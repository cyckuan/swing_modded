	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Not even the president of Nicaragua could help El
Presidente.
	   Atlanta's Dennis Martinez, trying to surpass Juan Marichal as
the winningest Latin American pitcher in U.S. major league history,
was knocked out in the fifth inning by the Boston Red Sox on
Tuesday night.
	   Martinez, who is tied with Marichal at 243 victories, left the
game after giving up back-to-back singles leading off the fifth.
The Red Sox built a 7-1 lead in the inning and went on to win 9-3.

	   In New York, Hideo Nomo pitched five inconclusive innings in his
debut with the Mets, who lost when Tampa Bay scored an unearned run
in the 11th.
	   Nomo's night was long over when John Hudek (0-3) walked the
first two in the 11th before retiring Bobby Smith on a foul bunt
with two strikes. After second baseman Luis Lopez's error loaded
the bases, Quinton McCracken hit a sacrifice fly to right

Sumitomo Bank to support major South Korean banks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sumitomo Bank Ltd. said Wednesday it will support
five major South Korean commercial banks by guaranteeing letters of
credit up to dlrs 100 million.
	   The move by the major Japanese bank will be jointly taken with
the International Finance Corp., an affiliate of the
Washington-based World Bank, said Sumitomo spokeswoman Makiko
Tanaka.
	   Sumitomo said in a release that it has re-guaranteed letters of
credit issued by the banks to help smooth foreign trade in South
Korea, which is facing renewed financial and labor troubles.
	   There are now numerous cases of foreign banks and exporters who
have become reluctant to accept letters of credit from South Korean
banks amid the country's uncertain economic prospects.
	   Under a new plan, Sumitomo said it will guarantee up to 60
percent of the letters of credit to be issued by the South Korean
banks, with the remaining 40 percent guaranteed by the
International Finance Corp.
	   Takana said the new credit support measures will be signed with
each of the five South Korean banks, including Kookmin Bank,
Shinhan Bank and Korea Long Term Credit Bank, on June 23 in South
Korea.
	   South Korea is struggling to rehabilitate its economy after
accepting an International Monetary Fund bailout in December.
	   But the country faces difficulty in drawing foreign investment
and imports because of the increasing amount of bad debt held by
its financial institutions and intensifying labor disputes.

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ About 60 people attending an
evangelical gathering used machetes to kill three men they believed
were planning to rob them and rape women, authorities said Tuesday.
A fourth man escaped.
	   Police said the four men disrupted the gathering Saturday night
in Calderas, a poor farming village of 300 people, about 120 miles
(200 kilometers) north of Tegucigalpa, the capital. The men fired
shots in the air and wounded the pastor's brother in the abdomen.
	   The men tried to flee after they ran out of ammunition, but the
crowd caught up with them and killed them with machete blows,
police said. The men were identified as Francisco Contreras, 26,
Benito Cruz, 24, and his brother Selvin, 28.
	   Police are looking for the fourth man, who was believed to have
escaped unharmed.
	   None of the evangelicals were arrested. Police say the
investigation is continuing.

Singapore dollar, stock market tumble
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Falling through important psychological levels
for the second time in a week, the Singapore dollar and stock
market both weakened Wednesday as concerns mounted over regional
currencies and the local economy.
	   The stock market's benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index, or
STII, plunged 2.7 percent in morning trading to easily breach the
key support level of 1100. It fell to 1087.35 in late morning
trading, about 30 points off its opening.
	   The Singapore dollar wasn't spared either, breaking up through
the 1.72 level against the greenback for the first time since early
February. In morning trading, the U.S. dollar was quoted at a
four-month high of 1.7215 Singapore dollars, up from 1.7075 late on
Tuesday.
	   The falls come after a series of precipitous drops over the past
week. The market index closed below the 1200 last Thursday, while
the Singapore dollar dropped through the important 1.70 level on
Monday.
	   Current levels are fast approaching lows plumbed during the
height of the financial crisis earlier this year in January, when
the STII dropped to 1073.47 and the Singapore dollar weakened below
1.80 to the greenback.
	   There was increasing speculation by market players over whether
China will devalue its yuan and Hong Kong will abandon its fixed
currency peg against the U.S. dollar, according to a dealer at a
foreign brokerage in Singapore.
	   Uncertainty over the direction of the Japanese yen, and growing
indications of significant economic slowdown or even recession in
Singapore's economy also continue to dampen sentiment.
	   Equity markets were down across the region.
	   A dealer said attention was focused on Hong Kong, where the
benchmark Hang Seng index has dived 253.85 points to 8137.61 in
early Wednesday trading.
	   He said foreign sellers were dropping Singapore's index-linked
stocks to get out of the market.

Thai stock market drops below 300 for first time in 11 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's benchmark stock index
dropped below 300 points for the first time in 11 years as worries
grew over the health of Thai financial institutions.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index dropped to a low of 299.89
points in morning trading, although it quickly rebounded back over
the 300-point mark. Around 11:15 a.m. (0415 GMT), the index was at
300.37 points, down 7.88 points.
	   Dealers attributed the decline to worries over the fate of Thai
financial institutions. Although the Thai central bank has
announced new rules to encourage institutions to restructure
problem loans, few have begun to do so, analysts said.
	   Meanwhile, problem loans are mounting. Standard and Poor's
Corp., a U.S.-based credit rating agency, said last month it
predicted non-performing loans at Thai institutions would peak at
35 percent of total loans in 1999.

Cyclone storms across southern port city in Pakistan

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Rains battered Pakistan's southern port
city of Karachi, killing 12 people, as a cyclone plowed through the
area and into neighboring India, the state-run news agency said
Wednesday.
	   High winds and heavy rains lashed the city of 14 million people
throughout Tuesday, but most of the deaths, according to the
Associated Press of Pakistan, were the result of electrocution.
High winds toppled power lines, leaving live wires strewn across
several busy streets, the news agency said.
	   Several dwellings in Karachi's poorer neighborhoods also
collapsed, but police officials said there were only minor
injuries.

Protesting East Timorese reject offer by Indonesian president
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Rejecting a presidential promise of
special status for their homeland within Indonesia, thousands of
East Timorese protested Wednesday, demanding the right to vote for
full independence.
	   More than 3,000 students and others gathered on the grounds of
the state-funded University of East Timor.
	   ``We want total independence. We want to be free,'' said one
protester Licinio Branco at the noisy but peaceful rally.
	   Organizers said Indonesia should allow a full and free
referendum on the future of East Timor.
	   They said the protest was the biggest since euphoric
celebrations were held to mark the awarding of the 1996 Nobel peace
prize to their Roman Catholic spiritual leader Bishop Carlos Belo.
	   Belo earlier asked the protesters to abandon plans to march
through the streets of Dili, fearing that it would only lead to a
violent confrontation with the Indonesian military.
	   In 1991 dozens were killed when troops opened fire on a protest
march.
	   On Wednesday demonstrators stayed safely on the university's
campus. They raised their fists in the air and sang rebel songs.
	   Some wore headbands with the word ``independence'' written on
them. Others briefly held up outlawed rebel flags. Some stood on
the roof of campus buildings and chanted anti-Indonesian slogans.
	   Indonesian troops invaded East Timor, a former Portuguese colony
in 1975, and annexed it the following year.
	   Since then the half-island territory has endured human rights
abuses while a guerrilla war rages between Indonesian forces and
separatist rebels.
	   On Tuesday in Jakarta, President B.J. Habibie signaled a
possible easing of Indonesia's tight control, saying he's ready to
grant special status to East Timor in exchange for peace in the
disputed territory.
	   In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., Habibie
also said he had signed a decree to release 10 East Timor rebels
jailed by Indonesia.
	   The new Indonesian leader emphasized, however, that special
status did not mean political autonomy, and that imprisoned East
Timorese rebel leader Xanana Gusmao would remain behind bars.
	   Indonesia regards Gusmao as a criminal, saying he has committed
violent acts in his fight against Indonesia. He is serving a
20-year prison term in Jakarta's Cipinang Prison.
	   Habibie replaced longtime autocrat Suharto as president last
month. Suharto, who ordered the 1975 invasion, steadfastly refused
to make any concessions toward East Timor.
	   And although the granting of special status for the territory
would be largely a symbolic gesture, Habibie's offer is being
regarded as a significant shift in policy.
	   Even so, protesters on Wednesday said it was not enough.
	   As well as a referendum, many at the Dili rally said they wanted
the immediate release of Gusmao.
	   Despite the size of the crowd, no uniformed military personnel
were seen, although organizers said that plainclothes intelligence
officers were mingling with the protesters.
	   Many said they felt freer to express their demands since Suharto
quit after 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   Habibie has promised sweeping political reform, raising hopes
that a more democratic Indonesia will emerge.
	   ``This is the best opportunity we have had in years and we have
got to take advantage of it,'' said demonstrator Norberto
Gonsalves.

U.S. seeks Russian endorsement of strong measures against Serbia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reported language of proposed resolution, Russian
objection to proposal in grafs 2,3. &QL; 
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton is prepared to
talk to Russian President Boris Yeltsin himself, if necessary, to
get Moscow's support for tougher measures to stop the violent Serb
crackdown in Kosovo, senior U.S. officials say.
	   The Americans and Britons plan to ask the Security Council,
possibly next week, to authorize ``all necessary means'' to halt
Serb attacks on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, diplomatic sources said
Tuesday.
	   But the sources said Russian diplomats, in preliminary talks
this week, said they object to the proposal because it fails to
take into account Albanian separatist attacks against Serb police.
	   Both the diplomatic sources and the U.S. officials spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   In Bonn, Germany, Yeltsin pledged Tuesday to use his influence
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to end police and army
attacks in Kosovo, but remained firmly opposed to any Western
military intervention.
	   Yeltsin said he would try to meet Milosevic in person, and made
clear he prefers friendly diplomacy over any military threats or
economic sanctions to resolve the conflict that has killed at least
250 people this year.
	   ``The more softly I speak the better the chances of a meeting,''
Yeltsin said at a news conference following two days of talks with
German officials. ``We will meet and discuss the question of how to
get out of this situation without getting into a big war.''
	   The Russian president said any military deployment in Kosovo
would be ``very dangerous'' and could spark a wider Balkan
conflict.
	   NATO defense ministers, who meet in Brussels on Thursday and
Friday, are expected to order NATO military commanders to draw up
plans for possible direct military intervention in Kosovo.
	   Such proposals could include a ``no-fly'' zone similar to one
imposed on Bosnia during the war there, or expanding the 750-member
U.N. peacekeeping force in nearby Macedonia. Nearly half that force
is American.
	   The Russians _ allies of the Serbs _ oppose NATO troops in the
area but have indicated they might support a more robust U.N. role.
That would require approval by the 15-member Security Council,
where the Russians have a permanent seat and veto power.
	   Diplomats said the Britons and the Americans are waiting to see
what NATO foreign ministers decide before circulating any draft
resolution.
	   In the past, however, strong council action on Kosovo and other
issues, notably Iraq, has been blocked by Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov.
	   To get Moscow's backing on Kosovo, the United States is trying
to show flexibility on other issues, including Iraq, in which
Moscow and Washington differ. The Americans have indicated they may
accept a scaling-back of U.N. inspections of Iraqi nuclear
facilities in the coming months.

Philippine Airlines starts hiring replacement pilots
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Financially beleaguered Philippine
Airlines said Wednesday it has begun the process of hiring
replacements for about 600 striking pilots who have repeatedly
defied government back-to-work orders.
	   The pilots' union has refused the labor department's attempts to
formally deliver the back-to-work orders and continued its walkout
despite appeals from President Fidel Ramos.
	   An airline spokesman said job applications from local and
foreign pilots are being processed, but declined to say how many
have applied.
	   Labor Secretary Cresenciano Trajano said he would summon union
and airline officials to another meeting Wednesday to try to end
the dispute, but indicated he was losing patience.
	   ``The union can't just openly defy our orders,'' Trajano said.
	   The pilots began the strike Friday to protest a management
policy of ordering pilots to retire who have reached 20 years of
service or flown 20,000 hours, regardless of age. The policy puts
about 200 pilots in danger of forced retirement, the union said.
	   PAL, however, said it was not a unilateral management policy but
a provision in a collective bargaining agreement signed by airline
and union officials.
	   The airline earlier announced plans to reduce staff, slash costs
and cut flights to survive a financial crisis.
	   PAL says the strike is causing daily losses of 150 million to
200 million pesos (dlrs 3.8 million to 5.1 million) in lost
revenue, pushing it ``closer to the brink of insolvency.'' It said
it lost 8 billion pesos (dlrs 205 million) in the last fiscal year
_ three times more than the previous year.
	   PAL president Jose Antonio Garcia said the strike caused several
potential foreign buyers of the airline, including Northwest
Airlines, to break off talks and could force the airline to shut
down.
	   ``Closing PAL is an option. If there are no pilots and
operations, what work can we do?'' Garcia said after attending an
emergency meeting of PAL's board of directors Tuesday.
	   Trajano said the strikers defied a deadline for reporting back
to work of 6 p.m. Tuesday. The 620-strong Airline Pilots
Association of the Philippines said the order should be formally
delivered to its lawyer but refused to say where she was.
	   The union demanded that PAL also pledge in writing to stop
unilaterally retiring pilots, but the airline has refused.
	   PAL said it could only fly 16 out of 80 domestic and
international flights scheduled Wednesday.
	   The strike has affected thousands of passengers and is
threatening to prevent many Filipino and foreign guests from
visiting the country to celebrate the June 12 centennial of the
declaration of Philippine independence from more than 300 years of
Spanish colonial rule.
	   President Ramos has urged both sides to follow the labor
department's order and resume negotiations.
	   PAL has tried to recover from its spiraling losses with an
ambitious dlrs 4 billion modernization program, ordering 36 new
aircraft.
	   But Asia's currency crisis sharply reduced passenger numbers and
bloated the airline's debt in local currency terms, forcing it to
delay many of the orders.
	   PAL, Asia's first airline, is controlled by Chinese Filipino
tycoon Lucio Tan. It had been completely owned by the Philippine
government until it was partly sold in 1992.

	   DETROIT (AP) _ Tomas Holmstrom set up goals by Joe Kocur and
Nicklas Lidstrom in the first period to lead the Red Wings to a 2-1
victory over the Washington Capitals in the opening game of the
Stanley Cup finals on Tuesday night.
	   The Capitals, playing in the first final in their 24-year
history, came into the series as a heavy underdog, with most
prognosticators expecting the best-of-7 series to end in four or
five games.
	   For two periods, the game went as everyone expected. Detroit
dominated and Washington barely mounted a challenge.
	   A goal late in the second period by Richard Zednik got
Washington back in the game and Red Wings goaltender Chris Osgood
had to make at least six good saves in the final period to keep
Detroit ahead.
	   Game 2 also will be in Detroit on Thursday before the series
shifts to Washington for games on Saturday and Tuesday.
	   Osgood had 16 saves as the Red Wings handed Washington only its
second loss in nine playoff games on the road.
	   Olaf Kolzig, who carried Washington through the first three
rounds by stopping 546 of 577 shots, had 29 saves. He was
defenseless on both goals, beaten on a deflection on the first and
through a screen on the second.
	   The Red Wings dominated most of the first two periods. They
outshot the Capitals 19-10, held them without a shot for more than
a 15-minute span bridging the first and second periods and only
allowed one shot on three Washington power plays.
	   However, a great play by Andrei Nikolishin late in the second
period set up a late goal by Zednik, his seventh of the playoffs,
that got Washington back in the game.

Report: Ruling party committee wants to revalue Japanese yen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's ruling party will put together a draft bill
by the end of September to revalue the Japanese currency, a news
report said Wednesday.
	   The Liberal Democratic Party's subcommittee on denomination
wants to revalue the yen at roughly one yen to the U.S. dollar,
Kyodo News service reported.
	   The dollar currently buys about 140 yen.
	   The goal of the proposed revaluation would be to make the yen
more competitive as an international currency with the dollar and
Europe's newly created Euro, Kyodo said.
	   Most of the lawmakers on the committee support the move, Kyodo
said.
	   Party officials weren't immediately available to comment on the
report.
	   It remains uncertain, however, if the idea would ever make it to
a vote in Parliament. Lawmakers have floated such proposals in the
past, only to see them shot down by the powerful Finance Ministry,
which has called a new yen unnecessary and disruptive.

Police fire at Haitian refugee sloop; 30 believed drowned
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs, adding background. &QL; 
 &UR; By RAYMOND HAINEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) _ Authorities in the Turks and Caicos
Islands, who fired warning shots Monday at a crowded Haitian sloop,
were trying Wednesday to figure out whether their bullets or
panicky refugees capsized the boat. At least 30 refugees were
feared drowned.
	   Police questioned some of the 70 survivors Wednesday. John
Kelly, deputy governor of the British island chain 600 miles (950
kilometers) southeast of Florida, said Tuesday that he has asked
Bermuda to send Creole-speaking police to help with the interviews.
	   The bodies of six drowned Haitians were recovered Monday.
Rescuers searched without success Tuesday for 24 missing people,
Kelly said.
	   Bermudan police, he said, also would investigate unconfirmed
reports that police warning shots hit the sloop. Investigators were
expected to raise the sunken vessel to examine it for bullet holes.
	   He added, however, ``There is no evidence that the police
officers' shots hit the boat, and the six dead did not suffer
bullet wounds.''
	   Bermudan Premier Pamela Gordon said one scenario she heard
indicated the Haitians, who were crowded below deck, panicked when
they heard gunfire and rushed up to one side of the sloop, causing
it to capsize.
	   The Turks and Caicos, located between Cuba and the Bahamas, is a
popular tourist destination for snorkelers and deep-sea divers as
well as impoverished Haitians searching for work.
	   Firing warning shots, Kelly said, is a routine way for
authorities fighting illegal immigration to stop boats that do not
obey verbal orders to stop.
	   ``What the police try and do is to get aboard a boat and try and
see if it's carrying illegal migrants. If it is, it's escorted into
port and the illegals are flown back to Haiti,'' Kelly said.
	   It's not known how many Haitians flee their impoverished island
and make the journey north to Providenciales, the most populated of
the Turks and Caicos islands, which have about 15,000 citizens.
	   In 1996, the local government estimated Providenciales had 7,000
legal residents, including 1,000 Haitians, as well as 6,000 illegal
Haitians.
	   Resentment has grown among non-Haitian residents, who complain
that too much money has been diverted to support the Haitian
population.

Labor union boss re-elected in landslide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The leader of Israel's giant Histadrut
labor federation was re-elected in a landslide victory, the
federation announced Wednesday.
	   Amir Peretz was elected for a second term with over 70 percent
of the vote, while his rival Maxim Levy received only 22 percent.
	   Peretz has led over 600,000 Histradrut members in several
massive strikes over the past two years, mostly to protest the
government's proposal to roll back a pension agreement and its
plans to privatize state-owned corporations.
	   One of the peculiarities of the Israeli trade union movement is
that candidates for office run on a party ticket. Traditionally the
Histadrut was a stronghold of the Labor and left-wing parties, with
the right wing Likud in the opposition.
	   However Tuesday's election cut across traditional party lines.
Peretz, who is from the Labor party, was allied with the Likud.
	   Levy belongs to the Gesher party, which broke away from the
Likud some years ago, and he was allied with the left-wing Meretz
group.
	   Observers said Wednesday this realignment is a sign that the
party system is on the way out and candidates will in future be
elected on a personal basis, as in most other western countries.

Japan's Parliament extends session to vote on economic stimulus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with extension passed, edits to conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Parliament voted Wednesday to extend its
current session by eight days to complete passage of a 16.6
trillion yen (dlrs 119 billion) economic stimulus package, an
official said.
	   The extension will keep Japan's Parliament, which was scheduled
to recess on Wednesday, in session until June 18, a lower house
spokesman said.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party wanted the extra time to
finish cobbling together the largest economic stimulus package in
Japanese history, which is aimed at reviving an economy on the
brink of recession.
	   Opposition party members are expected to counter by seeking a
vote of no-confidence against Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto for
his handling of the economy, Japanese media said. Such a measure is
unlikely to pass.
	   The extension means that upper house elections scheduled for
this summer will likely take place between July 8 and 18, Kyodo
News reported.
	   The extension comes one day after Parliament passed a bill to
streamline the nation's bureaucracy.
	   The new law will trim the number of agencies and ministries to
13 from 22 within five years. It will cut the number of public
employees by about 10 percent and strengthen the prime minister's
control over policy making.
	   The new law was a key policy objective of Hashimoto, who has
promised to cut costs and rein in Japan's powerful ministries.

Aussie dollar continues falling towards 58 U.S. cents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The Australian and New Zealand dollars
both continued their free fall Wednesday, heading toward new
12-year lows.
	   In early afternoon trading the Aussie dollar hit a near 12-year
low of 58.30 U.S. cents. Dealers said the Australian dollar
appeared to be heading towards its intraday low of 57.10 U.S.
cents, seen in July 1986.
	   ``We're in uncharted waters,'' Scott Lewis, a foreign exchange
trader with IBJ Australia said. ``The only turnaround will be
profit taking on short positions from these big hedge funds but
there's no reason to suggest that's now.''
	   The Australian currency was also significantly lower against the
Japanese yen, down 1.5 yen from Tuesday's close. It was trading at
82.23-32 yen from 84.01-11.
	   In December 1996, the Australian dollar bought 82 U.S. cents. It
has fallen 28 percent since then.
	   Meanwhile, the New Zealand dollar fell to near 12-year lows
against the U.S. dollar, diving below 50 U.S. cents.
	   In morning trading the New Zealand dollar had fallen to 49.90
U.S. cents, its lowest level since October 1986. By early afternoon
it had climbed back through the 0.50 U.S. cent mark.
	   Currency dealers said they expected the Kiwi dollar, which has
fallen 4.9 percent in the last two weeks, to remain weak,
particularly as the Australian dollar was again under pressure.
	   The recent fall in the Kiwi dollar has also sparked a debate
about economics and the need to increase savings to combat New
Zealand's large current account deficit.
	   The deficit has been seen as one reason for the decline in the
kiwi dollar. Other reasons are a strong rise in the U.S. dollar as
the Asian financial crisis unfolded and the fact the Kiwi dollar
had been previously overvalued.

Hong Kong shares plunge on weak yen, high local interest rates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Rattled by the precipitous fall of the Japanese
yen, Hong Kong stocks dropped sharply Wednesday morning, with the
key index tumbling more than 4 percent.
	   Investors fear that the weak yen will force China to devalue its
currency to support exports and foreign investment inflows, leaving
the Hong Kong dollar's firm peg to the U.S. dollar in a precarious
position.
	   The yen's weakness also pushed local interest rates higher
Wednesday, sparking fears that there may be some speculative attack
on the Hong Kong currency, analysts said.
	   ``The yen is showing no signs of getting stronger, which is
putting further pressure on Hong Kong markets,'' said Vincent
Cheung, a trader at Sassoon Securities.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
tumbled 4.2 percent, or 355.29 points, to 8,036.17 at the midday
close, dangerously close to the intraday low for the year of 7,909
points.
	   The volatile benchmark overnight Hong Kong Interbank Offered
Rate is quoted at 6.125 percent, up from 6.00 percent late Tuesday.
The three-month rate is at 9.25 percent, up from 8.5 percent late
Tuesday.
	   Banking system liquidity has tightened steadily as money has
flowed out of Hong Kong markets, and with markets here weak,
commercial banks have been unwilling long-term lenders.
	   The high interest rates are making it harder for companies to
borrow and eating into their profits.
	   Meanwhile, a senior government official said Wednesday that it
is ``not particularly hopeful interest rates will come down anytime
soon'' as Hong Kong's financial markets continue to be battered by
external factors.
	   Speaking at a conference on Asia's financial turmoil, Secretary
for Financial Services Rafael Hui said there are no short-term
solutions to revive Hong Kong's shrinking economy, such as spending
its way out of the macroeconomic difficulty.
	   Hui reiterated his support for the Hong Kong dollar peg, noting
that in the current environment, ``more so than ever, it makes even
less sense to abandon the system.''

Myanmar to buy crude oil from Malaysia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Myanmar is buying crude oil worth
dlrs 80 million from Malaysia and an agreement on payment terms is
expected Wednesday, Malaysia's national news agency reported.
	   The Malaysian national oil company Petronas will supply the
crude, Myanmar's visiting Minister of Commerce Maj. Gen. Kyaw Than
said. Officials of both countries were discussing the payment
mechanism, he said.
	   ``We have completed discussions except for the payment terms and
mechanism'' to buy four million barrels of crude, Bernama news
agency quoted him as saying Tuesday. Wednesday's agreement will be
signed with Petronas.
	   Malaysia and Myanmar on Tuesday signed an agreement to expand
trade and enhance economic and industrial cooperation.
	   The governments had agreed to assist private enterprises boost
trade between the two nations, said Malaysia's international trade
and industry minister, Rafidah Aziz.
	   The sale of crude is expected help Myanmar meet a gasoline

Australia fears Indonesian economy worsening
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australian foreign affairs officials
fear that Indonesia's economy is deteriorating, saying Wednesday
that they expect a fifth of all Indonesian workers to be unemployed
by year's end.
	   Two days before the Indonesian crisis forced the resignation of
President Suharto, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer warned that a
handover of power to Vice President B.J Habibie would achieve
little.
	   The minister representing Downer in the Senate, Robert Hill,
said Wednesday that Downer was merely warning that Indonesia needed
to do more than change leaders, and was not casting aspersions on
Habibie.
	   ``Indonesia needed more than a simple substitution, and more
than a simple substitution has occurred,'' Hill told the committee.
	   Nick Warner, head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and
Trade's South Asia and Southeast Asia section, denied relations
with Indonesia had suffered as a result of the change of leader.
	   ``Since Dr. Habibie took over the presidency we have developed a
very good, close, sensible working relationship with him and with
his government,'' Warner said. ``I think he thinks well and
positively of Australia.''
	   However, Warner gave a very bleak assessment of the outlook for
the Indonesian economy.
	   ``All the macro-economic indicators for Indonesia are of course
looking pretty bad and much worse now than they were say three,
four or five months ago,'' Warner said.
	   ``We're looking at a contraction in the economy perhaps of the
order of 10 percent, or maybe more, unemployment perhaps rising to
over 20 percent by the end of the year.''

	   In Phoenix, Cecil Fielder hit a grand slam and had six RBIs and
Darin Erstad went 5-for-5 and drove in the go-ahead run as Anaheim

while walking none and striking out six.
	   The Dodgers, who have won five of their last seven games, scored
three unearned runs with two outs in the first off Jimmy Haynes
(4-3) thanks to a passed ball and throwing error by Oakland catcher
Mike Macfarlane.
 &UR; Padres 5, Reds 1 &QC; 
	   In San Diego, Greg Vaughn hit a grand slam and Andy Ashby came
within two outs of his fourth straight complete game as the Padres
beat the Cincinnati Reds 5-1 Tuesday night.
	   Ashby (8-4) gave up eight hits, tied his career high with 11
strikeouts and didn't walk a batter before leaving with two men on
in the ninth. Trevor Hoffman struck out the last two batters for
his 18th save this season and 26th in a row overall.
	   Vaughn hit his 22nd homer of the season and fourth career grand
slam with two out in the seventh off Brett Tomko (5-5).

Russia to continue cuts in trade missions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will continue a program of reducing the
size of its trade missions around the world with further cuts in
Africa, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Tuesday.
	   The trade missions in South Africa, Mozambique and Nigeria will
be cut back and become departments of the Russian embassies in each
of those nations, the agency quoted government sources as saying.
	   Trade missions to some 40 nations have already been reduced as
part of the government's efforts to cut spending because of its
poor finances, the report said. In the past, Russian trade missions
were often separate entities with their own support staff and
facilities.

More bad news for Japan _ GDP stats may confirm recession fears
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The official announcement hasn't been made yet, and
optimists are still holding out hope. But for the first time in
more than two decades, Japan's economy may be looking at its first
year of negative growth.
	   The verdict is to come Friday, when the Economic Planning Agency
will release Japan's quarterly gross domestic product figures for
January-March 1998.
	   The figures, covering the final quarter of Japan's 1997 fiscal
year, are widely expected to confirm fears that growth shrank for
two consecutive quarters, the standard definition for an economy in
full-blown recession.
	   If they do, it will be Japan's third dip into recession this
decade and will mean the first year of overall contraction of the
economy since fiscal 1974.
	   ``It has to be pretty embarrassing because Japan had such a
great reputation in the 1980s, but has pretty much lost it,'' said
Peter Morgan, chief economist at HSBC Securities Japan Ltd.
	   Morgan said he expects a 0.1 percent decline in the
January-March quarter-on-quarter GDP.
	   In March, the Economic Planning Agency said Japan's GDP for the
October-December quarter of 1997 fell 0.2 percent.
	   That's a far cry from Japan's boom years in the 1980s, when
Americans saw Tokyo as an economic superpower able to snatch up
landmark buildings such as Rockefeller Center in a single bound.
Japanese business practices became vogue. America was playing
catch-up.
	   No more.
	   Japan's jobless rolls have jumped to a postwar high of 4.1
percent, Japanese corporate earnings have hit the skids and the
Tokyo stock market trades at less than half its peak value in 1989.
	   Even the mighty yen has taken a spill, falling to a seven-year
low of 140 yen to the dollar this week. Now, the infamous dlrs 10
cup of premium coffee in Tokyo's finer hotels can be bought for a
mere dlrs 6.
	   Some economists hold out the possibility of an improvement in
the figures to be released Friday.
	   But even they admit that narrowly averting the official criteria
for a recession won't solve Japan's economic woes.
	   ``Even if we do get a recovery, it will be a jobless recovery,''
said Yasushi Okada, an economist in the Tokyo office of Credit
Suisse First Boston.
	   Okada, who believes the GDP may have bounced back as much as 0.2
percent in the first quarter of the year, said he expects Japan's
unemployment rate to rise as high as 5 percent by next year.
	   The reasons for Japan's sluggishness are many and complex.
	   Rigid corporate business practices such as lifetime employment
and dependence on parent banks for capital, for example, have
hampered innovation, hurt efficiency and slowed restructuring
efforts.
	   Management philosophies aside, analysts point to a clear policy
blunder as having sowed the seeds for the current macroeconomic
slowdown.
	   They blame Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and the
budget-conscious Finance Ministry for teaming up to pass a tax
increase that took effect April 1 last year.
	   Raising Japan's national sales tax to 5 percent from 3 percent
had a chilling effect on consumer spending, which accounts for
about two-thirds of the country's GDP.
	   Penny-pinching Japanese consumers became even more skittish amid
a string of high-profile bankruptcies of financial institutions in
recent months.
	   Japan's banking system, meanwhile, is awash in bad loans from
the collapse of a real estate price bubble in the late 1980s. And
much of Asia is embroiled in a financial crisis that has crimped
demand for Japanese exports and soured many of Japan's investments
in the region.
	   Some say the worst may be over, however.
	   Ron Bevacqua, an economist at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc., said
that barring another external shock like the Asian crisis or a rash
of new bank failures, consumer spending in Japan should begin to
pick up this summer.
	   The economy will also get a big boost from a 16.7 trillion yen
(dlrs 119 billion) public works-heavy spending package which was
approved by Japan's Cabinet in April, Bevacqua said.
	   Parliament is expected to pass the package later this month.
	   Others, such as HSBC's Morgan, worry that without fresh
government stimulus initiatives such as a sizable permanent income
tax cut, growth could well remain sluggish _ or go negative.
	   Japan's trade minister, Mitsuo Horiuchi, echoed these sentiments
Wednesday when he called for ``one more push'' to put the economy
back on track for recovery.
	   Economic Planning Agency head Koji Omi has studiously avoided
mentioning the word recession, taking pains to highlight the few
bright spots in the economy.
	   He may skirt around the ``r-word'' when the latest statistics
come out on Friday as well.
	   Two consecutive quarters, or six straight months, of negative
growth is almost universally accepted as the threshold for
recession. But Japan reserves formal judgment on this for a panel
of experts assembled by the Economic Planning Agency.
	   Few private economists pay that much heed.
	   ``The authorities in general tend to be quite behind, especially
in denoting the direction of the economy,'' said economist
Bevacqua.

Head of Japanese state-run oil company to resign for bad loans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The president of a Japanese state-run firm that
finances oil exploration will resign after the company disclosed
massive unrecoverable loans, media reported Wednesday.
	   Kunio Komatsu offered Tuesday to step down as head of the Japan
National Oil Corp. to take responsibility for the losses, which
total more than 1.4 trillion yen (dlrs 10 billion), or more than
the company's annual revenues, the reports said.
	   Calls to Japan National Oil to confirm the reports went
unanswered.
	   The Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which oversees
Japan National Oil, will appoint new executives to restructure the
company, according to the reports.
	   Japan National Oil is the latest in a series of bad loan
debacles that have called into question the stewardship of the
nation's once vaunted bureaucrats over Japan's financial system.
	   With the taxpayers sure to foot the cleanup, calls will likely
intensify for Japan to privatize such state-run finance companies.
	   Japan National Oil was started in 1967 to promote domestic oil
exploration by providing inexpensive capital to private companies.
The government shouldered the risk by not obligating the companies
to repay the loans if no oil was found.
	   Some of the unrecoverable loans also went into copper
exploration. None of the funded projects succeeded.

Report: Cashier siphons off bank's money, flees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A cashier diverted 12.5 million
ringgit (dlrs 3 million) secretly to his own account over two weeks
and fled overseas with part of the loot, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   The employee of Bank Bumiputra Malaysia's branch in the southern
city of Johor disappeared, either to Hong Kong or mainland China,
with 5 million ringgit (dlrs 1.3 million), the New Straits Times
said.
	   The bank discovered the theft when it ordered an audit after the
cashier failed to return from a vacation. He had stashed away the
money in April in a secret fixed deposit account before leaving.
	   While the local police have sought help from Interpol to trace
the 43-year-old cashier, the bank has suspended two managers of the
Johor branch pending the results of an internal inquiry, the daily
said.

Report: Ruling party may hear complaints of nepotism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Leaders of Malaysia's ruling party
are likely to hear about cases of alleged nepotism in handing out
contracts for huge government projects, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   Data on instances of nepotism has been collected and will be
presented at next week's United Malays National Organization
general assembly, Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, the party's youth wing chief,
was quoted as saying by Star daily.
	   A state government minister had challenged Zahid to release
details of the alleged nepotism, the daily said.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has said that party officials
were free to raise issues of corruption and nepotism at the June
19-21 meeting.
	   The general assembly is expected to focus on the national
economic crisis, Mahathir told reporters on Tuesday.
	   ``I'm quite sure they (the delegates) are going to talk about
the economic problems because some of them are affected by the
economic downturn,'' Mahathir said.
	   He rejected the opposition's call for talks with the government
on the current economic problems. ``We don't want to politicize
this,'' Mahathir said.

Lee and Metcalfe make Scotland team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Scotland's rugby selectors have chosen
both fullbacks, Glenn Metcalfe and Derrick Lee in the starting side
for Saturday's first test against Australia.
	   Lee, who played at fullback in the 51-26 loss to Fiji at the
start of the tour, has moved to the wing with New Zealander
Metcalfe winning a call up at the back.
	   Scotland lost to an Australian Barbarians team Tuesday in the
final match before the first of two tests.
	   Coach Jim Telfer said he was happy with his team's form, while
Australia will be backing up after a record 76-0 win over England
on Saturday.
	   Australia named an unchanged lineup from the one which inflicted
England's worst-ever defeat and gave the Wallabies their biggest
ever victory.
	   Scotland:
	   Glenn Metcalfe, Derrick Lee, Cameron Murray, Rowen Shepherd,
Shaun Longstaff, Gregor Townsend, Bryan Redpath, Eric Peters,
Gordon Simpson, Robert Wainwright (captain), Stuart Grimes, Scott
Murray, Matthew Proudfoot, Gordon Bulloch, David Hilton. Reserves:
Craig Joiner, Duncan Hodge, Graeme Burns, Adam Roxburgh, Stewart
Campbell, Gordon McIlwham, Kevin McKenzie.

Army supervises rescue work after cyclone leaves 130 dead in India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Relief workers distributed food and
searched for bodies in the debris of smashed homes after a cyclone
tore through western India, killing 130 people and leaving hundreds
of thousands homeless, officials said Wednesday.
	   Some 2,500 soldiers were helping local authorities distribute
supplies in remote areas of Gujarat state after Tuesday's cyclone.
State officials said the death toll could increase as aid workers
reach remote villages.
	   Relief workers handed out supplies of wheat, potatoes and
kerosene to residents of Bhuj, Jamnagar and Porbunder districts,
450 kilometers (280 miles) northwest of Bombay, where the cyclone
first struck land.
	   ``Medical teams have been sent out to contain any epidemic that
might break out,'' said R.M. Joshi, a government official at the
state control center.
	   The cyclone, India's worst in 25 years, uprooted trees,
electricity poles and cut off road and telecommunication links.
	   Thousands of people spent the night in the streets after walls
and roofs of mud-and-thatch houses collapsed. Authorities had moved
20,000 people to safety before the cyclone struck.
	   Rainfall has been reported in some places following the cyclone,
which packed wind speeds of up to 100 kph (65 mph).

Indonesian airline workers protest against Suharto contracts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Staffing

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 500 employees from Indonesia's
state-owned flag carrier Garuda Indonesia, including pilots and
cabin crew, demonstrated outside the airline's headquarters
Wednesday.
	   They demanded it end contracts linked to the family of
ex-President Suharto and said they were worried that cash-strapped
Garuda was planning big layoffs.
	   As many as 2,000 ground staff from Jakarta's Sukarno Hatta
Airport are set to join the demonstrators during the day,
protesters said.
	   Flights were not expected to be disrupted, an airline spokesman
said.
	   The demonstrators said they wanted a review of contracts held by
PT Angkasa Buana Wisesa which handles cargo for Garuda. Angkasa
Buana is owned by Cardig Air, which is part of Suharto's middle son
Bambang Trihatmodjo's Bimantara Group.
	   The employees are also calling for the review of a ground
equipment contract granted to Gapura, a unit of Angkasa Buana.
	   The calls are the latest examples of a growing backlash against
companies perceived to have benefited from collusion, nepotism and
corruption during the Suharto years.
	   Suharto stepped down as president on May 21 following protests
and riots, ending 32-years of authoritarian rule.
	   Critics say he and his family amassed billions of dollars and
built huge empires by abusing their power and position.
	   Some have called for the state to seize Suharto's assets and use
them to help Indonesia overcome its worst economic crisis in
decades.
	   The government of new President B.J. Habibie is planning a broad
inquiry into corruption during the Suharto era and has already
ended or placed under review many state contracts with companies
linked to the Suharto clan.
	   The Garuda employees said they are also demonstrating against
unconfirmed claims that the airline is to cut 4,000 jobs at the
struggling state-owned airline.
	   Garuda, like Indonesia's other airlines, is crippled by huge
foreign debt that has been worsened by a huge drop in the value of
the rupiah against the dollar.
	   Most of Garuda's revenues are in rupiah while its debt is
predominately in dollars.
	   According to State Enterprises Minister Tanri Abeng, it needs to
be restructured ``immediately'' to avoid isolation from the
international air network.
	   Some 50 percent of the company's dlrs 200 million foreign debt
is past due and Tanri said earlier this week that the airline's
liquidity isn't enough to pay for operations.
	   He also said Garuda would invite either foreign or domestic
investors to take a stake in the company, noting that the
government wasn't in a position to inject capital.
	   A company spokesman said he didn't know of any plans to cut
4,000 jobs.
	   Last week, Indonesia's third largest airline, Sempati, stopped
operating after posting big losses.

Lee and Metcalfe make Scotland team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ New Zealanders Glenn Metcalfe and
Gordon Simpson will play their first tests for Scotland in
Saturday's opening match of a two-game series against Australia.
	   Metcalfe and Simpson qualify because of Scottish grandparents.
	   ``Both are very professional and have been brought up in a good
rugby culture,'' said Scotland coach Jim Telfer. ``They've brought
something positive to the game.''
	   Scotland's selectors have chosen both fullbacks, Metcalfe and
Derrick Lee, in the starting side. Lee, who played at fullback in
the 51-26 loss to Fiji at the start of the tour, has moved to the
wing.
	   There are five changes from the loss in Suva, but only one from
the side which scored an encouraging victory over a below-strength
New South Wales team last Saturday.
	   Lee replaces Craig Joiner from that team.
	   Scotland lost to an Australian Barbarians team Tuesday in the
final match before the first of two tests.
	   Coach Jim Telfer said he was happy with his team's form, while
Australia will be backing up after a record 76-0 win over England
on Saturday.
	   Australia named an unchanged lineup from the one which inflicted
England's worst-ever defeat and gave the Wallabies their
biggest-ever victory.
	   Lee scored two tries in Tuesday's match to force his way back
into contention after it appeared he had lost his place.
	   ``Lee's attacking flair against the Australian Barbarians
impressed us,'' Telfer said.
	   Simpson made certain of the openside flanker position with
excellent displays against New South Wales Country and New South
Wales.
	   Rowen Shepherd is another fullback having to play out of his
usual position. He will start at inside center after turning around
a career which appeared to be flagging as Lee and Metcalfe went
past him in the fullback rankings.
	   Scotland:
	   Glenn Metcalfe, Derrick Lee, Cameron Murray, Rowen Shepherd,
Shaun Longstaff, Gregor Townsend, Bryan Redpath, Eric Peters,
Gordon Simpson, Robert Wainwright (captain), Stuart Grimes, Scott
Murray, Matthew Proudfoot, Gordon Bulloch, David Hilton. Reserves:
Craig Joiner, Duncan Hodge, Graeme Burns, Adam Roxburgh, Stewart
Campbell, Gordon McIlwham, Kevin McKenzie.

Asian markets continue slide on weak yen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A weaker Japanese yen _ bad news for many Asian
economies _ pushed down regional stock prices and currencies
Wednesday, with share prices in Thailand plummeting to 11-year
lows.
	   Many investors were reluctant to bid up stocks and currencies
ahead of a meeting of finance officials from the Group of Seven
industrialized nations scheduled to open in Paris later Wednesday.
	   ``No one knows what will come out of the G-7 deputy's meeting
and people are nervous,'' said Yasuhisa Morikuni, assistant vice
president at Bank of America.
	   The unease stems from concern the yen could fall further against
the dollar if officials attending the G-7 meeting do not issue a
statement pledging to support the battered Japanese currency.
	   The yen fell to seven-year lows against the dollar this week,
making the price of Japanese exports cheaper in foreign markets.
Many investors worry that the drop in the yen will force Japan's
Asian neighbors to devalue their currencies to remain competitive.
	   The dollar rose against the yen in mid-afternoon Tokyo trading.
It bought 140.98 yen, up 0.62 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and
above its late New York level of 140.30 yen overnight.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar broke through key psychological
levels against the Singapore dollar, the Thai baht and the
Indonesian rupiah in early trading.
	   The Singapore dollar broke through the 1.72 level against the
greenback for the first time since early February. In morning
trading, the U.S. currency was quoted at a four-month high of
1.7215 Singapore dollars, up from 1.7075 late on Tuesday.
	   Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index breached a
key support level of 1,100 points. It was down 2.7 percent to close
at 1,091.76 points as of the midday close.
	   In Bangkok, the benchmark stock index dropped below 300 points
for the first time in 11 years. The baht fell through the key
support of 43.00 baht to the dollar level, as worries grew over the
health of Thai financial institutions.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index dropped to a low of 299.89
points in morning trading, although it quickly rebounded back over
the 300-point mark. In late morning, the index was at 300.37
points, down 7.88 points.
	   Dealers attributed the decline to worries over the fate of Thai
financial institutions. Although the Thai central bank has
announced new rules to encourage institutions to restructure
problem loans, few have begun to do so, analysts said.
	   In Jakarta, the rupiah fell through a key resistance level early
Wednesday falling to 12,000 to the dollar, a level not seen since
before former president Suharto resigned last month.
	   Domestic demand for dollars kept continued pressure on the
rupiah, driving it further south, dealers said.
	   In Hong Kong, the yen pushed up interest rates, which further
hurt market sentiment and sparked fears that there may be some
speculative attack on the Hong Kong currency, analyst said.
	   The key Hang Seng Index tumbled 4.2 percent, or 355.29 points,
to 8,036.17 at the midday close, near the intraday low for the year
of 7,909 points.
	   The volatile benchmark overnight Hong Kong Interbank Offered
Rate was quoted at 6.125 percent, up from 6.00 percent late
Tuesday. The three-month rate was at 9.25 percent, up from 8.5
percent late Tuesday.
	   ``The yen is showing no signs of getting stronger, which is
putting further pressure on Hong Kong markets,'' said Vincent
Cheung, a trader at Sassoon Securities.
	   A senior government official said Wednesday that it is ``not
particularly hopeful interest rates will come down anytime soon''
as Hong Kong's financial markets continue to be battered by
external factors.
	   But Secretary for Financial Services reiterated his support for
the Hong Kong dollar peg, noting that in the current environment,
``more so than ever, it makes even less sense to abandon the
system.''
	   In Tokyo, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 190.91 points,
or 1.23 percent, closing at 15,339.26.
	   Share prices in Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur also fell in morning
trading.

Israel says Palestinian killed while planting bomb near settlement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ A Palestinian was shot and killed
Tuesday night by Israeli troops who surprised him and another man
as they were planting two bombs outside a settlement in the Gaza
Strip, the army said Wednesday.
	   The army had said earlier that the two men were trying to cut
through the security fence surrounding the settlement, but in a
search of the area the soldiers found two explosive charges with
electric detonation devices. The bombs were probably intended to be
used against an army patrol which was due to pass, the army said.
	   The soldiers ordered the men to halt, but they ran off and the
troops opened fire, killing Mohammed Bardawilbal, a resident of
Khan Yunis. The other man got away.
	   Palestinian police commander Khaled Abu Oleh said a joint
Israeli-Palestinian investigation into the incident was underway.
	   ``We are following in detail what happened and we cannot give
full information until we finish our investigation,'' Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat told reporters Wednesday morning.
	   Most of the Gaza Strip is under Palestinian control, while
Israel retains control of the areas around Jewish settlements and
the borders of the strip with Israel and Egypt.

	   CHITTAGONG, Bangladesh (AP) _ Thousands of protesters from all
over Bangladesh were converging Wednesday on a southern town for an
anti-government rally.
	   The protesters _ most traveling by bus despite calling their
campaign the ``long march'' _ say a peace accord the government
signed last year with rebels from the Buddhist Chakma tribe gives
the Chakmas too much local power at the expense of Muslim settlers
from the north.
	   Opponents of the accord plan to hold a rally later Wednesday in
Khagrachari, a Chakma stronghold 400 kilometers (250 miles) south
of the capital, Dhaka. Chakma rebels, who have surrendered their
arms in exchange for local autonomy, had fought the government for
20 years. The violence left more than 20,000 people, mostly
Muslims, dead.
	   A stream of up to 50,000 protesters set off Tuesday from Dhaka
and had reached the halfway point of their journey by midmorning
Wednesday. The convoy, led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia,
was delayed nine hours on the outskirts of Dhaka on Tuesday by a
road block of abandoned trucks set up by supporters of Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina.
	   A second stream of what organizers said were 200,000 people set
off Wednesday from Chittagong, 95 kilometers (60 miles) north of
Khagrachari. Zia supporters from all over the country had gathered
at the two starting points Tuesday.
	   Pro- and anti-government protesters fought in Chittagong on
Tuesday, leaving 60 injured and scores of trucks and shops damaged,
police said.
	   Protesters from both sides also held marches in Khagrachari
overnight, but did not clash.
	   The protest is seen as a test of strength for Zia, who since
losing power two years ago has called almost daily strikes, which
often erupt into violence.
	   Business leaders condemned the latest protest, fearing further
economic losses as shops shut down and vehicles stayed off the
roads.

U.S. dollar rises, Tokyo stocks finish lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar and bond
prices &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen Wednesday in
Tokyo as traders awaited the outcome of a meeting of Group of Seven
finance officials later in the day. Tokyo stocks finished lower in
light trading.
	   In mid-afternoon trading, the dollar bought 140.98 yen, up 0.62
yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and above its late New York level of
140.30 yen overnight.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
fell 190.91 points, or 1.23 percent, closing at 15,339.26. On
Tuesday, the average rose 235.46 points, or 1.52 percent.
	   The dollar advanced on buying amid speculation that deputy
finance ministers of the G-7 industrialized nations will not issue
a statement in support of the yen after their meeting in Paris.
	   Japanese officials have recently warned of the yen's excessive
weakening against the dollar, suggesting possible yen-buying
intervention. Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga has hinted that the
G-7 officials might touch on the recent exchange market movement.
	   Traders said they will keep watching the G-7 meeting and
congressional testimony by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan, also later Wednesday.
	   The U.S. currency had gained value steadily against the yen in
recent weeks as investors shifted more and more funds out of
Japan's sagging markets and into the robust U.S. economy.
	   Concerns over Japan's economy drove the dollar to a new
seven-year high of 141.35 yen on Tuesday.
	   Such worries also weighed on domestic prices, offsetting
optimism the stronger dollar would boost the earnings of Japanese
exporters.
	   On the stock market, traders said continued weakness in bank
issues on selling from foreign investors dampened sentiment.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section shed 10.08 points, or 0.83 percent, to 1,198.60. The
TOPIX closed up 10.32 points, or 0.86 percent, the day before.
	   Analysts said foreign investors will likely keep selling their
Japanese holdings if the yen keeps weakening. That's because a
weaker yen erodes the dollar value of Japanese stocks.
	   ``The weak yen is good for exporters, but our concern is that it
will hurt the sentiment of foreign investors,'' said Tsuyoshi
Nomaguchi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities Co.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.200 percent from Tuesday's finish of
1.210 percent, driving its price higher to 112.02 yen from 111.96
yen.

 &UR; Eritreans attack Ethiopian border post in northwest &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Eritrean forces attacked Ethiopia's
biggest border post in northwest Tigray province early Wednesday,
the government said.
	   ``Today, June 10, at 6 a.m. (0300 GMT) Eritrean forces attacked
our biggest post on the Badme-Shiraro front at Erde Mattios, and
fighting is continuing,'' spokeswoman Salome Tadesse told
reporters.
	   She said there were no fuerther details.
	   Ethiopia says that Eritrea set off the current border conflict
on May 6 when it moved into Ethiopian territory at roughly the same
spot.
	   The Eritrean forces, according to the Ethiopians, would have
attacked the Ethiopian post from inside Ethiopia.

	   ADDIS ABABA: inside Ethiopia.
	   A languishing peace proposal put forth by the United States and
Rwanda includes a recommendation that Eritrea withdraw to positions
it held prior to May 6.
	   Ethiopia accepted the arrangement in principle, but Eritrea said
it needed working on.
	   Eritrea has denied it is occupying any Ethiopian territory
although its forces were also reported to be at least 10 kilometers
(six miles) inside what has been considered to be the international
boundary at Zala Ambessa in northeastern Ethiopia.
	   The spokeswoman said Eritreans had suffered heavy losses during
fightin Tuesday at Zala Ambessa, but she said she had no

	   BOCHUM, Germany (AP) _ Seven people were killed and five others
injured in an early morning house fire in the west German city of
Bochum Wednesday.
	   Police said the fire began in the top floor of the five-story,
turn-of-the-century building and quickly spread. Rescue efforts
were hampered by the danger the structure would collapse.
	   The five injured suffered light smoke inhalation. The fire's
cause was unknown, but arson was not suspected, police said.

Businessman killed in Siberian town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian businessman was killed on his way to
work Wednesday by an unidentified gunman in what appeared to be an
organized crime killing, according to news reports.
	   Yuri Zinin, the head of Sibneft Company was shot in the back as
he walked out of his apartment building in the town of
Leninsk-Kuzntesky in the Kemerovo region of central Siberia,
Russian news agencies quoted local police as saying.
	   Zinin's company has the same name as one of Russia's largest oil
producers, Sibneft, controlled by controversial business mogul
Boris Berezovsky. But the two companies are separate.
	   Zinin's Sibneft was locally-based and mostly involved in selling
oil products and coal. Kemerovo is one of Russia's main coal-mining
regions.
	   Police launched a search for the killer who fled. Officials
wouldn't comment on possible motives for the murder.
	   There are hundreds of contract murders in Russia every year as
mobsters fight for control of profitable businesses. Only a small
number of such killings are ever solved.
	   The small town of Leninsk-Kuznetsky became known nationwide last
year, when the city mayor was arrested on tax fraud and
embezzlement charges. Mayor Gennady Konyakhin, also accused of
being linked to the mob, is in custody awaiting trial.

Eritreans attack Ethiopian border post in northwest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Eritrean forces attacked Ethiopia's
biggest border post in northwest Tigray province early Wednesday,
the government said.
	   ``Eritrean forces attacked our biggest post on the Badme-Shiraro
front at Erde Mattios, and fighting is continuing,'' spokeswoman
Salome Tadesse said.
	   She said the attack started at 6 a.m. (0300 GMT) but said there
were no further details.
	   Ethiopia says that Eritrea set off the current border conflict
on May 6 when it moved into Ethiopian territory in that region.
	   The Ethiopians said Wednesday's attack came from Eritrean forces
inside Ethiopia.
	   A languishing peace proposal put forth by the United States and
Rwanda includes a recommendation that Eritrea withdraw to positions
it held prior to May 6.
	   Ethiopia accepted the arrangement in principle, but Eritrea said
it needed work.
	   Eritrea has denied it is occupying any Ethiopian territory
although its forces were also reported to be at least 10 kilometers
(six miles) inside what has been considered to be the international
boundary at Zala Ambessa in northeastern Ethiopia.
	   The spokeswoman said Eritreans had suffered heavy losses during
fighting Tuesday at Zala Ambessa, but she said she had no
information on Ethiopian casualties.

Government and rebels blame each other for stalled peace talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Peace talks between Cambodian
government troops and resistance forces broke off Wednesday with
both sides blaming each other for the deadlock.
	   Gen. Hun Phoeung, chief negotiator for resistance forces loyal
to deposed co-Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, said the
stalemate was caused by the government's refusal to formalize a
ceasefire agreement and guarantee amnesty for rebel commanders.
	   Ranariddh was deposed last July in a bloody coup d'etat led by
co-Prime Minister Hun Sen. Ranariddh has returned to Cambodia to
compete in elections scheduled for July.
	   Several hundred of his troops, however, have been holed up along
the border with Thailand for months fending off attacks by Hun
Sen's army.
	   They are led by Gen. Nhek Bunchhay, who was convicted in a Hun
Sen-controlled court earlier this year of weapons smuggling and
attempting to overthrow the government, in a trial most observers
said was politically motivated.
	   Hun Sen's negotiators are demanding talks move immediately to
the reintegration of the rebels into the Cambodian army.
	   ``They only talked about integration which we can not accept
because we don't feel we will have a guarantee since we have been
attacked,'' Hun Phoeung said.
	   ``We proposed a joint ceasefire be signed before reaching an
integration of forces, but they disagreed,'' he said.
	   Gen. Dam Vuthy, chief negotiator for the Phnom Penh government,
accused the resistance group of intentionally stalling to buy time.
	   ``They put forth various conditions in a bid to delay or to
refuse to integrate into Royal Cambodia Armed Forces,'' Dam Vuthy
told reporters.
	   He warned that by sticking to their demands for having a joint
cease fire signed and amnesty for their commanders, resistance
forces might not be able to integrate in time for July's elections.
	   ``We hope they move faster for their own sake, not ours, so they
can regain full rights,'' Dam Vuthy said, adding that no date has
been scheduled for resumption of talks.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ About 200 militant farmers stormed a
government-operated golf course in Manila on Wednesday and laid
rice seedlings on the 10th hole to protest the 10th anniversary of
the country's land reform program.
	   The members of the Alliance of Nationalist Farmers criticized
the program for allowing land owners to convert land into
industrial estates, golf courses or housing developments to avoid
distributing it to landless farmers.
	   ``We hope that someday we will no longer clear mountains to make
farms,'' said rally leader Pablo Rosales. ``We can always turn golf
courses into useful land planted with crops.''
	   The farmers intended to dig holes in the green to plant the rice
but later agreed to a ``ceremonial planting'' in which they laid
the seedlings in rows on the ground after frantic security guards
pleaded with them not to damage the course.
	   Several golfers had to skirt the 10th hole during the three-hour
protest.
	   Many of the farmers say they come from farms being converted
into golf courses and housing developments.
	   ``We are feeling the hardship caused by land conversion while
foreigners and capitalists take advantage of our land,'' said Ed
Mora, another alliance leader.
	   The protesters had originally intended to target a private golf
course but decided against it because they are heavily guarded,
with high fences.
	   The Department of Agrarian Reform says about 56,168 hectares
(138,734 acres) of farm land were legally converted from 1988 to
December 1977.
	   The Philippine Peasant Institute, however, says the figure is
closer to 200,000 hectares (494,000 acres), most of which was
illegally converted.
	   President-elect Joseph Estrada said Tuesday he may suspend all
conversion of agricultural land until his administration crafts a
national land use policy.
	   Estrada, who takes office June 30, said a comprehensive land use
program will be one of the priorities of his first 100 days in
office.
	   The land reform program's goal was to purchase and distribute
4.29 million hectares (10.6 million acres) of land to landless
farmers. So far only 2.72 million hectares (6.7 million acres) have
been distributed, and the program has been extended until the year
2004.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A top Malaysian politician
acquitted on currency violations by an Australia court pleaded not
guilty Wednesday to corruption charges at home.
	   Former chief minister of the central state of Selangor, Muhammad
Taib, appeared calm when the charge against him was read out, the
national news agency Bernama reported. His wife, Rohani Asnan, and
other family members were also present in court.
	   Muhammad, 52, a prominent member of Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad's United Malays National Organization party, is charged
under the Prevention of Corruption Act for not declaring his
assets. If convicted, he could face one year in jail and a 2,000
ringgit (dlrs 500) fine.
	   On May 29, a court in Brisbane declared him innocent after a
trial for violating Australian laws by carrying more than a million
dollars in foreign currency in his hand luggage during a trip to
Australia in December 1996.
	   Muhammad said he was not aware that he had to declare any cash
in excess of U.S. dlrs 3,100 (5,000 Australian dollars) while
traveling in the country.
	   At the time, he was chief minister of Selangor. He resigned his
post and has also taken leave from his position of vice president
of UMNO.
	   But during the trial he revealed he had purchased a farm, houses
and several pieces of land valued in Australia and New Zealand
under the name of his wife.
	   That led to demands from the opposition and the ruling party to
investigate the former chief minister.

so-called Yirga triangle, a 400-sq.kilometer (160-sq.-mile)
contested slice of Tigray.
	   Asked why the Eritreans would be pushing into territory they
hadn't previously claimed as belonging to them according to the
Italian colonial boundary drawn up in the 19th century, the
spokeswoman replied:
	   ``It is a difficult question to answer from here. They are
insane.''

Hong Kong's leader rules out change in currency peg
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo Available &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa
insisted Wednesday the government will keep its 14-year currency
peg to the U.S. dollar, despite increasing calls for action to help
Hong Kong fight a liquidity crunch.
	   Speaking at a conference on Asia's financial crisis, Tung said
the government won't alter the currency's peg to ease a liquidity
shortage in the local banking system.
	   The news pushed the benchmark three-month interest rate up to
10.375 percent in early afternoon, up from 9.25 percent early
Wednesday. The one-month rate soared to 11.0 percent from 9.625
percent.
	   Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index opened the afternoon
session down 5 percent and then slipped to its lowest level so far
this year, as interbank interest rates surged following Tung's
comments.
	   The index lost 423.41 points, or 5 percent, to 7,968.05 when the
afternoon session opened, then slipped to as low as 7,906.39, its
lowest level in more than three years.
	   Tung said floating the currency would ``cause speculative
attacks against the Hong Kong dollar and increase interest rates.''
	   ``The government will maintain Hong Kong's long-held tradition
of fiscal prudence,'' Tung said.
	   Tung said that recent pressure on the territory's currency was
due to the weakness of the Japanese yen.
	   Investors in the region fear that the weak yen will force China
to devalue its currency to support exports and foreign investments,
leaving the Hong Kong dollar's firm peg to the U.S. dollar in a
precarious position.
	   The devaluation of the two currencies will likely bring more
chaos to the already weakened financial markets in the region.
	   Locally, the Hong Kong government is under increasing pressure
to delink the Hong Kong currency as interest rates remain at high
levels to defend the Hong Kong dollar, making borrowing extremely
difficult for local companies and eating into their profits.

<TEXT>
	   PALEMBANG, Indonesia (AP) _ Rescuers searching a burned down
shopping center and movie theater complex Wednesday said they had
recovered a total of 25 bodies, but feared more dead were still
inside.
	   Fire swept through the Megahira shopping center Monday night.
	   Parts of the six-story building were smouldering two days later,
hampering the search for victims.
	   Witnesses said stores in the center had been shut for several
hours when the fire started.
	   Police said at least 54 people were known to have been in three
movie theaters inside. Dozens more were playing pool in an adjacent
amusement center.
	   ``Many victims are still inside,'' police chief Brig. Gen. Dedde
Janrigadi was quoted as saying by the Sumatra Espres newspaper.
	   The cause of the fire has not been established, he said.
	   Police spokesman Lt. Col. Sardjo Sadjat said 19 people were
injured, 14 of them treated in hospitals in the city, 460
kilometers (285 miles) northwest of Jakarta.
	   Survivors said panic broke out when the building was engulfed in
smoke. None said they saw any flames.
	   One man told the newspaper Republika that people ``trampled on
one another'' to get out.
	   Others alleged that fire exits had been locked by security
guards. Police said they were investigating that claim.
	   Some survivors climbed down ropes holding a window washing
platform on the outside of the building. Others went onto the roof
and jumped to the top of a neighboring building.
	   ``I think no one can survive,'' said Djaieni, a fire department
official.
	   Most of the bodies were badly charred. Only two had been
identified. Distraught relatives of missing moviegoers crowded
around the fire site as rescuers, their faces covered by cloths,
carried out human remains.
	   ``My son was at the movies with his girlfriend. He never came
home,'' said one woman who identified herself by the single name,
Daya.
	   The shopping center, in Palembang on the island of Sumatra, was
built in 1976. It was rebuilt after fire destroyed much of it in
1985, when one firefighter was killed.
	   Last month several shopping malls were set afire during riots in
the capital, Jakarta. Hundreds of people died, mostly looters
trapped inside.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Air France said Wednesday it had reached an
agreement with striking pilots to end a ten-day walkout which has
severely undermined preparations for the World Cup.
	   In a statement, Air France said the pilots had agreed to accept
company shares in exchange for salary cuts.
	   The company called for an immediate return to work.
	   The World Cup kicks off later Wednesday with a match between

Corporate sales and profits decline, pessimism spreads: survey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sales and profits for Japanese companies fell in
the quarter ended in March as managers said they are more
pessimistic about the economy than they've been in at least 15
years, according to a government survey released Wednesday.
	   Pretax profits for Japanese companies plunged 25.4 percent in
the three months ended in March compared with a year earlier as
sales sank 6.8 percent, the largest decline in 40 years, the
Ministry of Finance said in a quarterly survey.
	   The report follows a string of bad news for the Japanese economy
which is stuck in its worst slowdown in decades. Many economists
expect a report due out later this week will show the country has
sunk into recession.
	   The finance ministry's survey, which was conducted in May, also
showed corporate managers didn't expect economic conditions to
improve anytime soon.
	   The survey's business sentiment index for major manufacturers _
a measure of corporate optimism _ sank to minus 36.1 from minus
31.0 a quarter earlier. The index is the difference between the
percentage of companies which say the economy is worsening from
those that say it's getting better. A negative number indicates
there are more pessimists than optimists.
	   The score is the worst since the ministry started the survey in
1983. The previous record low was minus 26.1 in the March survey.
	   The survey also indicated that the growing pessimism is
affecting companies' planning for the future. New investment by
Japanese corporations decreased by 5.8 percent over the quarter.

Duma postpones START II hearings until fall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian Parliament's lower house on Wednesday
put off hearings on the START II arms reduction treaty from next
week until the fall, further delaying hopes of ratification.
	   Acting on ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky's proposal, the
State Duma voted 235-39 to postpone the hearings until some time in
the fall. The move reversed a Duma decision last week to hold
hearings June 16.
	   The hearings, which would precede a ratification debate, would
involve Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and other top officials
discussing why the treaty should be approved.
	   START II was signed in 1993 and ratified by the U.S. Senate in
1996. President Boris Yeltsin has long been urging the Duma to do
the same. The treaty would halve Russian and American nuclear
arsenals to 3,500 warheads each.
	   Communists and nationalists dominating the Duma have balked at
ratifying START II, claiming that cutting strategic weapons would
harm Russia's security and also be too expensive for the
cash-strapped nation.
	   Communist Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov has warned that the
hearings will be shelved if U.S. President Bill Clinton continues
to pressure Russia to pass the treaty.
	   Clinton has said he would prefer to come to Moscow for a
proposed summit with Yeltsin after START II has been ratified.
	   Ret. Gen. Albert Makashov, a Communist deputy in the Duma, on
Wednesday backed Zhirinovsky's proposal to put off the hearings,
saying that the Kremlin wants them to exert pressure on lawmakers
to ratify the treaty. ``It's Clinton who needs it,'' Makashov said.
	   Russian military leaders support ratification. They say that by
2007 _ the treaty's deadline for destroying weapons _ Russia's
intercontinental ballistic missiles with multiple warheads will be
at the end of their service lifetime and will have to be discarded
anyway.

Wharton School to train senior Chinese officials
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The Wharton School plans to begin training senior
Chinese government and state enterprise officials how to compete in
the market economy, the school said Wednesday.
	   President Jiang Zemin announced the program, which will begin in
September, when he visited the Wharton School at the University of
Pennsylvania last October.
	   Premier Zhu Rongji has said China must turn around its
debt-ridden state sector in the next three years in order to stem
heavy losses, put millions of laid-off workers back to work and
keep the economy growing.
	   China's success in reforming state companies ``is going to
depend on economic growth, development of firms and markets in
China, the expansion of the economy and the ability of state-owned
firms to transform themselves and be able to compete,'' said
Stephen J. Kobrin, a professor of multinational management who will
teach some of the courses in Beijing.
	   ``We're not arrogant enough to believe that we can solve the
problem through Wharton faculty coming to China. But we do think
they're important programs and that they focus directly on what the
market economy is,'' he said.
	   Barbara Kahn, a professor of marketing, said her courses would
cover keeping customers satisfied over the long term, developing
global brand names and market expansion strategies.
	   ``It seems the market here is not customer focused. That's not
easy to change,'' Ms. Kahn said.
	   A group of officials from southeastern Jiangsu province, one of
China's most affluent regions near Shanghai, will spend six weeks
at Wharton, in Philadephia, next fall studying business strategy,
marketing, finance, technology and management, they said.
	   The U.S. business school also plans to start training young
Chinese mangers at joint ventures in Shanghai, China's financial
and industrial center, beginning next summer.
	   Wharton's program is helped by its ties with President Jiang and
with the National School of Administration and Qinghua University,
China's leading engineering and business school.
	   Other universities from the United States and other countries
also have set up joint programs to train Chinese MBAs.
	   At a professional training seminar held by the Australian Trade
Commission in Beijing this week, Australian Ambassador Ric Smith
said China needs many well-trained managers for the government's
twin programs of reforming the state sector and streamlining the
bureaucracy.
	   Maurine Chong, Australia's senior trade commissioner in Beijing,
said Australian institutions also plan to cooperate with the
Ministry of Personnel and the State Economic and Trade Commission
to train Chinese managers.

Death toll in cyclone-hit India climbs to 205

	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Relief workers distributed food and
searched for bodies in the debris of smashed homes after a cyclone
tore through western India, killing 205 people, injuring 1,200 and
leaving hundreds of thousands homeless, officials said Wednesday.
	   The toll could rise, as many people remain missing and relief
workers have yet to reach some remote villages.
	   The death toll was highest in Kutch district, where a 12-foot
(four-meter) tidal wave flooded low-lying areas near Kandla port,
290 kilometers (180 miles) northwest of Bombay.
	   As many as 140 people, including fishermen and port workers,
drowned or were swept into the Arabian Sea, government officials
said. Nearly 125 people have been listed as missing and officials
fear the casualty figure could reach 200 in Kutch alone.
	   The other deaths and injuries were mainly caused by lightning
and collapsing houses in the rural districts of Junagadh, Bhuj,
Valsad and Jamnagar near Porbunder, the town where the storm first
struck land, 450 kilometers (280 miles) northwest of Bombay.
	   Nearly 800 workers living in makeshift tin-roofed camps at the
Reliance refinery project at Jamnagar were injured by flying
debris. Officials said 150 of them were hospitalized in a nearby
town. The district reported 35 casualties.
	   Some 2,500 soldiers were called in to help restore
communications and distribute supplies in remote areas of Gujarat
state after Tuesday's cyclone.
	   Relief workers handed out wheat, potatoes and kerosene to
residents of Bhuj, Jamnagar and Porbunder.
	   ``Medical teams have been sent out to contain any epidemic that
might break out,'' said R.M. Joshi, a government official at the
state control center.
	   The cyclone, India's worst in 25 years, uprooted trees,
electricity poles and cut off road and telecommunication links.
	   The worst affected districts of Kutch, Jamnagar and Porbunder
were without electricity for the second day Wednesday.
	   Thousands of people spent the night in the streets after walls
and roofs of mud-and-thatch houses collapsed. Authorities had moved
some 20,000 people to safety before the cyclone struck.
	   Heavy rainfall has been reported in western India and eastern
areas of neighboring Pakistan following the cyclone, which packed
wind speeds of up to 100 kph (65 mph).
	   Pakistan's port city of Karachi was battered by rains blamed for
the deaths of 12 people. Most of the dead, according to the
Associated Press of Pakistan, were electrocuted after high winds
toppled power lines and left live wires strewn across several busy
streets.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - At least 79 people have drowned in Ukraine
since the start of the summer bathing season, officials said
Wednesday.
	   Twelve drowning deaths were registered over the last 10 days of
May and another 67 so far in June, the Emergency Situations
Ministry said. Twelve of the victims in June were children, it
said.
	   About half of the deaths involved drunken people. The ministry
said the rest were caused by neglect for safety, especially that of
children swimming in rivers, lakes and the sea.

Israel says Palestinian killed while planting bomb near settlement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ A Palestinian was shot to death
Tuesday night by Israeli troops who surprised him and another man
as they were planting two bombs outside a settlement in the Gaza
Strip, the army said Wednesday.
	   The soldiers ordered the men to halt, but they ran off and the
troops opened fire, killing Mohammed Bardawilbal, a resident of
Khan Yunis. The other man got away.
	   The army said the soldiers found two explosive charges with
electric detonation devices. The bombs were probably intended to be
used against an army patrol that was due to pass, the army said.
	   Palestinian police commander Khaled Abu Oleh said a joint
Israeli-Palestinian investigation into the incident was underway.
	   ``We are following in detail what happened and we cannot give
full information until we finish our investigation,'' Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat said Wednesday morning.
	   Most of the Gaza Strip is under Palestinian control, while
Israel retains control of the areas around Jewish settlements and
the strip's borders with Israel and Egypt.

	   Wednesday's agreement was reached with the SNPL, the main
pilots' union which represents the vast majority of Air France
pilots.
	   Air France had been locked in bitter talks with pilots' unions
over the last ten days.
	   On Tuesday night, as World Cup celebrations began in Paris,
negotiations seemed deadlocked.

Football star Stan Collymore apologizes for fracas with TV
</HEADLINE>
personality Ulrika Jonsson &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Football star Stan Collymore has apologized for
punching and kicking his girlfriend Ulrika Jonsson in a Paris bar.
	   Jonsson, 30, a Swedish-born television personality, returned to
her home in Cookham Dean, 25 miles (40 kms) northwest of London,
following the incident Monday night. She told reporters on
Wednesday: ``I don't want to talk about it.''
	   Collymore's adviser and agent Paul Stretford confirmed witness
reports, including that of a Scottish Television news reporter,
that the Aston Villa striker hit and kicked Miss Jonsson at a late
night World Cup party for Scotland fans on Monday.
	   Scottish Television reporter Martin Geissler said Collymore
``dragged her out of the bar into a back room, pushed her to the
ground and aimed kicks at her head. She was lying on the ground
screaming and bar staff then grabbed Collymore and threw him out.''
	   Stretford read a statement issued by Collymore, 27, in which he
admitted that ``a stupid and silly argument had developed
throughout the course of the day.''
	   ``My actions were totally reprehensible, something I am not
proud of and finding very difficult to come to terms with. In a fit
of petulant temper I struck out at the girl I love and immediately
regretted my actions, but by then it was too late.
	   ``I could hide behind a facade of excuses and no comments but
petulance, jealousy and possibly having too much to drink are the
real reasons behind this
	   regrettable and avoidable incident.''
	   Collymore also confirmed that he had been head-butted by someone
in the bar, and he apologized to that unidentified man ``for
causing him to feel that he had to take such action.''
	   Collymore said he had privately apologized to Miss Jonsson.

Italians arrest suspected terrorists as World Cup starts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ As the World Cup kicks off in France Wednesday,
Italian police arrested at least 20 people suspected of belonging
to an Algerian terrorist group allegedly planning attacks during
the games.
	   Paramilitary police in Bologna said approximately 23 people had
been arrested and dozens of others were being questioned. News
reports linked those arrested to the Armed Islamic Group, a violent
Muslim militant movement blamed for murdering tens of thousands of
people in Algeria.
	   A Europe-wide anti-terrorist sweep over the past month has led
to nearly 100 arrests in France, Italy, Germany, Belgium and
Switzerland.
	   French authorities in May said they had found evidence of
possible terrorist attacks planned during the month-long soccer
tournament to be played in 10 French cities. They also urged the
public to watch out for bombs.
	   Algerian militants have staged terrorist attacks in France in
the past to pressure Paris to cut its ties with the military-backed
government of the petroleum-rich North African nation.

Mayor of Thailand's second largest city resigns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHIANG MAI, Thailand (AP) _ The mayor of Chiang Mai, Thailand's
second largest city, has abruptly resigned in the face of political
pressure connected with the proposed site of a new municipal dump.
	   An official of Chiang Mai province said Wednesday that Sakol
Karanthakasuwan was caught between the demands of his political
organization and opposition among residents of the area where the
dump would be located.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Sakol's
resignation Tuesday might further weaken the control the Navarat
Pattana Group, one of northern Thailand's biggest business groups,
has exercised over the city government.
	   The Navarat Pattana group is involved in real estate and
retailing.
	   Sakol gave no public reason for his resignation, but was
believed to want to cut his association with the group, said the
official.
	   The party to which Sakol belonged was closely associated with
the group, and two years ago controlled all 24 seats in the
municipal legislature. But political infighting, fueled by
scandals, has led many to defect, and with Sakol's resignation, the
group now controls only 11 seats.
	   The founder of the Navarat Pattana Group, Maj.-Gen. Intarat
Yodbangtoei, is facing trial for allegedly running an extortion
racket at four Chiang Mai markets, including the Night Bazaar, a
popular shopping area among foreign visitors.
	   Chiang Mai, 580 kilometers (360 miles) north of Bangkok, is a
popular tourist destination and university town.
	   Sakol was being pressured by the Navarat Pattana Group to
purchase land from a particular seller for the city's dump site,
said the provincial official.
	   He said public anger about the affair was running so high that
Intarat recently came close to being attacked by some 300 villagers
while he was inspecting a dump site in Hang Dong district.
	   Provincial Governor Pravit Sihasopon was nonetheless expected to
appoint Intarat's wife, Busaba, to replace Sakol unless the council
members who had broken with the Navarat Pattana Group could unite
and agree on an alternative candidate, said the official.

French need some heavy prodding to get charged for World Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The home fans color any World Cup. Their fervor,
even craziness, can provide that extra sparkle to make memories
live on forever. Their indifference can turn the finals into an
out-of-body experience.
	   The French have a tall task ahead over the next month to make
themselves inseparably intertwined with their Coupe du Monde.
	   ``We never really felt a groundswell,'' said Jacques Lambert,
the general director of the World Cup organizing committee.
	   Two decades ago, the confetti and paper rolls cascading down
River Plate's Monumental Stadium and snowing under the pitch
symbolized an Argentinean nation totally enthralled with the
success of the home team.
	   A dozen years ago in Mexico, an opening win over little Belgium
turned Mexico City into a seething mass of celebrating fans and
wild fiestas with hundreds of thousands of fans continued with
every win until Germany prevailed in a quarterfinal penalty
shootout.
	   The Italian fans tried hard to enliven the 1990 finals, but they
will always be remembered for weeping openly in Naples' Sao Paolo
stadium after Argentina's Diego Maradona denied them a place in the
final during a penalty shootout.
	   Despite the huge crowds in the United States four years ago, the
host nation was mesmerized by the murder charges facing football
star OJ Simpson and much more absorbed by basketball and ice hockey
finals instead of a soccer sideshow.
	   The hope always was that by returning the World Cup to its
French cradle, the national enthusiasm would automatically follow.
	   Don't necessarily count on it. Especially not the home team.
	   The French team already thank the lucky stars that their opening
match Friday against South Africa is in Marseilles, the
Mediterranean port where the southern heart truly beats for Les
Bleus, as the team is known.
	   ``The whole of the ... south will be there,'' said defensive
mainstay Laurent Blanc. ``It's the best place to start. They're
more exuberant.''
	   Coach Aime Jacquet agreed. ``We feared stadiums full of people
without fervor. So this is a good decision.''
	   Marseilles's antithesis is Paris, a town that can react to the
team with a cool disdain.
	   Parisian fans are known to whistle the team. ``France has a
habit of denigrating those that they loved just a few weeks
earlier,'' said Cyrille Auvillain, a member of the fledgling
official fan club of the French team.
	   Last year, the team got a cool reaction when it disappointed at
its Tournoi de France, a warmup for the World Cup. Since they have
also been whistled in Lens and St. Etienne, despite winning on both
occasions.
	   ``How to explain this lack of love,'' asked French federation
president Claude Simonet. ``The French are impatient, demanding.''
	   The official fan club for France was founded half a year ago,
and has lured just 4,000 members in a country of 58.5 million.
	   The lukewarm mentality of the French fans even has opposing
teams figuring out special strategies.
	   As a Frenchman, South African coach Philippe Troussier knows all
to well how fickle the French can be. On Friday, he wants his team
to come strong from the start, knowing how the crowd can turn if
its team doesn't start well.
	   Soccer observers say a French team led by brilliant playmaker
Zinedine Zidane can go all the way to the final and even President
Jacques Chirac, the first among French fans, has spoken of his
expectation that he will offer the Cup to French captain Didier
Deschamps July 12.
	   But soccer fever is not running through the whole nation yet.
``Maybe we don't like winners,'' Auvillain said.
	   One thing is sure _ one of France's biggest sporting legends is
cyclist Raymond Poulidor, who made a career out of finishing second
in the Tour de France.

Security strengthened at Bangladeshi power stations for World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Authorities in Bangladesh have beefed
up security at the country's power stations, concerned that outages
during World Cup broadcasts could lead to attacks by angry soccer
fans.
	   Bangladesh's national team is not playing in the World Cup
tournament, which begins Wednesday, but the country has many avid
soccer fans.
	   The government flew in two Russian engineers from Moscow on
Sunday to repair a 210 megawatt power stations to ensure there was
adequate power supply in the capital, Dhaka, newspapers reported
Wednesday.
	   Outages are routine in Bangladesh, which generates only 1,700
megawatts of power, an inadequate amount of electricity for the
country. In some areas, power cuts last up to 12 hours, leading to
street demonstrations.

Protests in city on Clinton's itinerary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Several hundred disgruntled residents staged
protests Wednesday in Xi'an, the Chinese city famed for its
terracotta warriors that will be President Clinton's first stop in
China later this month, according to a Hong Kong-based human rights
group.
	   The peaceful demonstrations by two groups with different
grievances against the government began Tuesday morning. A group of
about 150 people were protesting the government's failure to
allocate them new housing after they were evicted from their homes
for redevelopment, the Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China said.
	   They were soon joined by some 200 pedicab drivers protesting the
city's decision ahead of Clinton's June 25-26 visit not to allow
them to work as taxi drivers, the group said.
	   Many of the pedicab drivers are disabled and depend on their
jobs hauling passengers and small loads of furniture and other
goods for their livelihood.
	   Police did not intervene, and the demonstrators dispersed at
about 6 p.m. Tuesday. They resumed their protest Wednesday morning,
the human rights center said.
	   Xi'an police and government officials denied that any protests
had occurred, although they confirmed that the city had prohibited
pedicab owners from hiring out their vehicles.
	   Xi'an, a grimy industrial city that was once the imperial
capital on China's Silk Road, has been the site of several protests
in recent months.
	   The Hong Kong-based group reported last week that police in
Xi'an had beaten one of the thousands of onlookers watching a
sit-in on June 2 by 200 workers from the No. 1 Construction Co. who
were protesting layoffs.
	   The demonstrations are the latest in steady outbursts of unrest
as reform-minded Chinese leaders allow bankrupt state industries to
lay off millions of workers. In cities throughout China, many of
the unemployed have taken to driving taxis and pedicabs to make
ends meet.
	   In May, some 500 taxi drivers surrounded Xi'an government
offices to protest licensing fees they believed were unfair.

Air France says agreement reached with striking pilots
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: combines urgent series, adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN PHILLIPS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Air France said Wednesday it had reached an
agreement with striking pilots to end a ten-day walkout which has
severely undermined preparations for the World Cup.
	   In a statement, Air France said the pilots had agreed to accept
company shares in exchange for salary cuts.
	   The company called for an immediate return to work.
	   The World Cup kicks off later Wednesday with a match between
Brazil and Scotland.
	   ``This global accord is aimed at assuring the development of Air
France by improving its competitivity with regards to its rivals,''
the statement said.
	   The company also said it would scrap a two-tier salary scale,
under which new pilots earned less than their colleagues.
	   The strike was an acute embarrassment to the company, the World
Cup's official carrier, and the French government.
	   Wednesday's agreement was reached with the SNPL, the main
pilots' union which represents the vast majority of Air France
pilots.
	   Air France had been locked in bitter talks with pilots' unions
over the last ten days.
	   On Tuesday night, as World Cup celebrations began in Paris,
negotiations seemed deadlocked.
	   The pilots had been protesting a proposal for 500 million francs
(dlrs 83 million) in salary cuts. Air France had said the cuts were
needed to modernize the airline, which was saved from bankruptcy in
1993 but reported profits in 1996 and 1997.
	   In the statement, Air France said part of the agreement involved
guaranteed training for young pilots.
	   Only one in four Air France planes was flying Tuesday, and other
carriers were cashing in on the carrier's woes.
	   British Airways estimated it was bringing in an additional 1

France strike.
	   Air France had arranged special flights to transport teams to
their destinations during the World Cup.
	   An estimated one million fans are expected to travel to France
for the month-long soccer tournament. Many fans have already

Singapore dollar, stock market tumble
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with index passing this year's low.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's benchmark stock index plunged 4.1
percent Wednesday to hit its lowest level this year and the
Singapore dollar fell to a four-month low against the U.S.
currency.
	   Dealers said foreign sellers were abandoning Singapore's
index-linked stocks to get out of the market.
	   Mounting fears that the local economy is worse than official
figures show, a stagnant property sector, concerns about bank
exposures to regional bad loans and the weakening Asian currency
markets have contributed to the rapid slide of Singapore's markets
in the past two weeks.
	   The benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index easily breached a
key support level of 1100 in early trading and before closing had
fallen more than 45 points, to a low for the year, 1071.94. The
index's last low was on Jan. 12, when it hit 1073.47.
	   On that day, considered to be the height of the financial
crisis, the Singapore dollar had also weakened to below 1.80 to the
U.S. dollar.
	   The Singapore dollar wasn't spared on Wednesday either, breaking
through the 1.72 level against the U.S dollar for the first time
since early February. The U.S. dollar was quoted at a four-month
high of 1.7215 Singapore dollars in morning trading, but the
currency fluctuated within one Singapore cent.
	   The falls come after a series of precipitous drops over the past
week.
	   There was increasing speculation by market players over whether
China will devalue its yuan and Hong Kong will abandon its fixed
currency peg against the U.S. dollar.
	   Uncertainty over the direction of the Japanese yen, and growing
indications of significant economic slowdown or even recession in
Singapore's economy also continue to dampen sentiment.
	   Equity markets were down across the region.
	   Dealers said attention was focused on Hong Kong, where the
benchmark Hang Seng index had dived.

Air France says agreement reached with striking pilots
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with three days needed for Air France service to
return to normal, background on pilots' grievances.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Air France said Wednesday it had reached an
agreement with striking pilots that severely undermined
preparations for the World Cup.
	   In a statement, Air France said the pilots had agreed to accept
company shares in exchange for salary cuts.
	   The company called for an immediate return to work. Previously
Air France had said it would take at least three days for service
to return to normal once the strike ended.
	   The World Cup kicks off later Wednesday with a match between
Brazil and Scotland, although it appeared that most of the fans had
been able to get to France despite the strike by switching airlines
or taking the train.
	   ``This global accord is aimed at assuring the development of Air
France by improving its competitivity with regards to its rivals,''
the company statement said.
	   Air France also said it would scrap a two-tier salary scale,
under which new pilots earned less than their colleagues. The
pilots, among the most highly paid in the world, had found this
detrimental to cabin solidarity.
	   The strike was an acute embarrassment to the company, the World
Cup's official carrier, and the French government.
	   Many of the Air France planes, which were decorated with huge
images of World Cup soccer stars, sat idle on the runways during
the runup to the soccer tournament.
	   Wednesday's agreement was reached with the SNPL, the main
pilots' union which represents the vast majority of Air France
pilots.
	   Air France had been locked in bitter talks with pilots' unions
over the last ten days.
	   On Tuesday night, as World Cup celebrations began in Paris,
negotiations had seemed deadlocked.
	   The pilots had been protesting a proposal for 500 million francs
(dlrs 83 million) in salary cuts. Air France had said the cuts were
needed to modernize the airline, which was saved from bankruptcy in
1993 but reported healthy profits in 1996 and 1997.
	   It appeared, however, that much of the 1997 gain has been eaten
up by the strike.
	   In the statement, Air France said part of the agreement involved
guaranteed training for young pilots, at least part of which would
be paid for by the company.
	   Only one in four Air France planes was flying Tuesday, and other
carriers were cashing in on the carrier's woes.
	   British Airways estimated it was bringing in an additional 1
million pounds (dlrs 1.6 million) daily as a result of the Air
France strike.
	   Air France had arranged special flights to transport teams to
their destinations during the World Cup.
	   An estimated one million fans are expected to travel to France
for the month-long soccer tournament. Many fans have already
arrived, and some have been forced to switch airlines.
	   As well as the airline strike, France has been hit in recent
days by walkouts by train drivers, baggage handlers, and some bus
services.

EU Commission set to approve relaxation of British beef ban
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be UPDATED after decision expected by 1100 gmt
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission was expected
Wednesday to back the lifting of the worldwide ban on most British
beef exports imposed more than two years ago at the height of
Europe's ``mad cow'' scare.
	   The 20-member European Union executive body is set to rule that
all beef and beef products from cattle born after Aug. 1, 1996,
will be free for export. That would cover most potential beef
exports.
	   ``The British government made great efforts in the eradication''
of mad cow disease,'' Commission President Jacques Santer told
reporters. ``I think it will be the next step, to lift the ban.''
	   However, even if the Commission approves the relaxation of the
ban, the EU's complex decision-making process means it could still
take months before British beef is back on foreign markets.
	   A decision to drop the ban should be approved by a panel of
veterinary experts from the 15 EU nations who are scheduled to meet
Friday. Those specialists are divided and if they cannot agree, the
issue will be put to a vote at a meeting of EU agriculture
ministers, probably in July.
	   Germany in particular is wary about letting British beef back
onto its markets, fearing that lingering mad cow fears among
consumers could again drive down the price of all beef.
	   The EU slapped a global ban on British beef exports on March 27,
1996, after the British government acknowledged a possible link
between a brain-wasting cattle ailment officially known as bovine
spongiform encephalopathy and an equally fatal human condition,
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
	   Fears that eating mad-cow tainted beef could cause humans to
contract CJD provoked a crisis in the beef industry across Europe
and cattle prices plummeted.
	   Although some animals have gone down with BSE in other European
nations, the overwhelming majority of mad cow cases have been in
Britain. The outbreak was blamed on the practice of feeding cattle
the ground remains of sheep and other animals.
	   Britain banned such feed on Aug. 1, 1996 and now claims all
cattle born after that ban are free from the disease. Among other
measures taken to wipe out the disease, Britain slaughtered 3
million cattle judged at risk and forbade the sale of cattle-parts
thought most likely to harbor the disease, such as brains and
spinal cords.
	   The first relaxation of the ban came two weeks ago, when the EU
allowed exports of beef from Northern Ireland, where a special
computer tracking system allowed herds to be certified mad-cow
free.
	   Before the ban, Britain's beef exports were worth some 5 billion
pounds (dlrs 8.1 billion) a year.

Wharton School to train senior Chinese officials
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS word in lede to ``teaching'' sted ``training''; CLARIFIES
attribution in lede to faculty members &QL; 
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The Wharton School plans to begin teaching senior
Chinese government and state enterprise officials how to compete in
the market economy, visiting faculty members said Wednesday.
	   President Jiang Zemin announced the program, which will begin in
September, when he visited the Wharton School at the University of
Pennsylvania last October.
	   Premier Zhu Rongji has said China must turn around its
debt-ridden state sector in the next three years in order to stem
heavy losses, put millions of laid-off workers back to work and
keep the economy growing.
	   China's success in reforming state companies ``is going to
depend on economic growth, development of firms and markets in
China, the expansion of the economy and the ability of state-owned
firms to transform themselves and be able to compete,'' said
Stephen J. Kobrin, a professor of multinational management who will
teach some of the courses in Beijing.
	   ``We're not arrogant enough to believe that we can solve the
problem through Wharton faculty coming to China. But we do think
they're important programs and that they focus directly on what the
market economy is,'' he said.
	   Barbara Kahn, a professor of marketing, said her courses would
cover keeping customers satisfied over the long term, developing
global brand names and market expansion strategies.
	   ``It seems the market here is not customer focused. That's not
easy to change,'' Ms. Kahn said.
	   A group of officials from southeastern Jiangsu province, one of
China's most affluent regions near Shanghai, will spend six weeks
at Wharton, in Philadephia, next fall studying business strategy,
marketing, finance, technology and management, they said.
	   The U.S. business school also plans to start training young
Chinese mangers at joint ventures in Shanghai, China's financial
and industrial center, beginning next summer.
	   Wharton's program is helped by its ties with President Jiang and
with the National School of Administration and Qinghua University,
China's leading engineering and business school.
	   Other universities from the United States and other countries
also have set up joint programs to train Chinese MBAs.
	   At a professional training seminar held by the Australian Trade
Commission in Beijing this week, Australian Ambassador Ric Smith
said China needs many well-trained managers for the government's
twin programs of reforming the state sector and streamlining the
bureaucracy.
	   Maurine Chong, Australia's senior trade commissioner in Beijing,
said Australian institutions also plan to cooperate with the
Ministry of Personnel and the State Economic and Trade Commission
to train Chinese managers.

Newspaper: death toll in rebel school attack rises to 80
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HENRY WASSWA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The death toll in a rebel attack on a
technical training college in western Uganda has risen to 80, a
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   President Yoweri Museveni condemned the Monday attack on
Kichwamba Technical College, the bloodiest carried out by the
Alliance of Democratic Forces since they appeared on the scene two
years ago. He said the group included former security agents in the
dreaded secret police of former dictator Idi Amin.
	   Museveni, himself a former rebel leader, spoke Tuesday evening
at a ceremony honoring those who died in the 1981-86 rebellion he
led against the government of Milton Obote.
	   The ADF rebels reportedly attacked the training college near
Kabarole, 316 kilometers (196 miles) west of Kampala, to carry off
young men to serve in their ranks. When the students barricaded
themselves inside one of the college buildings, the rebels set fire
to it.
	   On Wednesday, the government-owned New Vision said the death
toll had risen to 80 and that another 60 people were missing and
feared abducted.
	   The ADF rebels and those of the Lord's Resistance Army operating
in northern Uganda force civilians to join their ranks; the LRA
usually carries off children under the age of 15.
	   Education Minister Apollo Nsimbi went on state radio Tuesday to
express sorrow over the deaths.
	   Many Ugandans have begun to express concern that the army _ the
Ugandan People's Defense Force _ is incapable of dealing with the
three-front rebel onslaught.
	   The ADF is based in the foothills of the Rwenzori Mountains that
form the border between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the
Congo. The West Nile Bank Front, another rebel group, operates in
the far northwestern part of the country, on the west bank of the
Nile River.
	   The Sudan-based LRA operates mainly in the northern districts of
Gulu and Kitgum, but late last month struck in central Lira
district.
	   ADF rebels operating in Kabarole, Kasese and Bundibuyo districts
have displaced at least 80,000 people from their homes.
	   Aides to Maj. Shaban Bantariza, a military spokesman, said he
had gone to the area to gather information about Monday's attack.
	   The New Vision further reported that army commanders in the the
region blamed troops posted near the trainin college for not
responding swiftly to the rebel attack and said the area unit
commander has been arrested.
	   ``When the rebels attacked the institute at around 5.30 a.m on
the fateful day, the UPDF troops just took off and left the
vulnerable lives of the students in the hands of the brutal ADF
thugs,'' New Vision said.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ New Zealand captured the prized wicket
of Sanath Jayasuriya to leave Sri Lanka on 52 for one wicket at
lunch on day one of the third test in Colombo on Wednesday.
	   Jayasuriya fell in the ninth over when paceman Chris Cairns had
him edge a ball to second slip, where Bryan Young took a simple
catch.
	   At the crease were Marvan Atapattu on 22 and Mahela Jayawardena
on 16. Sri Lanka won the toss and decided to bat first.
	   The Indian Ocean islanders retained the same side which won the
second Test by an innings, squaring the 3-match series 1-1.
	   New Zealand brought in left-arm spinner Mark Priest to replace
paceman Shyane O'Conner, while also leaving out allrounder Chris
Harris in favor of batsman Craig Spearman.
	   The match started an hour late due to rain.
	   Sri Lanka: Arjuna Ranatunga (capt.), Sanath Jayasuriya, Marvan
Atapattu, Mahela Jayawardena, Aravinda de Silva, Hashan

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Police seized 1,500 video tapes of
people engaging in obscene acts with animals in northwestern
Transylvania, a police officer said Wednesday.
	   An Italian and a Romanian brought the tapes to customs officers
Tuesday, requesting an export license, Col. Constantin Aurel Tufaru

U.S. dollar climbs, Tokyo stocks fall
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Wraps up with late dollar, closing bond, other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar climbed to a new seven-year high
against the yen Wednesday ahead of a meeting of Group of Seven
finance officials in France. Tokyo stocks fell amid sharp declines
in other Asian stock markets.
	   In late afternoon trading, the dollar bought 140.84 yen, up 0.48
yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and above its late New York level of
140.30 yen overnight. During Wednesday's trading, the currency
moved as high as 141.57 yen, its highest level since June 1991.
	   The dollar rose amid speculation that deputy finance ministers
of the G-7 industrialized countries will not issue a statement to
curb the yen's slide after their meeting Wednesday in Paris.
	   Japanese officials have recently warned of the yen's excessive
weakening against the dollar, suggesting possible yen-buying
intervention. Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga has hinted that the
G-7 officials might address the recent exchange market movement.
	   Traders said they will keep watching the G-7 meeting and
congressional testimony by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan, also Wednesday.
	   The dollar has gained steadily against the Japanese currency in
recent weeks as investors shifted funds out of Japan's sagging
markets and into the robust U.S. economy.
	   Meanwhile, sharp falls in Asian stock markets, including Hong
Kong, sent Tokyo share prices lower Wednesday. Some investors also
took profits following Tuesday's rise on the main index.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 190.91 points, or 1.23
percent, closing at 15,339.26. On Tuesday, the average rose 235.46
points, or 1.52 percent.
	   Among Wednesday's losers were bank issues, which faced selling
by foreign investors. Japanese banks are still saddled with huge
bad loans left over from the collapse of Japan's speculative
``bubble economy'' in the early 1990s.
	   Trading remained light, with an estimated 340 million shares
changing hands on the first section, up from Tuesday's 314 million
shares. Declining issues outnumbered advancers 746 to 352, with 145
issues unchanged.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section shed 10.08 points, or 0.83 percent, to 1,198.60. The
TOPIX closed up 10.32 points, or 0.86 percent, the day before.
	   Analysts predicted foreign investors will keep selling their
Japanese holdings if the yen keeps weakening. A weaker yen erodes
the dollar value of Japanese stocks.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.195 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.210 percent,
driving its price higher to 112.06 yen from 111.96 yen.

Iranian paper stops publishing after press violation charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A new Iranian newspaper has stopped
publication after authorities charged it with frequently violating
press ethics, other newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   The liberal Gozaresh-e-Baz was charged by the Press Supervisory
Board, and its case was forwarded Tuesday to the Justice Ministry
for review, the Iran Daily said.
	   A court case could follow and the newspaper may lose its license
if it's found guilty.
	   Another newspaper, Salam, quoted Gozaresh-e-Baz's director
Mohammad Mahdavi Khorrami as saying he had voluntarily stopped
publishing the paper until a final verdict.
	   The action against Gozaresh-e-Baz, or ``Open Report,'' is seen
as a setback for the press freedom that has been allowed by
moderate President Mohammad Khatami since he took office in August.
	   It was not clear if hard-liners opposed to Khatami's reforms
were behind the crackdown on the paper.
	   The Farsi-language newspaper started publishing only last month
and on its third day it printed a front-page color picture of a
teenage boy with a teenage girl wearing a head scarf. The caption
read: ``Friendship Under Fear.''
	   The Culture Ministry warned it to ``respect the Press Law and
the society's ethical and religious standards,'' the
English-language Iran News said.
	   It quoted a ministry official, Ahmad Borqani, as saying that the
newspaper ``has followed quite an inappropriate path from the
beginning of its publication to the present day.''
	   Borqani said the paper had also printed ``a false report''
claiming that some Iranian officials had transferred money to
overseas bank accounts. Borqani said such a report is ``aimed at
disturbing public opinion and is against our national interests.''
	   Iran's constitution forbids the media from ``propagating
destructive and anti-Islamic attitudes.''
	   On Monday a court convicted the editor of the popular Jameah
newspaper of defamation and lies. The sentence was not made public.

Air France says agreement reached with striking pilots

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Air France said Wednesday it had reached an
agreement with striking pilots, ending a walkout that had severely
embarrassed the country in the days leading up to the World Cup.
	   In a statement, Air France said the pilots had agreed to accept
company shares in exchange for salary cuts.
	   The company called for an immediate return to work. But the
airline has said previously it would take at least three days for
service to return to normal once the strike ended.
	   Just Tuesday night, as World Cup celebrations began in Paris,
negotiations had seemed deadlocked. Pilots had gathered at Charles
de Gaulle airport and agreed to continue the walkout, despite an
appeal by the transport minister to both sides to continue talking.
	   But in talks overnight, an agreement was reached.
	   Jean-Cyril Spinetta, the president of Air France, told France
Info radio Wednesday morning that ``this is a compromise that is
good for the company, good for the employees and good for the
clients.''
	   But he added that consequences of the strike were ``heavy'' and
that the company had lost a billion francs (dlrs 166 million.)
``Now we have to think of confidence, confidence in Air France,
confidence in its clients,'' he said.
	   ``This global accord is aimed at assuring the development of Air
France by improving its competitiveness with regards to its
rivals,'' he said in a statement.
	   The carrier also said Wednesday it would scrap a two-tier salary
scale, under which new pilots earned less than their colleagues.
The pilots, among the most highly paid in the world, had found this
detrimental to cabin solidarity.
	   The strike, coming as the country tries to put its best face
forward for the world's biggest sporting event, was a severe
embarrassment to the government.
	   The World Cup kicks off later Wednesday with a match between
Brazil and Scotland.
	   Thousands of fans have descended on France for the tournament,
many having to switch airlines at the last minute or take the
train.
	   Air France is the official airline of the World Cup, and many of
its planes, decorated with huge images of soccer stars, sat idle on
runways during the runup to the soccer tournament.
	   Wednesday's agreement was reached with the SNPL, the main
pilots' union which represents the vast majority of Air France
pilots.
	   The airline had been locked in bitter talks with pilots' unions
over the last 10 days.
	   The pilots had been protesting a proposal for 500 million francs
(dlrs 83 million) in salary cuts. Air France had said the cuts were
needed to modernize the airline, which was saved from bankruptcy in
1993 but reported healthy profits in 1996 and 1997.
	   It appeared that much of the 1997 gain has been eaten up by the
strike.
	   In the statement, Air France said part of the agreement involved
guaranteed training for young pilots, at least part of which would
be paid for by the company.
	   Only one in four Air France planes was flying Tuesday, and other
carriers were cashing in on the carrier's woes.
	   British Airways estimated it was bringing in an additional 1
million pounds (dlrs 1.6 million) daily as a result of the Air
France strike.
	   As well as the airline strike, France has been hit in recent
days by walkouts by train drivers, baggage handlers, and some bus
services.

 &UR; TURKS AND CAICOS _ Police fire at Haitian refugee sloop; 30
believed dead &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) _ Police in the British Turks and Caicos
Islands fired on a boat jammed with 100 Haitian refugees. The boat
capsized, drowning as many as 30 people, authorities said Tuesday.
	   John Kelly, deputy governor of the island chain, said there were
unconfirmed reports the police hit the boat when they tried to
shoot warning shots over its bow on Monday.
	   The sloop flipped over and threw its passengers into the ocean.
	   The bodies of six drowned Haitians were recovered Monday.
Rescuers searched without success Tuesday for 24 missing people,
Kelly said.
	   Kelly said there was no evidence that the police officers' shots
hit the boat, and the six dead did not suffer bullet wounds.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Unions OK general strike to protest phone company
sale
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Union leaders on Tuesday approved a
general strike to protest the proposed sale of the state-owned
Puerto Rico Telephone Co. to a GTE-led consortium, but they refused
to reveal a strike date.
	   The strike threat is intended to pressure Puerto Rican
legislators who must decide whether to approve the dlrs 1.8 billion
sale, a centerpiece of Gov. Pedro Rossello's privatization program.
	   ``It could be tomorrow,'' said Miguel Sisamone, vice president
of the Independent Telephone Workers Union.
	   A small bomb, meanwhile, exploded outside a bank owned by a
partner in the GTE consortium, shattering windows and heightening
fears of violence by opponents of the sale. There were no injuries.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Cuban exile groups protest Spanish prime minister's
visit
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Several dozen anti-Castro activists called on the
Spanish government to take a stronger stand against the Cuban
regime as Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar visited South
Florida on Tuesday.
	   Protesters on street corners waved Cuban flags and held up signs
to passing traffic at Florida International University, where Aznar
spoke on the importance of higher education.
	   One of the signs called Aznar a liar. Another said ``Spanish
investors are exploiting Cuban workers.''
	   The demonstration was organized by several Cuban exile groups
that say Aznar's government has been too soft on Fidel Castro's
regime. No arrests were reported.
 &UR; UNITED NATIONS: Cuba says U.S. embargo harmful to drug fight
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Cuba said Tuesday the U.S. embargo was
harming its efforts to fight drug trafficking and rejected as
illegitimate the U.S. procedure of certifying countries as allies
in the drug war.
	   ``The developing world,'' said Justice Minister Roberto Diaz
Sotolongo, ``is where the flow of the resources required to
confront the challenge posed by this evil is most necessary.''
	   Speaking to a U.N. General Assembly special session on drugs,
Diaz Sotolongo said there was political will in Cuba to prevent
using Cuban territory for moving drugs.
	   Cuban authorities prevented 95 million doses of cocaine from
being consumed in other countries between 1994 and 1997, he said.
 &UR; GUYANA: Officials say rights groups ``ganging up'' on Caribbean
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Human rights groups are ``ganging up''
on Caribbean nations to force them to abandon the death penalty,
local justice ministers complained during a forum in Guyana.
	   They urged each other to openly oppose pressure by the United
Nations Human Rights Committee, Amnesty International, Caribbean
Rights and Human Rights Watch to curb their use of capital
punishment.
	   ``This is a fundamental issue that we must address because we
have a number of international organizations ganging up against
us,'' Radford Hill, Antigua's legal affairs and justice minister
said during the meeting last week. ``The better thing to do is for
us to come up with a harmonized approach to the issue. There is
strength in numbers.''
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Local Justice Dept. probes political donations by
AT&AMP;T
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ The Puerto Rican Justice Department
is investigating allegations that AT&AMP;T Corp. made possibly unlawful
donations to a political party that supports statehood for this
U.S. territory.
	   The government said in a statement that its Special
Investigations Bureau is probing contributions made between 1993
and 1995 to Tele-Pro, a group of Puerto Rican statehood activists.
	   Some of the money was later deposited in bank accounts of Gov.
Pedro Rossello's New Progressive Party, documents published Tuesday
by the El Nuevo Dia newspaper show.
	   At least one of those donations _ a dlrs 4,000 check written in
1994 that ended up in the party's bank account _ would violate a
dlrs 1,000 limit on donations to parties during non-election years
set by Puerto Rican law.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Jamaican boy dies after being scratched by cat
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ A 6-year-old Jamaican boy stricken with
a rare complication of ``Cat Scratch Disease'' has died in a
Jacksonville, Florida, hospital, his parents reported.
	   Bosville Anthony Mullings of Westmoreland Parish, Jamaica,
caught bacillary angiomatosis, a rare form of the disease, after a
cat scratched him in March. News of his illness inspired hundreds
of Jamaicans to donate money to fly him to the United States for
medical care.
	   His parents said Mullings died Monday of heart complications
related to the disease.
	   ``The doctors tried their best,'' his father, Bosville Mullings
Sr., said Monday. ``If it's the will of the Lord to take him, then
whatever his will is, that's good enough for me.''
 &UR; CUBA: Italian foreign minister in Cuba
	   HAVANA (AP) _ With Cuba expressing concern about a recent U.S.
pact with Europe, Italy's foreign minister met Tuesday with Cuban
officials to express interest in continuing ties with the communist
island.
	   Lamberto Dini, who arrived Monday, was making the first visit by
a European Community foreign minister since the United States
imposed a tougher new version of its Cuba embargo in March 1996.
	   Cuban foreign minister Roberto Robaina, who met Dini on Tuesday,
said Monday that he was confident Europe continues to oppose the
U.S. law known as the Helms-Burton Act, which authorizes U.S.
sanctions against international companies that deal with Cuba.
 &UR; JAMAICA: University of the West Indies offers scholarship to
spelling champ
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ She won't enroll for another five
years, but the University of the West Indies is already courting
the Jamaican winner of a prestigious spelling bee contest with the
offer of a full scholarship.
	   Jody-Anne Maxwell, 12, has been offered a free education in the
major of her choice by the university's Mona Campus in Kingston,
Professor Elsa Leo-Rhynie, deputy principal of the university, said
Tuesday
	   Maxwell won the annual Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee
Competition, held in Washington, D.C., on May 29. She became the
first winner from outside the United States in the contest's
71-year history.
	   Maxwell has also been offered a full scholarship to Howard
University in Washington, D.C. She has said she wants to study
corporate law.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Fearing the local economy is worse than the
government admits, foreign sellers bailed out of the Singapore
markets in a frenzy Wednesday, and the benchmark index plunged 4.4
percent to its lowest level in seven years.
	   The key Straits Times Industrial Index easily breached a key
support level of 1100 in early trading and fell 49 points to close
at 1067.81, a seven-year low.

 &UR; SINGAPORE: seven-year low.

<TEXT>
	   The Singapore dollar also hit a four-month low against the U.S.
currency.
	   The index's previous low this year was on Jan. 12, when it hit
1073.47 in what was considered the peak of the regional economic
crisis.
	   But fears are growing that Singapore, a hub for transferring
money into, out of, and around the financially weak region, is now
set to suffer more of the consequences of the Asian economic
crisis. It largely sailed unscathed through most of the tumult last
year.
	   Government television attributed Wednesday's market plunge to
heavy selling of the Japanese and Hong Kong currencies amid fears
of more devaluation in the region.
	   The Singapore dollar wasn't spared either, breaking through the
1.72 level against the U.S dollar for the first time since early
February. The U.S. dollar was quoted at a four-month high of 1.7215
Singapore dollars in morning trading, but the currency fluctuated
within one Singapore cent throughout the day.

Floods inundate homes, injure 15 in Bangladesh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Torrential rains and rushing rainwater
from hills in neighboring India have flooded Bangladesh's eastern
Sylhet district, inundating homes and vast areas of standing crops,
officials said Wednesday.
	   Fifteen people were injured in the floods that washed away 300
mud-and-straw dwellings and uprooted trees and electric poles.
Water entered thousands of homes in several parts of the district.
	   Power supply and communication within the district was
disrupted.
	   Rivers in Sylhet, 190 kilometers (120 miles) east of the
national capital Dhaka, were flowing above the danger marks,
officials of the Water Development Board said.

Cross-Atlantic speed record broken by Australian-built ferry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CEUTA, Spain (AP) _ The record for the fastest Atlantic crossing
by a commercial passenger vessel has been broken by an
Australian-built ferry, the company said Wednesday
	   The 91-meter (yard) ``Catalonia'' arrived in the Spanish enclave
city of Ceuta in north Africa around 10:00 p.m (20:00 GMT) Tuesday,
clocking an average speed of 40 knots during it's cross-Atlantic
sprint that began in New York at 0035gmt on Sunday, said Ivonne
Sentis, spokeswoman for Buquebus, an Argentine-Uruguayan company
which owns the ferry.
	   Hoverspeed Great Britain set the previous record with an average
speed of 36.65 knots in 1990. Both ships were built by Incat
Australia.
	   Winning the record carries with it the Hales Trophy, donated by
British Member of Parliament Harold Hales in 1933, and first held
by the Italian Liner Rez which set a speed of 29 knots in the same
year.
	   To qualify for a record attempt the ships must not refuel en
route.
	   Within the next few days, the 450-ton catamaran is due to make
its way around southern Spain and up the eastern coast to the city
of Barcelona.
	   The ferry, that has room for 900 passengers and 240 cars, is to
work the route between Barcelona and the Mediterranean resort
island of Mallorca from June 15.
	   It is scheduled to make that far less demanding crossing in
about three hours.

EU Commission set to approve relaxation of British beef ban
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be UPDATED after decision, expected by 1100 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission on Wednesday
was expected to back the lifting of a worldwide ban on most British
beef exports that was imposed more than two years ago at the height
of Europe's ``mad cow'' scare.
	   The 20-member European Union executive body was set to rule that
all beef and beef products from cattle born after Aug. 1, 1996,
will be free for export. That would cover most potential beef
exports.
	   ``The British government made great efforts in the eradication''
of mad cow disease, Commission President Jacques Santer said. ``I
think it will be the next step, to lift the ban.''
	   Even if the Commission approves the relaxation of the ban, the
EU's complex decision-making process means it could still take
months before British beef is back on foreign markets.
	   A decision to drop the ban is expected to be approved by a panel
of veterinary experts that is scheduled to meet Friday. Those
specialists are divided and if they cannot agree, the issue will be
put to a vote at a meeting of EU agriculture ministers, probably in
July.
	   Germany in particular is wary about letting British beef back
onto its markets, fearing that lingering mad cow fears among
consumers could again drive down the price of all beef.
	   The EU slapped a global ban on British beef exports on March 27,
1996, after the British government acknowledged a possible link
between a brain-wasting cattle ailment officially known as bovine
spongiform encephalopathy and an equally fatal human condition,
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
	   Fears that eating mad-cow tainted beef could cause humans to
contract CJD provoked a crisis in the beef industry across Europe
and cattle prices plummeted.
	   Although some animals in other European nations have contracted
the disease, the overwhelming majority of mad cow cases have been
in Britain. The outbreak was blamed on the practice of feeding
cattle the ground remains of sheep and other animals.
	   Britain banned such feed on Aug. 1, 1996, and now claims all
cattle born after that ban are free from the disease. Britain also
slaughtered 3 million cattle judged at risk and forbade the sale of
cattle parts thought most likely to harbor the disease.
	   The first relaxation of the ban came two weeks ago, when the EU
allowed exports of beef from Northern Ireland, where a special
computer tracking system allowed herds to be certified
disease-free.
	   Before the ban, Britain's beef exports were worth 5 billion
pounds (dlrs 8.1 billion) a year.

Ruling party subcommittee wants to revalue Japanese yen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix slug &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with chairman confirming idea under consideration;
EDITS thruout to conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A ruling party subcommittee agreed Wednesday to
study revaluing the Japanese currency to make it more competitive
as an international currency, the committee's chairman said.
	   Hideyuki Aizawa said the Liberal Democratic Party's 30-member
subcommittee on denomination met for the first time Wednesday and
agreed to make a proposal to the government by the end of
September.
	   He said the committee wanted to revalue the yen at roughly one
yen to the U.S. dollar as a means of boosting confidence in the yen
as an international currency alongside the dollar and Europe's
euro.
	   The dollar currently buys about 140 yen.
	   The subcommittee hopes that the government eventually would
eventually draft a bill to revalue the yen by 2001, Aizawa said.
	   It remains uncertain, however, if the idea would ever make it to
a vote in Parliament. Lawmakers have floated such proposals in the
past, only to see them shot down by the powerful Finance Ministry,
which has called a new yen unnecessary and disruptive.

 &UR; SINGAPORE: the day.

<TEXT>
	   The growing realization that the crisis will be deeper and
longer than originally expected has begun to affect Singapore, an
island of 3.1 million residents with few resources except its
highly trained workforce and modern infrastructure geared toward
attracting investment.
	   Government predictions have not matched the mounting private
sector forecasts that Singapore will fall into a recession or a
significant slowdown this year, although record unemployment has
already been acknowledged.
	   A stagnant property sector, concerns about undisclosed bank
exposures to regional bad loans and the weakening Asian currency
markets have contributed to the rapid slide of Singapore's markets
in the past two weeks.
	   There was increasing speculation by market players Wednesday
over whether China will devalue its yuan and Hong Kong will abandon
its fixed currency peg against the U.S. dollar.
	   Uncertainty over the direction of the Japanese yen, and growing
indications about Singapore's declining economy also dampened
sentiment. Instead of shopping for bargains, foreign investors
simply sold what shares they had.
	   Media and property group Singapore Press Holdings Ltd., widely
seen as a proxy for the Singapore economy, was the biggest price
loser among index-linked stocks, hitting an all-time low of 11.70
Singapore dollars (dlrs 6.80) on volume of 426,000 shares, before
recovering by a few cents.
	   Equity markets were down across the region.
	   Dealers said attention was focused on Hong Kong, where the
benchmark Hang Seng index had dived.

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Three leading South Korean companies
have joined in a dlrs 2.6 million joint venture to search for
copper in Australia, company officials said Wednesday.
	   Samsung, Hyundai and Daewoo will join in the search along with
South Korea's state-run Korea Resources Corp. and Australia's
Malachite Resources N.N. and LFB Resources N.L.
	   Korea Resources Corp. entered into a 50-50 joint venture with
the two Australian concerns in February. It now has to split its 50
percent share equally with the three new Korean companies.
	   The latest deal calls for all six parties to form a consortium
to search for copper in Yeobal, 350 kilometers (210 miles)
northwest of Sydney, for the next five years, the officials said.
	   Preliminary tests indicate the area has a commercially feasible
copper deposit, they said. If confirmed, the joint venture partners
will mine the ore.
	   South Korea does not produce copper. It imported 883,000 tons of
copper worth dlrs 1.2 billion last year. Its 1998 copper imports
are expected to reach 1.2 million tons worth dlrs 1.5 billion.

Iranian paper stops publishing after press violation charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A new Iranian newspaper has stopped
publication after authorities charged it with frequently violating
press ethics, other newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   The liberal Gozaresh-e-Baz was charged by the Press Supervisory
Board, and its case was forwarded Tuesday to the Justice Ministry
for review, the Iran Daily said.
	   A court case could follow and the newspaper may lose its license
if it is found guilty.
	   Another newspaper, Salam, quoted Gozaresh-e-Baz's director
Mohammad Mahdavi Khorrami as saying he had voluntarily stopped
publishing the paper until a final verdict.
	   The action against Gozaresh-e-Baz, or ``Open Report,'' is seen
as a setback for the press freedom that has been allowed by
moderate President Mohammad Khatami since he took office in August.
	   The Farsi-language newspaper started publishing only last month.
	   The English-language Iran News quoted a Culture Ministry
official, Ahmad Borqani, as saying that the newspaper ``has
followed quite an inappropriate path from the beginning of its
publication to the present day.''
	   Borqani said the paper had also printed ``a false report''
claiming that some Iranian officials had transferred money to
overseas bank accounts. Borqani said such a report is ``aimed at
disturbing public opinion and is against our national interests.''
	   Iran's constitution forbids the media from ``propagating
destructive and anti-Islamic attitudes.''

Despite hard times, Thais planning to bet big on World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Despite a crippling economic crisis
that has left many people in dire straits, Thais are planning to
bet more money than ever on the World Cup soccer tournament,
according to a survey released Wednesday.
	   Although Thailand's team didn't qualify, the tournament, which
kicks off Wednesday in France, will be a boon to a range of Thai
businesses, both legal and underground, according to a survey by
the Thai Farmers Bank Research Center.
	   Thais will bet about 30 billion baht (dlrs 700 million)
nationwide, a significant increase from the amount bet on the
previous World Cup played in the United States in 1994, the survey
said.
	   Bangkok respondents to the survey said they were putting aside
an average of 38,860 baht (dlrs 903) to bet, up 35 percent from an
average of 28,740 baht (dlrs 668) last time.
	   More than 57 percent said they would wager with their savings,
while about 24 percent said they would use savings and borrow
money. About 18 percent said they would work overtime or find an
extra job to earn money to bet on the World Cup.
	   Aside from bookmakers, several legal businesses will also get a
boost from the event, the research center said.
	   Sales and use of communications equipment will be on the rise,
as fans trade information by mobile phones, computers and pagers,
the center said.
	   Newspapers should see sales increase, and pubs and restaurants
with big-screen televisions should also see more businesses, the
survey said.
	   Sales of instant noodles and coffee should also perk up as fans
stay up late at night to watch games on television because of the
time difference.

World Cup: Italy asks FIFA to replace sick striker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ With striker Fabrizio Ravanelli suffering
from an infection in his right lung, Italy has formally applied to
FIFA to replace him on the team roster with Parma forward Enrico
Chiesa, an official said Wednesday.
	   ``On the basis of the doctor's report, coach Cesare Maldini
decided to begin the proper steps to have FIFA authorize the
replacement of Ravanelli with Chiesa on the Italian team,''
federation spokesman Stefano Balducci said.
	   All the necessary documentation has been filed with soccer's
governing body, he said.
	   Ravanelli was responding well to treatment, but will require a
rest period of at least a week to avoid the danger of developing
full-blown pneumonia, Balducci said.
	   Suffering from fever and cough, he was taken to the hospital in
nearby Creil on Tuesday. He will remain at the team's base camp for
possible examination by FIFA doctors, Balducci said.
	   Regulations allow for last-minute changes among sick or injured
players until 1530 GMT, the kickoff time of the inaugural World Cup
match between Brazil and Scotland.
	   Chiesa is already in the Italian camp as the 23rd player.
	   He had been put on alert as a substitute for forward Alessandro
Del Piero, who has just recovered from a right thigh strain, and
then for Moreno Torricelli, who bruised his foot last week but
resumed practicing Tuesday. Now Chiesa has a third chance to stay
with the team.

Hong Kong shares plunge on weak yen, high local interest rates
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with closing figures; ADDS comments from chief
executive and traders

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong shares ended at a three-year low
Wednesday, with foreign mutual funds dumping stocks on concerns
about rising domestic interest rates, weakening regional currencies
and of a possible devaluation of China's currency, the yuan.
	   Following Tuesday's 2.3-percent slump, the blue-chip Hang Seng
Index further tumbled 412.09 points, or 4.9 percent, to close at
7,979.37.
	   Turnover was 7.15 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 916 million),
compared with 3.28 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 420 million) for
the half-day session Tuesday. Trading was suspended Tuesday morning
because of severe rainstorms.
	   The closing level marked the first time in over three years that
the Hang Seng Index ended below the key 8,000-point level.
	   That sent a majority of the blue-chip companies to their lowest
levels this year.
	   ``It was mostly panic-selling by the big fund houses. They were
reducing their weightings on Hong Kong stocks,'' said Francis Lun,
research analyst at Pacific Challenge Securities Ltd.
	   ``Under such stock-clearing selling when the houses dump shares
regardless of the price, share prices nose-dived, especially in the
early afternoon,'' he added
	   The weakening yen dragged down most Southeast Asian currencies
Wednesday and compounded fears of a possible yuan devaluation,
whcih would leave the Hong Kong dollar's firm peg to the U.S.
dollar in a precarious position.
	   Fueling the fear was mainland central bank governor Dai
Xianglong's remark Tuesday that the falling Japanese yen would
exert a negative impact on China's foreign trade, though the
People's Bank of China official reiterated a pledge to keep the
Chinese currency stable.
	   Hong Kong's Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa also insisted
Wednesday the government will keep its currency peg, despite
increasing calls for action to help Hong Kong fight a liquidity
crunch.
	   He said at a conference floating the currency would ``cause
speculative attacks against the Hong Kong dollar and increase
interest rates.''
	   The news pushed the benchmark three-month interest rate up to
10.375 percent in early afternoon, up from 9.25 percent early
Wednesday. The one-month rate soared to 11.0 percent from 9.625
percent.
	   Traders said the interest rate surge further hurt market
sentiment. The high interest rates are making it harder for
companies to borrow and eating into their profits.
	   Minutes before the market's close, Tung told reporters that the
government will not dip into its reserves to keep financial markets
from sliding further before Hong Kong is a free market.
	   Banking system liquidity has tightened steadily as money has
flowed out of Hong Kong markets, and with markets here weak,
commercial banks have been unwilling long-term lenders.
	   The London-based banking giant HSBC lost 9.0 Hong Kong dollars
to 181.0.
	   Property stocks Sun Hung Kai Properties lost 1.90 to 30.30, and
Henderson Land lost 2.85 to 23.40.
	   Among conglomerates, Swire Pacific ``A'' lost 2.60 to 22.0, and
Hutchison Whampoa lost 2.0 to 34.0.

Some Kuwait students think Madeleine Albright is an actress
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Some university students in Kuwait think U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is a Hollywood star and
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is a rock singer, a newspaper
reported Wednesday.
	   The newspaper said it quizzed 100 students from different
departments of Kuwait University to test their general knowledge
and came up with ``catastrophic'' results.
	   Students were given multiple choices to identify 32 local, Arab
and international personalities including politicians, discoverers,
writers, and artists.
	   While Ahlam, the singer from neighboring United Arab Emirates,
did very well with all students getting the right answer, 45 of the
respondents thought Albright is an American actress. Thirty-one got
her profession right and 24 said there is no such personality.
	   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan did not fare much better: 59
students said he played soccer for Cameroon. Thirteen said he was a
Communist activist while 23 students identified him correctly. Five
didn't answer at all.
	   Chancellor Kohl was identified by 71 students as a rock and roll
singer, 16 said he is a golf player, four said he was head of state
and nine didn't know.
	   Syrian poet Adonis came out worst: 87 branded him an
international terrorist.

Philippine peso, stocks decline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine peso fell against the
U.S. dollar Wednesday after the release of a Morgan Stanley report
revising downward its regional exchange-rate forecasts for 1998,
dealers said.
	   The dollar averaged 39.775 pesos for the day, up from 39.470
pesos on Tuesday.
	   The peso, which was relatively steady against the dollar in the
morning, fell sharply in afternoon trading, with the dollar
clipping 40 pesos. The dollar's high for the day was 40.270 pesos.
	   Dealers said the Morgan Stanley report triggered relatively
heavy demand for dollars, with volume rising to dlrs 164.5 million
from dlrs 77.7 million on Tuesday.
	   Morgan Stanley's report forecast the peso would fall to 47 pesos
to the dollar by the end of the year. Since the currency crisis
erupted last July, the peso's lowest level was 46.50 pesos per
dollar, touched in January. The past six months have seen the peso
trade in a range of 37 pesos to 41 pesos per dollar.
	   Morgan Stanley sees inflation averaging 10 percent this year,
higher than the government's target of 7.5 percent to 8.5 percent.
	   With the dollar last traded at 40.060 pesos, dealers expect the
losses to be extended in the coming session.
	   Particular attention will be paid to any yen-supportive comments
made at the Group of Seven finance ministers' meeting in Paris
later Wednesday.
	   In stock trading, shares moved lower as a dearth of positive,
market-moving news sidelined most investors, traders said.
	   Concern over the future of most Asian economies continues to
weigh down regional stocks and will likely do so for the
foreseeable future, they said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 6.62 points,
or 0.3 percent, to 1,917.87, after losing 6.10 points on Tuesday.
	   It was the third straight loss for the main index, bringing its
total decline to 39.89 points during the period.
	   ``There's no incentive for investors to come into the market,''
said Edwin Siao, trader for institutional sales of Abacus
Securities Corp.

Government orders improved control of state assets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Alarmed by the steady siphoning off of state
assets by unscrupulous company managers and local officials, the
government announced Wednesday tougher financial regulations.
	   Acknowledging what already is known to be a serious problem, the
circular from the State Council, or Cabinet, orders local
governments as well as the central bank and courts to do what they
can to prevent further theft and waste of state property.
	   To meet its goal of reforming its bloated and inefficient
state-owned enterprises within three years, the government is
selling off many small- and medium-size firms.
	   Company managers and local officials have sought to cash in on
the process by setting up dummy bank accounts and fake companies to
hold such assets for their personal use and to avoid paying back
their debts, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   The State Council has ordered banks to crack down on
unauthorized accounts and to improve accounting oversight and asset
valuation.
	   It also warned local courts to be fair and honest in dealing
with cases of fraud and waste _ alluding to widespread corruption
in the judicial system.
	   Those found guilty of violating the new orders or of causing
economic losses by failing to enforce them would be severely
punished, it said.

Businessman killed in Siberian town
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES that Zinin's company linked to Berezovsky's Sibneft
in graf 4, ADDS new details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian businessman was killed on his way to
work Wednesday by an unidentified gunman in what appeared to be an
organized crime killing, according to news reports.
	   Yuri Zinin, the head of Sibneft Company was shot in the back as
he walked out of his apartment building in the town of
Leninsk-Kuzntesky in the Kemerovo region of central Siberia,
Russian news agencies quoted local police as saying.
	   The killer fled leaving his gun behind _ a trademark manner of
Russian underworld's hitmen.
	   Zinin's company is a local branch of one of Russia's largest oil
producers, Sibneft, controlled by controversial business mogul
Boris Berezovsky. It runs a network of gas stations in the region
and also deals in coal. Kemerovo is one of Russia's main
coal-mining regions.
	   Police launched a search for the killer who fled. Officials
wouldn't comment on possible motives for the murder.
	   There are hundreds of contract murders in Russia every year as
mobsters fight for control of profitable businesses. Only a small
number of such killings are ever solved.
	   The small town of Leninsk-Kuznetsky became known nationwide last
year, when the city mayor was arrested on tax fraud and
embezzlement charges. Mayor Gennady Konyakhin, also accused of
being linked to the mob, is in custody awaiting trial.
	   According to the ITAR-Tass news agency, a tax police officer and
a local coal mine director have been killed in the town during the
past year and another coal mine manager survived an attempt on his
life.

Iran and Kuwait sign deal to expand security, drug cooperation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran and Kuwait signed an agreement
Wednesday to expand cooperation in security, immigration and
anti-drug smuggling operations, Iranian radio reported.
	   The agreement was signed by Kuwait's Interior Minister Sheik
Mohammad al-Khaled al-Sabah, and his Iranian counterpart Abdollah
Nouri.
	   Sheik Khaled arrived in Iran Tuesday for a three-day visit, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency said.
	   Wednesday's agreement signals improving ties, which had grown
tense during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War because of Kuwait's
financial support for Baghdad.
	   But Iran's neutral stand during the 1991 Gulf War that ended a
seven-month Iraqi occupation of Kuwait brought the two Gulf
countries closer.
	   Relations warmed further with Iran's election last May of
moderate President Mohammad Khatami.
	   Since then, economic cooperation has grown, and visits of
officials and legislators have increased.

Investments in Philippines fall 51 percent in first five months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine Board of Investments
approved a total of 133.65 billion pesos (dlrs 3.4 billion) worth
of projects in the first five months of 1998, 51 percent less than
in the same period a year earlier.
	   BOI managing head Melito Salazar said Wednesday the downturn in
investments is the result of ``temporary belt-tightening among
local firms'' to cope with the Asian financial crisis.
	   Despite the overall slowdown, foreign equity in the projects
approved for the period rose 43 percent to 25.98 billion pesos
(dlrs 666 million) from a year earlier.
	   ``This is significant because other Asian countries have
experienced negative foreign interest in the wake of last year's
crisis,'' he said.
	   The Philippines has not been as badly affected by the currency
crisis as some other Asian countries.
	   A total of 118 projects were approved by the BOI in the first
five months, Salazar said.
	   The sectors that attracted the largest investments were energy,
construction and housing, public utilities, tourism, and
infrastructure and industrial services.
	   Much of foreign interest came from Hong Kong, the United States,
Japan, the Virgin Islands, Canada, and Britain.

Palestinian stabbed to death; Israeli co-worker suspected
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Palestinian worker was stabbed to death in a
Jewish settlement in the West Bank on Wednesday, apparently by his
Israeli co-worker, police said.
	   The motive for the killing was not yet known, police spokeswoman
Linda Menuhin said.
	   Both workers were employed by an Israeli truck owner who
delivers soft drinks to settlements in the West Bank.
	   The stabbing took place in the back of the truck while it was
stopped in the Maale Ephraim settlement.
	   The owner returned to the truck after a few minutes' absence,
and found the Palestinian lying on the floor, bleeding from a
stomach wound. The co-worker had the knife in his hand, Israel
Radio said.
	   The victim was rushed to the local first aid station but died
shortly afterward.
	   The names of the dead man and his co-worker were not immediately
made public. The Palestinian man was from the Shuafat refugee camp
in Jerusalem, police said.
	   Police were questioning the suspect, Menuhin said.

Thailand transvestites preying on Japanese tourists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Two suspected members of a Thai
transvestite gang that targets and robs Japanese tourists have been
arrested and charged with attempted robbery, police said Wednesday.
	   Prachak Trinate, a transvestite, and Sakchai Sae-ung, his
driver, were arrested Sunday in downtown Bangkok by tourist police
as they were trying to convince a Japanese man to go for a ride in
Sakchai's taxi.
	   Transvestite robbers frequently flirt with their potential
victims and then encourage them to get in a taxi driven by an
accomplice, said the police officer who spoke only on condition of
anonymity.
	   ``For some reason the transvestites find Japanese easy to
fool,'' said the officer.
	   In the past year, tourist police have logged over 40 cases
involving the gang, of which all except two victims were Japanese
men, the officer said.
	   He said sometimes the transvestites pretend to be lost and ask
their victim to take them to a certain destination. Once in the
cab, the robbery takes place.
	   The robbers immediately change clothes or hair styles after the
crime, the officer said.

Singapore dollar drops, stock market tumbles to 7-year low
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; COMBINES urgent series. INSERTS quotes.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Fearing the local economy is worse than the
government admits, foreign sellers bailed out of Singapore markets
in a frenzy Wednesday, and the benchmark index plunged 4.4 percent
to its lowest level in seven years.
	   The key Straits Times Industrial Index easily breached a key
support level of 1100 in early trading and fell 49 points to close
at 1067.81, a seven-year low. The Singapore dollar also hit a
four-month low against the U.S. currency.
	   The index's previous low this year was on Jan. 12, when it hit
1073.47 in what was considered the peak of the regional economic
crisis.
	   But fears are growing that Singapore _ a hub for transferring
money into, out of, and around the financially weak region _ is now
set to suffer more of the consequences of the Asian economic
crisis. It mostly sailed unscathed through the tumult last year.
	   ``Everyone knows that we have benefited from our neighbors'
growth, and now we have to suffer along with them,'' Philip Wee, a
regional economist with Standard Chartered Bank, told Dow Jones
Newswires.
	   Government television, which has given no explanation in its
market closing bulletins for the rapid slide of the past two weeks,
attributed Wednesday's plunge to heavy selling of the Japanese and
Hong Kong currencies amid fears that China may devalue its yuan and
Hong Kong will abandon its fixed currency peg against the U.S.
dollar.
	   The Singapore dollar wasn't spared either, breaking through the
1.72 level against the U.S dollar for the first time since early
February. The U.S. dollar was quoted at a four-month high of 1.7215
Singapore dollars in morning trading, and fluctuated within one
Singapore cent through the day.
	   The growing realization that the crisis will be deeper and
longer than originally expected has begun to affect Singapore, an
island of 3.1 million residents without resources besides its
technically trained people. It also has a modern infrastructure
geared toward attracting investment, building new technologies and
handling money.
	   Government predictions have not matched the mounting private
sector forecasts that Singapore will fall into a recession or have
zero growth this year, although record unemployment has already
been acknowledged.
	   ``One or two political leaders have come up to warn about
retrenchments this year. That is probably the clearest sign that we
are headed for some pretty turbulent waters,'' Chia Yew Boon,
research director at Santander Investment Securities, told Dow
Jones Newswires.
	   A stagnant property sector, concerns about undisclosed bank
exposures to regional bad loans and the weakening Asian currency
markets contributed to the rapid slide of Singapore's markets in
the past two weeks.
	   But instead of bargain hunting, foreign investors simply sold
off the shares they had.
	   Media and property group Singapore Press Holdings Ltd., widely
seen as a proxy for the Singapore economy, was the biggest price
loser among index-linked stocks, hitting an all-time low of 11.70
Singapore dollars (dlrs 6.80) on volume of 426,000 shares, before
recovering by a few cents.

World Cup: Japan's standout midfielder impossible to interview
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ It's easy to spot Hidetoshi Nakata.
He's the one with the mean long passes, cool and cocky demeanor and
his hair dyed a bright copper orange.
	   The 21-year-old midfielder, who has grown practically overnight
into Japan's biggest cover-boy, draws screams from the stands fit
for a rock star every time he touches the ball during a game.
	   Nakata is also the only player on the Japanese World Cup team
who refuses to talk to reporters.
	   Every day after practice in this quaint resort, famous for its
therapeutic hot springs, the players are surrounded by a throng of
eager journalists. The players, with the exception of Nakata, are
all surprisingly patient and cordial.
	   With rumors stirring about European clubs' interest in Nakata,
the 1997 Asian Player of the Year, now signed with J-League's
Bellmare Hiratsuka, would top any reporter's list for interviews.
	   But the Japanese reporters have long given up. And Nakata _ who
has represented his country on several youth teams as well as the
Atlanta Olympics in 1996 _ is able to pass them by with a bare nod
straight to the bus that takes him back to the hotel.
	   In the past week, Nakata made himself available to the media
once, and only to a group of Argentine reporters. When this
reporter tried to join the group, Nakata turned with a stern look
and raised his palm, motioning, ``No.''
	   Team spokeswoman Yuki Tanaka said Nakata only speaks to foreign
media, and even that is extremely rare.
	   ``He is very pure,'' Tanaka said apologetically.
	   The tabloid press, which dominates sports reporting in Japan, is
infamous for sensational reports, even twisting quotes and
fabricating news.
	   In an unusual move in a society that so values harmony it frowns
upon litigation, Nakata is suing the writer of an unauthorized
biography, a hot-seller back home.
	   Nakata also has a vulnerable side. He was unable to take part in
training with his team for a week last month because of an
allergy-related skin rash caused by stress and exhaustion.
	   Nakata, who has scored a career six goals in international
matches, also has a penchant for one-word replies.
	   He was asked by the Argentine reporters last week what he
thought of Maradona, according to Tanaka. Nakata's reply:
``Nothing.''
	   In a statement released through the team, Nakata said: ``It's
naturally important to win the World Cup as a team, but I think
it's most important to get my own condition at its best and reach
my true potential.''
	   ``As for my opponents, I can't tell who's good or bad until I
play them, so I'm not going to worry too much about them but
concentrate on giving it all I've got.''
	   Besides reporters, Nakata hates vegetables. But his love for
Armani is well-known.
	   The star, whose used sneakers recently sold for 1.72 million yen
(dlrs 12,000) at a Tokyo charity auction, has started a fad of oval
Armani glasses (which Nakata only wears off the pitch). These days,
streets in Japan are filled with Nakata lookalikes.
	   ``You may think Nakata is the main player on this team,'' coach
Takeshi Okada told reporters earlier this week. ``But for us, the
entire team is important.''

Cabinet endorses high interest rates for Malaysia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A simmering row over the direction
of Malaysia's monetary policy may have been defused Wednesday with
the Cabinet endorsing current interest rates.
	   At the weekly meeting of government ministers, Finance Minister
Anwar Ibrahim informed the Cabinet that the government would retain
interest rates at current levels, according to a government source.
	   The official said the endorsement was reached after a brief
discussion at the meeting that was also attended by Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, who has repeatedly differed with Anwar on
monetary policy.
	   Anwar, who is also deputy prime minister, has backed the central
bank-prescribed high rates, saying these were needed to prevent a
run on reserves and spiraling inflation. Mahathir has said the
tight monetary policy and high lending rates were hurting
businesses and stifling economic growth.
	   Although both Mahathir and Anwar have denied there was a rift
between them on economic policy, markets have reacted nervously to
the contradictory signals.

Iran and Kuwait sign deal to expand security, drug cooperation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran and Kuwait signed an agreement
Wednesday to expand cooperation in security, immigration and
anti-drug smuggling operations, Iranian radio reported.
	   The agreement was signed Kuwaiti Interior Minister Sheik
Mohammad al-Khaled al-Sabah and his Iranian counterpart, Abdollah
Nouri.
	   Sheik Khaled arrived in Iran Tuesday for a three-day visit, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency said.
	   Wednesday's agreement signals improving ties, which had grown
tense during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War because of Kuwait's
financial support for Baghdad.
	   But Iran's neutral stand during the 1991 Gulf War that ended a
seven-month Iraqi occupation of Kuwait brought the two Gulf
countries closer.

Villa striker apologizes for fracas with girlfriend
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: similar version moved on some news circuits &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Aston Villa striker Stan Collymore has apologized
for punching and kicking his celebrity girlfriend in a Paris bar
during a World Cup party.
	   Ulrika Jonsson, 30, a Swedish-born television personality,
returned to her home in England following the incident Monday
night. She told reporters on Wednesday: ``I don't want to talk
about it.''
	   Collymore's adviser and agent Paul Stretford confirmed witness
reports, including that of a Scottish Television news reporter,
that the player hit and kicked Miss Jonsson at a late night World
Cup party for Scotland fans on Monday.
	   Scottish Television reporter Martin Geissler said Collymore
``dragged her out of the bar into a back room, pushed her to the
ground and aimed kicks at her head. She was lying on the ground
screaming and bar staff then grabbed Collymore and threw him out.''
	   Stretford read a statement issued by Collymore, 27, in which he
admitted that ``a stupid and silly argument had developed
throughout the course of the day.''
	   ``My actions were totally reprehensible, something I am not
proud of and finding very difficult to come to terms with. In a fit
of petulant temper I struck out at the girl I love and immediately
regretted my actions, but by then it was too late.
	   ``I could hide behind a facade of excuses and no comments but
petulance, jealousy and possibly having too much to drink are the
real reasons behind this regrettable and avoidable incident.''
	   Collymore also confirmed that he had been head-butted by someone
in the bar, and he apologized to that unidentified man ``for
causing him to feel that he had to take such action.''
	   Collymore said he had privately apologized to Miss Jonsson.
	   Collymore, 27, played in some of England's World Cup qualifying
games but was left off the squad for the finals in France.
	   He was Britain's most expensive player when he transferred from
Nottingham Forest to Liverpool for 8.5 million pounds (dlrs 13.8
million) in 1995. Collymore never lived up to his billing and later
moved for 7 million pounds (dlrs 11.4 million) to Aston Villa,
where he also has been a disappointment.

Russian markets hit by Asia and concerns about lack of aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian stocks took a double beating Wednesday,
dropping because of market falls in Asia and fears that Western
governments won't bail Moscow out of its financial mess, traders
said.
	   The Russia Trading System (RTS) index fell 5.8 percent in the
first 90 minutes of trading, dropping to 185.13 compared to 196.45
on Tuesday.
	   Volume was light, but traders said Russian financial
institutions were selling aggressively.
	   ``It looks like its going to be a pretty bad day,'' said Dmitry
Kryukov, a trader at Renaissance Capital brokerage in Moscow.
	   The Russian economy is stagnating, with little or no growth in
most areas. The government has promised deep cuts in public
spending and improved tax collection to try to improve the
situation.
	   There were also concerns that the drop in the market could
revive pressure on the ruble. The government has ruled out
devaluation, but the Russian Central Bank has limited resources
with which to defend the currency.
	   The Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations were to discuss
Russia's financial problems at a meeting Wednesday in Paris, but
people close to the talks said that a full-fledged aid package was
unlikely.
	   The Russian stock market has already fallen more than 50
perecent since the beginning of the year. Few big investors are
ready to risk any more money in Russia until emerging markets
settle down around the world, dealers said.

Palestinians called to `mobilize' against Jewish settlement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By HILARY APPELMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A top Palestinian official called Wednesday for
the Palestinian people to ``mobilize to defend Jerusalem'' against
Jewish settlement.
	   In Jerusalem, Israeli troops dragged away American and Canadian
demonstrators holding a sit-in to protest expansion of a Jewish
settlement in the Arab neighborhood of Silwan. Some protesters were
beaten and kicked as they were dragged through the dust by their
arms and legs.
	   Palestinian Cabinet Secretary Ahmed Abdel Rahman reacted angrily
to the Israel Interior Ministry's decision Tuesday to approve the
construction of new housing for a Jewish religious seminary in east
Jerusalem on land originally slated for an Arab girls school.
	   ``This decision by the Israeli government is a continuation of
the Israeli aggression toward the city of Jerusalem in order to
make it a Jewish city and deport all the Arab citizens from
Jerusalem,'' Abdel Rahman told The Associated Press in the Gaza
Strip.
	   ``The people have to mobilize to defend Jerusalem and the holy
places.''
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat called the Israeli decision
``another violation'' of the Israel-Palestinian peace agreements,
which say neither side should make unilateral changes to the status
quo before a final peace settlement that would determine the fate
of Jerusalem.
	   Settlers, backed by funding from supporters such as U.S.
multi-millionaire Irving Moskowitz, have recently intensified their
campaign to increase the Jewish presence in traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem, which the Palestinians claim as a future capital.
	   On Monday, settlers moved into five apartments in a pair of
buildings in Silwan, setting off clashes with Palestinians.
	   About 50 protesters from the United States and Canada, mostly
members of Christian human rights groups, held a sit-in outside the
buildings Wednesday that was roughly dispersed by Israeli border
police. Palestinian residents of the neighborhood watched from
surrounding rooftops, and police said some residents pelted them
with stones.
	   ``I came here to look at the situation _ I'm appalled at what
I've seen,'' said Michael Kauffman, a Canadian who was dragged by
his arms and legs.
	   ``We just wanted to show solidarity with the Palestinians who
had their homes taken away by the settlers,'' said Lucy Mayer of
New York.
	   Police said the demonstration was held without a permit, and
that several demonstrators were arrested.
	   Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
War and later annexed it.
	   The United States has asked Israel for a time-out in settlement
expansion to help restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, stalled
since Israel began another settlement project on a disputed east
Jerusalem hilltop in March 1997.
	   Also Wednesday, the Israeli army said that a Palestinian shot
and killed by Israeli troops on Tuesday night had been planting a
bomb outside a Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip. A second man
involved escaped, the army said.
	   Palestinian police identified the dead man as Aboud Bardawil,
22, and said a joint Israeli-Palestinian investigation into the
incident was underway.
	   In a separate incident, a Palestinian worker was stabbed to
death in the Jewish West Bank of Maale Ephraim on Wednesday,
apparently by his Israeli co-worker, Israeli police said. The
motive for the killing was not immediately known.

Lomu trims down for England
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMILTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Jonah Lomu may look a little less
imposing to England's struggling rugby players, but a new diet has
left him hungry for more test action.
	   Lomu revealed he had trimmed down from 120 kilograms (265lbs) to
113 kilograms (249lbs) in a few months ahead of this season. He
will take the field against the English, who crumbled to a woeful
76-0 loss against Australia last week, on Saturday for New Zealand
A.
	   All Blacks coach John Hart has put Lomu on notice that he must
perform Saturday or miss out on the June 20 test match.
	   Lomu destroyed England in the 1995 World Cup semifinal, running
over the top of Mike Catt in one sensational play.
	   Faced with Hart's ultimatum, Lomu has, in turn, put the English
on notice.
	   ``I'm lighter now than I've ever been, feeling younger at the
moment,'' Lomu said Wednesday. ``That helps with the turning around
and getting around the field quicker, which is a plus for me.''
	   Lomu said he had given up much of the greasy and fattening
takeaway food that he loved so much.
	   ``You know, I indulge myself sometimes, I go for takeaway food
and things like that, but I've now gone off some of those,'' Lomu
said. ``I eat more rice now than I've ever had in my life, I feel
really good. When I get up I have more energy and I look forward to
another day.''
	   His new eating habits helped with the kidney disorder that
forced him out for almost all of last season.
	   If Lomu comes through Saturday's game in good shape, he will
play the Dunedin test a week later.
	   ``I just want a decent 80 minutes of footie,'' Lomu said. ``I
have to go out there and please the selectors, and have a go. I've
got to put pressure on myself.''

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - A Kiev district court ordered a Ukrainian
newspaper to pay 200,000 hryvna (about dlrs 100,000) to compensate
an opposition leader for moral damage, the politician's attorney
said Wednesday.
	   Julia Timoshenko, a top official of the opposition Hromada
movement, sued the Ukraina Moloda newspaper following a Feb. 4
article regarding a church award she allegedly was to receive, her
attorney Viktor Nykazakov said.
	   The order of St. Barbara, ``named after the beaten and beheaded
Christian, was meant for a simple church warden and not for the
canonized oppositioner Timoshenko,'' the newspaper wrote, according
to the Interfax news agency.
	   Nykazakov said the court ruled that the story itself and a photo
collage accompanying the article ``did not correspond to reality''
and ordered the newspaper to publish a photo provided by
Timoshenko, in addition to the fine.
	   The newspaper has the right to appeal the decision to a higher
court.
	   Timoshenko said she plans to transfer the money to the Ukrainian
Orthodox Church.
	   ``The publication, first of all, offended the church, and it
would only be just to use the 200,000 hryvna for the benefit of
believers,'' Interfax quoted her as saying.

Consumer group plans lawsuit on water rationing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Consumer groups in the Malaysian
capital are planning to bring a rare class-action suit against
local authorities for failing to provide water to residents, a
spokesman for the groups said Wednesday.
	   The suit against the state government of Selangor, which is
responsible for supplying the area of the capital, would be on
behalf of the residents and could be as much as half a million
ringgit (dlrs 128,000), said A. Jayaseelan.
	   ``We are now doing all the legal research,'' said Jayaseelan,
director of the Selangor and Federal Territory Consumer
Association. The other group involved in the proposed suit is the
Federation of Malaysian Consumers Associations.
	   The final demand for compensation would be decided after people
file claims, said Jayaseelan. Consumer activists had received some
claims and were now involved in a signature campaign for the suit,
he said.
	   The suit, to be filed in about two months, was aimed at proving
that the water shortage was a crisis caused by negligence of the
utilities and not necessarily by the drought in Southeast Asia
brought on by El Nino.
	   Nearly 2 million residents of Kuala Lumpur and its suburbs have
been on severe water rationing for three months and some
neighborhoods receive water only once a week.
	   The decision to file a suit came after the police denied
permission to consumer groups to hold a meeting with residents to
discuss the water crisis.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Some university students in Kuwait think U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is a Hollywood star and
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is a rock singer, a newspaper
reported Wednesday.
	   The Al-Rai Al-Amm daily said it quizzed 100 students from
different departments of Kuwait University to test their general
knowledge and came up with ``catastrophic'' results.
	   Students were given multiple choices to identify 32 local, Arab
and international personalities including politicians, discoverers,
writers, and artists.
	   While Ahlam, the singer from neighboring United Arab Emirates,
did very well with all students getting the right answer, 45 of the
respondents thought Albright is an American actress. Thirty-one got
her profession right and 24 said there is no such personality.
	   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan did not fare much better: 59
students said he played soccer for Cameroon. Thirteen said he was a
Communist activist while 23 students identified him correctly. Five
didn't answer at all.
	   Chancellor Kohl was identified by 71 students as a rock 'n' roll
singer, 16 said he is a golf player, four said he was head of state

Air France says agreement reached with striking pilots

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with no immediate comment by the SNPL in 10th graf,

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Air France said Wednesday it had reached an
agreement with striking pilots, ending a walkout that had severely
embarrassed the country in the days leading up to the World Cup.
	   In a statement, Air France said the pilots had agreed to accept
company shares in exchange for salary cuts.
	   The company called for an immediate return to work. But the
airline has said previously it would take three days for service to
return to normal once the strike ended.
	   Just Tuesday night, as World Cup celebrations began in Paris,
negotiations had seemed deadlocked. Pilots had gathered at Charles
de Gaulle airport and agreed to continue the walkout, despite an
appeal by the transport minister to both sides to continue talking.
	   But in talks overnight, an agreement was reached.
	   Jean-Cyril Spinetta, the president of Air France, told France
Info radio Wednesday morning ``this is a compromise that is good
for the company, good for the employees and good for the clients.''
	   But he added that consequences of the strike were ``heavy'' and
that the company had lost a billion francs (dlrs 166 million.)
``Now we have to think of confidence, confidence in Air France,
confidence in its clients,'' he said.
	   ``This global accord is aimed at assuring the development of Air
France by improving its competitiveness with regards to its
rivals,'' he said in a statement.
	   The carrier also said Wednesday it would scrap a two-tier salary
scale, under which new pilots earned less than their colleagues.
The pilots, among the most highly paid in the world, had found this
detrimental to cabin solidarity.
	   The main pilots' union, the SNPL, had no immediate comment.

Indonesian president offers special status to East Timor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to wrap up day's events &QL; 
 &UR; With Indonesia-Troubled Territory; Indonesia-East Timor
 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Protesters in East Timor rejected a
peace offering from Indonesia's new president Wednesday and
thousands in the capital staged another round of demonstrations
against corruption and for higher salaries.
	   Protests, once strictly curbed, have become a daily event in
Indonesia following promises of reform and freedom by new President
B.J. Habibie.
	   In a signal of possible easing of Indonesia's tight control of
East Timor, Habibie said Tuesday he might grant largely symbolic
special status to the troubled territory but said it must stay part
of Indonesia.
	   On Wednesday he signed a decree to free 15 East Timorese
political prisoners.
	   Despite these concessions, about 3,000 students and others
crammed into the campus of the University of East Timor in the
provincial Dili, demanding the right to vote for full independence
from Indonesia, which invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975.
	   Justice Minister Muladi said the 15 East Timorese inmates would
be released as soon as possible.
	   Another dissident would be released from a prison on Indonesia's
main island, Java, bringing to 20 the total number of political
prisoners freed since Habibie took office on May 21.
	   Despite insistent demands by East Timorese activists, rebel
guerrilla leader Xanana Gusmao will remain behind bars. He's
regarded by Indonesia as a violent criminal, not a political
prisoner or freedom fighter.
	   Habibie replaced longtime leader Suharto as president last month
when the old autocrat was forced from office by a wave of protests
and violence.
	   Suharto, who ordered the 1975 invasion, had steadfastly refused
to make any concessions toward East Timor.
	   In Jakarta, about 2,000 factory workers protested outside the
national Parliament for higher salaries and better conditions as
Indonesia's battles the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   The protest comes just days after Habibie signed an
International Labor Organization convention respecting workers
rights.
	   The Indonesian government also said it would ratify United
Nation's human rights conventions against torture and racial
discrimination.
	   Under Suharto, Indonesia was regularly criticised for having a
poor human rights record.
	   Another 200 protesters held a demonstration at the government
social insurance office following accusations of mismanagement and
corruption.
	   More than 500 employees from Indonesia's state-owned flag
carrier Garuda Indonesia, including pilots and cabin crew,
demonstrated outside the airline's headquarters.
	   They demanded it end contracts linked to the family of President
Suharto and said they were worried that cash-strapped Garuda was
planning big layoffs.
	   The protest was the latest example of a growing backlash against
companies perceived to have benefited from collusion, nepotism and
corruption during the Suharto years.
	   Meanwhile, about 1000 employees of Wal Mart stores in Indonesia
demanded to be told if they would soon lose their jobs after a
Indonesian company operating the stores under license from the
U.S.-based retail giant decided to close down its operation.

U.S.-based Chinese dissident claims Chinese prisoners made World
</HEADLINE>
Cup footballs

<TEXT>
	   MACAU (AP) _ Shortly before the opening of World Cup Wednesday
in Paris, an exiled Chinese dissident claimed that Chinese
prisoners had made some of the footballs to be used in the matches.
	   Bao Ge, 34, who served three years in a labor camp in Shanghai,
told a press conference in Macau that he was among Chinese
prisoners forced to make ``make some Adidas footballs.''
	   Some of the balls, he said, were marked ``France 98 FIFA World
Cup, Official Championship Ball.''
	   But a spokesman for Adidas, the World Cup's official football
supplier, denied the allegations, saying the balls the prisoners
made were probably souvenir balls for other companies, not Adidas
footballs for World Cup matches.
	   Peter Csanadi, Adidas' director of global public relations said
in Herzogenaurach, Germany, that the design for the official
football ``wasn't even finalized yet'' when Bao was in prison.
	   He added about 20 other companies were licensed to use the World
Cup logo on souvenir balls.
	   ``We believe (Bao) is acting in good faith,'' he said. ``We know
he is telling the truth,'' about making footballs with the World
Cup logo.
	   ``Either the balls were of these other companies or they were
counterfeit,'' said Csanadi.
	   Bao spent three years in a labor camp for political activism and
has been in exile in the United States since last November, shortly
after Chinese President Jiang Zemin's U.S. visit.
	   ``The guards in the camp compelled the prisoners to work at
least 15 hours a day, or even more. If the prisoners could not meet
the quotas for the day, they were penalized by having to stay up
all night without any sleep,'' Bao said.
	   Bao said he would file a lawsuit in Hong Kong against Adidas for
compesation for his work. He said other Chinese dissidents on exile
will sue the company in Germany and the United States.

Russian railroads to stop carrying military cargo due to
</HEADLINE>
nonpayment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian railroads will suspend shipments of
military cargo starting Thursday because of the military's chronic
failure to pay its transportation bills, the Railways Ministry
announced.
	   By the start of this month, the army's and security agencies'
debt to the railroads had reached 2.3 billion rubles (dlrs 391
million), the ministry said Wednesday, according to the ITAR-Tass
news agency.
	   However, the suspension will not apply to ``strategically
important cargo ensuring Russia's defense,'' the report said. It
did not elaborate.
	   Russia's cash-strapped railroads are among the nation's chronic
tax debtors, and railroad officials blamed their financial troubles
on the military's failure to pay its bills.

World Cup: Injury makes Arendse's dream a nightmare
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VICHY, France (AP) _ South African players have long dreamed of
finally getting the chance to play in a soccer World Cup. For
goalkeeper Andre Arendse, the dream has become a nightmare.
	   Injured in training Monday night, Arendse will likely miss the
tournament. Team officials have called a news conference later
Wednesday on Arendse's condition, but they say privately he is out
because of his damaged left leg.
	   The lanky Fulham F.C. player, who turns 31 later this month, led
South Africa to victory in the 1996 African Nations Cup tournament
but was dropped from the team last year after former coach Clive
Barker resigned.
	   Arendse regained his spot under new coach Philippe Troussier,
who took over in March, but was expected to back up Hans Vonk of
Heerenveen F.C. and Brian Baloyi of local club Kaizer Chiefs at the
World Cup.
	   The news was a lone disappointing note for South African players
lapping up the experience of their first World Cup. Bafana Bafana
begins play on Friday night in a Group C clash with France in
Marseilles.
	   For 28 years until 1992, South Africa was banned from
international soccer because of apartheid. The players watched
World Cup matches on television, but actually taking the field
against the planet's best nations seemed impossible.
	   Midfielder Brendan Augustine, 26, recalled that ``it never
crossed my mind'' that he would play in a World Cup.
	   ``It was out of this world, a dream I never imagined,'' he said.
``Now that it's happening, it's out of this world.''
	   David Nyathi of St. Gallen, another midfielder, took a
philosophical view, saying the World Cup was like any other goal or
challenge a man faces, such as getting married or becoming a
father.
	   ``This is one of those dreams that becomes reality,'' said
Nyathi, 29. ``I have to say thank God I'm one of the people to be
representing South Africa in this glorious moment.''
	   He noted other South African players, including legends such as
former national coach Jomo Sono, never played in a World Cup
because of the apartheid ban.
	   ``It's a pity others never got a chance,'' he said.
	   Defender Mark Fish of Bolton Wanderers also mentioned those left
out by the political imbroglio.
	   ``We're representing South Africa, not only the republic but
also the players of the past who never had a chance,'' said Fish,
25. ``To play the host nation in the World Cup is the biggest
stage. It's a dream come true.''
	   Except for Arendse.

Picks up 7th graf, `The Singapore ...

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Fearing the local economy is worse than the
government admits, foreign sellers bailed out of Singapore markets
in a frenzy Wednesday, and the benchmark index plunged 4.4 percent
to its lowest level in more than nine years.
	   The key Straits Times Industrial Index easily breached a key
support level of 1100 in early trading and fell 49 points to close
at 1067.81, a figure government television said was a 9 1/2 year
low. The Singapore dollar also hit a four-month low against the
U.S. currency.
	   The index's previous low this year was on Jan. 12, when it hit
1073.47 in what was considered the peak of the regional economic
crisis.
	   But fears are growing that Singapore _ a hub for transferring
money into, out of, and around the financially weak region _ is now
set to suffer more of the consequences of the Asian economic
crisis. It mostly sailed unscathed through the tumult last year.
	   ``Everyone knows that we have benefited from our neighbors'
growth, and now we have to suffer along with them,'' Philip Wee, a
regional economist with Standard Chartered Bank, told Dow Jones
Newswires.
	   Government television, which has given no explanation in its
market closing bulletins for the rapid slide of the past two weeks,
attributed Wednesday's plunge to heavy selling of the Japanese and
Hong Kong currencies amid fears that China may devalue its yuan and
Hong Kong will abandon its fixed currency peg against the U.S.
dollar.
	   Traders were ``spooked by the yen's bad showing,'' the evening
television report said. The Japanese yen fell to a seven-year low
against the U.S. dollar Wednesday.
	   The Singapore dollar wasn't spared either, breaking through the
1.72 level against the U.S dollar for the first time since early
February. The U.S. dollar was quoted at a four-month high of 1.7215
Singapore dollars in morning trading, and fluctuated within one
Singapore cent through the day.
	   The growing realization that the crisis will be deeper and
longer than originally expected has begun to affect Singapore, an
island of 3.1 million residents without resources besides its
technically trained people. It also has a modern infrastructure
geared toward attracting investment, building new technologies and
handling money.
	   Government predictions have not matched the mounting private
sector forecasts that Singapore will fall into a recession or have
zero growth this year, although record unemployment has already
been acknowledged.
	   ``One or two political leaders have come up to warn about
retrenchments this year. That is probably the clearest sign that we
are headed for some pretty turbulent waters,'' Chia Yew Boon,
research director at Santander Investment Securities, told Dow
Jones Newswires.
	   A stagnant property sector, concerns about undisclosed bank
exposures to regional bad loans and the weakening Asian currency
markets contributed to the rapid slide of Singapore's markets in
the past two weeks.
	   But instead of bargain hunting, foreign investors simply sold
off the shares they had.
	   Media and property group Singapore Press Holdings Ltd., widely
seen as a proxy for the Singapore economy, was the biggest price
loser among index-linked stocks, hitting an all-time low of 11.70
Singapore dollars (dlrs 6.80) on volume of 426,000 shares, before
recovering by a few cents.

Russian combat jet crashes, killing two

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian combat jet crashed Wednesday while
attempting to land in northwestern Russia, killing its crew of two,
officials said.
	   The Su-24 bomber belonging to the Baltic Fleet's air arm crashed
while approaching an air base near the town of Ostrov in the
northwestern Pskov region, the Interfax news agency reported,
quoting fleet officials.
	   Both the pilot and navigator died in the crash.
	   The Su-24 is a twin-engine tactical bomber capable of flying at
supersonic speed.
	   It wasn't immediately clear what caused the crash. Officials
have started an investigation.
	   Many previous accidents with military aircraft have been blamed
on human error. Authorities say pilots' skills have deteriorated
because of a lack of practice caused by the military's severe fund
shortage.

Malaysia's hotel occupancy stays high at 70 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Despite a sharp slowdown in the
economy, Malaysia's hotel occupancy remains high at 70 percent with
no reports of any layoffs in the industry, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   The high occupancy rate indicates that there are still ample
career opportunities in the hotel industry, Minister of Culture,
Arts and Tourism Sabaruddin Chik was reported as saying Tuesday by
the Business Times daily.
	   ``With this high rate of hotel occupancy there is no reason for
hotel managements to retrench workers,'' he said.
	   Sabbaruddin projected a better prospect this year for the hotel
industry, saying the ministry expects 6.8 million visitors in 1998,
up from 6.2 million in 1997. In 1996, 7.1 million tourists visited
the country.
	   Sabbaruddin added that the optimistic forecast for 1998 is based
on the anticipated increase of visitors in September for the
Commonwealth Games.
	   The sharp depreciation in the value of the ringgit against the
dollar has also made it more affordable for tourists to vacation in
the country, he said.
	   Since the Asian economic crisis began last July, Malaysia's
currency, the ringgit, has lost more than 36 percent against the
U.S. dollar.

Palestinian official calls for mobilization against Jewish

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A top Palestinian official called Wednesday for
Palestinians to ``mobilize to defend Jerusalem'' against Jewish
settlement.
	   In Jerusalem, Israeli troops dragged away American and Canadian
demonstrators holding a sit-in to protest expansion of a Jewish
settlement in the Arab neighborhood of Silwan. Some protesters were
beaten and kicked as they were dragged through the dust by their
arms and legs.
	   Palestinian Cabinet Secretary Ahmed Abdel Rahman reacted angrily
to the Israel Interior Ministry's decision Tuesday to approve the
construction of new housing for a Jewish religious seminary in east
Jerusalem on land originally slated for an Arab girls school.
	   ``This decision by the Israeli government is a continuation of
the Israeli aggression toward the city of Jerusalem in order to
make it a Jewish city and deport all the Arab citizens from
Jerusalem,'' Abdel Rahman told The Associated Press in the Gaza
Strip.
	   ``The people have to mobilize to defend Jerusalem and the holy
places.''
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat called the Israeli decision
``another violation'' of the Israel-Palestinian peace agreements,
which say neither side should make unilateral changes to the status
quo before a final peace settlement that would determine the fate
of Jerusalem.
	   Settlers, backed by funding from such supporters as U.S.
multi-millionaire Irving Moskowitz, have recently intensified their
campaign to increase the Jewish presence in traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem, which the Palestinians claim as a future capital.
	   On Monday, settlers moved into five apartments in a pair of
buildings in Silwan, setting off clashes with Palestinians.
	   About 50 protesters from the United States and Canada, mostly
members of Christian human rights groups, held a sit-in outside the
buildings Wednesday that was roughly dispersed by Israeli border
police. Palestinian residents watched from surrounding rooftops,
and police said some residents pelted them with stones.
	   ``I came here to look at the situation _ I'm appalled at what
I've seen,'' said Michael Kauffman, a Canadian who was dragged by
his arms and legs.
	   ``We just wanted to show solidarity with the Palestinians who
had their homes taken away by the settlers,'' said Lucy Mayer of
New York.
	   Police said the demonstration was held without a permit, and
that several demonstrators were arrested.
	   Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
War and later annexed it.
	   Also Wednesday, the Israeli army said that a Palestinian shot
and killed by Israeli troops on Tuesday night had been planting a
bomb outside a Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip. A second man
involved escaped, the army said.
	   Palestinian police identified the dead man as Aboud Bardawil,
22, and said a joint Israeli-Palestinian investigation into the
incident was underway.

Mandela was target for chemical disabling, scientist alleges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela was the
target of a plot to mentally disable him through chemicals after
1990, a scientist who served the apartheid government said
Wednesday.
	   In testimony before a panel probing apartheid crimes, Schalk van
Rensburg described how his superior, Andre Immelman, told him there
were plans to poison Mandela with thallium, a drug that attacks the
nervous system.
	   Van Rensburg said the aim was not to kill Mandela, who had just
been released in 1990 after 27 years in prison and was starting
talks with the then white-run government on ending apartheid.
	   ``The intention, I understood, was to reduce his level of
intellectuality and effectiveness by inducing brain damage,'' he
said.
	   The Truth and Reconciliation Commission is investigating the
former apartheid army's chemical and biological weapons projects,
headed by Wouter Basson, who ran the scheme through an elaborate
network of front companies.
	   There was no suggestion that a plan to poison Mandela was ever
carried out, but documents introduced by the Truth Commission
suggested a possible link with the highest levels of the state.
	   Truth Commission lawyers presented a 1986 report from the State
Security Council, a shadowy body made up of apartheid's top
government ministers, that suggested Mandela could be released only
when he was in such a poor state of health that he could not
continue to lead the African National Congress.
	   Van Rensburg said he had never seen the document.
	   Jaap Celliers, a lawyer representing Basson and other top
scientists in the program, denied the document indicated a plot to
actively poison Mandela. He said the minutes could have just meant
that Mandela should be kept in jail long enough to damage his
health.
	   ``It was the longer detention, not active conduct,'' he said.
	   Basson, who has been called to testify later this week, was
forced to resign from the army in 1993 after a government report
fingered him in making poisons and chemical bombs. He is currently
being investigated on charges of making and possessing ecstasy and
mandrax drugs.
	   Earlier this week, scientists who worked in Basson's projects
described working in a poison factory that churned out chocolates,
drinks and cigarettes spiked with lethal chemicals that were passed
to government hit squads.
	   Scientists also developed large supplies of lethal
micro-organisms such as anthrax and cholera that could have been
used to cause epidemics.
	   Mandela and the ruling ANC that were elected in 1994's first
all-race elections set up the commission to uncover the truth about
apartheid crimes and promote racial healing.

Belgian man saves three after car slides into a canal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A Belgian citizen has rescued and
resuscitated three Romanians after their car slid into the waters
of a Transylvanian fish farm, a local official said Wednesday.
	   ``We have never seen something like this here until now, ''
Sorin Daut mayor, of the village Feldioara, said by telephone.
	   He said three people were trapped for several minutes Tuesday
after their car spun out of control and sank into a man-made canal
of a fish farm near Feldioara, 150 kilometers (94 miles) northwest
of Bucharest.
	   Belgian Fanica Bordinc, 30, on holiday in his country of birth,
witnessed the accident from a distance. He then dived into the
waters and, after failing to open the car doors, winched the car
out of the canal with a cable attached to his own car.
	   Bordinc smashed the car windows, pulled out the occupants and
conducted mouth to mouth resuscitation on all three.
	   One victim was recovering in hospital while the other two were
released after a brief medical check.

U.N. declares 22 Indonesians political refugees
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The United Nations announced
Wednesday it would arrange political asylum for 22 Indonesians who
took refuge in the U.S. embassy and U.N. compound to escape
deportation.
	   ``We have interviewed all 22 of them, we have investigated, and
we have concluded that they are refugees, in need of international
protection,'' said Hege Rudd of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees.
	   The UNHCR had not decided where the refugees would be given
asylum, Rudd said, adding they could be sent to different
countries.
	   ``The UNHCR is in close communications with the Malaysian
government to see what the next step will be for these refugees,''
she said.
	   The U.N. was asked to intervene after the Indonesians refused to
leave the U.S. embassy in downtown Kuala Lumpur, saying if deported
they would be tortured and even killed by the Indonesian military.
	   The refugees belong to Aceh, a region in the northern tip of
Sumatra, where an armed separatist movement has been active since
the 1970s. Human rights groups have accused the Indonesian military
of persecuting and executing Acehnese rebels.
	   Fleeing a police crackdown on illegal migrants, 14 Indonesians
rammed a truck through the gates of the UNHCR compound on March 30.
Eleven days later, eight more Acehnese hoisted themselves over the
walls of the U.S. embassy to escape the police and sought political
asylum.
	   The UNHCR would try to resettle the 22 men by seeking legal
protection, and in certain cases, citizenship, from governments who
agree to allow them in, the official said.
	   But the fate of two dozen other Indonesians who scrambled over
the walls of the Swiss, French and Brunei embassies on April 9
hangs in balance.
	   Unlike the U.S. and the U.N., these embassies handed the illegal
aliens over to Malaysian police. They were then taken to a
detention camp.
	   ``The UNHCR has not been able to see them,'' said Rudd.
	   Malaysia says the Acehnese are economic migrants and not
political refugees and hence should be deported like all other
foreigners found working without valid permits.
	   Malaysia has already deported 30,000 Indonesians this year in an
attempt to secure jobs for its own people in a sliding economy.
	   Prior to Southeast Asia's economic crisis, hundreds of thousands
of foreign workers were welcomed in Malaysia to provide much of the
work force to the booming property sector. Of its 8 million labor
force then, 3 million were migrant workers, half of them
Indonesian.

Eritrea seeks African help to end conflict with Ethiopia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Eritrea wants mediation by Egypt and other
African nation to end its territorial dispute with Ethiopia that
has turned into war, an Eritrean envoy said Wednesday.
	   ``Both Eritrea and Ethiopia have good relations with Egypt,''
which should facilitate Egyptian mediation between the two
neighbors,'' Abdullah Mahmoud Jaber, an adviser to Eritrean
President Isaias Afwerki, told reporters.
	   He earlier met with President Hosni Mubarak, and said the
Egyptian leader promised to ``play his role to prevent the African
Horn region from exploding.''
	   The dispute between Eritrea and Ethiopia is over a swath of land
that both claim.
	   Border skirmishes broke out on May 6 when Ethiopia accused
Eritrea of incursions. Ethiopian warplanes bombed an Eritrean
military airport in the capital, Asmara, on Friday and Saturday,
touching off serious hostilities.
	   Rwandan and U.S. mediators have proposed a peace plan that
Ethiopia has accepted. Eritrea says it the proposal is too sketchy.

Iranian paper stops publishing after press violation charges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS name of newspaper throughout to Gozaresh-e-Ruz sted
Gozaresh-e-Baz &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A new Iranian newspaper has stopped
publication after authorities charged it with frequently violating
press ethics, other newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   The liberal Gozaresh-e-Ruz was charged by the Press Supervisory
Board, and its case was forwarded Tuesday to the Justice Ministry
for review, the Iran Daily said.
	   A court case could follow and the newspaper may lose its license
if it's found guilty.
	   Another newspaper, Salam, quoted Gozaresh-e-Ruz's director
Mohammad Mahdavi Khorrami as saying he had voluntarily stopped
publishing the paper until a final verdict.
	   The action against Gozaresh-e-Ruz, or ``Day's Report,'' is seen
as a setback for the press freedom that has been allowed by
moderate President Mohammad Khatami since he took office in August.
	   It was not clear if hard-liners opposed to Khatami's reforms
were behind the crackdown on the paper.
	   The Farsi-language newspaper started publishing only last month
and on its third day it printed a front-page color picture of a
teenage boy with a teenage girl wearing a head scarf. The caption
read: ``Friendship Under Fear.''
	   The Culture Ministry warned it to ``respect the Press Law and
the society's ethical and religious standards,'' the
English-language Iran News said.
	   It quoted a ministry official, Ahmad Borqani, as saying that the
newspaper ``has followed quite an inappropriate path from the
beginning of its publication to the present day.''
	   Borqani said the paper had also printed ``a false report''
claiming that some Iranian officials had transferred money to
overseas bank accounts. Borqani said such a report is ``aimed at
disturbing public opinion and is against our national interests.''
	   Iran's constitution forbids the media from ``propagating
destructive and anti-Islamic attitudes.''
	   On Monday a court convicted the editor of the popular Jameah
newspaper of defamation and lies. The sentence was not made public.

Canada plans to open representative office in West Bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Canada will open a representative office in the
Palestinian-ruled West Bank town of Ramallah, the Palestinian
Ministry of International Cooperation said Wednesday.
	   No date has been set, but the ministry said the office would be
opened ``as soon as the right location is found.''
	   The announcement coincides with a six-day tour of the region by
Diane Marleau, Canadian minister for International Cooperation. She
said the office would not be a consulate and will focus on economic
development not diplomacy.
	   On Wednesday Marleau toured the Jalazoun refugee camp near
Ramallah, where Canada is financing a sewage system project.
	   During a trip to the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, Marleau signed a
memorandum of understanding with the Palestinian Authority for the
development of infrastructure in Rafah.

Report: Turkey excludes French firm from major defense deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey has excluded a major French defense
firm from a dlrs 150 million tender for aircraft in retaliation for
a motion by French deputies recognizing the alleged Armenian
genocide, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Turkey denies that the deaths of some 1.5 million Armenians
between 1915 and 1923 constituted genocide, insisting that losses
occurred on both sides as the result of a civil war.
	   The English-language Turkish Daily News said that Turkish
defense authorities would not invite Thomson CSF to bid for the
navy aircraft if the French Senate goes on to approve the motion.
	   French deputies in the lower chamber unanimously adopted a
one-sentence motion last month, stating: ``France officially
recognizes the Armenian genocide of 1915.''
	   The defense ministry refused to comment on the report. Thomson
CSF representatives were not immediately available for comment.
	   U.S. firms, Argos Systems and Boeing Co. and Spain's
Construcciones Aeronauticas SA (CASA) were expected to compete for
the bid later this year.
	   Last week, the municipality of Turkey's Aegean port city of
Izmir said it would bar French firms from bidding for a subway
construction project.

Italians arrest suspected terrorists as World Cup starts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian police arrested at least 20 people suspected
of belonging to an Algerian terrorist group allegedly planning
attacks during the World Cup, which started in France on Wednesday.
	   Paramilitary police in Bologna said more than 20 people had been
arrested and dozens of others were being questioned. News reports
linked those arrested to the Armed Islamic Group, a violent Muslim
militant movement blamed for murdering tens of thousands of people
in Algeria.
	   An anti-terrorist sweep over the past month has led to nearly
100 arrests in France, Italy, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland.
	   French authorities in May said they had found evidence of
possible terrorist attacks planned during the month-long soccer
tournament, which is being played in 10 French cities.
	   Algerian militants have staged terrorist attacks in France in
the past to pressure Paris to cut its ties with the military-backed
government of the petroleum-rich North African nation.

EU Commission recommends lifting ban on most British beef

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission on Wednesday
backed the lifting of the worldwide ban on British beef exports
imposed more than two years ago at the height of Europe's ``mad
cow'' scare.
	   The 20-member European Union executive body ruled British beef
and most beef products from cattle older than six months and
younger than 30 months, should be cleared for export. That would
cover most potential beef exports.
	   British Agriculture Minister Jack Cunningham told the BBC the
decision would be ``a very, very important step.''
	   However, despite the Commission's approval, the EU's complex
decision-making process means it could still take months before
British beef is back on foreign markets.
	   The decision needs approval by a panel of veterinary experts
that is scheduled to meet Friday, but the specialists are divided
and if they fail to agree, the issue will be put to a vote at a
meeting of EU agriculture ministers.

Air France says agreement reached with striking pilots

	   PARIS (AP) _ Air France said Wednesday it had reached an
agreement with striking pilots, ending a walkout that had severely
embarrassed the country in the days leading up to the World Cup.
	   In a statement, Air France said the pilots had agreed to accept
company shares in exchange for salary cuts.
	   The company called for an immediate return to work. But the
airline has said it would take three days for service to return to
normal once the strike ended.
	   Just Tuesday night, as World Cup celebrations began in Paris,
negotiations had seemed deadlocked. Pilots had gathered at Charles
de Gaulle airport and agreed to continue the walkout, despite an
appeal by the transport minister to both sides to continue talking.
	   But in talks overnight, an agreement was reached.
	   Jean-Cyril Spinetta, the president of Air France, told France
Info radio Wednesday morning ``this is a compromise that is good
for the company, good for the employees and good for the clients.''
	   But he added that consequences of the strike were ``heavy'' and
that the company had lost a billion francs (dlrs 166 million.)
``Now we have to think of confidence, confidence in Air France,
confidence in its clients,'' he said.
	   ``This global accord is aimed at assuring the development of Air
France by improving its competitiveness with regards to its
rivals,'' he said in a statement.
	   The carrier also said Wednesday it would scrap a two-tier salary
scale, under which new pilots earned less than their colleagues.
The pilots, among the most highly paid in the world, had found this
detrimental to cabin solidarity.
	   The pilots seemed satisfied with the agreement, especially with
the elimination of the two-tier salary system.
	   ``On the whole, the agreement is a good one for everybody. The
company had its constraints and its objectives to achieve. I think
it will be able to reach them,'' said Christian Paris, a spokesman
for the SNPL, the main pilots' union.
	   The strike, coming as the country tries to put its best face
forward for the world's biggest sporting event, was a severe
embarrassment to the government.
	   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, whose sympathies during the strike
were with the state-owned Air France, welcomed the agreement,
although he said it ``ought to have been possible to avoid it.''
	   Speaking after a Cabinet meeting, Jospin said, ``But I hope the
the company above all will benefit, because that is my primary
objective and what guided me throughout this period.''
	   The World Cup kicks off later Wednesday with a match between
Brazil and Scotland.
	   Thousands of fans have descended on France for the tournament,
many having to switch airlines at the last minute or take the
train.
	   Air France is the official airline of the World Cup, and many of
its planes, decorated with huge images of soccer stars, sat idle on
runways during the runup to the soccer tournament.
	   Wednesday's agreement was reached with the SNPL, the main
pilots' union which represents the vast majority of Air France
pilots.
	   The airline had been locked in bitter talks with pilots' unions
over the last 10 days.
	   The pilots had been protesting a proposal for 500 million francs
(dlrs 83 million) in salary cuts. Air France had said the cuts were
needed to modernize the airline, which was saved from bankruptcy in
1993 but reported healthy profits in 1996 and 1997.
	   It appeared that much of the 1997 gain has been eaten up by the
strike.
	   In the statement, Air France said part of the agreement involved
guaranteed training for young pilots, at least part of which would
be paid for by the company.
	   Only one in four Air France planes was flying Tuesday, and other
carriers were cashing in on the carrier's woes.
	   British Airways estimated it was bringing in an additional 1
million pounds (dlrs 1.6 million) daily as a result of the Air
France strike.
	   As well as the airline strike, France has been hit in recent
days by walkouts by train drivers, baggage handlers, and some bus
services.

Airline chief may be sacked after clothes mishap on state visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ The head of Papua New
Guinea's national airline may be fired after an embarrassing mishap
last week left an official delegation to Indonesia stranded without
a change of clothes, Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Bill Skate
said Wednesday.
	   Skate denied that Chris Mek, the acting managing director Air
Nuiguini had already been denied removed, but said the Cabinet will
consider his future at an upcoming meeting.
	   ``We will decide his fate,'' Skate said. ``Whether he stays or
whether he is removed to another area.
	   ``We are not going to chuck him out, we are going to find him a
job where we think he will be better utilized,'' he said.
	   The blunder happened last Wednesday, when Skate's chartered Air
Niugini airbus landed in Jakarta for a four-day state visit, but
airline staff failed to unload the luggage.
	   Members of the delegation were left without their clothes and
gifts intended for Indonesia's new President B.J. Habibie also went
missing.
	   The Papua New Guineans desperately searched for new clothes to
wear to an official state dinner on Thursday, with the prime
minister's secretary Robert Igara reportedly spending U.S. dlrs
2,000 (Australian dollars 3,400) on a formal dinner suit, two
shirts, a tie and a pair of socks.
	   Skate said he was only embarrassed by the lack of gifts to give
to Habibie.

	   Germany in particular is wary about letting British beef back
onto its markets, fearing a backlash from worried consumers.
	   Announcing the decision, EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler
said a number of strict conditions would apply to return of British
beef.
	   He said beef on the bone would still be banned; beef will have
to come from animals killed in approved slaughterhouses and
``animal passports'' will be needed to ensure cattle come from herd
free of mad cow disease.
	   The EU slapped a global ban on British beef exports on March 27,
1996, after the British government acknowledged a possible link
between a brain-wasting cattle ailment officially known as bovine
spongiform encephalopathy and an equally fatal human condition,
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
	   Fears that eating mad-cow tainted beef could cause humans to
contract CJD provoked a crisis in the beef industry across Europe
and cattle prices plummeted.
	   Although some animals in other European nations have contracted
the disease, the overwhelming majority of mad cow cases have been
in Britain. The outbreak was blamed on the practice of feeding
cattle the ground remains of sheep and other animals.
	   Britain banned such feed on Aug. 1, 1996, and now claims all
cattle born after that ban are free from the disease. Britain also
slaughtered 3 million cattle judged at risk and forbade the sale of
cattle parts thought most likely to harbor the disease.
	   The first relaxation of the ban came two weeks ago, when the EU
allowed exports of beef from Northern Ireland, where a special
computer tracking system allowed herds to be certified
disease-free.
	   Before the ban, Britain's beef exports were worth 5 billion
pounds (dlrs 8.1 billion) a year.

New bishop chosen to replace controversial conservative
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The cathedral chapter of Chur has
chosen a new bishop to replace the controversial conservative
Wolfgang Haas, a member of the chapter said Wednesday.
	   Bishop Amedee Grab was chosen by the 24-member body of Chur
clergy from a shortlist of three candidate bishops in a closed
meeting Tuesday, said Franz Stampfli, the canon of Zurich.
	   The appointment still has to be accepted within eight days by
Grab himself and confirmed by the Vatican, Stampfli said.
	   The Chur post has been vacant since Haas in December moved to a
newly created post as archbishop of Liechtenstein.
	   The announcement came in response to mounting pressure from the
Swiss government and Catholic establishment. It was greeted by
overwhelming relief in Switzerland and surprise in neighboring
Liechtenstein.
	   Tensions between Haas and other leading Swiss Catholics had
mounted since 1990 when he took over as bishop of Chur. The diocese
covers Zurich and a large mountainous area in eastern Switzerland,
and until December also included the tiny principality of
Liechtenstein.
	   An arch-conservative, Haas angered the liberals in his flock by
opposing moves to allow in women and lay preachers.
	   Grab, 68, is currently bishop of Fribourg, Lausanne and Geneva
and president of the Swiss bishops conference. Although a
conservative, he is seen as more moderate than Haas.
	   Pope John Paul II was seen as imposing his protege Haas upon the
Swiss, whose roughly 3.5 million Catholics have a history of
independence from Rome. The pope was accused of violating a Vatican
pledge to give Chur clergy three candidate bishops to choose from.

Mismanaged grain eroding China's ability to feed itself
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELAINE KURTENBACH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Dishonest grain dealers are costing China
billions of dollars and have left farmers unwilling to plant more
grain _ weakening the nation's ability to feed itself, according to
state-run media reports.
	   In yet another concession to market forces, the government plans
sweeping reforms of the state grain buying system responsible for
ensuring that enough staple food reaches the country's 1.2 billion
people, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said Wednesday.
	   Under the new system, farmers are to sign contracts with
authorized grain dealers, rather than local governments, and grow
only the grain they can sell, it said.
	   Apart from ensuring food reaches all, the grain purchasing
system is the government's main tool for keeping the vast
countryside stable.
	   Farmers have watched city residents prosper while their own
incomes have lagged far behind. With unrest rising among the
millions of city dwellers laid off by reforming state-owned
factories, the ruling Communists can hardly afford to risk turmoil
in the countryside.
	   Premier Zhu Rongji announced shortly after he took office in
March that the government-run grain system would have to go.
	   Specifics of the reform plan have not yet been announced. But
reports this week in the state media documented the widespread
mismanagement and corruption.
	   They point to a severe deterioration in the grain industry, with
losses reported by state grain firms ballooning to 27 billion yuan
(dlrs 3.27 billion) in the first quarter of this year, compared
with 48 billion yuan (dlrs 5.81 billion) in 1997 and 19.7 billion
(dlrs 2.38 billion) in 1996, the Communist Party newspaper People's
Daily reported Tuesday.
	   The newspaper blamed state grain companies for being too
bureaucratic, refusing to buy grain at the subsidized prices set by
the state, and charging illegal fees and taxes.
	   Government funds intended for grain purchases often were
embezzled or funneled into other uses. Farmers have been forced to
sell the grain at lower prices than promised and are sometimes paid
with IOU's.
	   Imbalance between supply and demand has pushed prices lower by
30 percent or more, despite government promises that state
purchasing price would remain steady.
	   The Xinhua report noted that farmers in central Hubei province
had produced 48.6 percent more rice per capita in 1997 than in
1996, but that their per capita income from grain sales had fallen
because of a glut.
	   Meanwhile, food processing factories were using imported wheat
because locally grown varieties were not suitable for their
products, it said.
	   The reports of troubles inside the grain distribution system
come as some experts warn of a growing gap between China's needs
and its ability to increase grain production.
	   They believe that water shortages, limits on the ability of
farmers to boost yields through better technology and the loss of
farmland to other uses will force China to import growing amounts
of grain over the next few decades, putting pressure on world grain
prices.

Police say 34 injured in clashes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Late-night clashes between drunken soccer fans,
Parisian youths and riot police left 34 policemen injured,
including one who was in critical condition after being hit in the
head with a beer bottle, police said Wednesday.
	   The others were only slightly injured, according to a midmorning
police report. The man in critical condition was the commander of a
motorcycle unit.
	   About 15 people were arrested in the unrest, during which police
used tear gas to disperse drunken soccer fans and apparently also
Parisian youths who threw bottles and tried to knock down a phalanx
of policemen, using a steel barrier as a battering ram.
	   Two of those in custody were Scots, police said. An Algerian, a
Liberian and a Congolese were also arrested. The nationalities of
the others weren't immediately known.
	   The World Cup kicks off later Wednesday with the opening match
between Brazil and Scotland. Thousands of Scottish fans have
descended on Paris for the match.
	   The incidents Tuesday night and early Wednesday on the
Champs-Elysees marred the festive atmosphere of the meticulously
planned pre-World Cup events.
	   They came as four ``giants'' _ 60-foot-tall robots _ made their
way through the city to the Place de la Concorde, where tens of
thousands watched a spectacle involving acrobats and dancers in
fanciful costumes.
	   Scottish fans said Wednesday that it wasn't all the fault of the
soccer fans. They said youths from Paris' troubled suburbs actually
began the disturbances.
	   ``Some young kids started throwing things just for the hell of
it, I think,'' said Derek Christie, from Fife in Scotland.
	   ``Everybody was having a good time, and I don't think they liked
it,'' said his friend, John Morrison, of Iverness.
	   When the unrest between the groups got out of hand, the police
charged, they and other witnesses said.
	   Christie and Morrison were strolling through Paris Wednesday,
waiting for their team's late-afternoon match.
	   In London, the Foreign Office said two Scots were in custody in
Paris, but they said it was a separate incident from the troubles
in the center of Paris.
	   ``They are currently being held in police custody on assault
charges,'' a spokesman said.
	   In the early morning hours Wednesday, bands of soccer fans were
roving the streets, many desperately seeking transportation back to
where they were staying.
	   Outside a Scottish pub in the Marais district, a group of
partying fans in kilts blocked traffic. When a taxi tried to drive
through, the fans surrounded it, a few of them jumping on the hood
and pounding on the windows. The taxi, and other cars, hastily
retreated.
	   The trouble began around 10:30 p.m., when dozens of people threw
beer bottles at the helmeted riot police, who responded by charging
at them. The fans dispersed. The incident was repeated several
times.
	   About an hour later, just after midnight, several hundred
people, led by young fans armed with security barriers as battering
rams, tried to break through a line of policemen on the
Champs-Elysees.
	   This time police charged them and used tear gas. The fans
quickly dispersed.
	   While the police were clashing with the youths, tourists and
passers-by, in the area to soak up the post-parade atmosphere,
snapped pictures or filmed them with minicams.

U.N. agency chiefs welcome Indonesian adoption of labor standards
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ International Labor Office chief Michel Hansenne
and U.N. human rights commissioner Mary Robinson Wednesday welcomed
Indonesia's decision to ratify an international convention
guaranteeing workers' trade union rights.
	   ``The ratification of this all-important convention represents a
major step on the road to institutionalizing democracy and human
rights in the workplace,'' ILO Director-General Hansenne said in a
statement issued during the U.N. agency's 86th annual conference.
	   The formal signing of the convention and adoption of other ILO
international labor standards is the latest indication of
Indonesia's reformist approach to workers' rights following the
rise to power of new president B.J. Habibie.
	   Since he took over from ex-president Suharto, Habibie has
relaxed tight restrictions on labor unions and freed prominent
political prisoners including trade unionist Muchtar Pakpahan.
	   Indonesia's manpower minister Fahmi Idris formally notified
Hansenne of Indonesia's ratification of the convention at a
conference session Wednesday.
	   On Tuesday, Idris indicated the country's intention to ratify
other ILO conventions on abolition of forced labor and workplace
discrimination.
	   ``The ILO stands ready to help Indonesia in the transformation
under way,'' Hansenne said.
	   In the first appearance of a U.N. human rights commissioner at
an ILO conference, Robinson on Wednesday applauded Indonesia's
decision.
	   She urged the swift adoption by countries of a new convention on
the worst forms of child labor and said she was ``heartened'' by
the conference's discussion of a proposed declaration on workers'
fundamental rights.

Three aid workers killed in ambush in southern Sudan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMED OSMAN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Armed assailants opened fire at a United
Nations relief convoy in southern Sudan, killing three officials
and wounding four others, the official Sudanese News Agency
reported Wednesday.
	   SUNA said two of those killed in Tuesday's attack worked for the
U.N.'s World Food Program and the third was attached with the
International Committee of the Red Cross. All victims were
Sudanese, sources told The Associated Press.
	   Among the injured was a government soldier, SUNA said.
	   A Sudanese government minister, Gen. Hassan Dahawi, accused the
rebel group Sudan People's Liberation Army of carrying out the
attack on the three-car convoy in the Southern Kordofan province,
about 500 kilometers (310 miles) southwest of the capital Khartoum.
	   The WFP office in Khartoum refused to comment.
	   The ICRC resumed only last week its relief work in southern
Sudan, which had been suspended in November 1996 after a rebel
faction allied with the government seized a relief plane and three
Red Cross workers.
	   ``We call upon all U.N. organizations and the voluntary
organizations to continue their humanitarian mission without paying
attention to such ugly provocations that target humanity and
peace,'' Dahawi was quoted as saying by SUNA.
	   SPLA rebels have been fighting since 1983 for autonomy and
development in the predominantly Christian, African and animist
south, which has traditionally been dominated by the Muslim and
Arabized north.
	   An estimated 1.5 million people have died in the fighting and
related famines. The WFP runs a big program in the south to feed
the people.

	   CEUTA, Spain (AP) _ The record for the fastest Atlantic crossing
by a commercial passenger vessel has been broken by an
Australian-built ferry, the company said Wednesday.
	   The 91-meter (300 foot) Catalonia arrived in the Spanish enclave
city of Ceuta in north Africa around 10:00 p.m (20:00 GMT) Tuesday,
clocking an average speed of 40 knots during it's cross-Atlantic
sprint that began in New York at 0035gmt on Sunday, said Ivonne
Sentis, spokeswoman for Buquebus, an Argentine-Uruguayan company
which owns the ferry.
	   Hoverspeed Great Britain set the previous record with an average
speed of 36.65 knots in 1990. Both ships were built by Incat
Australia.
	   Winning the record carries with it the Hales Trophy, donated by
British Member of Parliament Harold Hales in 1933, and first held
by the Italian Liner Rez which set a speed of 29 knots in the same
year.
	   The Catalonia claimed a second record when it became the first
commercial vessel to sail more than 1,000 nautical miles in a 24
hour period, its maker Incat Australia said. Its top 24-hour run
was 1,015 nautical miles.
	   To qualify for a record attempt the ships must not refuel en
route.
	   Within the next few days, the 450-ton catamaran is due to make
its way around southern Spain and up the eastern coast to the city
of Barcelona.
	   The ferry, that has room for 900 passengers and 240 cars, is to
work the route between Barcelona and the Mediterranean resort
island of Mallorca from June 15.
	   It is scheduled to make that far less demanding crossing in
about three hours.

Thai stock market drops below 300 for first time in 10 1/2 years

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's stock exchange index on
Wednesday fell below 300 points for the first time in 10 1/2 years,
as share prices made their biggest single-day drop in four months
because of worries about debt-servicing capabilities.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index closed at 292.10 points,
down 16.15 points from Tuesday.
	   An estimated 118 million shares valued at 1.63 billion baht
(dlrs 37.9 million) changed hands Wednesday, up from some 92.7
million shares valued at 1.31 billion baht (dlrs 30.5 million)
traded the previous session.
	   At Wednesday's close, the SET index was down 21.6 percent from
its closing level on the last trading day of 1997.
	   Dealers attributed the market's plunge to selling by foreign
investors concerned that Thai companies will have increasing
trouble financing their debt.
	   On Wednesday, a big listed company, Robinson Department Store,
announced it would stop servicing about 6.8 billion yen (dlrs 48.2
million) in floating-rate notes for six months while it completes a
corporate restructuring.
	   The company said, however, that it will remain in business. Its
stock closed at 1.20 baht (dlrs 0.028) a share, down 0.40 baht
(dlrs 0.009)
	   ``The outlook for the stock market will be very dim until we
know all these companies will be able to service their debts,''
said Songyos Kulvichien, a dealer with Securities One. ``So far,
there's been no reassurance on that front.''
	   Analysts have long identified 300 points as a key support level
for the exchange's index, meaning a decline below that point would
trigger a massive sell-off.
	   The index hasn't been below 300 points since Jan. 4, 1988, when
it closed at 287.71. At that time the index was just beginning to
recover from the Wall Street stock market crash of October 1987.
	   Some dealers surmised the across-the-board sell-off might also
reflect a decision by fund managers to concentrate their
investments outside Asia's troubled emerging markets.
	   Thailand's stock market enjoyed a healthy rebound in the first
half of the year, they said, making it attractive for investors to
cash in the gains rather than take the risks associated with
waiting any longer.

Philippine Airlines declares pilot strike over, to reduce
</HEADLINE>
operations

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Financially beleaguered Philippine
Airlines announced Wednesday it will no longer accept back about
600 striking pilots and will sharply reduce its operations to match
the few pilots it now has.
	   In a surprise move, the airline said it will sell several of its
54 aircraft, including some just purchased, and concentrate on
domestic routes to cope with the effects of the five-day walkout.
	   The airline said it now considers the strike over because the
pilots defied a government back-to-work order Tuesday and have all
been fired.
	   PAL said it will operate with just 25 management pilots _ senior
pilots who train other pilots _ until it is able to hire and train
new personnel.
	   It has already begun the process of hiring replacements, it
said.
	   ``The strike is over and a downsized Philippine Airlines emerges
from the five-day illegal walkout,'' it said in a statement.
	   ``The move will maximize PAL's limited capacity to sustain
financial viability under the present circumstances,'' it said.
	   The pilots' union said it was not surprised by the dismissals
and would not capitulate.
	   ``We still believe in what we're espousing,'' said Capt. Amy
Gloria, a union spokeswoman.
	   The union repeatedly refused attempts by the labor department to
formally deliver the back-to-work order and continued its walkout
despite appeals from President Fidel Ramos.
	   Ramos urged both sides Wednesday to resume negotiations.
	   The pilots began the strike Friday to protest a management
policy of ordering pilots to retire who have reached 20 years of
service or flown 20,000 hours, regardless of age. The policy puts
about 200 pilots in danger of forced retirement, the union said.
	   PAL, however, said it was not a unilateral management policy but
a provision in a collective bargaining agreement signed by airline
and union officials.
	   The airline earlier announced plans to sharply reduce staff,
slash costs and cut flights to survive its long-term financial
problems.
	   Talks at the labor department Wednesday on the dispute ended
without success.
	   PAL said the strike has cost it about 150 million pesos (dlrs
3.8 million) a day in lost revenue. It said it lost 8 billion pesos
(dlrs 205 million) in the last fiscal year _ three times more than
the previous year.
	   PAL president Jose Antonio Garcia said the strike caused several
potential foreign buyers of the airline, including Northwest
Airlines, to break off talks.
	   The strike has affected thousands of passengers and is
threatening to prevent many Filipino and foreign guests from
visiting the country to celebrate the June 12 centennial of the
Philippines' declaration of independence from more than 300 years
of Spanish colonial rule.
	   PAL earlier tried to recover from its spiraling losses with an
ambitious dlrs 4 billion modernization program, ordering 36 new
aircraft. But Asia's currency crisis sharply reduced passenger
numbers and bloated the airline's debt in local currency terms,
forcing it to delay many of the orders.
	   PAL, Asia's first airline, is controlled by Chinese Filipino
tycoon Lucio Tan. It had been completely owned by the Philippine
government until it was partly sold in 1992.

EU Commission recommends lifting ban on most British beef exports
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with commission approving lifting of ban. No pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission on Wednesday
recommended the lifting of the ban on British beef exports imposed
more than two years ago at the height of Europe's ``mad cow''
scare.
	   The 20-member European Union executive body ruled British beef
and most beef products from cattle older than 6 months and younger
than 30 months should be cleared for export. That would cover most
potential beef exports.
	   British Agriculture Minister Jack Cunningham told the BBC the
decision would be ``a very, very important step.''
	   However, despite the Commission's approval, the EU's complex
decision-making process means it could still take months before
British beef is back on foreign markets.
	   The decision needs approval by a panel of veterinary experts
from the 15 EU nations that is scheduled to meet Friday, but the
specialists are divided and if they fail to agree, the issue will
be put to a vote at a meeting of EU agriculture ministers, probably
in July.
	   Germany in particular is wary about letting British beef back
onto its markets, fearing that lingering mad cow fears among
consumers could again drive down the price of all beef.
	   The EU slapped a global ban on British beef exports on March 27,
1996, after the British government acknowledged a possible link
between a brain-wasting cattle ailment officially known as bovine
spongiform encephalopathy and an equally fatal human condition,
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
	   Fears that eating mad-cow tainted beef could cause humans to
contract CJD provoked a crisis in the beef industry across Europe
and cattle prices plummeted.
	   Although some animals have come down with BSE in other European
nations, the overwhelming majority of mad cow cases have been in
Britain. The outbreak was blamed on the practice of feeding cattle
the ground remains of sheep and other animals.
	   Britain banned such feed on Aug. 1, 1996, and now claims all
cattle born after that ban are free from the disease. Among other
measures taken to wipe out the disease, Britain slaughtered 3
million cattle judged at risk and forbade the sale of cattle-parts
thought most likely to harbor the disease, such as brains and
spinal cords.
	   The first relaxation of the ban came two weeks ago when the EU
allowed exports of beef from Northern Ireland, where a special
computer tracking system allowed herds to be certified mad-cow
free.
	   Before the ban, Britain's beef exports were worth dlrs 8.1
billion a year.

Police say 34 injured in clashes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Late-night clashes between drunken soccer fans,
Parisian youths and riot police left 34 policemen injured,
including one who was in critical condition after being hit in the
head with a beer bottle, police said Wednesday.
	   The others were only slightly injured, according to a midmorning
police report. The man in critical condition was the commander of a
motorcycle unit.
	   About 15 people were arrested in the unrest, during which police
used tear gas to disperse drunken soccer fans and apparently also
Parisian youths who threw bottles and tried to knock down a phalanx
of policemen, using a steel barrier as a battering ram.
	   Two of those in custody were Scots, police said. An Algerian, a
Liberian and a Congolese were also arrested. The nationalities of
the others weren't immediately known.
	   The World Cup kicks off later Wednesday with the opening match
between Brazil and Scotland. Thousands of Scottish fans have
descended on Paris for the match.
	   The incidents Tuesday night and early Wednesday on the
Champs-Elysees marred the festive atmosphere of the meticulously
planned pre-World Cup events.
	   They came as four ``giants'' _ 60-foot-tall robots _ made their
way through the city to the Place de la Concorde, where tens of
thousands watched a spectacle involving acrobats and dancers in
fanciful costumes.
	   Scottish fans said Wednesday that it wasn't all the fault of the
soccer fans. They said youths from Paris' troubled suburbs actually
began the disturbances.
	   ``Some young kids started throwing things just for the hell of
it, I think,'' said Derek Christie, from Fife in Scotland.
	   ``Everybody was having a good time, and I don't think they liked
it,'' said his friend, John Morrison, of Inverness.
	   When the unrest between the groups got out of hand, the police
charged, they and other witnesses said.
	   Christie and Morrison were strolling through Paris Wednesday,
waiting for their team's late-afternoon match.
	   In London, the Foreign Office said two Scots were in custody in
Paris, but they said it was a separate incident from the troubles
in the center of Paris.
	   ``They are currently being held in police custody on assault
charges,'' a spokesman said.
	   In the early morning hours Wednesday, bands of soccer fans were
roving the streets, many desperately seeking transportation back to
where they were staying.
	   Outside a Scottish pub in the Marais district, a group of
partying fans in kilts blocked traffic. When a taxi tried to drive
through, the fans surrounded it, a few of them jumping on the hood
and pounding on the windows. The taxi, and other cars, hastily
retreated.
	   The trouble began around 10:30 p.m., when dozens of people threw
beer bottles at the helmeted riot police, who responded by charging
at them. The fans dispersed. The incident was repeated several
times.
	   About an hour later, just after midnight, several hundred
people, led by young fans armed with security barriers as battering
rams, tried to break through a line of policemen on the
Champs-Elysees.
	   This time police charged them and used tear gas. The fans
quickly dispersed.
	   While the police were clashing with the youths, tourists and
passers-by, in the area to soak up the post-parade atmosphere,
snapped pictures or filmed them with minicams.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Many Asian stock markets and currencies plunged
through important support levels Wednesday as the U.S. dollar
climbed to a new seven-year high against the yen, sparking fears
that China would soon be forced to devalue its currency.
	   The benchmark Thai index closed at its 10 and a half-year low,
while the index in Singapore plunged to its seven-year low. Hong
Kong stocks also dropped to their three year lows.
	   Southeast Asian currencies also sank lower against the U.S.
dollar after U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley released a report
revising downward its region exchange rate forecasts for 1998.
	   The Thai baht, the Indonesian rupiah, the Singapore dollar and
the New Taiwan dollar all breached important support levels.
	   Many investors were reluctant to bid up stocks and currencies
ahead of a meeting of finance officials from the Group of Seven
industrialized nations scheduled to open in Paris later Wednesday.
	   ``No one knows what will come out of the G-7 deputy's meeting
and people are nervous,'' said Yasuhisa Morikuni, assistant vice
president at Bank of America.
	   The unease stems from concern the yen could fall further against
the dollar if officials attending the G-7 meeting do not issue a
statement pledging to support the battered Japanese currency.
	   In late afternoon trading, the dollar bought 140.84 yen, up 0.48
yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and above its late New York level of
140.30 yen overnight.
	   During Wednesday's trading, the currency moved as high as 141.57
yen, its highest level since June 1991.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 190.91
points, or 1.23 percent, closing at 15,339.26.
	   The yen's fall has made the price of Japanese exports cheaper in
foreign markets. Investors worry that a further drop in the yen
will force Japan's Asian neighbors, including China, to devalue
their currencies to remain competitive.
	   Hong Kong's Chief Executive reiterated Wednesday that the
government will keep the currency peg, saying floating the currency
would ``cause speculative attacks against the Hong Kong dollar and
increase interest rates.''
	   His comments immediately sparked a surge in the interbank
interest rates, which dragged down share prices in the afternoon.
	   Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index nosedived 412.09 points,
or 4.9 percent, to close at 7,979.37, adding to Tuesday's
2.3-percent drop.
	   ``It was mostly panic-selling by the big fund houses. They were
reducing their weightings on Hong Kong stocks,'' said Francis Lun,
research analyst at Pacific Challenge Securities Ltd.
	   In Singapore, the key Straits Times Industrial Index easily
breached a key support level of 1,100 in early trading and fell 49
points to close at 1,067.81, a seven-year low.
	   The index's previous low this year was on Jan. 12, when it hit
1073.47 in what was considered the peak of the regional economic
crisis.
	   The U.S. dollar was quoted at a four-month high of 1.7215
Singapore dollars in morning trading, and fluctuated within one
Singapore cent through the day.
	   ``One or two political leaders have come up to warn about
retrenchments this year. That is probably the clearest sign that we
are headed for some pretty turbulent waters,'' said Chia Yew Boon,
research director at Santander Investment Securities.
	   In Bangkok, the benchmark stock index dropped 16.15 points to
292.10 points, ending below 300 points for the first time in
10-and-a-half years.
	   The baht fell through the key support of 43.00 baht to the
dollar level, trading at 43.23 to the U.S. dollar in afternoon
trading.
	   Dealers said foreign investors are growing worried that Thai
companies will have increasing trouble financing their debts.
	   Indonesia's rupiah fell to a four-month low of 13,000 rupiah to
the U.S. dollar late Wednesday, a level not seen before former
president Suharto resigned last month.
	   After falling to 13,000, the rupiah rebounded slightly and ended
Jakarta trading at 12,950, down from 11,750 late Tuesday.
	   The JSX Composite Index closed down 0.7 percent, or 2.992
points, at 408.080.
	   In Taipei, the Weighted Price Index plunged 3.1 percent to
7,223.13, while the New Taiwan dollar finished at a new 11-year low
against the U.S. dollar.
	   The U.S. dollar breached the important barrier of 35.000 dollar
level 30 minutes before the closing bell, but ended a touch lower
at 34.896.
	   In Kuala Lumpur, the Composite Index fell 3.1 percent to close
at 489.86 points.
	   The dollar was quoted at a midrange of 3.9800 ringgit, up from
3.9500 late Tuesday.
	   In Seoul, the benchmark index also plunged 4.3 percent, closing
at 324.54.
	   In New Zealand, the key index plunged 30.47 points to 2,067.47,
its lowest level since July 1996.
	   Elsewhere:
	   SYDNEY : The key Australian index ending 1.2 percent lower at
2,623.9, the lowest close since mid-January.
	   MANILA: Stock prices fell for the third day. The key index fell
0.3 percent to 1,917.87.

EU Commission recommends lifting ban on most British beef

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission on Wednesday
backed the lifting of the worldwide ban on British beef exports
imposed more than two years ago at the height of Europe's ``mad
cow'' scare.
	   The 20-member European Union executive body ruled British beef
and most beef products from cattle older than six months and
younger than 30 months, should be cleared for export. That would
cover most potential beef exports.
	   ``We do feel that British beef is safe,'' said EU Farm
Commissioner Franz Fischler. British Agriculture Minister Jack
Cunningham told the BBC the decision would be ``a very, very
important step.''
	   Despite the Commission's approval, the EU's complex
decision-making process means it could still take months before
British beef is back on foreign markets.
	   The decision needs approval by a panel of veterinary experts
that is scheduled to meet Friday, but the specialists are divided
and if they fail to agree, the issue will be put to a vote at a
meeting of EU agriculture ministers.
	   Germany in particular is wary about letting British beef back
onto its markets, fearing a backlash from worried consumers.
	   Announcing the decision, Fischler said strict conditions would
apply to return of British beef.
	   He said beef on the bone will stay banned; cattle must be killed
in approved slaughterhouses and ``animal passports'' will be needed
to ensure cattle come from herds free of mad cow disease.
	   ``We will do our best to ensure the measures will mean no
further risks for consumers anywhere in Europe,'' Fischler told a
news conference at EU headquarters.
	   The EU slapped a global ban on British beef exports on March 27,
1996, after the British government acknowledged a possible link
between a brain-wasting cattle ailment officially known as bovine
spongiform encephalopathy and an equally fatal human condition,
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
	   Fears that eating mad-cow tainted beef could cause humans to
contract CJD provoked a crisis in the beef industry across Europe
and cattle prices plummeted.
	   Although some animals in other European nations have contracted
the disease, the overwhelming majority of mad cow cases have been
in Britain. The outbreak was blamed on the practice of feeding
cattle the ground remains of sheep and other animals.
	   Britain banned such feed on Aug. 1, 1996, and now claims all
cattle born after that ban are free from the disease. Britain also
slaughtered 3 million cattle judged at risk and forbade the sale of
cattle parts thought most likely to harbor the disease.
	   The first relaxation of the ban came two weeks ago, when the EU
allowed exports of beef from Northern Ireland, where a special
computer tracking system allowed herds to be certified
disease-free.
	   Before the ban, Britain's beef exports were worth 5 billion
pounds (dlrs 8.1 billion) a year.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Many Asian stock markets and currencies plunged
through important support levels Wednesday as the U.S. dollar
climbed to a new seven-year high against the yen, sparking fears
that China would soon be forced to devalue its currency. The
benchmark Thai index closed at its 10 1/2-year low, while the index
in Singapore plunged to its seven-year low. Hong Kong stocks also
dropped to their three-year lows. Southeast Asian currencies also
sank lower against the U.S. dollar after U.S. investment bank
Morgan Stanley released a report revising downward its region
exchange rate forecasts for 1998. The Thai baht, the Indonesian
rupiah, the Singapore dollar and the New Taiwan dollar all breached
important support levels. In late afternoon trading, the dollar
bought 140.84 yen, up 0.48 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and above
its late New York level of 140.30 yen overnight. Tokyo's benchmark
225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 190.91 points, or 1.23 percent,
closing at 15,339.26. (ASIAN MARKETS)

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sales and profits for Japanese companies fell in
the quarter ended in March as managers said they are more
pessimistic about the economy than they've been in at least 15
years, according to a government survey released Wednesday. Pretax
profits for Japanese companies plunged 25.4 percent in the three
months ended in March compared with a year earlier as sales sank
6.8 percent, the largest decline in 40 years, the Ministry of
Finance said in a quarterly survey. The report follows a string of
bad news for the Japanese economy which is stuck in its worst
slowdown in decades. Many economists expect a report due out later
this week will show the country has sunk into recession.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian stocks took a double beating Wednesday,
dropping because of market falls in Asia and fears that Western
governments won't bail Moscow out of its financial mess, traders
said. The Russia Trading System (RTS) index fell 5.8 percent in the
first 90 minutes of trading, dropping to 185.13. Volume was light,
but traders said Russian financial institutions were selling
aggressively. The Russian economy is stagnating, with little or no
growth in most areas. The government has promised deep cuts in
public spending and improved tax collection to try to improve the
situation. (RUSSIA-MARKETS)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Three leading South Korean companies
have joined in a dlrs 2.6 million joint venture to search for
copper in Australia, company officials said Wednesday. Samsung,
Hyundai and Daewoo will join in the search along with South Korea's
state-run Korea Resources Corp. and Australia's Malachite Resources
N.N. and LFB Resources N.L. Korea Resources Corp. entered into a
50-50 joint venture with the two Australian concerns in February.
It now has to split its 50 percent share equally with the three new
Korean companies. (SKOREA-AUSTRALIA-COPPER)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's new military ruler says he
supports a transition to civilian rule, although Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar has given little indication of how the enormous shift from
his predecessor's brutal dictatorship will be carried out as
quickly as anticipated. Air Vice Marshal Mohammed Alfa, a senior
military junta aide, told reporters Tuesday that Abubakar would
turn the country over to an elected civilian government by Oct. 1.
Neither he nor Abubakar provided details. In his first address to
the nation, Abubakar did say Tuesday night that Nigeria's many
political exiles are welcome home. His televised address came hours
after the military junta appointed him to replace Gen. Sani Abacha,
who died Monday of a heart attack. (NIGERIA)
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Eritrean forces attacked Ethiopia's
biggest border post during a dawn raid Wednesday, the government
said. Spokeswoman Salome Tadesse said the attack in northwest
Tigray province, on the Badme-Shiraro front at Erde Mattios,
started at 6 a.m. She said there were no further details except
that the fighting is continuing. Ethiopia says Eritrea set off the
current border conflict on May 6 when it moved into Ethiopian
territory in that region. The Ethiopians said Tuesday's attack came
from Eritrean forces inside Ethiopia. A languishing peace proposal
put forth by the United States and Rwanda includes a recommendation
that Eritrea withdraw to positions it held prior to May 6.

	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Relief workers distributed food and
searched for bodies in the debris of smashed homes after a cyclone
tore through western India, killing 205 people, injuring 1,200 and
leaving hundreds of thousands homeless. Officials said Wednesday
that the toll from the cyclone, India's worst in 25 years, could
rise because many people remain missing and relief workers have yet
to reach some remote villages. The death toll was highest in Kutch
district, where a 3-meter (12-foot) tidal wave flooded low-lying
areas near Kandla, a port 290 kilometers (180 miles) northwest of
Bombay. As many as 140 people, including fishermen and port
workers, drowned or were swept into the Arabian Sea, government
officials said. Some 125 people have been listed as missing and
officials fear the casualty figure could surpass 200 in Kutch
alone. (INDIA-CYCLONE)
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Rejecting a presidential promise of
special status for their homeland within Indonesia, thousands of
East Timorese demonstrated Wednesday for the right to vote for full
independence. More than 3,000 students and others gathered on the
grounds of the state-funded University of East Timor. ``We want
total independence. We want to be free,'' said Licinio Branco at
the noisy but peaceful rally. Organizers called for a full and free
referendum on the future of East Timor, a former Portuguese colony
invaded by Indonesian troops in December 1975 and annexed in
January 1976. Since then, the territory has endured human rights
abuses and separatist rebels have fought a guerrilla war.
(INDONESIA)
	   PARIS (AP) _ Air France said Wednesday it reached an agreement
with striking pilots, ending a walkout that severely embarrassed
the country in the days leading up to the World Cup. In a
statement, Air France said the pilots agreed to accept company
shares in exchange for salary cuts. The company called for an
immediate return to work. But the airline has said previously it
would take three days for service to return to normal once the
strike ended. Just Tuesday night, as World Cup celebrations began
in Paris, negotiations had seemed deadlocked. Pilots had gathered
at Charles de Gaulle airport and agreed to continue the walkout,
despite an appeal by the transport minister to both sides to
continue talking. (AIR FRANCE)

President, son take opposite sides in municipal elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ President Elias Hrawi and his son George
are set for an electoral showdown next week, backing rival tickets
in the municipal elections in their hometown of Zahle.
	   Newspapers said Wednesday the race for Zahle would be close, and
the results could have a bearing on the president's political
prospects. Hrawi's extended term of office expires in November, but
it is thought he may accept another extension.
	   Hrawi, his younger son Roy and his nephew, Khalil Hrawi, a
member of parliament, have endorsed a slate of candidates for the
21-member town council in Zahle, eastern Lebanon.
	   But Hrawi's eldest son George has backed the ticket of his
father's arch-foe Elie Skaff, another legislator and leader of a
local Maronite Catholic clan.
	   Zahle, some 37 kilometers (23 miles) east of the capital Beirut,
is the largest Christian city in the Bekaa Valley, where the fourth
and last stage of Lebanon's municipal elections will be held
Sunday.
	   Skaff and Hrawi are long-time rivals for the leadership of the
town's Maronite Christian community.
	   ``I respect my father and admire his achievements in Zahle ...
but I follow my own convictions in politics,'' George Hrawi told
the newspaper An-Nahar.
	   George Hrawi, who shied away from politics until recently, said
he did not agree with his father's policies. He did not elaborate,
but predicted the disagreement would ``snowball'' in the next few
days.
	   The president has not commented on George's remarks.
	   Some political observers have speculated that the president may
have advised George to back the rival slate, so that the Hrawi
family would have supporters on the council, regardless of which
ticket wins.

Ramos: Philippines to evacuate 78 Filipinos from Eritrea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines will evacuate 78
Filipino teachers and engineers from Eritrea to escape violence
caused by its border conflict with Ethiopia, President Fidel Ramos
said Wednesday.
	   Ramos said the evacuees will stay temporarily in Jiddah, Saudi
Arabia. He did not say whether they will be sent home or be allowed
to return to Eritrea when the violence there subsides.
	   Ethiopia says Eritrea set off the border conflict on May 6 when
it moved into Ethiopian territory.
	   A peace proposal put forward by the United States and Rwanda
includes a recommendation that Eritrea withdraw to positions it
held prior to May 6.
	   Ethiopia accepted the arrangement in principle, but Eritrea said
it needed work.
	   Ramos did not say if there were Filipinos in Ethiopia.

Three aid workers killed in ambush in southern Sudan

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Armed assailants opened fire at a United
Nations relief convoy in southern Sudan, killing three officials
and wounding four others, the official Sudanese News Agency
reported Wednesday.
	   SUNA said two of those killed in Tuesday's attack worked for the
U.N.'s World Food Program and the third was attached with the
International Committee of the Red Cross. All victims were
Sudanese, sources told The Associated Press.
	   Among the injured was a government soldier, SUNA said.
	   A Sudanese government minister, Gen. Hassan Dahawi, accused the
rebel group Sudan People's Liberation Army of carrying out the
attack on the three-car convoy in the Southern Kordofan province,
about 500 kilometers (310 miles) southwest of the capital Khartoum.
	   The WFP office in Khartoum refused to comment.
	   The ICRC resumed only last week its relief work in southern
Sudan, which had been suspended in November 1996 after a rebel
faction allied with the government seized a relief plane and three
Red Cross workers.
	   ``We call upon all U.N. organizations and the voluntary
organizations to continue their humanitarian mission without paying
attention to such ugly provocations that target humanity and
peace,'' Dahawi was quoted as saying by SUNA.
	   SPLA rebels have been fighting since 1983 for autonomy and
development in the predominantly Christian, African and animist
south, which has traditionally been dominated by the Muslim and
Arabized north.
	   An estimated 1.5 million people have died in the fighting and
related famines. The WFP runs a big program in the south to feed
the people.

Belarusian government bent on evicting U.S., other ambassadors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo planned. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Belarus said Wednesday that it had
postponed a deadline for foreign diplomats to leave their
residences, but continued to insist that the diplomats would be
evicted to permit urgent repairs.
	   The United States, Russia, France, Germany and Lithuania have
formally protested the planned eviction, which they say is in
violation of international law.
	   France and Lithuania said they will recall their ambassadors for
consultations if Belarus persists, and Washington has said it will
also take some action in response.
	   Belarusian officials reluctantly agreed to extend Wednesday's
deadline for the diplomats to leave until next week.
	   Oleg Novikov, deputy head of the Dipservice state agency in
charge of maintaining the diplomatic residences, told reporters on
Wednesday that his workers hadn't yet cut power and water supply to
the Drozdy complex but would do that next week.
	   ``I think they should use the time left to remove the
furniture,'' he said.
	   Novikov said that ambassadors from Bulgaria and several
ex-Soviet republics had left the complex in pinewoods on the
western outskirts of the capital, Minsk, before Wednesday's
deadline and workers have already started on repairs which will
take 14 months.
	   The ambassadors say that under international law, their
residences are considered sovereign territory and governments have
no right to enter without permission or insist that diplomats
leave.
	   U.S. Ambassador Daniel Speckhard said this week that envoys
would prefer to make arrangements to remain in the complex during
the repairs. He noted that the to
weld shut the side gate.
	   Officials in the former Soviet republic expressed regret for the
``inconvenience,'' but insisted the diplomats leave, saying the
complex's water supply is no longer safe and the sewage system is
polluting the environment.
	   The Foreign Ministry has offered the ambassadors apartments in
downtown Minsk or plots on which to build new residences.
	   ``There is a danger that Drozdy will float in its own sewage,''
Foreign Minister Ivan Antonovich said Tuesday on Belarusian state
radio. ``We can't endanger diplomats' lives''
	   He also claimed that foreign countries were overreacting because
of their bias against Belarus, whose authoritarian president has
been criticized in the West.
	   The dispute began in April when the government served notice
that the ambassadors would have to vacate their homes in the
rambling, wooded housing compound by Wednesday.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said on
Tuesday that Belarusian authorities had extended the deadline by
one week, to June 17. He said Ambassador-at-large Steve Sestanovich
summoned the Belarusian charge d'affaires to protest the eviction
notices.
	   ``We have pointed out very clearly at a variety of levels to
Belarus that it is not too late to reverse the self-destructive
course the government has chosen,'' Rubin said.

Drug problem is downside of the collapse of Soviet Union
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Taking advantage of the collapse of the
Soviet Union, drug traffickers have established links across
Central Asia to smuggle narcotics from Afghanistan to lucrative
markets in Western Europe.
	   Leaders of the newly independent states such as Tajikistan,
Uzbekistan and the Kyrgyz Republic complain they lack the resources
to combat criminal syndicates based in Russia and Western Europe.
	   The end of the Soviet Union, with its police state internal
controls, gave traffickers a freer hand to move large amounts of
opium and other drugs across Central Asia to markets in Western
Europe.
	   ``The drug problem is acute throughout the Central Asian
region,'' the prime minister of the Kyrgyz, Kubanychbek Jumaliev,
told the U.N. special session on drugs Tuesday. The three-day
conference ends Wednesday.
	   ``Two or three years ago, people in Kyrgyzstan had only a
theoretical idea what heroin is,'' Jumaliev said. ``Nowadays, it
has become one of the main drugs on the illegal market.''
	   U.N. officials say the problem is made worse because of the
decades-long instability in Afghanistan, which along with Myanmar
produces most of the world's illicit supply of opium.
	   The newly independent states of Central Asia, some of which have
suffered their own internal instability, lack the means to control
their borders and maintain surveillance on drug traffickers moving
in and out of Afghanistan.
	   ``Today, it is possible to say with confidence that the main
source of growing, producing and delivering drugs to the European
countries is Afghanistan,'' said Foreign Minister Abdulaziz Kamilov
of Uzbekistan.
	   Afghan factions permit the drug trade to earn money to buy more
weapons, which in turn produces more fighting and instability, he
said.
	   The president of Tajikistan, Emomali Rakhmonov, complained that
the international community has devoted considerable resources to
combatting drugs in Latin America and Southeast Asia but has left
poor Central Asian states on their own.
	   Rakhmonov said that in 1991, the year the Soviet Union
collapsed, police in Tajikistan seized only 10 kilograms (22
pounds) of narcotics. In 1997, Tajik police seized more than 4.5
tons.
	   He estimated that the figure seized amounts to no more than 15
percent of the total amount of drugs which passed through Tajik
territory.
	   ``The Republic of Tajikistan is not yet in a condition to
finance independently the programs and measures to combat this
evil,'' Rakhmonov said. ``We require active support and assistance
to block and control illicit drug traffic.''
	   Officials from those countries said privately they would like
the European Union to provide more assistance since most of the
drugs passing through Central Asia will end up sold on the streets
of Berlin, Paris, London and other Western European cities.
	   Kamilov suggested that the European Union help Central Asian
states establish a coordination center to monitor the flow of drugs
and develop plans for curbing the flow.

Sexual harassment rife in defense force school, investigation
</HEADLINE>
finds &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's defense training school
has a pervasive culture of sexual harassment with half of the
female cadets and one in ten men experiencing unwanted sexual
advances, a new report released Wednesday said.
	   Problems at the Australian Defense Force Academy stem from a
culture in which ``seemingly decent and personable young men and
women engaged in extraordinarily nasty and brutish activities,''
the report said.
	   The report is the product of a study, conducted jointly by
defense personnel and academics, commissioned after news reports
that sexual misconduct was rife throughout the Australian Defense
Force.
	   It found 14 female cadets at the academy said they had suffered
sexual assault or attempted sexual assault, as did one male cadet.
Fellow cadets were the culprits in the majority of cases and
excessive alcohol consumption was a major contributing factor.
	   The report said the number of incidents at the academy was
substantially higher than the reported incidence of sexual
misconduct in the wider forces, despite a well-publicized policy of
zero tolerance of sexual harassment.
	   ``Crude and offensive behaviors are experienced by both male and
female cadets but the sexist behaviors are experienced mainly by
females,'' the report said.
	   ``It would appear that at the Defense Academy these behaviors
have become a pervasive and public feature of the environment, part
of the day to day social life of cadets.''
	   The situation at academy is very similar to comparable academies
in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada, the report
said.
	   Defense Force Chief General John Baker said the review found a
culture within the cadet body which conflicted with the aims of the
institution.
	   ``We have a zero tolerance for all forms of sexual harassment
and this report gives us the way ahead,'' Baker said of the
recommendations, which include curbing cadets' drinking.
	   He said he expected cadets and other armed forces personnel to
undertake a higher standard of personal conduct than members of the
general public.
	   The impact of reforms introduced as a result of the report will
be felt throughout the armed forces, Baker said.

Polish train drivers threaten nationwide strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Train drivers on Wednesday threatened to
strike next week unless the government-run railway meets their
demands for pay raises and earlier retirement.
	   Jan Zaborowski, head of the train drivers' union, said the
government has until June 16 _ or one week _ to meet the demands.
Otherwise, the strike would begin June 17.
	   A spokeswoman for the Transport Ministry said negotiations
between the union and the government were under way.
	   The drivers want a 300-zloty (dlrs-88) raise in their monthly
pay, currently about 1,000 zlotys (dlrs 300).
	   They want to be eligible for retirement at 55 if they have
worked for at least 20 years. They want the age limit dropped for
those who have worked for at least 30 years. The current retirement
age is 65 for men and 60 for women.
	   In addition, the drivers want the government to funnel 1 percent
of its annual budget to subsidize the railways, which are strapped
for cash but need to lower prices to compete with cheaper road
travel.

Court rules bank strike illegal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ In the third decision of its kind in the
past two weeks, a court ruled Wednesday that the month-long strike
by employees of Greece's fourth largest bank was illegal.
	   Ionian Bank employees, who walked off the job on May 8, are
protesting plans to privatize the bank.
	   The strike has threatened to derail government efforts to
streamline the economy and meet European Union criteria for joining
its single currency club in 2001.
	   A court has ruled twice before that the strike is illegal, on
grounds that no skeleton staff were appointed to serve customers.
	   Both times, workers claimed they would not be violating the
court orders by failing to return to work if they were covered by
strikes called by umbrella trade union organizations.
	   But the latest ruling against the strike, this time declared by
GSEE, Greece's largest trade union, leaves workers with no
alternative but to return to work or risk losing their jobs.
	   The court also banned any new strike with the same demands and
said GSEE leaders will be liable for a fine of 500,000 drachmas
(dlrs 1,655) each for every additional strike day.
	   During the trial, Ionian deputy general manager Emmanouil
Santorineos said the bank's operation has been completely paralyzed
since the strike began, with 45,000 civil servants unable to
receive their salaries as their accounts had effectively been
frozen.
	   Before the court decision was announced, Ionian union leaders
said they would continue their strike until Thursday and then chose
``other forms of protest,'' local media reported.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the union after the court
ruling.
	   GSEE has also called for a demonstration outside the bank's main
computer center on Thursday ``to condemn the authoritarianism
criminalization of workers' mobilizations.''
	   Workers have not been bowed by the government's concession to
one of their main demands last week _ providing current Ionian
employees with a guaranteed job until the retirement age of 62 _
saying they want to see the concession in writing.

Defense minister says 433 killed in latest battle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Recent fighting between Sri Lankan
forces and Tamil rebels for the control of a strategic highway
killed 433 people, the country's defense minister said Wednesday.
	   Defense Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte, speaking in Parliament,
said 198 soldiers, 10 officers and 225 Tamil Tiger rebels were
killed in fighting since May 28 in the north where militants among
the country's minority Tamils are fighting for an independent
homeland.
	   Ratwatte said his troops were in control of the operation.
	   The statement was the first official report of the major
military operation to dislodge rebels of the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam from the highway that will link the former rebel city
of Jaffna with the rest of the country.
	   Ratwatte said the news censorship imposed on reporting of the
war was a temporary measure. It was aimed at not letting the enemy
know about government operation.
	   He said 206 soldiers suffered major injuries and 1,269 sustained
minor injuries during the operation. Many of those who sustained
minor injuries have gone back to the battle front.
	   He said the Tamil Tiger rebels lost at least 225 combatants and
600 were wounded.
	   Government troops backed by the artillery and air force are
fighting near Mankulam, the last Tamil-held town on a road that
troops have been trying to capture since May 1997.
	   Rebels among Sri Lanka's minority Tamils want a homeland in the
north and the east to end what they call discrimination by the
majority Sinhalese. The war, which started in 1983, has left more
than 52,000 people dead.

Asian markets continue slide on weak yen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS Singapore stock index fall to ``9 1/2 year low'' from
``7-year low,'' grafs 2 and 16.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Many Asian stock markets and currencies plunged
through important support levels Wednesday as the U.S. dollar
climbed to a new seven-year high against the yen, sparking fears
that China would soon be forced to devalue its currency.
	   The benchmark Thai index closed at its 10 and a half-year low,
while the index in Singapore plunged to a 9 1/2 year low. Hong Kong
stocks also dropped to their three year lows.
	   Southeast Asian currencies also sank lower against the U.S.
dollar after U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley released a report
revising downward its region exchange rate forecasts for 1998.
	   The Thai baht, the Indonesian rupiah, the Singapore dollar and
the New Taiwan dollar all breached important support levels.
	   Many investors were reluctant to bid up stocks and currencies
ahead of a meeting of finance officials from the Group of Seven
industrialized nations scheduled to open in Paris later Wednesday.
	   ``No one knows what will come out of the G-7 deputy's meeting
and people are nervous,'' said Yasuhisa Morikuni, assistant vice
president at Bank of America.
	   The unease stems from concern the yen could fall further against
the dollar if officials attending the G-7 meeting do not issue a
statement pledging to support the battered Japanese currency.
	   In late afternoon trading, the dollar bought 140.84 yen, up 0.48
yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and above its late New York level of
140.30 yen overnight.
	   During Wednesday's trading, the currency moved as high as 141.57
yen, its highest level since June 1991.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 190.91
points, or 1.23 percent, closing at 15,339.26.
	   The yen's fall has made the price of Japanese exports cheaper in
foreign markets. Investors worry that a further drop in the yen
will force Japan's Asian neighbors, including China, to devalue
their currencies to remain competitive.
	   Hong Kong's Chief Executive reiterated Wednesday that the
government will keep the currency peg, saying floating the currency
would ``cause speculative attacks against the Hong Kong dollar and
increase interest rates.''
	   His comments immediately sparked a surge in the interbank
interest rates, which dragged down share prices in the afternoon.
	   Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index nosedived 412.09 points,
or 4.9 percent, to close at 7,979.37, adding to Tuesday's
2.3-percent drop.
	   ``It was mostly panic-selling by the big fund houses. They were
reducing their weightings on Hong Kong stocks,'' said Francis Lun,
research analyst at Pacific Challenge Securities Ltd.
	   In Singapore, the key Straits Times Industrial Index easily
breached a key support level of 1,100 in early trading and fell 49
points to close at 1,067.81, a 9 1/2 year low.
	   The index's previous low this year was on Jan. 12, when it hit
1073.47 in what was considered the peak of the regional economic
crisis.
	   The U.S. dollar was quoted at a four-month high of 1.7215
Singapore dollars in morning trading, and fluctuated within one
Singapore cent through the day.
	   ``One or two political leaders have come up to warn about
retrenchments this year. That is probably the clearest sign that we
are headed for some pretty turbulent waters,'' said Chia Yew Boon,
research director at Santander Investment Securities.
	   In Bangkok, the benchmark stock index dropped 16.15 points to
292.10 points, ending below 300 points for the first time in
10-and-a-half years.
	   The baht fell through the key support of 43.00 baht to the
dollar level, trading at 43.23 to the U.S. dollar in afternoon
trading.
	   Dealers said foreign investors are growing worried that Thai
companies will have increasing trouble financing their debts.
	   Indonesia's rupiah fell to a four-month low of 13,000 rupiah to
the U.S. dollar late Wednesday, a level not seen before former
president Suharto resigned last month.
	   After falling to 13,000, the rupiah rebounded slightly and ended
Jakarta trading at 12,950, down from 11,750 late Tuesday.
	   The JSX Composite Index closed down 0.7 percent, or 2.992
points, at 408.080.
	   In Taipei, the Weighted Price Index plunged 3.1 percent to
7,223.13, while the New Taiwan dollar finished at a new 11-year low
against the U.S. dollar.
	   The U.S. dollar breached the important barrier of 35.000 dollar
level 30 minutes before the closing bell, but ended a touch lower
at 34.896.
	   In Kuala Lumpur, the Composite Index fell 3.1 percent to close
at 489.86 points.
	   The dollar was quoted at a midrange of 3.9800 ringgit, up from
3.9500 late Tuesday.
	   In Seoul, the benchmark index also plunged 4.3 percent, closing
at 324.54.
	   In New Zealand, the key index plunged 30.47 points to 2,067.47,
its lowest level since July 1996.
	   Elsewhere:
	   SYDNEY : The key Australian index ending 1.2 percent lower at
2,623.9, the lowest close since mid-January.
	   MANILA: Stock prices fell for the third day. The key index fell
0.3 percent to 1,917.87.

World Cup: South Koreans benefit from homegrown cuisine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo WCP101 &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ South Korea's recipe for success at the 1998 World
Cup starts in the kitchen, and a chef from the homeland is
overseeing the ingredients.
	   The cook is Chung Seung-chan, flown in by their hotel to serve
up the same dishes players are accustomed to eating back home.
	   ``The players say they're happy to have Korean cooking 1,000
miles from home,'' said Park Sun-hu, who translates between Chung
and the hotel's French chef in the kitchens.
	   ``The French must have their baguette (bread) and fromage
(cheese) every day. For Koreans it's essential to eat rice and
kimchi'' _ a spicy vegetable salad.
	   It is precisely those French cheeses that got the South Koreans
into trouble when they came to France last April for matches
against the Paris club St. Denis and France's first division club
Metz.
	   Suffering from a variety of digestive problems, the South
Koreans lost to 2-1 to Metz before scraping by St. Denis 2-1.
	   ``They had a lot of problems with the food,'' recalls team
vice-manager Chun Hanjin. ``Many had diarrhea, which weakened
them.''
	   ``The problem was all the milk products,'' chef Chun explained.
``They are too rich here and difficult for the players to digest.
In Korea we only consume two percent and skim milk products.''
	   If the way to a man's heart is through his stomach, the South
Koreans will need all the heart they can get in their bid to win
their first match in five World Cup appearances.
	   Doing his share, Chung prepares a selection of two or three
Korean dishes each day, including the traditional staple kimchi.
Chung also makes bulgogi, a marinated beef and vegetable dish, and
fried chicken. And plenty of rice.
	   While millions of people come to France each year to sample some
of the world's most famous Michelin restaurants, the country's
haute cuisine has failed to impress the South Korean squad. The
players do, however, appreciate Italian food.
	   ``The hotel chef's spaghetti bolognese is very popular among the
players, for some reason,'' said Park, who like Chung works for a
hotel chain (Accor) back home.
	   Despite the honor and excitement of cooking for the national
team, life in the French hotel's kitchens isn't exactly a piece of
cake.
	   Communication is difficult and Chung does most of the cooking
himself for the 23 players and the rest of the South Korean
delegation. He does, however, receive help from the hotel's second
chef, Richard Donio.
	   ``Many things are different in a French kitchen,'' said Park.
``And there are many communication problems. But Monsieur Donio is
a great help even if he understands nothing about Korean cooking.''
	   Chung and Park will follow the team to Lyon and Marseille for
its first-round matches against Mexico and the Netherlands.
	   ``I'm very excited about cooking for the World Cup team,'' said
Chung, speaking through Park. ``I get to meet famous players and
it's my first time in France.''

Man sentenced to death for killing 19 people
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Siberian man fainted Wednesday when he was
sentenced to death for raping, robbing and stabbing to death 19
people, a news agency said.
	   Vadim Yershov, 25, was sentenced by a military tribunal in the
Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, according to ITAR-Tass. He faced a
military trial because he had committed the crimes after deserting
from his army unit.
	   Yershov had been on trial since last October.
	   In practice, Russia has suspended carrying out death sentences
although capital punishment remains part of the legal code. The
Council of Europe has called on Russia to abolish capital
punishment as a condition of its membership in the organization.

Defense ministers to seek plans for Kosovo intervention
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES material from US-Kosovo-Cohen
 &UR; JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - With the Serb-led Yugoslav army beefing
up its forces in Kosovo, NATO defense ministers face a growing
belief that the only way to stop the violence may be direct
military intervention.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen and his 15 NATO colleagues,
meeting at alliance headquarters here Thursday and Friday, are
expected to order military planners to take a hard look at the
intervention option, whether that be sending in troops, conducting
air strikes or enforcing a no-fly zone.
	   ``The worsening of the situation makes it more than advisable to
work out credible options for military action, to have them ready
for a political decision at any time,'' German Defense Minister
Volker Ruehe told reporters.
	   Cohen acknowledged ``a general consensus there should be
accelerated planning'' and that ``all NATO members feel an
increased sense of urgency.''
	   ``There is a genuine concern throughout the region that if this
goes unchecked, it could have much wider implications than just
Kosovo,'' he said.
	   More than 250 people have died in clashes between government
forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, armed wing of the Albanian
independence movement. Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of
the province's population, demand independence from Serbia, the
larger of two republics in Yugoslavia.
	   The United States and its allies support autonomy for Kosovo but
oppose the rebels' demands for independence and condemn violence on
both sides.
	   In recent days entire villages in Kosovo have been flattened and
thousands of people driven from their homes.
	   ``Kosovo is in grave danger of becoming another Bosnia,'' said
Carlos Westendorp, the High Representative in Bosnia, the man
responsible for enforcing the civilian aspects of the Dayton peace
accords.
	   ``It is as if we repair one house, only to discover the one next
door is burning down,'' he said. ``This is supposed to be the year
of returns to Bosnia, but it is rapidly becoming the year of the
exodus from Kosovo.''
	   The United States and the European Union have imposed tough
economic sanctions on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, but
few hold out much hope that will result in a government pullback in
Kosovo.
	   ``We have learned the Serbs don't respond to pressure unless it
is military pressure,'' said a senior NATO official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   NATO military planners have for the past two weeks been
following out earlier instructions to study indirect options for
pressuring Milosevic. Those include dispatching up to 20,000 troops
to Albania and Macedonia. That would include reinforcing the
existing 750-man U.N. force in Macedonia and helping both countries
secure their borders while dealing with refugees and arms
smuggling.
	   But, noted another NATO official, ``With the events of the last
week, shoring up the periphery seems of secondary value.''
	   Intervening in Kosovo, however, would require a sound legal
basis.
	   The United States is backing a British effort to win U.N.
Security Council approval for a resolution authorizing ``all
necessary measures'' to deal with the situation in Kosovo,
including direct military intervention.
	   The Russians, however, have opposed this so far. President Boris
Yeltsin says he will try to use his influence with Milosevic, but
remains firmly against intervention.
	   NATO ministers will be consulting with their Russian
counterpart, Igor Sergeyev, who will be here for a meeting of the
NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council.

seem to agree whether it was right-wing or left-wing activists who
stole weapons and ammunition from a military base over the past
several weeks.
	   A police intelligence report indicates that members of the
former anti-apartheid liberation armies stole the materiel to be
used in disrupting next year's elections, SABC radio reported
Wednesday.
	   The report contradicts comments by government officials last
week that the thefts were connected to right-wing pro-apartheid
whites who wanted to create havoc.
	   SABC said it obtained a copy of the secret report and that it
was compiled by Police commissioner George Fivaz to be presented to
President Nelson Mandela and Parliament last week.
	   But Mandela's spokesman denied the report had been destined for
the president.
	   ``The report was not meant for the president,'' spokesman Parks
Mankahlana told The Associated Press. ``We have decided the matter
will be handled by Commissioner Fivaz.''
	   SABC said Parliament never received the report. It was told
instead by a Defense Department official that the thefts had a
right-wing connection.
	   Fivaz and the parliamentary committee on security could not be
immediately reached for comment.
	   SABC said the secret report named a group behind the thefts as
MKAPLA _ an acronym connecting the ruling African National
Congress' former armed wing to the Azanian People's Liberation
Army, another former anti-apartheid military group.
	   In an SABC interview, Mankahlana dismissed the report as
possibly being one of a number of ludicrous and unfounded documents
that have been emerging.
	   Earlier this year, South Africa's military chief Georg Meiring
resigned amid a controversy stirred up by a report about a coup
plot that the government says never existed. Meiring had given the
report to Mandela. A panel of judges said the report was unfounded
and never taken seriously by military personnel.
	   Three men with alleged right wing connections were arrested for
the theft of 117 weapons _ including mortars and rocket launchers _
and 200,000 rounds of ammunition from a truck from Tempe base.
	   Last week, a group calling itself the Boere Weerstandsbewging,
or Boer's Resistance Movement, claimed the theft was done by Boers,
the white descendants of Dutch settlers.

Talks seek peaceful end to coup attempt in Guinea-Bissau
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A parliamentary delegation scheduled a
meeting Wednesday with renegade soldiers holed up in a military
installation since launching a coup attempt four days ago in this
West African nation.
	   Parliamentarian Zinha Vaz said in a telephone interview
broadcast by Portuguese state radio RDP-Africa that the meeting
would be held at 11 a.m. (1100GMT)near the suburban military
complex. Whether the meeting had begun on schedule could not be
confirmed immediately.
	   The four-member delegation, which was hoping to end the standoff
between the rebels and government troops surrounding the base,
included leaders from each of the four parties represented in
Parliament.
	   Vaz declined to comment on the agenda for the talks, but said
the aim was to seek a peaceful resolution to the conflict.
	   Loyalist troops have tried unsuccessfully to dislodge the rebels
from the arms depot and barracks at Bra, 15 kilometers (10 miles)
outside Bissau, the capital. The former Portuguese colony has a
population of 1 million.
	   Troops from neighboring Senegal and the Republic of Guinea
arrived in the country on Tuesday to support the government forces.
	   The rebels, led by former armed forces chief Brig. Gen. Ansumane
Mane, have demanded that President Joao Bernardo Vieira and the
government step down and that a transition government be installed
ahead of elections in July.
	   There was no information on the size or firepower of the rebel
force.
	   A spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Bissau said it was quiet
Tuesday night.
	   ``There was some sporadic mortar fire overnight, but it was a
whole lot quieter than it has been,'' Bryan Hunt said in a
telephone interview. ``It's a stalemate situation.''
	   Hunt said he heard army trucks moving through the capital
towards Bra during the night.
	   He said reliable sources had told him that 400 soldiers from
Guinea and 250 troops from Senegal were in the capital.
	   Downtown areas were calm early Wednesday. The airport, located
near Bra, remained closed, but it was not clear if it was under
rebel control.
	   Mane, describing himself as head of the self-proclaimed Military
Junta for the Consolidation of Democracy, Peace and Justice, said
in a statement Tuesday that he had no intention of seizing power
himself and offered talks to ``avert a bloodbath.''
	   The brigadier, fired six months ago during an investigation into
arms trafficking with the separatist rebels of Casamance, a
Senegalese region that borders Guinea-Bissau to the north, had
waited until Saturday to officially step down.
	   Foreign Minister Fernando Delfim da Silva rejected the call for
an early ballot, saying legislative elections were scheduled for
this year and a presidential election was due in 1999.

Thousands protest Serb attacks, ethnic leader to Europe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new information throughout, including protest,
Rugova in European capitals &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QL; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Decrying the latest Serb aggression,
thousands of ethnic Albanians took to the streets of Pristina in
protest, while their leader headed to Europe's capitals to seek
assistance for his people.
	   Some 20,000 Kosovo Albanians marched through the main street of
the provincial capital Pristina bearing banners that read: ``NATO,
Kosovo is burning'' and ``NATO, tomorrow will be too late,'' and
carrying Albanian and U.S. flags.
	   The protesters fervently chanted ``U-C-K,'' the Albanian
language acronym for the Kosovo Liberation Army _ a militant
organization fighting to wrest the province away from Serbia _ and
sang a popular Albanian song, praising their ethnic leader Ibrahim
Rugova.
	   No police were present and the rally _ the 60th consecutive
protest in the capital _ ended peacefully.
	   No immediate violence was reported early Wednesday elsewhere in
the province, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs nine-to-one.
Kosovo's restless Albanian majority seeks independence from Serbia,
which stripped its autonomy in 1989 and has since ruled the
province with a heavy military and police presence.
	   More than 250 people have died in Kosovo escalating clashes
between between Yugoslav troops and ethnic Albanian militants began
in early March.
	   In last week's fighting alone, more than 50 people were killed
and 200 were missing and presumed captured in western parts of
Kosovo, according to ethnic Albanian sources.
	   Chased by the fighting, some 20,000 Kosovo Albanian refuges
flowed into northern Albania last week. An additional 10,000 fled
to the neighboring republic of Montenegro, which together with
Serbia makes up Yugoslavia.
	   Another 50,000 people have been displaced within Kosovo since
March, according to the Pristina-based Committee for the Defense of
Human Rights.
	   Meanwhile, Rugova headed for the European capitals of Paris and
London to attend meetings of the Contact Group nations, which
monitors developments in the former Yugoslavia, and seek help for
his people back home.
	   Demonstrations announced by the independent human rights
organization Society for Threatened Peoples, were to simultaneously
take place in European capitals, as well as Kosovo's provincial
capital Pristina, as well as in Albania and Macedonia.

Bus drivers end strike in Norway, nurses defy arbitration
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) - A strike by 10,000 transport workers ended
Wednesday with record pay raises of up to 13.7 percent, while
health workers in a separate labor conflict refused to immediately
respect a government order to return to work.
	   The transport workers, many of them public bus drivers, walked
out on May 14. The strike resulted in traffic jams, packed trains
and long taxi lines as Norwegians sought other ways to commute to
work.
	   The drivers had vowed to strike until their wages were raised to
match those of similar professions.
	   The transport workers' union and employers resumed talks
Tuesday, and reached a new contract during the night with pay hikes
of 8 to 13.7 percent.
	   ``This is a historic settlement,'' said Per Oestvold, leader of
the Transport Workers' Union.
	   About 1,600 nurses, nurse's aides and technicians remained on
strike despite a government order Tuesday binding them to
arbitration because the conflict threatened public health.
	   ``We totally disagree with that assessment,'' Laila Davoey,
leader of the striking nurses, was quoted as telling the Norwegian
news agency NTB. ``Only 1,100 of about 40,000 nurses are on strike.
This is not a situation that threatens life and health.''
	   The strike can legally continue until Parliament passes a
special law calling for binding arbitration. However, unions
traditionally end strikes as soon as the government orders a forced
arbitration.
	   The health personnel were among 3,800 Academic Union members
ordered to strike for better pay on May 28.

379 former Muslim rebels walk out of Philippine army training camp
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Several hundred former Muslim
rebels have walked out of an army training camp after complaining
of strictness and manhandling by trainers, the military said
Wednesday.
	   Col. Horacio Lapinid, spokesman of the military's Southern
Command, quoted trainers as saying some of the former rebels
``refused to follow training rules and are stubborn,'' causing a
breakdown in training.
	   The 379 trainees were part of the second batch of former Moro
National Liberation Front guerrillas to undergo six months of basic
infantry training before being absorbed into the army. The training
began June 1.
	   Abu Hamrik Tadik, a former MNLF official who is among those
overseeing the training, said the former rebels complained of being
punched and kicked by the Christian officers.
	   ``This is a big problem,'' Tadik said. er agreed to return to
camp and finished training.
	   A total of 7,500 former Muslim separatists are to be accepted
into the country's military and police forces under a peace accord
signed in 1996 that ended a quarter-century rebellion that killed
more than 120,000 people in southern Mindanao Island.
	   Two smaller Muslim rebel groups _ the fundamentalist Abu Sayyaf
and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front _ are still fighting the
government.
	   The government has begun peace talks with the MILF but the talks
have been put on hold until President-elect Joseph Estrada takes
office on June 30.

Taiwanese gangsters practice on stray dogs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwanese gangsters are training new
recruits by having them attack stray dogs with knives and acid, an
animal rights group claimed Wednesday.
	   The Animal Protection League said it has recorded 107 cases of
the abuse in the greater Taipei area as of the end of May.
	   Based on eyewitness reports, the attacks are carried out by
junior high school-age gang recruits taking part in group ``courage
building'' sessions, said Shen Jung-chen, the league's director.
	   The group's investigation was prompted by the discovery of
strays burned with acid in the Taipei suburb of Panchiao in May
1997, Shen said.
	   Newspapers have reported dozens of similar attacks on strays,
including one on the campus of prestigious National Taiwan
University. No perpetrators have ever been caught.
	   Taiwan has come under international criticism for its treatment
of strays. In many places, the dogs are housed at garbage dump
pounds and destroyed by drowning, poisoning or electrocution.
	   Animal rights groups have called for the passage of an animal
protection law to require strays be treated humanely.
	   The island is believed to have at least 5,800 gang members
belonging to 126 organized crime groups. Though handguns are their
weapon of choice, watermelon knives, acid and baseball bats are
also popular.

British cattle farmers relieved `mad cow' nightmare may be ending
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ From livestock auctions to cattle farms, Britain's
beef industry cautiously applauded Wednesday's news that the ``mad
cow'' nightmare could be ending, as European regulators sought to
lift an export ban.
	   ``It'll take the gloom out of the market,'' said David Williams,
who runs the Williams Wholesale slaughterhouse in tiny Woebley,
western England. ``It'll be a great morale booster for the whole
industry.''
	   Williams' wife, Sheila, alluded to more blows that the beef
dealers have suffered _ including the Labor government's ban of all
beef on the bone in Britain, based on the minuscule possibility
that T-bones or prime rib could give humans the incurable brain
ailment caused by the mad cows.
	   ``Is that bone-in, or bone-out?'' Mrs. Williams asked as the
European Commission recommended that British farmers be allowed to
export beef and most products from animals older than six months
and younger than 30 months.
	   Actually, the bones will have to be out, and the EC
recommendation doesn't yet end British cattle farmers' troubles.
	   The farmers have bitterly complained that they make some of the
world's best beef but have seen the product unfairly tarnished by
British government bumbling and European politics.
	   The crisis erupted in March 1996 when Britain acknowledged a
link between cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE,
and the fatal human brain ailment Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.
	   European Union veterinary experts still must study Wednesday's
recommendation on lifting the export ban, and it could be put to a
vote of agriculture commissioners from the 15 EU nations.
	   ``We've now turned the corner and we're in the home straight,''
said Ben Gill, president of the National Farmers Union. ``The
momentum must not be lost. We are confident that the huge weight
which has burdened the farming community for more than two years
will soon be removed.''
	   At the Hereford Cattle Society in Hereford, the English town
that shares the name of the famous cattle breed, secretary David
Prothero said his members also are pulling for an end to the ban on
live exports.
	   The Hereford breeders have sold cattle to make herds all over
the world, and they were hit by an export ban in 1990, years before
mad cow fears pushed British beef out of the international market.
	   The ban has forced the Hereford society to cut its staff from a
dozen workers to just four.
	   ``We've really been suffering,'' Prothero said. ``We think it's
been more political rather than down to any common sense that the
ban should remain.''

Neste four-month profit falls to dlrs 26 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Citing lower crude oil prices, the
Neste oil and gas group said Wednesday that its four-month pretax
profit fell to 139 million markkaa (dlrs 25.7 million) from 284
million markkaa in 1997.
	   Net sales during January to April also dropped, to 13.8 billion
markkaa (dlrs 2.5 billion), from 14.9 billion markkaa during the
same period last year.
	   Neste Group, Finland's second-largest company in terms of net
sales, said it was also hit by the economic crisis in Asia, but
expected an improvement in performance during the rest of the year.
	   ``Although the low crude oil price continues to affect Neste's
profitability, the group's running business operations are
estimated to be considerably better in 1998 than in 1997,'' the
company said in a statement.
	   In 1997, Neste's pretax profit increased by 73 percent to 983
million markkaa (dlrs 182 million).
	   Last year, Neste announced that it will sell its 50-percent
holding in Borealis, Europe's largest manufacturer of polyolefins
to the Austrian oil and gas company OMV and the International
Petroleum Investment Company of Abu Dhabi. The sale, worth 4
billion markkaa (dlrs 740 million), will give each company a
25-percent share in Borealis.
	   Neste, which is more than 90-percent state-owned, is active in
oil refining, energy and chemicals. It employs 9,000 people in more
than 30 countries.

Norway's annual inflation rate 2.1 percent in May

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway's inflation rate fell to 2.1 percent
for the 12 months ending on May 15, from 2.5 percent a month
earlier and 2.7 percent in May 1997, the state statistics agency
announced Wednesday.
	   Statistics Norway said the consumer price index for May was
275.4, compared to 275.8 in April and 269.7 in May 1997. All the
figures use 1979 as a base year with an index of 100.
	   The agency said lower electricity rates and a fall in clothing
prices were among the main reasons for the drop in inflation.

Nokia to expand further in China with new factory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Finnish telecommunications group Nokia
will build a new plant in the eastern Chinese province of Jiangsu,
to make digital mobile phone base stations and equipment, the
company said Wednesday.
	   The factory, to be situated in Suzhou Industrial Park, will
begin deliveries in 1999 and will employ 300 people in its first
phase. It will be Nokia's seventh production site in China.
	   Nokia views China as one if its most promising mobile phone
markets. Last year, it announced deals worth more than to dlrs 750
million to supply mobile phone networks and equipment to Chinese
customers.
	   In 1994, the first official digital mobile phone call in China
was made on a Nokia mobile phone and network.
	   Last year, Nokia had a record pretax profit of 8.4 billion
markkaa (dlrs 1.55 billion). It employs more than 38,000 people
worldwide.

Cholesterol-blocking margarine company's profit surges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Raisio Group more than doubled its
four-month pretax profit to 165 million markkaa (dlrs 30 million),
from 70 million markkaa in 1997, mainly because of growing sales of
cholesterol-blocking margarine, the company said Wednesday.
	   Net sales from January to April also increased, to 1.8 billion
markkaa (dlrs 333 million), from 1.6 billion markkaa during the
same period last year.
	   The margarine division's net sales fell slightly to 540 million
markkaa (dlrs 100 million), but Benecol _ the cholesterol-blocking
bread spread _ increased its turnover to 167 million markkaa (dlrs
31 million), up from 19 million markkaa in 1997.
	   Raisio, one of Finland's largest food, animal feed and chemical
groups, is best known for Benecol that inhibits the absorption of
the health-threatening form of cholesterol.
	   It introduced Benecol in 1995, but sales of the margarine had
been limited to Finland for more than two years due to a shortage
of the key raw material, plant sterol, a fat-soluble plant alcohol.
	   Now, the company says, it is increasing the production of plant
sterol at Raisio, and plans to build a factory near Charleston,

U.S. Treasury Secretary to visit Malaysia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin is scheduled to visit Malaysia at the end of June amid a
heated debate over interest rate policies among the nation's top
leaders.
	   Rubin will meet his counterpart, Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim,
during his June 28-29 visit, the national news agency Bernama
quoted Anwar's spokesman as saying Wednesday.
	   Diplomats at the U.S. embassy confirmed they have been informed
of Rubin's visit, which will follow a trip with President Bill
Clinton to China.
	   Rubin has reiterated that the United States has always been
ready to help crisis-hit Asian countries reform their sagging
economies which have been weakened by sharp currency depreciations
since last July.
	   He has also emphasized in a recent meeting of Asia-Pacific
finance ministers in Alberta, Canada, that reforms undertaken by
local governments must be accepted by their people.
	   ``If the difficult reform measures that are necessary to restore
confidence are going to work, there has to be a broad public
acceptance,'' he said.
	   Rubin's visit comes as the top echelon of Malaysia's government
debates the direction of the country's monetary policy.
	   Anwar, who is also deputy prime minister, has been pushing for
high interest rates, saying these were needed to prevent a run on
reserves and spiraling inflation.
	   Mahathir, however, has said the tight monetary policy and high
lending rates were hurting businesses and stifling economic growth.
	   Both Mahathir and Anwar have denied there was a rift between
them on economic policy.

Defense ministers to seek plans for Kosovo intervention
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES material from US-Kosovo-Cohen &QL; 
 &UR; JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ With the Serb-led Yugoslav army beefing
up its forces in separatist Kosovo province, NATO defense ministers
face a growing belief that the only way to stop the violence may be
direct military intervention.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen and his 15 NATO colleagues,
meeting at alliance headquarters here Thursday and Friday, are
expected to order military planners to take a hard look at the
intervention option, whether would be sending in troops, conducting
air strikes or enforcing a no-fly zone.
	   ``The worsening of the situation makes it more than advisable to
work out credible options for military action, to have them ready
for a political decision at any time,'' German Defense Minister
Volker Ruehe told reporters.
	   Cohen acknowledged ``a general consensus there should be
accelerated planning'' and that ``all NATO members feel an
increased sense of urgency.''
	   ``There is a genuine concern throughout the region that if this
goes unchecked, it could have much wider implications than just
Kosovo,'' he said.
	   In Kosovo, more than 250 people have died in clashes between
government forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, armed wing of the
Albanian independence movement. Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90
percent of the population in the southern province, demand
independence from Serbia, the larger of two republics in
Yugoslavia.
	   The United States and its allies support autonomy for Kosovo but
oppose demands for independence and condemn violence on both sides.
	   In recent days, entire villages in Kosovo have been flattened
and thousands of people driven from their homes.
	   ``Kosovo is in grave danger of becoming another Bosnia,'' said
Carlos Westendorp, the High Representative in Bosnia responsible
for enforcing the civilian aspects of the Dayton peace accords.
	   ``It is as if we repair one house, only to discover the one next
door is burning down,'' he said. ``This is supposed to be the year
of returns to Bosnia, but it is rapidly becoming the year of the
exodus from Kosovo.''
	   The United States and the European Union have imposed economic
sanctions on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, but few hold
out much hope that will result in a government pullback in Kosovo.
	   ``We have learned the Serbs don't respond to pressure unless it
is military pressure,'' said a senior NATO official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   NATO military planners have for the past two weeks been
following out earlier instructions to study indirect options for
pressuring Milosevic. Those include dispatching up to 20,000 troops
to neighboring Albania and Macedonia. That would include
reinforcing the existing 750-man U.N. force in Macedonia and
helping both countries secure their borders while dealing with
refugees and arms smuggling.
	   But, noted another NATO official, ``With the events of the last
week, shoring up the periphery seems of secondary value.''
	   Intervening in Kosovo, however, would require a sound legal
basis.
	   The United States is backing a British effort to win U.N.
Security Council approval for a resolution authorizing ``all
necessary measures'' to deal with the situation in Kosovo,
including direct military intervention.
	   However, President Boris Yeltsin says he will try to use his
influence with Milosevic, but remains firmly against intervention.
	   NATO ministers will be consulting with their Russian
counterpart, Igor Sergeyev, who will be here for a meeting of the
NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council.

Swiss artist who worked chocolate, waste paper, dead at 68
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Dieter Roth, an impish German-born
artist whose provocative works included art materials such as
sausage, waste paper and howling dogs, has died, his family
announced. He was 68.
	   Roth died at home of a heart attack last Friday, Swiss
newspapers reported.
	   He was a sculptor, poet, video and graphic artist, book
publisher and cacophonic musician whose works included many
scatological references. He explored everyday objects for their
artistic value.
	   Roth described himself as a ``slugger'' who liked to ``punch
everyone in the nose.'' He had lectured at Yale University and at
times lived in Philadelphia, Denmark and Iceland.
	   Born in 1930 to a Swiss father and a German mother in Hanover,
Germany, he first came to Switzerland in 1943 to escape World War
II. He studied graphic art in Bern and in 1953 launched an art
periodical, ``Spirale.''
	   Roth's first forays into art were geometrical drawings, but he
soon found that too limiting and, as he described it, began to
``smear.''
	   His 1950s exhibits soon branched into improvisational performing
art with a concert of howling dogs.
	   Following his ``accumulation principle,'' in 1976 he declared
300 binders of his waste paper to be a work of art. In 1987 his
exhibit in Hamburg, Germany, included table cloths covered with
random stains, notes and doodles.
	   He often featured food _ from chocolate-covered glass busts of
Beethoven to sausage _ and saw their deterioration in exhibits as
foreshadowing his own death.
	   He liked to give himself humorous German aliases, such as Otto
Hase (hare), Max Plunderbaum (trashtree) and Fax Hundetraum (dog
dream.)
	   He continued active until his death. Last year he made a
150-hour-long video of a sheep titled ``Solo scenes.''
	   An exhibit of his work was held in New York earlier this year.
Currently there are exhibits in Vienna and Zurich.
	   He is survived by two sons, Bjoern and Karl, and a daughter,
Vera.
	   A notice in the Basler Zeitung on Wednesday omitted funeral
details, but said only that the burial would be conducted in the
most intimate circle.

Indonesian social groups claim Chinese women raped by rioters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IRWAN FIRDAUS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian human rights and women's
groups Wednesday claimed dozens of ethnic Chinese women were raped
and assaulted during a wave of rioting that rocked Jakarta last
month.
	   An official estimate says at least 1,188 people were killed in
the violence, which help forced ex-President Suharto to resign,
ending 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   Volunteer social workers said some attacks appeared to be
carried out so as to terrorize the minority Chinese community when
the violence climaxed on May 13 and 14.
	   ``Women were gang raped in front their neighbors. Some were
stripped naked and forced to dance. They were humiliated,'' said
Nugroho Katjasungkana a volunteer from a coalition of social
welfare groups.
	   He said more than 100 cases had been documented.
	   Many of the rapes were allegedly committed by mobs who broke
into Chinese-owned shops and homes that were also looted and set
afire.
	   Some victims were badly beaten and wounded. Others trapped in
burning houses.
	   Similar reports had been made in other cities and towns where
rioting took place.
	   The Jakarta Post newspaper quoted Ita Nadia of the women's group
Kalyanamitra as describing some attacks as ``brutal, inhumane and
heartless.''
	   She cited one case of a 12-year-old girl being raped by a group
of seven intruders who forced her parents to watch.
	   One man said a group of rapists mutilated his wife with a razor.
	   Another man said his two sisters were gang raped and then thrown
into a burning building where they died.
	   Indonesia's Chinese Christian and Buddhist minority make up only
about 4 percent of the predominately Muslim population of 202
million.
	   The Chinese dominate the country's economy and industry and have
been attacked as scapegoats as inflation and mass unemployment
soars during Indonesia's worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   The government-appointed National Human Rights Commission has
said that Chinese have been targeted. It is now investigating the
rape allegations as well as other cases of violence against
Chinese.
	   Last weekend new President B.J. Habibie called on Indonesians to
end racial discrimination against the Chinese community.
	   Social workers said investigations into individual rape cases
would be difficult.
	   Rape victims in traditionally conservative Indonesia are often
too shamed or afraid to press charges. The anarchy that reigned
during the rioting might also make it difficult to locate
independent witnesses and identify suspects.
	   Police have said they have no reports of multiple rapes during
the riots. However, they admit that many victims won't come forward
with official complaints.

Ban on beef gelatin imports lifted as of July 1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The government has decided to lift a
6-months-old ban on beef gelatin imports from the European Union,
effective July 1.
	   At a session late Tuesday, the government decided not to extend
the temporary ban which is in force until June 30. But import
certificates will be checked at border crossings to eliminate
imports from countries which had cases of the deadly mad cow
disease, a government statement said.
	   On Jan. 1 the Solidarity-led government of Jerzy Buzek
introduced a ban on all EU gelatin imports, after experts said it
may cause the disease.
	   The ban on all gelatin except beef was lifted Feb. 17, following
media criticism that Poland's main gelatin producer profited from
the situation.

Thousands protest Serb attacks, ethnic leader to Europe

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Decrying the latest Serb aggression,
thousands of ethnic Albanians took to the streets of Pristina in
protest Wednesday, while their leader headed to Europe's capitals
to seek assistance for his people.
	   Some 20,000 Kosovo Albanians marched through the main street of
the provincial capital Pristina bearing banners that read: ``NATO,
Kosovo is burning'' and ``NATO, tomorrow will be too late,'' and
carrying Albanian and U.S. flags.
	   The protesters fervently chanted ``U-C-K,'' the Albanian
language acronym for the Kosovo Liberation Army _ a militant
organization fighting to wrest the province away from Serbia _ and
sang a popular Albanian song, praising their ethnic leader Ibrahim
Rugova.
	   No police were present and the rally _ the 60th consecutive
protest in the capital _ ended peacefully.
	   No immediate violence was reported early Wednesday elsewhere in
the province, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs nine-to-one.
Kosovo's restless Albanian majority seeks independence from Serbia,
which stripped its autonomy in 1989 and has since ruled the
province with a heavy military and police presence.
	   More than 250 people have died in Kosovo escalating clashes
between between Yugoslav troops and ethnic Albanian militants began
in early March.
	   In last week's fighting alone, more than 50 people were killed
and 200 were missing and presumed captured in western parts of
Kosovo, according to ethnic Albanian sources.
	   Chased by the fighting, some 20,000 Kosovo Albanian refuges
flowed into northern Albania last week.
	   An additional 10,000 fled to the neighboring republic of
Montenegro, which together with Serbia makes up Yugoslavia. The
Montena-fax independent news agency in Montenegro reported a
``river of refugees'' was crossing dense, mountainous territory on
foot to reach Montenegro.
	   Another 50,000 people have been displaced within Kosovo since
March, according to the Pristina-based Committee for the Defense of
Human Rights.
	   Meanwhile, Rugova headed for the European capitals of Paris and
London to attend meetings of the Contact Group nations, which
monitors developments in the former Yugoslavia, and seek help for
his people back home.
	   Demonstrations announced by the independent human rights
organization Society for Threatened Peoples, were to simultaneously
take place in European capitals, as well as Kosovo's provincial
capital Pristina, as well as in Albania and Macedonia.

Philippine Airlines declares pilot strike over, to reduce
</HEADLINE>
operations
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with striking pilots offering to return to work but
airline refusing to accept them in new grafs 9-11
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Financially beleaguered Philippine
Airlines announced Wednesday it will no longer accept back about
600 striking pilots and will sharply reduce its operations to match
the few pilots it now has.
	   In a surprise move, the airline said it will sell some of its 54
aircraft, including several just purchased, and concentrate on
domestic routes to cope with the effects of the five-day walkout.
	   The airline said it now considers the strike over because the
pilots defied a government back-to-work order Tuesday and have all
been fired.
	   PAL said it will operate with just 25 management pilots _ senior
pilots who train other pilots _ until it is able to hire and train
new personnel.
	   It has already begun the process of hiring replacements, it
said.
	   ``The strike is over and a downsized Philippine Airlines emerges
from the five-day illegal walkout,'' it said in a statement.
	   ``The move will maximize PAL's limited capacity to sustain
financial viability under the present circumstances,'' it said.
	   The union repeatedly resisted attempts by the labor department
to formally deliver the back-to-work order and continued its
walkout despite appeals from President Fidel Ramos.
	   In a meeting called Wednesday by labor officials, however, the
strikers appeared to have softened their stand and offered to go
back to work if the airline guaranteed there would be no
retaliatory actions or salary cuts.
	   A PAL representative rejected the offer and said the airline
considered all strikers terminated, causing the talks to bog down.
Another meeting was set Thursday.
	   ``This is just a publicity stunt of PAL to break the resolve and
morale of the strikers,'' union spokesman Capt. Florendo Umali said
of the airline's announcement it will scale down operations.
	   The pilots began the strike Friday to protest a management
policy of ordering pilots to retire who have reached 20 years of
service or flown 20,000 hours, regardless of age. The policy puts
about 200 pilots in danger of forced retirement, the union said.
	   PAL, however, said it was not a unilateral management policy but
a provision in a collective bargaining agreement signed by airline
and union officials.
	   The airline earlier announced plans to sharply reduce staff,
slash costs and cut flights to survive its long-term financial
problems.
	   PAL said the strike has cost it about 150 million pesos (dlrs
3.8 million) a day in lost revenue. It said it lost 8 billion pesos
(dlrs 205 million) in the last fiscal year _ three times more than
the previous year.
	   PAL president Jose Antonio Garcia said the strike caused several
potential foreign buyers of the airline, including Northwest
Airlines, to break off talks.
	   The strike has affected thousands of passengers and is
threatening to prevent many Filipino and foreign guests from
visiting the country to celebrate the June 12 centennial of the
Philippines' declaration of independence from more than 300 years
of Spanish colonial rule.
	   PAL earlier tried to recover from its spiraling losses with an
ambitious dlrs 4 billion modernization program, ordering 36 new
aircraft. But Asia's currency crisis sharply reduced passenger
numbers and bloated the airline's debt in local currency terms,
forcing it to delay many of the orders.
	   PAL, Asia's first airline, is controlled by Chinese Filipino
tycoon Lucio Tan. It had been completely owned by the Philippine
government until it was partly sold in 1992.

World Cup: Soccer succeeds where politics fails _ in uniting Arabs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TAREK EL-TABLAWY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ For centuries, Arab and Muslim
leaders have tried to unite the Arab Middle East's diverse peoples.
But where tangible steps could have been taken, rhetoric often
prevailed.
	   Soccer now appears to be fostering a sense of unity among Arabs
at the World Cup.
	   With three Arab countries participating in the France 1998, Arab
soccer fans here say that while they would like their respective
team to win, they will be more than happy if Morocco, Tunisia or
Saudi Arabia make it to the second round _ or even the
quarterfinals.
	   ``The important thing is not that a particular Arab team win,
but that just one of them makes a decent showing. That way, we, as
Arabs, can hold our head up high before the world,'' Youssef
Hussein, a 42-year-old Tunisian subcontractor living in Marseille,
told The Associated Press.
	   If history has a say in this Cup competition, the face-saving
Hussein wants may be delivered by a strong Moroccan team which, in
the 1986 Mexico World Cup, became the first African country to
reach the final 16.
	   ``Naturally, I'm rooting for Tunisia. It is, after all, my
country,'' said Hussein, who had the red Tunisian flag draped
across his shoulders like a cape.
	   ``But if Morocco or Saudi advances, I'd be delighted. They are,
after all, Arab teams and we are, first and foremost Arabs.''
	   In Montpellier, host of the Group A Morocco-Norway match
Wednesday evening, other Arabs shared Hussein's spirit of
unanimity.
	   About 50 Morocco supporters from Egypt and Jordan, as well as
Morocco, unfurled a large Moroccan flag and chanted in Arabic,
``With our blood, with our soul, we support you Morocco.'' The
chant is a modified version of a popular rallying cry for the
charismatic president of Egypt in the 1950s and 1960s, Gamal
Abdel-Nasser. He is still celebrated 27 years after his death for
his efforts to unite the Arab world.
	   Egyptian Tamer Sayed, 29, said the only thing Arabs have been
able to agree on is that they ``hate Israeli occupation of Arab
land.''
	   Soccer may not be ``all that important compared to peace, but
it's about all we have that's not political or religious,'' said
Sayed, who traveled from Belgium to join Moroccan friends in
rooting for the team.
	   One way of boosting Arab achievements in soccer, suggested
Hussein, the subcontractor, would be to set up an Arab national
team made up of the best players in the Arab world.
	   ``But it is, of course, just a dream _ like the Arab common
market,'' he said, referring to a plan proposed in the 1960s that
would offer greater opportunities for integrating Arab economies.

Korean immigrant in the U.S. to invest dlrs 200 million back home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Responding to a call for help from his
native country, a Korean-born American businessman will invest dlrs
200 million in South Korea's financially troubled Cho Hung Bank,
his spokesman said Wednesday.
	   Jeong Kim, 37, jumped onto the Fortune magazine's list of the
100 richest high-tech executives in the United States when he sold
his small Yurie Systems Inc. to Lucent Technologies Inc. for dlrs 1
billion in April.
	   Kim got dlrs 510 million under the deal, with the rest going to
the other shareholders of Yurie Systems, based in the Washington
suburb of Landover, Md.
	   ``Mr. Kim's decision reflects his desire to play a role in
helping his native country,'' said Kim Young-moon, an executive of
Yurie Korea Inc.
	   Kim is among the more successful of the over 1 million ethnic
Koreans in the United States. Now on a trip to Washington,
President Kim Dae-jung has urged them to invest back home to save
the battered Korean economy.
	   Cho Hung Bank officials were talking with Kim on the terms of
the investment. Cho Hung, one of Korea's top five commercial banks,
said it wanted Kim to buy new shares the bank planned to issue.
	   South Korean banks are desperately seeking foreign investment to
help rebuild their depleted capital base. They have been crippled
by a wave of loan defaults since the country's economic crisis
began last year.
	   Kim's investment will be the second major inflow of foreign cash
into the troubled banks. In May, Commerzbank AG of Germany said it
would invest dlrs 250 million in Korea Exchange Bank.
	   Kim's family emigrated to the United States when he was 14. He
put himself through school by working nights at 7-Eleven and went
on to establish his company just six years ago.
	   Yurie, with about 240 employees, made equipment for Internet
service providers, telephone companies, and corporations that
connect their communications networks to very high-speed
technology.
	   Kim remains with his old company as president of Lucent's
carrier networks division.

Bosnia's Muslim President says he may seek revision of Dayton
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ If those obstructing peace
implementation come to power in September elections in Bosnia, its
Muslim president says he will request a revision of the Dayton
peace agreement.
	   Alija Izetbegovic, the chairman of Bosnia's three-man presidency
spoke Tuesday in Luxembourg at a session of international officials
overseeing peace implementation in the wartorn Balkan nation.
	   ``Our standpoint is clear: either full implementation of the
Dayton peace agreement or its revision,'' Izetbegovic said in
comments carried by Bosnian state TV.
	   It was the first time the Bosnian Muslim side spoke of possible
revision.
	   While the United States and its allies are most unlikely to
agree to any change in the Bosnian peace pact, the Muslims,
claiming protracted obstruction by the other two ethnic groups,
might not feel obliged to comply either.
	   At the same session, Carlos Westendorp, the top international
official in Bosnia, praised the peace process as a ``success,'' but
conceded there were also ``disappointments.''
	   He listed such issues as a common flag, currency and passport
that had been agreed upon, saying the return of refugees was also
on the increase.
	   However, these symbols of Bosnian nationhood had to be imposed
by Westendorp because no agreement could be reached among leaders
of the three ethnic groups _ Muslims, Croats and Serbs.
	   Westendorp urged the people of Bosnia to use the chance of the
September elections to vote for those who will bring the country
forward.

Myanmar says economy grew 4.6 percent, short of target
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's economy grew 4.6 percent in the
last fiscal year, failing to reach the targeted growth rate of 6.4
percent, according to newly-released official statistics seen
Wednesday.
	   Statistics issued by the National Planning and Economic
Development Ministry said the country's gross domestic product for
the fiscal year ending March 31, 1998 totalled 74.329 billion kyat,
equal to dlrs 12.4 billion at the official rate of exchange, or
dlrs 256.3 million on the free market.
	   Per capita income for 1997-98, calculated at 1985-86 constant
price, increased 2.7 percent to 1,532 kyat (about dlrs 255 at the
official exchange rate compared to 1,492 kyat (dlrs 249) for
1996-97.
	   The official report attributed the lagging growth to the
disappointing performance of the agricultural sector, which
dominates the economy.
	   The sector's poor performance was due to a decrease in
production of wetlands rice because of flash floods and a decline
in oil crop production due to drought, the ministry's report said.
	   A growth rate of 6.2 percent is earmarked for the current fiscal
year ending March 31, 1999, the report said.
	   Many Western economists look skeptically at official statistics
from Myanmar _ also known as Burma _ since foreign exchange
controls foster a huge underground economy. The large scale export
of opium and heroin and other illicit drugs also contributes
unaccounted transfers to the economy.

Opposition softens stance on upcoming NATO enlargement vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The center-right opposition softened its stance
Wednesday on an upcoming vote on NATO enlargement a day after
threatening to bring down Premier Romano Prodi's government.
	   While in favor of NATO's plans to enlarge, the opposition had
vowed it would not bail out Prodi when the vote comes up in the
Chamber of Deputies this month.
	   ``When the time comes to make a decision, we will act as men of
the West,'' media mogul Silvio Berlusconi, the opposition leader,
said Wednesday.
	   He suggested the opposition may abstain, but quickly added that
no decision has been made.
	   The government lacks a majority in the Chamber and generally
depends on the votes of a hard-line Communist party. The
Communists, however, are opposed to the NATO alliance and the party
said it would vote against the Western alliance's expansion to the
east.
	   In the meantime, Prodi's political allies are hoping to persuade
Fausto Bertinotti, leader of the Communist Refoundation party, to
keep the government afloat while allowing parliamentary approval of
NATO expansion.
	   ``We are looking for a way out,'' said Achille Occhetto,
president of the Chamber's Foreign Affairs commission.
	   He indicated a solution would involve parliamentary procedure,
such as the Communist deputies leaving the hall before the vote.
	   The political opposition was emboldened by a strong showing in
local elections Sunday.
	   ``Only in Italy can a vote on NATO hinge on the election of some
mayors,'' Occhetto said.
	   The Senate has already approved NATO expansion. The vote will
come up in the Chamber the week of June 22. bsdy

Spanish authorities seize four tons of hashish in southern Spain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HUELVA, Spain (AP) _ About four tons of hashish were seized
Wednesday from a Portuguese boat in waters off this southwestern
port, local authorities said.
	   The boat, the Sotovento, was seized after the maritime customs
agents boarded the vessel and discovered 150 bundles of hashish,
said Antonio Sotelo, spokesman for the local interior ministry.
	   Six people on the boat _ nationalities and identities were not
available _ were arrested on smuggling charges, Sotelo said.
	   Spain's southern shore is a major entry point for hashish being
smuggled into Europe.

Hong Kong's leader rules out change in currency peg
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stock figures, additional comments from
Tung
 &UR; AP Photo Available

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa
insisted Wednesday the government will keep its 14-year currency
peg to the U.S. dollar, despite increasing calls for action to help
Hong Kong fight a liquidity crunch.
	   His comments immediately pushed up interest rates, which in turn
dragged the benchmark stock index further down to close at its
lowest level in three years.
	   Despite the fall in the stock market and persistent pessimism
over Hong Kong's economic future, Tung told reporters minutes
before trading that the government will not inject funds to keep
the financial markets from sliding further.
	   At the conference, Tung said floating the currency would ``cause
speculative attacks against the Hong Kong dollar and increase
interest rates.''
	   ``The government will maintain Hong Kong's long-held tradition
of fiscal prudence,'' Tung said.
	   The news pushed the benchmark three-month interest rate up to
10.375 percent in early afternoon, up from 9.25 percent early
Wednesday. The one-month rate soared to 11.0 percent from 9.625
percent.
	   The surge in interest rates triggered a 4.9-percent plunge in
the blue-chip Hang Seng Index.
	   The index tumbled 412.09 points, or 4.9 percent, to close at
7,979.37, the lowest level in three years, adding to Tuesday's
2.3-percent fall.
	   Tung said that recent pressure on the territory's currency was
due to the weakness of the Japanese yen.
	   The weakening yen dragged down most Southeast Asian currencies
Wednesday and compounded fears of a possible yuan devaluation,
which would leave the Hong Kong dollar's firm peg to the U.S.
dollar in a precarious position.
	   Fueling the fear was mainland central bank governor Dai
Xianglong's remark Tuesday that the falling Japanese yen would
exert a negative impact on China's foreign trade, though the
People's Bank of China official reiterated a pledge to keep the
Chinese currency stable.
	   The Hong Kong government is under increasing pressure at home to
float the Hong Kong currency as interest rates remain high, making
borrowing extremely difficult for local companies and eating into
their profits.
	   Pressure also mounted for the government to increase public
spending and make further tax cuts to lift the economy. A coalition
of seven political parties and several independent legislators,
forming a majority in the newly-elected legislature, has said they
would back a deficit budget if necessary.
	   But Tung hinted the government would not consider budgeting a
deficit, saying that would bring a new round of currency
speculation against the Hong Kong dollar.
	   ``If we have a deficit budget ... foreign speculators would
doubt our confidence in our currency peg and attack they would
attack our dollar,'' Tung said.
	   He also ruled out dipping into the reserves to lift Hong Kong's
weakening economy, which shrank 2 percent in the first quarter this
year, the first contraction in 13 years.
	   This ``is a free market. The government will not interfere,'' he
said. Hong Kong's ``stock market will stabilize when stability
returns to the region.''

Thousands protest Serb attacks, ethnic leader to Europe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with protests, Rugova in Europe, information on
refugees in Montenegro &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Decrying the latest Serb aggression,
thousands of ethnic Albanians took to the streets of Pristina in
protest Wednesday, while their leader headed to Europe's capitals
to seek assistance for his people.
	   Some 20,000 Kosovo Albanians marched through the main street of
the provincial capital bearing banners that read: ``NATO, Kosovo is
burning'' and ``NATO, tomorrow will be too late,'' and carrying
Albanian and U.S. flags.
	   The protesters fervently chanted ``U-C-K,'' the Albanian
language acronym for the Kosovo Liberation Army _ a militant
organization fighting to wrest the southern province away from
Serbia _ and sang a popular Albanian song, praising their ethnic
leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   No police were present. The rally _ the 60th consecutive protest
in the capital _ ended peacefully.
	   No immediate violence was reported early Wednesday elsewhere in
the province, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
Kosovo's restless Albanian majority seeks independence from Serbia,
which stripped its autonomy in 1989 and has since ruled the
province with a heavy military and police presence.
	   More than 250 people have died in escalating clashes in Kosovo
between Yugoslav troops and ethnic Albanian militants began in
early March.
	   In last week's fighting alone, more than 50 people were killed
and 200 were missing and presumed captured in western parts of
Kosovo, according to ethnic Albanian sources.
	   Chased by the fighting, some 20,000 Kosovo Albanian refuges
flowed into neighboring northern Albania last week.
	   An additional 10,000 fled to the neighboring republic of
Montenegro, which together with Serbia makes up Yugoslavia. The
Montena-fax independent news agency in Montenegro reported a
``river of refugees'' was crossing dense, mountainous territory on
foot to reach Montenegro.
	   Another 50,000 people have been displaced within Kosovo since
March, according to the Pristina-based Committee for the Defense of
Human Rights.
	   Meanwhile, Rugova headed for the European capitals of Paris and
London to attend meetings of the Contact Group nations, which
monitors developments in the former Yugoslavia, and seek help for
his people.
	   Demonstrations announced by the independent human rights
organization Society for Threatened Peoples were to simultaneously
take place in European capitals.

Army bid to build ill-fated bridge rejected as too expensive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The Israeli army offered to build a
bridge strong enough to bear tank traffic for the ill-fated opening
ceremonies of the Maccabiah Games, but was turned down because its
bid cost too much, a general testified Wednesday.
	   The bridge that was eventually built by a private company for
less than half the cost collapsed during the opening ceremony of
the games last summer, killing four Australian athletes and
injuring dozens of others.
	   About 100 Australian athletes were on the bridge when it
buckled, plunging them into the polluted river below.
	   Two contractors, the engineer who designed the bridge, the
director of the event and the chairman of the Maccabiah organizing
committee are being tried on charges of negligent homicide and
building without proper permits. They face up to three years in
prison if convicted.
	   Two army officers testified Wednesday for the prosecution, which
is trying to show that the event organizers acted to cut costs at
the expense of safety.
	   Brig. Gen. On Ragonis said the army had offered to build the
bridge for 288,000 shekels (about dlrs 82,000)
	   Yoram Eyal, the chairman of the organizing committee, asked for
the price to be lowered, and appealed to Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai to build the bridge for free, Ragonis said.
	   The civilian contractor that was eventually chosen entered a bid
of 120,000 shekels (about dlrs 34,000).
	   ``The Maccabiah organizing committee wanted the army to
construct the bridge,'' Ragonis said. ``Yoram Eyal asked us to
lower the price to the level of the civilian contractors.''
	   Another witness, Lt. Col. Avi Matzur, said the army would have
built a 12-section Bailey bridge designed for tank convoys to pass
over.
	   ``The army has been building such bridges for 50 years,'' Matzur
said.
	   Ragonis said that in the past, the army would have built the
bridge for free. But the military is being streamlined and now
charges to cover its costs, he said.
	   Ragonis added that the army provided considerable logistical
support to games for free, including military orchestras and an air
force flyby.

Saudi oil minister in Iran to push for production cutbacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi met with his
Iranian counterpart Wednesday to lobby Iran to cut oil production
in an attempt to boost prices.
	   Al-Naimi, who arrived in Tehran Tuesday, briefed Oil Minister
Bijan Namdar Zangeneh on the recent accord between Saudi Arabia,
Venezuela and Mexico to cut back 450,000 barrels a day from the
market, Iran's state-run Tehran radio reported.
	   Al-Naimi has been touring the region to push for additional
cutbacks to boost sagging prices that have hovered around dlrs 14 a
barrel, some 20 percent lower than last year despite cuts in daily
global production by 1.5 million barrels a day.
	   Iran, the second-largest exporter in the 11-nation Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, has reportedly been exceeding the
pledged cuts it made in March.
	   Iran had agreed to cut 140,000 barrels a day but wanted the cuts
to come from its daily quota of 3.94 million barrels rather than
its actual production level, which fluctuates but is considerably
lower than the quota.
	   Al-Naimi earlier visited Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and Qatar
and non-OPEC producer, Oman.
	   He secured a pledge from Qatar to cut 20,000 barrels per day
starting July 1.

379 former Muslim rebels walk out of Philippine army training camp

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Several hundred former Muslim
rebels have walked out of an army training camp after complaining
of strictness and manhandling by trainers, the military said
Wednesday.
	   Col. Horacio Lapinid, spokesman of the military's Southern
Command, quoted trainers as saying some of the former rebels
``refused to follow training rules and are stubborn,'' causing a
breakdown in training.
	   The 379 trainees were part of the second batch of former Moro
National Liberation Front guerrillas to undergo six months of basic
infantry training before being absorbed into the army. The training
began June 1.
	   Abu Hamrik Tadik, a former MNLF official who is among those
overseeing the training, said the former rebels complained of being
punched and kicked by the Christian officers.
	   ``This is a big problem,'' Tadik said. ``It is an illegal act of
the military trainers. There should be an investigation of the
incident.''
	   Lapinid said 20 former rebels originally walked out of the 1st
Infantry Division in Pagadian City in Zamboanga del Sur province.
They forced 180 others to join them through beatings and threats of
harm to their families, Lapinid said. Later, the remaining 179
joined the walkout.
	   An earlier batch of 1,101 Moro National Liberation Front rebels
completed training in January and are now in the army. A similar
incident occurred with the first batch but they later agreed to
return to camp and finished training
	   A total of 7,500 former Muslim separatists are to be accepted
into the country's military and police forces under a peace accord
signed in 1996 that ended a quarter-century rebellion that killed
more than 120,000 people in southern Mindanao Island.
	   Two smaller Muslim rebel groups _ the fundamentalist Abu Sayyaf
and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front _ are still fighting the
government.
	   The government has begun peace talks with the MILF but the talks
have been put on hold until President-elect Joseph Estrada takes
office on June 30.

Police arrest eighth suspect for race fixing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ An eighth suspect has been arrested in connection
with an alleged doping and fixing scandal in English horse racing,
Scotland Yard said Wednesday.
	   A 55-year-old man was taken to central London police station
after raids Tuesday on five London locations. The man was released
on bail and ordered to reappear in September.
	   Scotland Yard would not release the man's name but said he was
not a jockey or a trainer.
	   The race-fixing investigation first came to light in January
when five men, including jump jockeys Leighton Aspell, Dean
Gallagher and Jamie Osborne, were arrested.
	   Aspell was cleared but his two riding colleagues were bailed to
reappear later this month. Two other men, including a professional
bettor, were arrested in February.
	   The police investigation was launched following the discovery of
illegal substances in the samples of Avanti Express and Lively
Knight, two horses beaten at short odds in jumps races in March
1997.
	   The police were called in to investigate the allegations of race
fixing after Jockey Club stewards discovered links between the two
doping incidents.
	   Jockey Club spokesman John Maxse said Wednesday that the man
arrested was not licensed by the Jockey Club and, therefore, it was
a police matter.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Hundreds of ethnic Albanians
demonstrated Wednesday against recent bloodshed in the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo and appealed for international intervention.
	   ``Violence in Kosovo has to stop immediately,'' said march
organizer Louis Gojani.
	   Although the United States and the European Union have imposed
new sanctions on Serbia, protesters want tougher military actions.
	   ``There must be international intervention. It's not important
how that happens, it's important that it will happen,'' said Gojani
of the Coordination Council of Albanians in the Netherlands.
	   Protesters marched to government buildings and handed petitions
to lawmakers and foreign ministry representatives.
	   Around 400 demonstrators participated in the march, according to
an estimate by local police.
	   More than 250 people have died this year in escalating clashes
between government forces and the pro-independence Albanian
militants, known as Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen and his NATO colleagues,
who are meeting in Brussels Thursday and Friday, are expected to
order military planners to take a hard look at possible military
measures.

U.S.-based Chinese dissident claims Chinese prisoners made World

 &UR; Eds: ADDS comment from Adidas spokesman, graf 5 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MACAU (AP) _ Shortly before the opening of World Cup Wednesday
in Paris, an exiled Chinese dissident claimed that Chinese
prisoners had made some of the footballs to be used in the matches.
	   Bao Ge, 34, who served three years in a labor camp in Shanghai,
told a press conference in Macau that he was among Chinese
prisoners forced to make ``make some Adidas footballs.''
	   Some of the balls, he said, were marked ``France 98 FIFA World
Cup, Official Championship Ball.''
	   But a spokesman for Adidas, the World Cup's official football
supplier, denied the allegations, saying the balls the prisoners
made were probably souvenir balls for other companies, not Adidas
footballs for World Cup matches.
	   Peter Csanadi, Adidas' director of global public relations said
in Herzogenaurach, Germany, that the design for the official
football ``wasn't even finalized yet'' when Bao was in prison, and
the match footballs were manufactured only in Morocco.
	   He added that about 20 other companies were licensed to use the
World Cup logo on souvenir balls, he said.
	   ``We believe (Bao) is acting in good faith,'' he said. ``We know
he is telling the truth,'' about making footballs with the World
Cup logo.
	   ``Either the balls were of these other companies or they were
counterfeit,'' said Csanadi.
	   Bao spent three years in a labor camp for political activism and
has been in exile in the United States since last November, shortly
after Chinese President Jiang Zemin's U.S. visit.
	   ``The guards in the camp compelled the prisoners to work at
least 15 hours a day, or even more. If the prisoners could not meet
the quotas for the day, they were penalized by having to stay up
all night without any sleep,'' Bao said.
	   Bao said he would file a lawsuit in Hong Kong against Adidas for
compesation for his work. He said other Chinese dissidents on exile
will sue the company in Germany and the United States.

Silver lining to Pakistan's economic woes: Finance Secretary
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Although the stock market is down,
the latest credit rating is poor and foreign currency accounts have
been frozen to prevent a panic exodus of U.S. dollars, there may be
a silver lining, Finance Secretary Moeen Afzal said Wednesday.
	   Pakistan may use this economic emergency to make some
fundamental changes to its economic policies, Afzal said.
	   Foreign currency accounts were frozen last month after Pakistan
tested six nuclear devices in response to its traditionally hostile
neighbor India, which conducted five nuclear tests.
	   Pakistan expected to be hit with severe economic sanctions as a
result of the testing, which it feared would spark a run on foreign
currency. Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves were at dlrs 1.3
billion, barely enough to pay six weeks of imports.
	   Afzal said changes may include taxing foreign currency accounts,
thus denying rich Pakistanis a tax shelter. Currently, the wealthy
in Pakistan can keep millions of dollars in foreign currency
accounts without having to pay taxes or explain the origins of the
money.
	   Monetary liberalization in Pakistan is barely seven years old.
When Pakistan encouraged foreign exchange accounts, Afzal said it
opened the door wide, promising not to ask the origins of the
money. Critics said that allowed people with black market or drug
money to legally launder it.
	   Afzal said the government wants to correct this, tighten up
regulations and have people pay taxes.
	   The government also wants to push forward with banking reforms
aimed at putting an end to loans with little or no collateral. It
also wants to collect millions of dollars in unpaid loans and widen
its tax net.
	   Barely 1 million people pay taxes in Pakistan and most of them
are small businessmen and professionals. Some of the elite,
including politicians, barely pay dlrs 100 in income tax.
	   It is expected that Pakistan's budget, which is being released
Friday, will be loaded with new tax measures.
	   The deficit is expected to be down to 5.4 percent, slightly over
the target of 5 percent. Inflation should drop to 8.5 percent down
from 10 percent.
	   Since India detonated its first series of nuclear devices on May
11, the Karachi Stock Exchange began a free fall, which has brought
it to a record low of 998 points. Standard and Poor's downgraded
Pakistan on June 1 to a single-B-minus from a single B-Plus and put
Pakistan on a creditwatch.

IMF top man in Asian returns to Indonesia as rupiah drops
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund's top
official in Asia arrived in Jakarta on Wednesday to oversee a
thorough review of the IMF-led assistance program for Indonesia.
	   Hubert Neiss flew into Jakarta after Indonesia's battered
currency dropped below 13,000 rupiah against the U.S. dollar as
financial markets doubted the economy would be able to recover any
time soon.
	   The IMF's dlrs 43 billion bailout was derailed last month when
protests and riots broke out, forcing ex-President Suharto to quit
after 32 years in power.
	   Loan installments under the plan were suspended amid the
political and social turmoil, which many feel have worsened
Indonesia's economic crisis, marked by soaring inflation and mass
unemployment.
	   The IMF wants Indonesia to make sweeping economic reforms.
	   ``The purpose of the visit is to review macroeconomic targets
and to continue the restructuring of the financial system and also
continue the structural reform,'' Neiss told reporters after his
arrival at Jakarta's Sukarno Hatta airport.
	   He said it would take ``two to three weeks'' to conduct the
review and only after then can the loan program resume.
	   This is Neiss' second visit to Jakarta in 10 days.
	   During his previous visit, Neiss met a veritable who's who of
the Indonesian establishment including government members,
prominent opposition leaders, even trade unionists.
	   Neiss said then that the fund would have to revise the
macroeconomic targets for the country, in the light of recent
developments in this sprawling Southeast Asian nation.
	   A team of IMF economists has been here since Monday to begin
that task.
	   The IMF was scheduled to disburse dlrs 1 billion from its dlrs
10 billion standby credit arrangement with Indonesia on June 4.
	   The prospect of the current review lasting two to three weeks
confirms the payment of that dlrs 1 billion installment is at least
a month away.
	   After revising the targets, Neiss will have to report to the
IMF's executive board, which can only then vote to release the next
tranche. The IMF has indicated however, that it will release the
aid once the review is complete.
	   The IMF is likely to predict a contraction in the Indonesian
economy of at least 10 percent, from a 5 percent contraction
estimated earlier.
	   The fund is also expected to revise its inflation and possibly
exchange rate targets, as well as other budgetary estimates.
	   The latest IMF program's exchange rate target is for 6,000
rupiah to the dollar by the end of the year, a figure most
economists dismiss now as wildly optimistic.

Saudi foreign minister consults with Mubarak on Arab summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Prince Saud
Al-Faisal on Wednesday discussed with President Hosni Mubarak the
prospects of an Arab summit on the Middle East peace process.
	   The meeting comes amid reports _ denied by Saudi Arabia _ that
the United States has pressured it to delay the summit, which had
anyway made little headway because of differences and doubts among
Arab leaders on the stand to be adopted against Israel.
	   Prince Saud told reporters that if a conference is held it
``should be on the highest level and well prepared to serve the
cause of peace and the Arab rights.'' He did not elaborate.
	   Arab leaders began discussing the summit after signs that the
United States has been unable to convince Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to
accept a compromise of a further 13 percent troops pullback from
the West Bank.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has been pushing for the
conference to put pressure on Israel to accept the compromise.
	   The United States had reportedly asked Arab leaders to postpone
the summit, arguing that it needed more time to persuade Netanyahu
to accept its suggestions.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ The country's military ruler is promising
democracy, but many Nigerians _ accustomed to years of political
deceit _ were reserving judgment Wednesday on their newest
generalissimo and his pledge.
	   In his first address to the nation Tuesday evening, Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar vowed to support a transition to civilian rule,
but gave no details on how the process would be carried out.
	   ``We don't want another Sani Abacha,'' said 25-year-old shoe
repairman Joseph Akpan. ``We've had enough Sani Abacha.''
	   To ordinary Nigerians life has gone quietly on since the death
this week of much their maligned dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha. Many
simply said they want an end to military rule.
	   Opposition leaders say they will go ahead with demonstrations on
Friday to mark the fifth anniversary of the day in 1993 when
presidential elections were canceled.
	   ``We are under no illusion that by Abacha's death, military rule
has come an end,'' the United Action for Democracy said in a
statement, adding ``the struggle against military rule in all its
guises will be renewed with vigor.''
	   On the streets of Lagos, Nigeria's sprawling commercial capital,
there were few signs that life had changed in any dramatic way in
recent days.
	   Flags flew at half mast at government offices in honor of
Abacha, but otherwise, the teeming city went about its daily
business.
	   The legacy of Abacha's leadership is visible everywhere in
Lagos, from the lines for gasoline that stretch for blocks to the
flickering electricity and the phones that can't call across town.
	   Abubakar, speaking on national television hours after he was
appointed by the ruling military junta to replace Abacha, also said
the country's many political exiles were welcome to return home.
	   ``I invite all Nigerians in self-exile to return home to join
the process of reconstruction and reconciliation,'' said the
general, who remained stone-faced throughout the five-minute
speech.
	   Such well-known exiles as Wole Soyinka, a writer and Nobel
laureate, have warned that the military must give way to civilian
leadership.
	   ``I'm afraid that if the military does not bow to the will of
the people, armed insurrection becomes inevitable,'' he said in
Jerusalem, where he was lecturing. ``The signs of it are already
there.''
	   Although Abubakar, a career soldier, gave no specifics on how
the military would hand power over to a civilian government, he
said his administration was committed to a transition process
introduced by Abacha.
	   ``We will do everything to ensure its full and successful
implementation,'' Abubakar said Tuesday night.
	   Earlier, Air Vice Marshal Mohammed Alfa, a senior military junta
aide, told reporters that Abubakar would turn the country over to
an elected civilian government by Oct. 1 _ but gave no details.
	   Civil rights groups, meanwhile, called for the release of jailed
businessman Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of the 1993
annulled presidential elections.
	   Abacha, a dictator well-known for his brutality, had long
promised that his transition program would end military rule in
Nigeria. But he was also widely seen as manipulating the system to
have himself transformed into a civilian ruler.
	   Though he never officially declared his candidacy, he was the
only person nominated by Nigeria's five registered political
parties for Aug. 1 presidential elections.
	   Countries around the world called for Nigeria's military, which
has ruled Nigeria for the vast majority of its 38 years of
independence, to finally step aside for good.
	   Abacha himself seized power in a 1993 coup. During his years in
power, about 7,000 government critics and dissidents were
imprisoned.
	   In Washington, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the
Clinton administration hoped that Abubakar would soon surrender
power. Similar calls for democracy in Nigeria came from France,
Britain and members of the Commonwealth of former British colonies.
	   Still, several nations in West Africa praised Abacha for making
his military a regional peacekeeper. Sierra Leone President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah was returned to power earlier this year as a direct
result of Nigeria's military intervention.
	   And Liberian President Charles Taylor called for a national day
of mourning for Abacha _ whose troops helped to implement peace
accords that ended seven years of civil war in Liberia.
	   In Lagos, which was officially in mourning, there were few signs
of tears over Abacha's death.
	   ``There's no reason to be upset,'' said Kehinda Suleiman, a
40-year-old Lagos resident. ``We're happy he's gone. He was not
such a good leader.''

	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Rejecting a presidential offer of special
status for their homeland within Indonesia, thousands of East
Timorese protested Wednesday, demanding the right to vote for full
independence and for the release of a jailed guerrilla leader.
	   More than 3,000 students and others gathered on the grounds of
the state-funded University of East Timor.
	   ``We want total independence. We want to be free,'' said one
protester Licinio Branco at the noisy but peaceful rally.
	   Organizers said Indonesia should allow a full and free
referendum on the future of East Timor.
	   They said the protest was the biggest since euphoric
celebrations were held to mark the awarding of the 1996 Nobel peace
prize to their Roman Catholic spiritual leader Bishop Carlos Belo.
	   On Tuesday in Jakarta, President B.J. Habibie signaled a
possible easing of Indonesia's tight control, saying he's ready to
grant special status to East Timor in exchange for peace in the
disputed territory.
	   On Wednesday Justice Minister Muladi said the 15 East Timorese
inmates would be released as soon as possible.
	   Another dissident would be released from a prison on Indonesia's
main island, Java, bringing to 20 the total number of political
prisoners freed since Habibie took office on May 21.
	   Habibie has made it clear that special status did not mean
political autonomy, and that imprisoned East Timorese rebel leader
Xanana Gusmao would remain behind bars.
	   Indonesia regards Gusmao as a criminal, saying he has committed
violent acts in his fight against Indonesia. He is serving a
20-year prison term in Jakarta's Cipinang Prison.
	   Gusmao has described Habibie as ``a clown.''
	   ``Habibie has no future. The 25 years he served (former
President) Suharto were the same 25 years that the East Timorese
and Indonesian people suffered repression and injustice,'' Gusmao
said in an interview broadcast Wednesday on Portuguese state radio
Antena RDP.
	   Habibie, a former Suharto Cabinet minister and longtime friend,
replaced the former autocrat as president last month. Suharto, who
ordered the 1975 invasion, steadfastly refused to make any
concessions toward East Timor.
	   And although the granting of special status for the territory
would be largely a symbolic gesture, Habibie's offer is being
regarded as a significant shift in policy.
	   Even so, protesters on Wednesday said it was not enough.
	   As well as a referendum, many at the Dili rally said they wanted
the immediate release of Gusmao.
	   Despite the size of the crowd, no uniformed military personnel
were seen, although organizers said that plainclothes intelligence
officers were mingling with the protesters.
	   Many said they felt freer to express their demands since Suharto
quit after 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   Habibie has promised sweeping political reform, raising hopes
that a more democratic Indonesia will emerge.
	   ``This is the best opportunity we have had in years and we have
got to take advantage of it,'' said demonstrator Norberto
Gonsalves.
	   Belo earlier asked the protesters to abandon plans to march
through the streets of Dili, fearing that it would only lead to a
violent confrontation with the Indonesian military.
	   In 1991 dozens were killed when troops opened fire on a protest
march.
	   On Wednesday demonstrators stayed safely on the university's
campus. They raised their fists in the air and sang rebel songs.
	   Some wore headbands with the word ``independence'' written on
them. Others briefly held up outlawed rebel flags. Some stood on
the roof of campus buildings and chanted anti-Indonesian slogans.
	   Indonesian troops invaded East Timor, a former Portuguese colony
in 1975, and annexed it the following year.
	   Since then the half-island territory has endured human rights
abuses while a guerrilla war rages between Indonesian forces and
separatist rebels.

Denmark, Faeroes settle lingering dispute over bank sale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Denmark and its semiautonomous Faeroe
Islands on Wednesday settled a five-year dispute over the sale of
the island's only bank that left the tiny archipelago with an
unmanageable debt burden.
	   The government of the Faeroe Islands, home to about 45,000
people north of Scotland, was encouraged by Denmark to buy the bank
Foeroya Banki in 1993, only to discover that it was 1.2 billion
kroner (dlrs 166 million) in debt.
	   Earlier this year, the 18-island Faeroes sued Denmark over the
sale, and an independent report criticized the Danish government
and Den Danske Bank, Denmark's largest bank, for pushing the sale
of the heavily indebted Faeroese bank.
	   After all-night talks Wednesday, Denmark's Finance Minister
Mogens Lykketoft and Faeroese Prime Minister Anfinn Kalsberg agreed
that Denmark would write off 900 million kroner (dlrs 129 million)
of islands' debt and make 500 million kroner (dlrs 71.4 million) of
debt interest free. The remaining debt of around 4 billion kroner
(dlrs 571 million) will be repaid over 20 years.
	   In return, the Faeroes agreed to drop their lawsuit against the
Danish government, which gives the islands about 1 billion kroner
(dlrs per 143 million) a year in aid, but would continue legal
action against Den Danske Bank.
	   The Faeroes rely on fishing, and suffered a severe slump in the
1980s and early 1990s when fish stocks declined. The islands
economy has showed signs of recovery in recent years.
	   Under a self-rule agreement, the islands' government handles
most domestic matters and leaves defense and foreign policy to
Denmark.

Report: Turkey excludes French firm from major defense deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with protest outside French embassy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey has excluded a major French defense
firm from a dlrs 150 million tender for aircraft in retaliation for
a motion by French deputies recognizing the alleged Armenian
genocide, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Turkey denies that the deaths of some 1.5 million Armenians
between 1915 and 1923 constituted genocide, insisting that losses
occurred on both sides as the result of a civil war.
	   The English-language Turkish Daily News said that Turkish
defense authorities would not invite Thomson CSF to bid for the
navy aircraft if the French Senate goes on to approve the motion.
	   Meanwhile, Turkey's civil servants trade union staged a protest
outside the French embassy in Ankara, chanting `` Down with French
Imperialism.''
	   They placed a black wreath outside the embassy, and called for a
boycott of French goods.

	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Relief workers distributed food and
searched for bodies in smashed homes Wednesday, a day after a
cyclone tore through western India, killing 216 people, injuring
1,200 and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless, officials said.
	   The toll from Tuesday's storm, the worst to hit India in 25
years, could rise, as many remain missing. Relief workers have yet
to reach some remote villages.
	   The death toll was highest in Kutch district, where a 12-foot
(3-meter) tidal wave flooded low-lying areas near Kandla port, 530
kilometers (330 miles) northwest of Bombay.
	   As many as 140 people, including fishermen and port workers,
drowned or were swept into the Arabian Sea, government officials
said. Nearly 125 people have been listed as missing. Officials fear
the casualty figure could reach 200 in Kutch alone.
	   The cyclone winds that reached speeds of up to 100 kph (65 mph),
uprooted trees, electricity poles and cut off road and
telecommunication links.
	   Other deaths and injuries were mainly caused by lightning and
collapsing houses in the rural districts of Junagadh, Bhuj, Valsad
and Jamnagar near Porbunder, where the storm first struck land, 450
kilometers (280 miles) northwest of Bombay.
	   Nearly 800 workers living in makeshift tin-roof camps at the
Reliance oil refinery project at Jamnagar were injured by flying
debris. Officials said 150 were hospitalized in a nearby town. The
district reported 35 casualties.
	   Some were injured by flying objects when they left their homes
believing the cyclone had passed, Reliance worker Parth Pandya said
by telephone from Kamnagar, 470 kilometers (295 miles) northwest of
Bombay.
	   Some 2,500 soldiers were called in to help restore
communications and distribute supplies in remote areas of Gujarat
state.
	   ``The worst hit were the salt factory workers in Kandla. They
are very poor people and didn't understand the gravity of the
warnings to stay away from the coast,'' said Kuntan Sanghvi, a
government official in Ahmedabad, the Gujarat state capital 465
kilometers (291 miles) north of Bombay,
	   The worst affected districts of Kutch, Jamnagar and Porbunder
were without electricity for the second day Wednesday. Thousands of
people spent the night in the streets after walls and roofs of
mud-and-thatch houses collapsed. Authorities moved some 20,000
people to safety before the cyclone struck.
	   Heavy rain fell throughout western India and eastern areas of
neighboring Pakistan following the cyclone.
	   Pakistan's port city of Karachi was battered by rains blamed for
the deaths of 12 people. Most of the victims, according to the
Associated Press of Pakistan, were electrocuted after high winds
toppled power lines and left live wires strewn across several busy
streets.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian Parliament's lower house on Wednesday
put off hearings on the START II arms reduction treaty from next
week until the fall, further delaying hopes of ratification.
	   Acting on ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky's proposal, the
State Duma voted 235-39 to postpone the hearings. The move reversed
a Duma decision last week to hold hearings June 16.
	   The hearings, which would precede a ratification debate, would
involve Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and other top officials
discussing why the treaty should be approved.
	   START II was signed in 1993 and ratified by the U.S. Senate in
1996. President Boris Yeltsin has been urging the Duma to do the
same. The treaty would halve Russian and American nuclear arsenals
to 3,500 warheads each.
	   Communists and nationalists dominating the Duma have balked at
ratifying START II, claiming that cutting strategic weapons would
harm Russia's security and be too expensive for the cash-strapped
nation.
	   Communist Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov has warned that the
hearings will be shelved if U.S. President Bill Clinton continues
to pressure Russia to pass the treaty.
	   Clinton has said he would prefer to come to Moscow for a
proposed summit with Yeltsin after START II has been ratified.
	   Retired Gen. Albert Makashov, a Communist deputy in the Duma,
backed Zhirinovsky's proposal to put off the hearings, saying that
the Kremlin wants them to exert pressure on lawmakers to ratify the
treaty.
	   ``It's Clinton who needs it,'' Makashov said.
	   Russian military leaders support ratification. They say that by
2007 _ the treaty's deadline for destroying weapons _ Russia's
intercontinental ballistic missiles with multiple warheads will be
at the end of their service life and will have to be discarded
anyway.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said Wednesday
that the government would continue pushing for the treaty's
ratification.
	   ``We will continue working with the State Duma, since we believe
that the ratification of START II is an important step for
Russia,'' Rakhmanin said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
``Ratification of START II will allow us to begin considering START
III which will provide stronger security guarantees.''

Saudi oil minister in Iran to push for production cutbacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi met with his
Iranian counterpart Wednesday to lobby Iran to cut oil production
in an attempt to boost prices.
	   Al-Naimi, who arrived Tuesday in Tehran, briefed Oil Minister
Bijan Namdar Zangeneh on the recent accord between Saudi Arabia,
Venezuela and Mexico to cut back 450,000 barrels a day from the
market, Iran's state-run Tehran radio reported.
	   Al-Naimi has been touring the region to push for additional
cutbacks to boost sagging prices that have hovered around dlrs 14 a
barrel, some 20 percent lower than last year despite cuts in daily
global production by 1.5 million barrels a day.
	   Iran, the second-largest exporter in the 11-nation Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, has reportedly been exceeding the
pledged cuts it made in March.
	   Iran agreed to cut 140,000 barrels a day but wanted the cuts to
come from its daily quota of 3.94 million barrels rather than its
actual production level, which fluctuates but is considerably lower
than the quota.
	   Al-Naimi earlier visited Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and Qatar
and non-OPEC producer, Oman.
	   He secured a pledge from Qatar to cut 20,000 barrels per day
starting July 1.

Spice Girls reveal communication with estranged member
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Spice Girls say they have talked with Geri
Halliwell, better known as Ginger Spice, since her controversial
departure from the band two weeks ago and that they wish her well.
	   They also hastened to assure their audiences that the rocking
and rolling will continue _ even minus one Spice.
	   ``Of course we've been in touch with her _ there's a lot of
things to sort out,'' Sporty Spice Melanie Chisholm said Tuesday
from Italy, where the band teamed up with Luciano Pavarotti for a
charity concert. ``We really do wish her well _ we want her to
succeed.''
	   Halliwell announced she was leaving the all-girl group ``because
of differences between us'' in a statement read by her lawyer May
31. She wished the four other Spices a successful future together
and left her audiences with the playful warning, ``P.S. I'll be
back.''
	   The four other members of the group that topped the charts with
the hit single ``Wannabe'' emphasized Tuesday that band turnover is
a reality of the profession.
	   ``OK, there's been a change in the lineup, but we're not the
first or the last people for that to happen to,'' Chisholm said.
	   ``We are sorry for our fans who've had to go through this, but
we know we are better than ever and there's loads to look forward
to,'' said Baby Spice Emma Bunton.
	   Scary Spice Melanie Brown said, ``I think our next album will be
better vocally. You have to turn a negative into a positive because
it's so easy to be negative.''
	   Posh Spice Victoria Adams said the four Spices are still on good
terms with Halliwell.
	   ``If Geri walked through the door now we would all be like,
`hello,' '' she said. ``It would be like friends meeting up. It's
not nasty, we've all said that. We all love each other and we all
love Geri.''
	   The Spice Girls are scheduled to tour the United States
beginning June 14 and said they will record their third album later
this year.

Mandela was target for chemical disabling, scientist alleges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CLARIFIES time sequence of intention to poison Mandela in top

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Officials in the apartheid-era
government plotted to mentally disable Nelson Mandela with poison
during the final years of his imprisonment and shortly thereafter,
a former government scientist testified Wednesday.
	   There was no suggestion that the plan was ever carried out.
After his release from prison in 1990, Mandela led his African
National Congress to victory in the nation's first all-race
elections in 1994 and became president.
	   Testifying before a panel probing apartheid crimes, Schalk van
Rensburg described how his superior, Andre Immelman, told him soon
after Mandela's release there were plans to poison him with
thallium, which attacks the nervous system.
	   ``The intention, I understood, was to reduce his level of
intellectuality and effectiveness by inducing brain damage,'' van
Rensburg said.
	   Van Rensburg said the aim was not to kill Mandela, but to
disable him. The plot was considered in the final years of
Mandela's imprisonment and at least for a short time afterward,
according to the scientist.
	   The white-run government started preparing Mandela for his
release as early as 1989, and began talks with him on ending
apartheid shortly after his release.
	   But the apartheid government apparently did not want him to be a
viable political opponent.
	   A 1986 report from the State Security Council, which coordinated
the crackdown on anti-apartheid activists, suggested Mandela could
be released only when he was in such a poor state of health that he
could not continue to lead the ANC.
	   The Truth and Reconciliation Commission is investigating the
former apartheid army's chemical and biological weapons projects,
headed by Wouter Basson, who ran the scheme through an elaborate
network of front companies.

	   THE greenback rose further against the ringgit last week after
the Malaysian Government said the economy declined by 1.8 per cent
year on year in the first quarter. News of a plan to take over
banks' non- performing loans failed to support the ringgit. The
greenback closed at 3.8900 last Friday, up from 3.8300 the week
before.
	   The Sing dollar ended the week higher last week even as both the
Sing dollar and the ringgit fell against the greenback. The Sing
dollar could drift sideways against the ringgit for a while. The
Sing closed at 2.3020 last Friday, from 2.2810 the week before.
	   The Japanese yen strengthened against the greenback and the
ringgit last week on talk that the G-7 nations would call for a
stronger yen over the weekend. However, the medium-term outlook for
the yen is still bearish.
	   The yen ended last week at 2.8000, up from 2.7540 the week
before.
	   Sterling rose against the ringgit last week after UK interest
rates were unexpectedly raised Thursday. The central bank cited
rising wages and a tight labour market as a justification for its
move. Sterling closed last Friday at 6.3610, up from 6.2300 the
week before.
	   The Aussie dollar fell last week against the ringgit even though
Australian GDP growth in the first quarter was a higher than the
expected 1.3 per cent year-on-year. This is because investors
figured that the best was over for the Australian economy. The
Aussie closed last Friday at 2.3590, down from 2.3700 the week
before.

	   ONCE again, the key KLSE heavyweights came under strong selling
pressure in sending the KLSE Composite Index 6.17 per cent lower to
505.05 level.
	   The overall market performance, as reflected by the KLSE All
Share Emas Index, did better when it lost 4.37 per cent.
	   The under-performance displayed by the KLSE CI was underlined by
the major weakness on these index-linked stocks, particularly
Maybank Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd and Tenaga Nasional Bhd.
	   Persistent selling pressure emerging towards the last two
trading days sent the KLSE CI breaching the 517 critical support.
	   The KLSE Emas did better on some fundamental support on selected
second and third liners. It out-performed the KLSE CI by 180 basis
points.
	   Recent corporate reportings gave us an insight into some of the
better managed companies which continued to report healthy earning
during the recent currency and financial problems. Investors simply
ignored the fundamentals of the company.
	   PK Resources Bhd is one such company that reported healthy
earnings for the year ending Dec 31, 1997.
	   The company was incorporated in Malaysia on March 1, 1974, as a
private limited company and was converted into a public limited
company on Aug 8, 1991.
	   Later, it changed its corporate identity from Peladang Kimia Bhd
to PK Resources Bhd on Sept 29, 1997, to reflect its diversified
business activities.
	   The group is principally involved in the manufacture and
merchandising of fertilisers and chemical products.
	   Its subsidiaries are involved in property development, hotels,
quarry, landscaping and nursery, golf course construction and
maintenance.
	   In addition, the group had also diversified into providing
higher education when it established the Nilai College. It ventured
into private tertiary education with a consortium of leading
Australian universities led by La Trobe University.
	   For the financial year ending Dec 31, 1997, the group reported a
profit before tax of RM121.912 million, while its profit after tax
was RM52.718 million, translating into a net earnings per share of
42.71 sen (fully diluted). Its net tangible asset increased to
RM3.45 per share from RM3.07 per share in 1996.
	   Chartwise, its price trend fell from its all-time historical
peak of RM8.80 posted in 1996. It staged another attempt to take
out its all-time peak.
	   It failed when its price trend reversed at RM8.60 level on March
28, 1997. Since then, its price trend retraced all the way down to
its recent low at RM1.20 level on June 5.
	   Here are the readings of some of its technical indicators:-
Moving Averages: Its price trend continued to stay below its 10-,
20-, 30-, 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages.
	   Momentum Index: Its short-term momentum index continued to
consolidate further in search of its next downside support.
	   On Balance Volume: Its short-term OBV continued to stay below
its 10-day exponential moving averages.
	   Relative Strength Index: Its 14-RSI had since retraced to its
grossly oversold position at 9.17 level on June 5.
	   OUTLOOK: PK Resources' diversification programme over the last
few years transformed the group into a diversified but focused
group with exposure into the productive sectors.
	   Its property development project, Bandar Baru Nilai, is able to
benefit from its close proximity to the Multimedia Super Corridor,
Kuala Lumpur International Airport and Putrajaya, the new Federal
Government administrative centre.
	   At current price valuation, PK Resources' price trend is trading
at a not too demanding price earnings ratio multiple of 2.86 times.
Its current price trend reflected a 64.64 per cent discount, or
RM2.23, to its NTA of RM3.45.
	   PK Resources is one of the first few listed companies that
started buying back its own shares. Its first buy-back exercise was
initiated on March 3. Since then, the company had bought back more
than 2.6 million shares. Its ongoing buy-back exercise will
continue to underpin its price trend.
	   Technically, PK Resources' price trend had since retraced to its
five- year low. Its low PER valuation coupled with a steep discount
to its NTA are all pointing to an imminent technical rebound. At
current levels, its price trend provides opportunity for an
intermediate-term low risk investment.
	   From the perspective of its technical oscillators, indications
are pointing to a grossly oversold position. A technical rebound is
imminent to correct its current technical imbalances. Its
intermediate-term retracement objective is likely to retrace back
to RM1.68 to RM1.80 levels.

Second person dies as a result of bus fire in Armenia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ A 12-year-old boy died in a hospital on
Wednesday, the second victim of a bus fire that badly burned more
than 20 schoolchildren, officials said.
	   Sarkis Khachatrian died of severe burns in the Yerevan Central
Hospital. The first victim died in the hospital on Monday, and
several other children are in grave condition, hospital officials
said.
	   The bus carrying 40 students, teachers and parents returning
from a picnic exploded and burst into flames on a country road near
the village of Bartsrashen, 30 kilometers (19 miles) south of
Yerevan, on Sunday.
	   Officials said the explosion was apparently caused by a gas
leak.
	   Most buses and other vehicles in Armenia run on natural gas.
Gasoline is in short supply due to an economic blockade imposed by
neighboring Azerbaijan because of the territorial conflict over
Nagorno-Karabakh.

	   LAST week, share prices on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange
(KLSE) took another beating influenced by both the local and
foreign factors. The KLSE Composite Index (KLSE CI) resumed its
previous week's weak momentum when it closed another 6.17 per cent
lower to 505.05 level on June 5.
	   Overall market sentiment was depressed further on investors'
growing concern over a poorer economic outlook in the country.
Investors' concerns derived from the general market perception of
even weaker economic performance over the next two quarters.
	   The slow growth in the economy was reflected by Malaysia's gross
domestic products growth for the first quarter - at minus 1.8 per
cent while that of Hong Kong's was at minus 2.0 per cent.
	   Reacting to the negative news, investors sold down key blue
chips and other index-linked stocks when they drove the KLSE CI
sharply down to 518.00 level on June 1, giving a retracement loss
of 20.24 points, or 3.76 per cent.
	   The KLSE CI dipped briefly to 517.79 level in the morning trades
before staging a technical rebound to its intra-day high of 535.24
level on June 2. However, its rebound was shortlived when investors
took the opportunity to sell down their positions.
	   Amid the heavy selling and profit-taking liquidations, the KLSE
CI closed off its intra-day high. The market behaviour was
literally the same on June 3, 1998, when the KLSE CI rallied to its
intra-day high first before marking lower at market close.
	   After two days of erratic rebound, the KLSE CI resumed its
earlier prior trend when it retraced 7.75 points, or 1.47 per cent,
down to 518.61 level on June 4.
	   Investors had once again turned cautious following the further
weakness on the Malaysian ringgit to the dollar cross-rate. The
ringgit touched the 3.99-level in tandem with the weakness in the
regional currencies. The KLSE CI closed broadly lower to close at
505.05 level on June 5.
	   Reflecting the reaction to the negative growth for the first
quarter, the KLSE CI fell 33.19 points, or 6.17 per cent, over the
week to close at 505.05 level. The KLSE All Share Emas Index
dropped 5.96 points to 130.55 level.
	   The KLSE Industrial Index was down 32.23 points, or 3.11 per
cent, to 1,003.17 level. The KLSE Second Board Index eased 2.06
points, or 1.85 per cent, to 109.41 level.
	   On the sectoral performance analysis, plantation sector
out-performed the rest of the field with a marginal loss of 0.45
per cent followed by the consumer sector with 1.18 per cent. The
mining sector was the top loser with a week-on-week loss of 19.48
per cent.
	   Chartwise, the KLSE CI suffered heavy losses on June 1, 1998,
before recovering marginally on June 2 and 3. It resumed its
downtrend on June 4, before heading for a lower close at 505.05
level.
	   Following are the readings of some of its technical indicators:-
Moving Averages: The KLSE CI continued to stay below its 10-, 20-,
30-, 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages.
	   Momentum Index: Its short-term momentum index is currently
staging a re- test of its recent downside support.
	   On Balance Volume: Its short-term OBV trend breached both of its
short- and intermediate-term support.
	   Relative Strength Index: Its 14-RSI is staging a re-test of its
recent downside support registered on May 13.
	   OUTLOOK: Against the backdrop of more negative factors
influencing the local market sentiment, the KLSE CI retraced
sharply to re-test this column's envisaged symmetry wave support at
517 levels. It did provide critical support at 517 level for four
consecutive trading days.
	   The KLSE CI staged the first re-test of this support level on
June 1 when it closed at 518.00 level. Its second successful
re-test was recorded on June 2, when the KLSE CI hit its intra-day
low of 517.79 level before staging a rebound to 535.24 level.
	   After hitting its rebound high of 535.24 points, the KLSE CI
retraced to stage its third re-test of this support level when it
hit 518.61 level at its close on June 4.
	   All hell broke loose when the KLSE CI staged its fourth re-test
on June 5. This confirmed the validity of the Gann Study's Rule of
Four. The Rule of Four states that support or resistance would
normally give way on the fourth re-test.
	   Following its swift retracement from its recent high, the KLSE
CI's daily and weekly MACD (moving average convergence and
divergence) continued to trend downwards. As commented previously
in this column, the KLSE CI would have to consolidate further with
downside bias.
	   Its 14-RSI is currently tracing out a possible positive
divergence to the KLSE CI. Simulations showed the positive
divergence is imminent on the technical front. In other words, the
KLSE CI may breach the 500 support momentarily to re-test its
January 1998 support.
	   With that, the KLSE CI will pave the way for a technical rebound
to correct its grossly oversold position. This technical rebound
will likely take the KLSE CI back up above the 500 support. Bargain
hunting activities would certainly emerge when the KLSE CI re-test
its critical support zone around 488-500 levels.

Cyprus to test disputed new missile system in Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Cyprus will test its new air defense system in
Russia later this month, the Russian air force commander said
Wednesday.
	   Turkey has threatened to use force to stop the deployment of the
Russian-built missile system on the divided Mediterranean island.
	   Cmdr. Anatoly Kornukov told reporters that Cyprus is scheduled
to test the S-300 system at a base near Astrakhan, a city on the
Caspian Sea in southern Russia, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Kornukov said officials would decide late this summer whether
the Russian air force would deliver the system to Cyprus, according
to Interfax. The ITAR-Tass news agency quoted an unidentified
``military-industrial'' official as saying the system was ready for
shipment, and that Cyprus had already made advance payments.
	   A Russian newspaper reported Tuesday that Cyprus had already
received the missile system. Russian officials strongly denied the
report. The Rosvooruzheniye arms trading monopoly said the missiles
would be sent to Cyprus in mid-August as planned, Interfax said.
	   Russia has said the weapons are defensive, but Turkey considers
the sale to be a provocation and has warned that it will use force
to stop the system's installation.
	   Turkey has maintained 30,000 troops in a divided sector of
Cyprus since it invaded the island in 1974, following a failed coup
by supporters of union with Greece.

Japan's Parliament extends session to vote on economic stimulus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with opposition decision to submit no-confidence
motion; poll showing support for Cabinet has fallen to lowest-ever
level &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Parliament voted Wednesday to extend its
current session by eight days to complete passage of a 16.6
trillion yen (dlrs 119 billion) economic stimulus package, an
official said.
	   The extension will keep Japan's Parliament, which was scheduled
to recess on Wednesday, in session until June 18, a lower house
spokesman said.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party wanted the extra time to
finish cobbling together the largest economic stimulus package in
Japanese history, which is aimed at reviving an economy on the
brink of recession.
	   Meanwhile, two opposition parties _ the Democratic Party of
Japan and Liberal Party _ decided to jointly submit a no-confidence
motion against Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto for his handling of
the economy, said Haruo Semba, an official of the DPJ.
	   Such a measure is unlikely to pass as the LDP holds a majority
in the 500-seat lower house.
	   But it adds to Hashimoto's headaches as a new poll released
Wednesday showed that support for the Cabinet had fallen to a
record low.
	   A Kyodo News Agency survey showed that support for the Hashimoto
Cabinet had slumped to an all-time low of 35.0 percent from 37.1
percent in April. The dispproval rating was also at a record high
of 58.8 percent, up from 56.1 percent.
	   Kyodo said it had questioned 3,000 adults at random across the
nation on June 6-7. It gave no margin of error.
	   The extension of Parliament's session means that crucial upper
house elections scheduled for this summer will likely take place
between July 8 and 18, Kyodo reported.
	   The extension comes one day after Parliament passed a bill to
streamline the nation's bureaucracy.
	   The new law will trim the number of agencies and ministries to
13 from 22 within five years. It will cut the number of public
employees by about 10 percent and strengthen the prime minister's
control over policy making.
	   The new law was a key policy objective of Hashimoto, who has
promised to cut costs and rein in Japan's powerful ministries.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka was struggling at 200 for 8
in its first innings on the opening day of the third and final
cricket Test against New Zealand Wednesday after winning the toss
and electing to bat in overcast conditions.
	   The home team never looked comfortable after the dismissal of
its star batsman Sanath Jayasuriya with the total at 24, and
finished the first two sessions making just 124 runs for the loss
of five wickets.
	   Sri Lanka and New Zealand have won one test each in the
three-test series.
	   Paceman Chris Cairns triggered a Sri Lankan collapse when he had
Mahela Jayawardena caught behind off a rising ball, the first after
lunch, and in the last ball of the same over dismissed Aravinda de
Silva.
	   De Silva top edged an attempted hook shot and was caught by
Craig Spearman at fine leg for 4. Jayawardena made 16.
	   A few moments later, medium pacer Craig McMillan made it 70 for
4 by having a hand in the exit of skipper Arjuna Ranatunga who made
just 4 runs.
	   Ranatunga was at the non striker's end and could not beat a
deflection off McMillan's right hand in the face of a full blooded
drive from Marvan Atapattu.
	   Atapattu and Hashan Tillekeratne staged only a minor recovery
with an alliance of 32 runs for the fifth wicket and were back in
the pavilion after missing half centuries by two and seven runs
respectively.
	   Atapattu swept a ball from off spinner Paul Wiseman but only
succeeded in top edging the delivery to short fine leg where Daniel
Vettori took the catch.
	   Atapattu made 48 in 178 minutes of batting, hitting seven fours.
	   Tillekeratne was out half an hour before the scheduled close
when he edged a ball from McMillan into the hands of Bryan Young at
slip.
	   McMillan also came in handy for New Zealand when Romesh
Kaluwitharana played a delivery from him onto the stumps to be out
for 28, made off 78 balls.
	   Tillekeratne occupied the crease for 158 minutes and dispatched
seven balls to the fence.
	   Earlier in the day, Sri Lanka lost the wicket of Jayasuriya who
was caught at second slip by Young for 13 in the ninth over of the
innings.

	   SOFTWARE developer Rebus International (Asia) Sdn Bhd has
launched its latest insurance solution which incorporates new
features for facilitating insurance agents in their work.
	   The General Insurance Underwriting System (Genius) offers
value-added features which include the different insurance
products, distribution channels, information, contain costs,
implementation and maintenance, according to the company.
	   Rebus added that the solution can deal with all classes of
non-life personal and commercial insurance schemes such as fire,
motor, accident and engineering.
	   According to Rebus Asia's managing director David Waring, there
are four aspects of Genius which differentiate it from other
insurance software available in the market. These are its model
base, product definition, name database, diary and management
information.
	   The features are taken from Rebus Asia's previous products which
were also targeted at insurance companies. ``The additional
features make the software more flexible and user-friendly,'' said
Waring.
	   He said the model base is designed as a package to handle a wide
variety of business. It can be easily customised to the particular
requirements of a company, he said.
	   Waring added that existing users from any class of business such
as household, liability, life and health insurance, medical
malpractice and inwards reinsurance are handled within the same
system.
	   ``This kind of flexibility is controlled through the product
definition which allows the users to select from the many possible
processing and data elements that are required to make up a
policy,'' he said.
	   Genius, Waring said, is designed to be used worldwide either as
a single installation for a small company or as branch operations
for multinational corporations (MNCs).
	   ``To ensure that it can be used worldwide, this software allows
flexibility in terms of language and currency,'' he said,
explaining that Genius is able to do so as the screen and print
images can be translated with no programming changes. He claimed
that users can also set up their own base currency using the
system.
	   Waring said the product definition allows each insurance company
to tailor the package to suit their own requirements. For instance,
a company which specialises in one type of package may only require
a single product, whereas another company that writes a wide range
of general business may set up as many products as required.
	   Rebus Asia offers a few pricing options for customers who want
to purchase Genius. For instance, the price for a 10-user system
can start from RM300,000.
	   ``We also offer rental option which is about RM120,000 a year,''
Waring said, adding that the company, however, understands the
current economic condition and is willing to share the burden with
other insurance companies.
	   ``As we are committed in this region for the long haul, we offer
users several ways of settling payments. One way is to link payment
and the product with the performance of an insurance company.''

Protest march by Ukrainian miners edges close to Kiev
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BORYSPIL, Ukraine (AP) - The miners, naked to the waist, marched
quickly and silently under the scorching sun, cheered by honks from
passing cars and applause from villagers lining the highway.
	   On Wednesday, the column of about 1,000 striking Ukrainian
workers was just several kilometers (miles) outside Kiev, the
capital, after having marched for some 500 kilometers (310 miles)
from coal-producing areas of eastern Ukraine.
	   The protest march began last month, accompanying scattered
strikes that have idled dozens of mines as workers demanded their
long-overdue wages. Over 40 mines are now on strike, union leaders
say.
	   The miners are owed an average of eight months in back wages and
the overall wage debt stands at 2.2 billion hryvna (dlrs 1.1
billion), according to the Coal Industry Ministry.
	   The miners also want wage and pension increases and more funding
for the coal industry, plagued by numerous accidents caused by
aging equipment and neglect for safety rules.
	   The cash-strapped government, which blames managers in the coal
industry for many of the problems, has sent some money to coal
regions and is supposed to forward another 600 million hryvna (dlrs
300 million) allocated by parliament to help the struggling
workers.
	   Miners held separate demonstrations in front of parliament and
President Leonid Kuchma's headquarters in Kiev on Wednesday.
	   ``The miners shall stay ... until overdue wages are paid in
full,'' union leader Viktor Derzhak said, according to the Interfax
news agency.
	   The newly appointed Coal Industry Minister Serhiy Tulub told
ministry officials Tuesday that overdue wages have caused ``great
social tension,'' Interfax reported.
	   ``We must devise a tactic to end the protest actions in Kiev,''
he said, suggesting that ministry spending be slashed by 15 percent
so as to come up with some money.
	   On the highway to Kiev, the marchers were greeted with an
outpouring of sympathy. Many Ukrainians, whose country of more than
50 million people has experienced economic decline since the Soviet
collapse, feel affinity to the miners.
	   Among the column was Sergei, a shepherd father of five who said
he had abandoned his cattle in eastern Ukraine to join the march.
``He has even gained some weight,'' the miners joked.
	   Cars honked and people came out to give food and bottles of
mineral water to the marchers. Some elderly women waiting at bus
stops along the highway shouted slogans in support of the bygone
Soviet Union as the column approached.
	   In Kiev, the Socialist Party _ one of the left-wing forces that
have been seeking to capitalize on the miners' protests _ called on
residents to join the march when the workers reach the capital
Thursday.
	   The marching miners, however, said they had no political demands
to raise and pledged to return to their homes as soon as back wages
are paid.

	   ADVANCED Micro Devices has introduced the AMD-K6-2 processor
which is claimed to be the first Microsoft Windows compatible x86
microprocessor with 3DNow! technology.
	   According to the company, the AMD-K6-2 processor combines 3DNow!
instructions and superscalar MMX capability to deliver life-like
images and graphics, big-screen sound and video.
	   ``For the first time, AMD has introduced a processor that is
differentiated not solely by megahertz (MHz) or price, but also by
innovative technology that delivers a new level of
three-dimensional (3-D) performance and realism,'' said AMD's
executive vice president and chief technical officer S. Atiq Raza.
	   AMD said personal computer (PCs) makers such as IBM and Fujitsu
are planning to use the AMD-K6-2 processor with 3DNow! technology
in their forthcoming systems.
	   Microsoft is supporting 3DNow! technology in DirectX 6.0, a
common set of application programming interfaces (APIs) for
multimedia services in the Windows platform.
	   DirectX 6.0 optimised for 3DNow! technology is expected to be
available next month. Software applications that leverage the
forthcoming DirectX 6.0 API, the OpenGL 1.2 API and 3Dfx Glide API
will add value to improve 3-D performance as they will be optimised
for the 3DNow! technology.
	   According to AMD, numerous software titles, including Incoming
by Rage, Unreal by Epic MegaGames, Microsoft's Baseball 3-D,
Imagine Studios' Ares Rising and LiveArt 98 by Viewpoint Data Labs,
have also been optimised for 3DNow! technology.
	   Other new titles tuned for 3DNow! technology are expected to
debut throughout the year, the company said.

Vietnamese military chief visits China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam's defense minister, Senior
Lt.-Gen. Pham Van Tra, has begun an official friendship visit to
China to strenghthen bilateral military ties, the official
newspaper Vietnam News reported Wednesday.
	   Tra left for Beijing Tuesday at the invitation of Chinese
Defence Minister Chi Haotian, the newspaper reported.
	   Relations between Vietnam and China have recently been getting
warmer, and the two countries have been exchanging regular
high-level visits since their relations were normalized in 1991.
	   The two former communist allies fought a brief but bloody border
war in 1979 shortly after Vietnam invaded Cambodia to oust the
Beijing-backed Khmer Rouge government there.
	   The two countries still have territorial disputes involving
their land borders as well as maritime claims in the Tonkin Gulf
and around the Spratly Island chain, an area believed in be rich in
natural resources.

	   EPSON Trading (M) Sdn Bhd has unveiled what it claims is world's
brightest portable liquid crystal display (LCD) multimedia
projector, the EMP-7300.
	   Epson Trading's marketing executive sales and marketing division
Norafesa Abu Kassim said the newprojector incorporates the latest
features such as an ultra-high efficiently lamp, ultra-high
aperture LCD panel and an improved projection lens to achieve 1,200
ANSI lumens output brightness.
	   The lamp is said to last up to 1,000 hours, while the LCD panel
which uses the micro lens array technology has improved the
aperture ratio to 70 per cent.
	   According to Epson, the new improved projection lens focuses on
the critical portion of light onto the LCD panel resulting in a
higher light efficiency.
	   The 1,200 ANSI lumens output supports extended graphics array
(XGA) at 1,024 by 768 resolution and is able to compress SXGA/WS
images.
	   Other technologies incorporated in the EMP-7300 projector are
polarisarion conversion for more uniform brightness, panel on prism
for sharper images and real-time image resizing for accurate data
compression and digital gamma correction for better colour
gradation.
	   ``The EMP-7300 projector is Epson's first multimedia projector
which is equipped with the line doubler technology,'' Norafesa told
Computimes.
	   She said the line doubler technology is used to filter images
which consist of two fields of scanning lines. If infiltrated, the
images can cause flicker.
	   Besides filtering images, the line doubler also converts a
traditional interlace video image into a non-interlaced one by
eliminating the horizontal lines which appears on the projection
image.
	   The EMP-7300 projector comes with a contrast ratio of 300:1 and
weighs 6.2 kilograms. It is compatible with Digital, IBM and
Hewlett-Packard workstations and it can be connected to a personal
computer (PC), Mac and other video devices.
	   Targeted at workstation users and high-end users such as
engineering, medical, military organisations, Epson expects to sell
about 20 to 30 units of EMP-7300 projectors within one year.
	   Currently, the company claimed to have a market share of 16 per
cent for multimedia projectors in the Asia-Pacific region.
	   The suggested retail price for the EMP-7300 projector is
RM73,500 and it is available through local Epson outlets.

EU Commission sees grain mountain; Wants more land out of
</HEADLINE>
production &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Citing fast-growing surplus grains
stock, the European Commission proposed Wednesday that EU cereal
farmers take 10 percent of land out of production in 1999, double
the current level.
	   ``There is a serious danger of (surplus) stocks for cereals
increasing again to unacceptable levels,'' said EU Agriculture
Commissioner Franz Fischler.
	   ``We cannot bury our heads in the sand any longer. We have a
problem.''
	   His proposed remedy must be approved by EU agriculture ministers
who have been divided over the issue.
	   France and Germany _ the EU's biggest cereal producers _ want to
limit the set aside of land to 5 percent or just over that.
	   Fischler told reporters said a doubling of the current rate was
needed to prevent surplus stocks from getting out of hand.
	   ``Our analysis, based on realistic assumptions, indicates that
in the absence of an adjustment ... the European Union could have
30 million metric tonnes (33 million tons)'' in storage by
mid-2000, he said.
	   He called that ``a level which is untenable and which must be
avoided.''
	   Coceral, an EU cereal trade group, said public storage of grains
now total 13.3 million metric tonnes (14.6 million tons), up from
2.4 million tonnes (2.64 million tons) a year ago.
	   Commission officials predicted this will rise to 20 million
tonnes (22 million tons) in mid-1999 and to 29.5 million tonnes
(32.5 million tons) by mid-2000.
	   Surplus grain stocks have long been a nightmare scenario for the
EU.
	   In the past, cereals were stored away in huge quantities across
the EU while people elsewhere went hungry.
	   When they were sold, the EU did so with export subsidies because
the world price of cereals is lower than the EU price. Those
subsidies then led to unfair trade charges from the United States
and other trade partners.
	   Under EU rules, cereal farmers are encouraged, or can be forced,
to let land lie fallow to prevent overproduction.
	   They are then paid for not growing crops. The amount set-aside
land depends on market conditions. This year, 4 million hectares
have been taken out of production, half of it voluntarily.
	   The EU has had a 5 percent set-aside rate in 1997 and 1998, down
from 10 percent in 1996. Unless a new rate is set for 1999 and
beyond, the EU will revert to a more painful rate of 17.5 percent
that was imposed as the norm in 1992.

Lawmakers calls for impeachment of Iran's interior minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hard-line members of Parliament on Wednesday
demanded the impeachment of the liberal interior minister, accusing
him of jeopardizing Iran's stability.
	   Thirty-one members of Majlis, or parliament, filed a motion,
saying minister Abdollah Nouri should be impeached for several
reasons, including allowing a pro-democracy rally last month to
protest the influence of the hard-line clergy in Iran.
	   The impeachment motion is the latest attack by the conservative
members in Iran's ruling clergy on officials loyal to reformist
President Mohammad Khatami who took power in August.
	   Shortly after Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri read out the
impeachment motion, Khatami rose to his minister's support, calling
him ``our capable brother, an outstanding personality of the
revolution and the system.''
	   The impeachment motion accuses Nouri of ``creating tension in
the society, making provocative interviews and speeches in
different provinces and appointing inexperienced people to
managerial posts at the ministry.'''
	   His ``continuation in the post is detrimental to tranquility and
stability in the country,'' the motion was quoted as saying by the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   Hard-liners have in the past few weeks described the liberal
minister as incompetent and called for his resignation.
	   In the letter, the deputies protested the minister's open
support for Tehran Mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi who was arrested
in April on corruption charges.
	   Karbaschi, also a Khatami loyalist, is now on trial facing
accusations by the country's judiciary, which is controlled by the
conservative clergymen.
	   Nouri, appointed by Khatami who overcame strong resistance from
Parliament, had set up an office at the Interior Ministry to
coordinate support for Karbaschi. The lawmakers said Nouri's
actions created tensions.
	   Nouri has 10 days to appear before Parliament, where hard-liners
are in a slight majority, and respond to the accusations in the
impeachment motion, which will then be put to vote.
	   Khatami's landslide victory in May against hard-line candidate
Nateq-Nouri, who later secured the Parliament speaker's post, shook
the foundations of Iran's clerical rule.
	   The 20 million people who voted for Khatami, mainly women and
students, called his victory a triumph for civil liberties in this
Islamic republic.
	   Khatami still struggles, however, with hard-line opponents who
accuse him of betraying the 1979 Islamic revolution led by the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
	   Ali Khamenei, who succeeded Khomeini, remains Iran's powerful
spiritual leader.

World Cup: Italy seeks to break tradition with good start against
</HEADLINE>
Chile &QL; 
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Italy seeks an untraditionally good
World Cup start in Thursday's Group B match against Chile to launch
its quest for a record-equaling fourth title.
	   Initial matches of past world competitions often have presented
headaches for the ``Azzurri.'' Coach Cesare Maldini and his son
Paolo, the team captain, hope for an easy start this time against
the Latin American team.
	   ``We have a lot of respect for Chile, but we need to begin with
a victory. The first match of the first round is often decisive for
qualifying,'' said Paolo Maldini, a 30-year-old AC Milan defender
with 87 caps on the national team.
	   Italy won the world title in Spain, in 1982, barely escaping
first-round elimination following three draws. It suffered a 1-0
first-match upset by Ireland in 1994 before rallying to reach the
final against Brazil in Pasadena.
	   The Chilean team, which qualified for the World Cup finals
following a 16-year absence, is considered the underdog compared
with three-time champion Italy.
	   However Ivan Zamorano and Marcelo Salas, the Chilean strikers of
international fame, could produce an early sensation in the
tournament if the Italian defense does not prove tighter and more
attentive than in recent warmup games.
	   A defensive lapse of young Alessandro Nesta touched off Italy's
last-minute 1-0 loss against Sweden in last week's tuneup.
	   Nesta is going to mark Zamorano with agile Fabio Cannavaro
taking care of Salas.
	   Zamorano and Salas, who combined for 23 goals in World Cup
qualifying, ``are a threat for any defense,'' Cesare Maldini said.
	   Italy will be without its ``Golden Boy'' Alessandro Del Piero,
just recovered from a right thigh strain.
	   However the team will not miss imagination and play-making skill
in front with veteran Roberto Baggio taking over the place of his
younger teammate.
	   Baggio, Italy's World Cup hero in 1994, said he was looking
forward to an outstanding performance against Chile and then
sitting on the substitutes bench against Cameroon.
	   Del Piero, considered a key to Italy's fortunes in the World
Cup, is likely to return to action against the African team in
Montpellier on June 17.
	   Italy plays its last Group B match against Austria, on June 23.
Chile takes on the Austrians before playing Cameroon in Nantes.
	   The 2-0 rout of England at Wembley and the undeserved 0-1 loss
against Argentina in recent warmup games have greatly boosted
Chile's prestige and self-confidence while causing alarm in the
Maldini family.
	   ``Chile is not only Zamorano and Salas. Midfield and defense are
good. It's a tough team,'' the Italian coach said.
	   Cesare Maldini suggested that Italian midfield would play a
decisive role in the match, at Lescure stadium of Bordeaux in
southwest France.
	   As a result of the growing internationalization of European
leagues, Thursday's match features a duel between club teammates -
Inter Milan's goalie Gianluca Pagliuca on the Italian side and
Chile's Zamorano.
	   The expected lineups:
	   Italy: Gianluca Pagliuca; Alessandro Nesta, Paolo Maldini, Fabio
Cannavaro, Alessandro Costacurta, Dino Baggio, Francesco Moriero
(Angelo Di Livio), Demetrio Albertini, Roberto Di Matteo, Christian
Vieri (Filippo Inzaghi), Roberto Baggio.
	   Chile: Nelson Tapia; Ronald Fuentes, Pedro Reyes, Javier Margas,
Moises Villarroel (Christian Castaneda), Francisco Rojas, Nelson
Parraguez, Clarence Acuna, Fabian Estay (Jose Luis Sierra), Ivan
Zamorano, Marcelo Salas.
	   The match kicks off at 1530 GMT.

	   APPLE Computer has launched its latest products for the mobile
market, the PowerBook G3 series notebook computers, which feature
the PowerPC G3 processor that is claimed to be twice as fast as the
Pentium II processor, based on BYTEmark processor test scores.
	   The PowerBook G3 series for the Asian market comes in three
configurations namely PowerBook G3/233, G3/250 and G3/292.
	   The PowerBook G3/233 features a 12.1-inch display, 233 megahertz
(MHz) PowerPC G3 microprocessor, 32 megabytes (MB) synchronous
dynamic random access memory (SDRAM), 20X CD-ROM drive and
two-gigabyte (GB) hard drive.
	   The PowerBook G3/250 has similar features to the first
configuration except that it comes with a 13.3-inch display, a
250MHz PowerPC G3 microprocessor, 1MB Level 2 backside cache and
1.44MB floppy disk. The last configuration, the PowerBook G3/292,
features a 14.1-inch display, a 292MHz microprocessor, 64MB SDRAM,
8GB hard drive and other features similar to the first two.
	   All three configurations are bundled with MacOS8.1, RealPC from
Insignia Solutions Inc and third-party software such as FAXstf, Now
Contact, UptoDate and Web-Whacker.
	   The new notebooks also come with a full-sized keyboard and a
sleek black enclosure with rounded contours and soft-gripping
surfaces. The suggested retail prices for the three notebooks are
S$4,249 (RM10,200), S$6,814 and S$8,878 respectively.
	   The PowerBook G3/233 and G3/250 models are already available
while the PowerBook G3/292 model is expected to be available early
this month.
	   According to Apple Computer's South Asia Pte Ltd general manager
Chng Poh Hwa, the company plans to have an official launch of the
PowerBook G3 series in Malaysia this month.
	   ``There is no reason why there can't be a similar launch in
Malaysia; ultimately, it's the users and meeting their needs is our
concern,'' he said.
	   The company is also working towards establishing a direct
presence in Malaysia, but does not have a definite time frame for
its plans.
	   ``Our market will continue to be served by strong distributors
who focus purely on distribution efficiency to the channels and
then to the users,''
	   Chng said.
	   He said the company has been working with ``excellent'' partners
thus far, including Exquisite Discovery Sdn Bhd of the Sapura IT
Group on the local front, and has just signed an agreement with
Electronic Resources in Singapore for the distribution of Apple's
products in the region.

Vietnam's army businesses told to prepare for restructuring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam's defense ministry has issued an
edict telling the companies it controls in the business sector to
streamline in order to improve efficiency and competitiveness, a
ministry official said Wednesday.
	   The ordinance _ which was issued last month, but published in
the People's Army newspaper Wednesday _ requires the army's
businesses to restructure in order to build strong corporations
which will be able to take on major projects, and to dissolve
money-losing enterprises.
	   The army engages in businesses ranging from running hotels to
chartering helicopters and producing consumer goods.
	   The official, who asked not to be named, said the edict's order
represented a second wave of restructuring for army businesses.
	   In 1995-96, some 305 army businesses were streamlined by merger
and closures to 193.
	   The new edict did not specify how many army enterprises would be
merged or made to cease operating this time. It said the
streamlining must not reduce production or affect workers' jobs and
living conditions.
	   The ordinance also said divisional and provincial army units and
specialized departments under the defense ministry are not allowed
to set up commercial enterprises.
	   In Vietnam's socialist-oriented economy, the army has a
reputation for discipline, organization, and being a source of
abundant labor. It still has 500,000 troops in its ranks, a
reduction from 1 million over the past decade.
	   The army has teamed up with foreign partners in 55 projects
capitalized at more than dlrs 800 million. They range from hotels,
office buildings, automobile manufacturing and shipbuilding to
projects in the agricultural field.
	   Since Vietnam introduced a law on foreign investment in 1987,
Vietnam has attracted about 1,800 foreign investment projects with
a total pledged investment capital of dlrs 32 billion.

	   GOLF simulation games are not everybody's favourite. Those who
love golf simulation games are mostly golfers in real life. But
then again, there are also those who just love the game for the
gameplay and the stunning simulation technology the developers have
incorporated into it.
	   The latest release from Access Software, a golf simulation game
called Links LS '98 is one example of good gameplay and stunning
graphics. Links LS' predecessor Links 386 was one of the best
computer golf games a while ago. This long-awaited next-generation
version features stunning visuals and superb realism.
	   Links LS '98 (LS stands for Legends in Sports) comes with
courses designed by one of the best golf players in golf history,
Arnold Palmer.
	   It comes with four different real-life resort courses such as
The Kapalua Plantation, Bay and Village courses in the island of
Maui, Hawaii, and the Latrobe Country Course Club in Pennsylvania,
US. It is also a complete 72- hole golf championship course.
	   The original package comes with four compact disks (CDs) and a
complete reference manual (an advantage of getting original
software). The CDs include four courses, fly-by views of all holes,
six different golfer animations, virtual reality tour of the
resorts, video tour of the courses and even interviews and the
biodata of Arnold Palmer and his father Deacon Palmer.
	   Links LS comes with unlimited screen resolutions with up to 16.7
million colours. It will definitely make use of the extra random
access memory in your graphic card.
	   The background graphics on these courses are outstanding. Though
the scenery is digitised, there is a distinct realism that beats
the rest. It even comes with animations such as the fluttering of
flags and even flying planes, helicopters and blimps scuttling
across the course.
	   When you play near a water hazard, you will be dazzled with the
reflection of surrounding trees, terrains and even the clouds.
	   There are six golfers which include Arnold Palmer as well as
three other men and two women golfers. Each of these golfers has
different appearances and skills. However, only Arnold Palmer is
controlled by the game.
	   Nonetheless, Links LS allows you to create players either for
computer- controlled golfers or human-controlled golfers.
	   One of the most significant abilities of this game is that you
can play at the main view window and have up to eight windows to
view your shots.
	   You have forward and reverse landing cameras, a Golfer cam, Pin
cam, Green cam, Putting cam, Side Cam, Top cam, Profile and even
chat! Most of these cameras are ``smart cams'' and will follow your
every shot.
	   And these cameras are adjustable from one foot to about 100 feet
off the ground. If you are used to the working environment of
Windows 95, you won't have a problem in handling all of them at
once. These cams are great in a sense that it allows you to see how
and where your shot is going and to learn what went wrong. Now, if
it is your first time on the course, you can even have a fly-by
view of the hole. How nice if it happens in real life! Links LS
gives you control over your shots from adjusting your stance,
position of the ball, club face to controlling your swing. In Links
LS, you can even configure and save your swings so that it can be
used again and again. The swing control is based on the three-click
swing.
	   There is even a feature in Links LS that allows you to rotate
from your original position when making a difficult shot. This is a
real treat and can be very helpful when you are stuck in the woods.
Once my tee off shot landed right behind a big oak tree facing the
green, and without this rotating feature, I wouldn't be able to get
out of the maze, don't think pros can get out of it either.
	   Besides the lie and wind indicators, similar to all golf
simulations, there is also a slope indicator. This indicator is
very useful as it tells you the slope your ball is currently
resting on. It is very helpful, especially on the green.
	   Enough of the features. let's explore the courses. The Kapalua
Bay, Village and Plantation course is situated in the paradise
island of Maui.
	   The name ``Kapalua'' means ``arms that reach out'', referring to
the bay of the island.
	   The Kapalua Village Course was designed by Arnold Palmer and Ed
Seay.
	   This Par 71 championship course is both a challenging and an
enjoyable course. It is also the home for the Lincoln Mercury
International Championship, one of the most acclaimed post-PGA
tours. It started in 1982 with the prize money of just over
US$15,000 to a staggering US$150,000 in the 90s. Many great golfers
such as Greg Norman and Fred Couples have won their games here in
the past. It is also a 7,263-yard Par 73 championship golf course.
	   This is a very challenging course which has the aspect of an
ancient Scottish golf course - golfing at a grand scale.
	   According to the preview, this course will get you to use
practically almost every club in your bag.
	   The Latrobe Country Course is situated at the backyard of Arnold
Palmer's home in Pennsylvania. This 18-hole course was built on
scenic highlands and surrounded with beautiful trees. The club was
founded in 1920 and had its first nine holes in the following year.
The building of the first nine holes involved Deacon Palmer. And by
1963, this nine-hole course was expanded into an 18-hole
championship golf course.
	   This title deserves a big thumb's-up. Everything in Links LS is
precise and professional. If you are looking for a challenging and
an advanced golf game, this is a must-get software. It also comes
with Internet-play where you can challenge golfers from all around
the world.
	   This is the type of game that will give you plenty to talk about
with your golf-crazy friends. Grab it now and check it out
yourself.

Iran to cut oil production by 100,000 barrels per day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with output cut announcement, quote, CHANGES overline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran announced Wednesday that it will cut
its oil output by 100,000 barrels per day, joining other countries
in an effort to boost global prices.
	   The announcement to cut production, which takes effect on July
1, was made by the Oil Ministry following a meeting between
visiting Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi and his Iranian
counterpart, Bijan Namdar Zangeneh.
	   ``Iran undertakes to trim output by 100,000 barrels per day as
of July 1, in addition to the 140,000 barrels per day cut
previously agreed upon,'' the official Islamic Republic News Agency
quoted an oil ministry statement as saying.
	   Saudi Arabia has been lobbying several countries to cut oil
production in an attempt to increase sagging prices that have
hovered around dlrs 14 a barrel, some 20 percent lower than last
year despite cuts in daily global production by 1.5 million barrels
a day.
	   Al-Naimi, who arrived in Tehran Tuesday, briefed Zangeneh on the
recent accord between Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico to cut
back 450,000 barrels a day from the market, Iran's state-run Tehran
radio reported.
	   Iran's new cut will be in addition to the 140,000 barrels a day
production cut it had pledged to make in March. Iran said that
reduction should be made in its daily quota of 3.94 million barrels
rather than its actual production level, which fluctuates but is
considerably lower than the quota.
	   Iran, the second-largest exporter in the 11-nation Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, had reportedly been exceeding the
pledged cuts.
	   Al-Naimi earlier visited Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and Qatar
and non-OPEC producer, Oman.
	   He secured a pledge from Qatar to cut 20,000 barrels per day
starting July 1.

	   THE Government has set up the Telecommunications Consultative
Committee for Internet service provider (TCC-ISP), which will be
made up of representatives from the Telecommunications Department
and ISPs.
	   The main responsibility of the consultative committee will be to
study and analyse the growth of Internet services in the country.
	   An immediate issue to be tackled by the committee is a
suggestion from the Government that all ISPs share a common
gateway, or an International Internet Exchange.
	   Energy, Telecommunications and Posts Minister Datuk Leo Moggie
said this issue is important as the individual efforts by the ISPs
to set up an international gateway will necessarily involve large
amounts of investment.
	   He made this call after announcing the appointment of five new
ISPs - Celcom (M) Sdn Bhd, Mutiara Telecommunications Sdn Bhd,
PrismaNet (M) Sdn Bhd, Time Telecommunications Sdn Bhd and Bina
Sat-Com Sdn Bhd.
	   The current ISPs are Mimos Berhad, which operates the Jaring
network and Telekom Malaysia, which manages TMnet.
	   ``The Government has recommended that all seven ISP companies
jointly share the installation of the international gateway,''
Moggie told reporters, after presenting licences to the five new
ISPs in Kuala Lumpur last Friday.
	   ``It is to the benefit of the operators to reduce each
individual investment.''
	   He added that the Government also hopes that the consultative
committee will be able to find ways to review unnecessary
expenditure among the ISPs so that they will be able to offer
competitive and quality services.
	   Commenting on the possibility of market overcrowding with seven
ISPs operating locally, Moggie said this was not an issue as the
growth of the Internet is now twice as fast, and the public also
demands for improved quality services.
	   ``Hopefully, by having more companies offering Internet
services, the public will have more choices to select from,'' he
said, adding that most of the ISPs have indicated that they will
start operations and offer services by end of this year.
	   Director-general of the Telecommunications Department Datuk Hod
Parman said similar to both Jaring and TMnet networks which are
assigned user access code 1511 and 1515 respectively, the new ISPs
will also be assigned access codes from the 151X series.
	   ``The numbers to be assigned to them will be based on the new
ISPs' cellular network access code,'' he said, explaining that this
will make it easier for users to identify the ISPs they are linked
to.
	   According to Moggie, the Government reckons that seven ISPs are
enough, and has no immediate plans to issue new licences though
this position will be reviewed as the need arises.
	   However, he added, applications to become Internet access
service provider or IASP can still proceed.

	   MALACCA, Sun. - The Government will continue to reward good and
hardworking civil servants with increments and other incentives
under the New Remuneration System despite the economic slowdown.
	   ``This is a contractual obligation which the Government will
continue to offer to excellent and deserving employees,'' Chief
Secretary to the Government Tan Sri Abdul Halim Mohd Ali said after
launching a time management seminar last night organised by the
Association of Civil Servants' Wives (Puspanita) of Negri Sembilan,
Malacca and Johor.
	   ``We will not stop awarding good civil servants in our attempt
to enhance the administration and machinery of the public sector.
The Government can still afford to reward them despite the current
economic situation as we have allocations for this.''
	   Abdul Halim was asked to comment on whether the cutbacks in
expenditure would affect promotions. He was also asked to comment
on Cuepacs' move to review the scheme.
	   Cuepacs, the umbrella organisation representing civil servants'
unions, has been objecting to the NRS matrix system of appraisal
introduced on Jan 1, 1992, where high achievers are rewarded with
double or triple increments.
	   Abdul Halim said the NRS was the best evaluation scheme thus
far.
	   ``If there are weaknesses in the system, as claimed by certain
quarters, we will review it and try to find a solution to the
problem.
	   ``So far, I have not received any memorandum with regard to the
weaknesses in the appraisal system.''
	   Under the NRS, two per cent of the staff get the diagonal
promotion which gives double or more increment, three per cent the
vertical promotion of double increment while the rest get single
increment.
	   On whether the Government would be paying bonus to civil
servants this year, he said the matter had not been decided.
	   To another question, Abdul Halim, who is also Puspanita's
adviser, said the Government would continue to freeze recruitments
as it headed for an electronic government.
	   ``We are in the midst of trying to downsize the number of staff
at government departments.
	   ``However, not all departments will be affected. The number of
teachers, for instance, cannot be reduced due to the increase in
student population.''
	   Abdul Halim said a review would be conducted from time to time
to identify departments where the number of workers could be
reduced and absorbed by other departments.
	   The staff redeployment plan is to avoid new recruitments in line
with the Government's objective to downsize the civil service.
	   He said the study would also identify departments with excess
staff and re-assign them to other departments without affecting
their work performance.
	   Manpower in certain areas could be reduced with the advent of
electronic government, he said.
	   The Malaysian Administrative Modernisation and Manpower Planning
Unit in the Prime Minister's Department and the Public Service
Department would carry out a study on optimum manpower utilisation
in the civil service, he said.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Armed assailants opened fire at a United
Nations relief convoy in southern Sudan, killing three officials
and wounding four others, the official Sudanese News Agency
reported Wednesday.
	   SUNA said two of those killed in Tuesday's attack worked for the
U.N.'s World Food Program and the third was attached with the
International Committee of the Red Cross. All victims were
Sudanese, sources told The Associated Press.
	   A United Nations statement confirmed the death toll but put the
number of injured people at three, and said they belonged to Red
Crescent, the Islamic equivalent of Red Cross.
	   SUNA said a government soldier was among those injured.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - The controversy in the DAP over action
against three party leaders deepened with a former State DAP leader
today asking the leadership to allow criticism and ensure
impartiality in disciplinary proceedings.
	   Former Perak DAP chairman Ting Chek Ming said the action against
the three by the central executive committee on Wednesday came as
no surprise as he had also experienced a similar fate when he was
sacked from the State committee last month.
	   In a statement, Ting said that after his sacking, he had
appealed to the CEC but had yet to receive a reply.
	   At a Press conference in Malacca on Thursday, party
secretary-general Lim Kit Siang had announced the suspension of
national vice-chairman Liew Ah Kim and treasurer Fung Ket Wing, and
the removal of national publicity secretary Wee Choo Keong from his
post.
	   This followed complaints from the Malacca and Perak committees.
	   Ting said criticisms must be allowed in the party to attract
professionals to join it.
	   ``Transparency and accountability can only be achieved by the
setting up of an independent and impartial committee to investigate
the half-truths and falsehood told by Kit Siang to the Press.
	   Meanwhile, in Penang, Kit Siang said the three leaders who were
suspended and removed from their posts were welcome to take an
active part in the party's double campaign as they were still CEC
members.
	   One is the ``Sympathy, support and solidarity with Lim Guan
Eng'' campaign and the other is the ``National movement for
justice, freedom, democracy and good governance''.
	   He said in the past two months, Liew, Fung and Wee had not shown
any interest in the two campaigns.
	   ``The two campaigns have gained momentum because of the
tremendous support from the people and Wee, Liew and Fung should
seriously ask themselves whether they want them to fail.''
	   He said this when releasing white doves at a campaign for the
two causes in Bukit Mertajam.
	   Kit Siang said the CEC had removed or suspended the three from
their national party positions because it had lost confidence in
them as national leaders since they had refused to accept the
principle of collective leadership and responsibility for decisions
taken by the CEC.

Air France says agreement reached with striking pilots

	   PARIS (AP) _ Air France said Wednesday it had reached an
agreement with striking pilots, ending a walkout that had severely
embarrassed the country in the days leading up to the World Cup.
	   In a statement, Air France said the pilots had agreed to accept
company shares in exchange for salary cuts.
	   The company called for an immediate return to work. But the
airline has said it could take three days for service to return to
normal once the strike ended.
	   At Roissy airport north of Paris, red lights ominously flashed
canceled for most Air France flights.
	   Just Tuesday night, as World Cup celebrations began in Paris,
negotiations had seemed deadlocked. Pilots had agreed to continue
the walkout, despite an appeal by the transport minister to both
sides to continue talking.
	   But in talks overnight, an agreement was reached.
	   Jean-Cyril Spinetta, the president of Air France, told France
Info radio Wednesday morning ``this is a compromise that is good
for the company, good for the employees and good for the clients.''
	   But he added that consequences of the strike were ``heavy'' and
that the company had lost a billion francs (dlrs 166 million.)
``Now we have to think of confidence, confidence in Air France,
confidence in its clients,'' he said.
	   The carrier also said Wednesday it would scrap a two-tier salary
scale, under which new pilots earned less than their colleagues.
The pilots, among the most highly paid in the world, had found this
detrimental to cabin solidarity.
	   The pilots seemed satisfied with the agreement, especially with
the elimination of the two-tier salary system.
	   ``On the whole, the agreement is a good one for everybody. The
company had its constraints and its objectives to achieve. I think
it will be able to reach them,'' said Christian Paris, a spokesman
for the SNPL, the main pilots' union.
	   The strike, coming as the country tries to put its best face
forward for the world's biggest sporting event, embarrassed the
government.
	   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, whose sympathies during the strike
were with the state-owned Air France, welcomed the agreement,
although he said it ``ought to have been possible to avoid it.''
	   Speaking after a Cabinet meeting, Jospin said, ``But I hope the
the company above all will benefit, because that is my primary
objective and what guided me throughout this period.''
	   The World Cup kicks off Wednesday afternoon with a match between
Brazil and Scotland.
	   Thousands of fans have descended on France for the tournament,
many having to switch airlines at the last minute or take the
train.
	   Air France is the official airline of the World Cup, and many of
its planes, decorated with huge images of soccer stars, sat idle on
runways during the runup to the soccer tournament.
	   Wednesday's agreement was reached with the SNPL, the main
pilots' union which represents the vast majority of Air France
pilots.
	   The pilots had been protesting a proposal for 500 million francs
(dlrs 83 million) in salary cuts. Air France had said the cuts were
needed to modernize the airline, which was saved from bankruptcy in
1993 but reported healthy profits in 1996 and 1997.
	   It appeared that much of the 1997 gain has been eaten up by the
strike.
	   ``The pilots can do what they want, but I was against their
strike. Air France was picking up again, and now they've lost
everything,'' said Nathalie Seulin, who works at the information
desk at Roissy airport.
	   In the statement, Air France said part of the agreement involved
guaranteed training for young pilots, at least part of which would
be paid for by the company.
	   Other carriers were cashing in on the carrier's woes.
	   British Airways estimated it was bringing in an additional 1
million pounds (dlrs 1.6 million) daily as a result of the Air
France strike.
	   As well as the airline strike, France has been hit in recent
days by walkouts by train drivers, baggage handlers, and some bus
services.

World Cup: Bad leg could keep Iran's captain out of Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
match &QL; 
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   YSSINGEAUX, France (AP) - Ahmad Reza Abedzadeh, captain and
goalkeeper of the Iranian team, will probably miss Iran's opening
World Cup match with Yugoslavia because of a bad knee, the team's
coach said Wednesday.
	   ``There isn't much chance of Abedzadeh playing in the match with
Yugoslavia,'' coach Jalal Talebi told The Associated Press.
``There's only a 40 percent chance that he'll be well enough to
play,'' he said.
	   Abedzadeh, who is still recuperating from a knee operation late
last year, practiced with the team under heavy rain and tight
security Wednesday morning.
	   Iran's will adopt a defensive strategy for the game with
Yugoslavia, whose star-studded team packs a formidable punch. But
Iranian team sources said that back-up Nima Nakissa will likely
stand guard at the goal for Sunday's game in St. Etienne.
	   Midfielder Sattar Hamedani, also recuperating from a leg injury
last month, pulled out of practice and limped back to the team's
living quarters with an ice pack on his knee. Team sources said he
too may not be well enough to play Sunday.
	   Meanwhile, star striker Ali Daei, who recently underwent surgery
for a broken cheekbone while playing with Armenia Bielefeld, said
he had recovered completely.
	   Daei said he had signed up for three years with Bayern Munich
and would be leaving his present Bundesliga team after the World
Cup.
	   Daei and its two other Bundesliga strikers, the diminutive
Khodadad Aziz and Karim Bagheri, are the pillars of the team.
	   ``We are placed in a very tough group, but no one is going to
walk over us,'' said Azizi. ``We're going to make sure that the
offense is the best part of our team.''
	   After Yugoslavia, Iran meets the United States and Germany.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Yugoslavia has agreed to settle dlrs 34
million in debts to Jordan in the next few years, a diplomat said
Wednesday.
	   The agreement was reached during a visit by a Yugoslav
government delegation to Jordan earlier in the week, Yugoslav
Embassy spokesman Oliver Potezica said.
	   He told The Associated Press the debt was incurred by phosphate
purchases from Jordan in the 1980s.
	   He declined to say when the debt will be paid off, stressing
that more details must be worked out between the two sides.
	   He said the debt will be paid through tax exemptions on
Jordanian exports to central European and Black Sea countries via
Yugoslavia's free trade zones along the Danupe River.
	   Yugoslavia also agreed to launch two firms that will carry
infrastructural developments projects in Jordan at a low cost, he
added.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The United States has dispersed dlrs 79.2
million for development projects in cash-strapped Jordan, a U.S.
Embassy statement said Wednesday.
	   The statement said the contribution is part of dlrs 150 million
annual U.S. economic assistance to Jordan, which is saddled by dlrs
6.1 billion foreign debts.
	   Of the total, dlrs 60 million will be spent on financing the
design and construction of waste water management and efficiency of
water supply in Jordan, the statement said.
	   Another dlrs 13.5 million will be used to bolster the functions
of training centers to civil servants. The rest, or dlrs 5.7
million, will be allocated for family planning, including maternal
and child health care.
	   The United States pays an additional dlrs 75 million annually to
Jordan in military assistance.
 &UR; ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Germany has agreed to grant Jordan dlrs 5.6
million for various research projects, including watershed and pest
management, a German Embassy statement said Wednesday.
	   Of the total, dlrs 1.2 million will be spent on studies on
unspecified projects carried out by German experts who will also
train Jordanians, the statement said. It did not elaborate.
	   It said dlrs 1.7 million will be spent on new technologies for
long term agricultural and forestry projects in Wadi Ibn Hammad in
Kerak, 125 kilometers (78 miles) south of Amman.

management methods in Jordan.
 &UR; ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The Pearl of Kuwait Real Estate Co. said Wednesday
it will raise its capital 50 percent to 60 million dinars (dlrs
196.07 million).
	   Abdullah al-Gabandi, the chairman of the company, told The
Associated Press that the firm needed the funds for new projects in
Kuwait and abroad, as well as for restructuring short-term debts of
around 10 million dinars (dlrs 32.67 million). He would not
elaborate.
	   The company, which is one of the largest real estate businesses
listed on the Kuwait Stock Exchange, intends to raise the money by
offering new stock.
	   Al-Gabandi said The Pearl of Kuwait Real Estate incurred losses
in 1997, but managed to recover them in the first quarter of this
year. He declined to provide figures before a general assembly
meeting scheduled for later this month.

	   NEWLY-APPOINTED managing director for Sun Microsystems Pte Ltd's
Malaysia branch office (Sun Malaysia) Govinathan Pillai has set a
target growth of between 20 and 30 per cent for the company in the
current financial year which ends in July next year.
	   To achieve this goal, Sun Malaysia will be looking to extend its
reach in its target markets such as education, telecommunications,
utilities, securities, manufacturing industries and government.
	   ``For example, we are strong in the securities segment of the
financial industry and are now moving into commercial banks,''
Govinathan said.
	   ``In the telecommunications industry, we have already
established ourselves in the Internet service provider (ISP)
market, and are making our assault into the commercial applications
arena,'' he told Computimes in Kuala Lumpur last week.
	   According to Govinathan, Sun Malaysia's aim is to find a way to
service the requirements of companies and in the process
establishes itself as a player in the key operational systems of
these organisations.
	   He said under the current economic downturn, it is not
sufficient to have the best, the latest and the fastest equipment.
	   Towards this end, he said, Sun Malaysia will focus on its value
proposition and help companies to optimise, economise and improve
efficiency during this economic uncertainties.
	   ``We want to help customers understand how the implementation of
a particular system can help them save costs and get out of a
financial situation, or help them exploit their strengths to go
into new areas,'' he added.
	   Another area of focus for Sun Malaysia will be in building
stronger channel relationships to help the partners develop their
skills to be in a better position to exploit the market when the
economic situation recovers.
	   ``It is important that the channels know and understand that the
principal does not desert them in difficult times,'' Govinathan
said.
	   Govinathan also intends to change the perception that Sun is
merely a provider of workstations and servers, as well as the Java
inventor. ``We are a mainstream company with full-fledged IT
solutions to offer,'' he said.
	   On his new position, Govinathan said the job offers him a new
management challenge as multinational corporations tend to attract
the top players in the industry and the high achievers with
different cultures and ways of doing things.
	   ``The challenge here is to learn to combine them and get the
best of everything to work as a team. In a local entity we have to
hire them young and as such have to constantly train and create a
working culture,'' he added.
	   Govinathan also said that the worldwide awareness and marketing
programmes undertaken by Sun Microsystems have helped to create
awareness locally, thus making it easier to explore and work with
local companies.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Hundreds of Albanians protested outside
NATO headquarters Wednesday to demand the Western alliance
intervene to stop Serbian military action in Kosovo.
	   ``If NATO doesn't take the decision to intervene as fast as
possible, we fear that the number of victims will increase,''
organizer Ramadan Gashi told Associated Press Television.
	   The demonstration came on the eve of a meeting of NATO defense
ministers are expected to consider plans for possible intervention,
including perhaps sending in troops, air strikes or a no-fly zone
over Kosovo.
	   Some 300 protesters took part in the demonstration organized by
the Albanian Community in Belgium. Many waved the red-and-black
Albanian flag or others carried banners. One read ``Nothing learned
from Bosnia?''
	   The demonstration was in solidarity with a a protest by some
20,000 ethnic Albanians in the provincial capital Pristina. The
organizers said Albanians living in Washington, Ottawa and capitals
around Europe were also planning protests.

	   JOHOR BARU, Sun. - The Johor Indian Business Association today
welcomed the Prime Minister's assurance that the needs of all
Malaysians would be taken care of during these difficult times.
	   Jiba president P. Sivakumar said Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir
Mohamad's pledge that the Government was taking measures to ensure
all received assistance was also very gratifying.
	   He said such commitment by the country's top leadership was a
clear testimony that the Government had the interest and well-being
of all Malaysians at heart.
	   ``This is the best manifestation of a good Government,'' he
said, adding that it was very heart-warming to know the Government
recognised that all sections of the population had been hit hard by
the economic problems.
	   Sivakumar was commenting on the Prime Minister's speech in Kuala
Lumpur yesterday in conjunction with the 76th birthday of the Yang
di-Pertuan Agong Tuanku Ja'afar.
	   Among others, Dr Mahathir had assured Malaysians that no one
would be neglected or their problems glossed over by the Government
during the current economic situation.
	   He also said everyone, from unemployed workers and traders to
small and big entrepreneurs, would receive assistance or have their
burdens eased as the situation was not of their own making.
	   Sivakumar said Jiba, a non-governmental organisation dedicated
to helping Indian businessmen in Johor, appreciated the
Government's commitment and pledge of assistance.
	   Jiba provides managerial and technical support to Indian
businesses, and is involved in skills training, and joint ventures
with Bumiputera and Chinese enterprises. It also part of a
transport consortium.
	   Sivakumar said one sector of the economy badly in need of
government support and assistance was the transport industry. Small
independent lorry operators are among the worst hit by the
slowdown.
	   ``Hundreds of lorry operators have lost their vehicles to banks
and finance companies for defaulting on their mortgage payments.
Jiba appeals to the Prime Minister to work out a moratorium with
the financial institutions to allow the lorry operators to pay only
interest on their loans for six months, until the situation
improves.
	   ``Without government intervention, more operators will have to
close shop and this will affect the economy even further.''

World Cup: Croats fight to limit injury list _ and stay motivated
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VITTEL, France (AP) _ Already missing a top striker, Croatian
coach Miroslav Blazevic dreads the idea of performing more
``acrobatics'' with his lineup.
	   But inside defender Slaven Bilic, one of the team's mainstays,
may force his boss to do just that if his hamstring strain doesn't
clear up in time for Croatia's World Cup debut against fellow
newcomer Jamaica on Sunday.
	   Team doctors will wait until Friday to advise Blazevic whether
the 29-year-old Everton defender, who has no easy substitute, is
fit to play.
	   ``It's a crucial problem,'' Blazevic said after Wednesday's
light practice on a rain-soaked field at the local stadium. ``At
that point, I would have to do some acrobatics, something no one
recommends in a serious situation like the World Cup.''
	   A quarterfinalist in the 1996 European Championship, the Croats
are considered a dark horse at the World Cup.
	   They were decimated even before taking up quarters in this
pastoral eastern French spa town when their hottest striker, Alen
Boksic of Rome's Lazio, dropped out with an injury. And forward
Igor Cvitanovic was thrown off the squad for refusing to run laps
in practice.
	   In their last warmup before leaving home, the Croats whipped
non-qualifier Australia 7-0.
	   But Blazevic, a strict disciplinarian who likes to bark martial
orders to his players, wasn't happy with their lackadaisical
performance in the final tuneup, a 2-1 against local third division
team Raon L'Etape on Tuesday night.
	   ``I shouted at all of them,'' he said. ``This was not worthy of
our reputation.''
	   Croatia's top scorer Davor Suker, of European champion Real
Madrid, even missed a penalty kick during the game.
	   Then again, Blazevic may not have been showing his hand because
Jamaican trainer Rene Simoes was in the stands checking out the
Reggae Boyz' first opponent.
	   Blazevic has watched the Jamaicans play twice, against Brazil
and Sweden. He says the main challenge is ``their
unpredictability.''
	   But self-confidence is never in short supply with the Croatians,
who are shouldering the hopes of a traditionally soccer-mad nation
preoccupied with the Yugoslav wars and economic problems this
decade.
	   ``We will play our game,'' Blazevic insists. ``I don't adapt to
others' style.''
	   In its other first-round matches, Croatia meets Japan on June 20
and two-time world champion Argentina on June 26.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - Passengers using the new Kuala Lumpur
International Airport in Sepang will not have to worry about
getting lost as there will be airport ``ambassadors'' to assist
them.
	   Malaysia Airports Berhad, which will be operating the RM10.5
billion airport, has created the service to ensure smooth passenger
flow and reduce incidents of passengers missing flights. The
necessity arose after airport trials revealed that some passengers
at the airport for the first time, had lost their way.
	   It happened again yesterday, in what was the biggest operation
trials comprising more than 3,000 volunteers, with many complaining
that the lack of information and instructions made it difficult for
them to find the check-in counters and aircraft gates.
	   Malaysia Airports (Sepang) Sdn Bhd airport operations executive
Khaw Sim Min said the service will start with about 200 volunteers
from Malaysia Airports.
	   They will be providing help to passengers at ``strategic and
important''
	   locations within the airport.
	   ``The airport is such a huge complex that it could be very
daunting for any passenger coming for the first time. Although we
have enough signages around the airport, there are still people who
will require assistance.
	   ``The ambassadors will not only help passengers find their gates
or check-in counters but also assist them by providing information
on important airport procedures.''
	   He added that the service would bring to the airport a sense of
``user- friendliness'' and show that the spirit of a caring society
was well embedded in its staff.
	   ``It will also provide a warm and friendly treatment to
foreigners who come here and create a lasting positive impression
of the airport and the country.''
	   He said more than anything, the service will mean that
passengers can rest assured that they will pass through the airport
with a sense of safety, security and comfort.
	   Volunteers will have to attend a five-day training programme to
equip them with basic knowledge and skill required for the task.
	   ``This is also to familiarise themselves with every part of the
airport and the services and facilities available.''
	   Asked if the service will be a permanent feature of the airport,
Khaw said: ``We will continue to provide assistance as long as it
is required. We may stop the service once passengers are familiar
with the airport.''
	   KLIA will be officially opened by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong
Tuanku Ja'afar on June 27 and will commence full commercial
operations on June 30.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Hundreds of Albanians protested outside
NATO headquarters Wednesday to demand the Western alliance
intervene to stop Serbian military action in Kosovo.
	   ``If NATO doesn't take the decision to intervene as fast as
possible, we fear that the number of victims will increase,''
organizer Ramadan Gashi told Associated Press Television.
	   The demonstration came on the eve of a meeting of NATO defense
ministers which is expected to consider plans for possible
intervention, including perhaps sending in troops, air strikes or a
no-fly zone over Kosovo.
	   Some 300 protesters took part in the demonstration organized by
the Albanian Community in Belgium. Many waved the red-and-black
Albanian flag or others carried banners. One read ``Nothing learned
from Bosnia?''
	   The demonstration was in solidarity with a a protest by some
20,000 ethnic Albanians in the provincial capital Pristina. The
organizers said Albanians living in Washington, Ottawa and capitals
around Europe were also planning protests.

Government regrets patriarch won't attend burial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A deputy prime minister said Wednesday he regrets
that the Russian Orthodox Church patriarch will not attend the
burial of the country's last czar.
	   Boris Nemtsov said he did not know whether Alexy II's decision
means that President Boris Yeltsin will also miss the July 17
service, Russian news agencies reported.
	   The church's Holy Synod said Tuesday that no member of the
church hierarchy would take part in the burial of Czar Nicholas II,
his family and servants, but that local priests in St. Petersburg
could.
	   The church has expressed lingering doubts over the identity of
nine sets of bones recovered in 1991, despite a six-year
investigation and forensic tests in Russia, Britain and the United
States.
	   Despite the patriarch's decision, ``it is a matter of conscience
and honor to bury the remains of the czar and his relatives on July
17 in St. Petersburg on day of the 80th anniversary of the shooting
of the imperial family,'' Nemtsov said.
	   Nemtsov headed the Russian government commission that was in
charge of testing the remains.
	   Russian media have said that Yeltsin would only take part in the
ceremony if the patriarch did. Relatives of the czar may also skip
the burial, Interfax said.
	   ``The Royal House treated the Holy Synod's decision with great
respect because it shares the patriarch's doubts on the
authenticity of the remains,'' said a spokesman for the relatives,
Alexander Zakatov.
	   Zakatov said Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna Romanova will
decide by the end of June whether to attend the burial. The grand
duchess and her teen-age son Georgy are considered by most
monarchists to be the heirs to the Romanov throne. Her father was a
first cousin of the czar.
	   The funeral service will be held in the Peter and Paul
Cathedral, the traditional burial site of the Romanovs, who ruled
Russia for 300 years. Hundreds of foreign representatives have been
invited to attend.

	   The opposition BNP-led long march headed for the Chittagong Hill
Tracts (CHT) on Tuesday evening after being held up for nine long
hours at Mukti Sarani near Kanchpur Bridge, 10 kilometres from
Dhaka, due to roadblocks on both sides of the bridge.
	   The road blocks were put up by placing about 200 trucks and
other vehicles across the street, which caused a huge traffic jam
making movement of vehicular traffic impossible.
	   Tyres of some of these vehicles were deflated by gunfire. As the
day wore on the number of stranded vehicles on both sides of the
bridge swelled.
	   The police cleared the road at around 6 in the evening with the
help of the Roads and Highways Department thus enabling the long
marchers to resume their journey towards Chittagong.
	   At the head of the caravan was BNP Chairperson Begum Khaleda
Zia's vehicle with about 700 automobiles closely following it.
	   At Mukti Sarani and its adjoining areas the nine hour wait was
tension-packed punctuated by burst of gunfire and chase and
counter-chase between the supporters of the march and their
opponents. According to the long marchers at least 50 shots were
fired towards them by unidentified gunmen.
	   Three activists belonging to the Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal (JCD)
were injured as a result.
	   Begum Khaleda Zia, talking to newsmen, accused the government of
deliberately creating obstruction to the passage of long march even
though it had promised not to do so. She said that MPs belonging to
the ruling party had organised terrorist activities although the
government through a press note had prohibited carrying of firearms
in political programmes. She particularly held Shamim Osman, MP of
Awami League from Narayangonj responsible for terrorist activities
and for creating obstructions to the movement of traffic.
	   But after crossing the bridge at around 7 pm the BNP and its
allies including the Jamaat-e-Islami demanded that the long march
be escorted by the police upto its destination and official road
clearance be given to complete the march peacefully. The marchers
again started proceeding towards Chittagong when the government
fulfilled their demands. A contingent of police will now escort the
long march and protect it from any kind of intervention by any
quarter in any place along the Dhaka-Chittagong Highway.
	   Jatiyatabadi Jubodal leader Mirza Abbas alleged that the
opponents of marchers also abducted two activists of the party
known to be ward commissioners of Dhaka. The wounded persons were
being treated by the doctors travelling along with the marchers.
	   Local people said that on Monday night a group of armed youth
came near Kanchpur and barricaded the road with trucks and buses.
The youths fired at the wheels of the vehicles so that no one could
remove them from the spot.
	   The plying of buses to and from Dhaka came to a standstill from
10 pm on Monday night. No newspaper from Dhaka could be sent after
Kanchpur from Dhaka on Tuesday due to road barricade.
	   Though the local people alleged that the blockade was created by
the cadres of the local MP, Industries Minister Tofail Ahmed in an
interview with the BBC said that the blockade was created by
truckdrivers in protest against some illegal demands by the JCD
workers, the student wing of the BNP.
	   Meanwhile, angry marchers obstructed by the barricades, damaged
several vehicles near the Kanchpur Bridge as the long march to CHT
stayed halted here.
	   At this stage BNP Chairperson Begum Zia asked her party
activists to remain calm and wait till the road was cleared by the
authorities.
	   ``We will sit here if we are not allowed to move on,'' she told
newsmen who are covering the long march.
	   It was decided that the Deputy Opposition leader Professor
Badruddoza Chowdhury now in Chittagong, would lead the long march
from there if she was kept obstructed.
	   Jamaat-e-Islami and other smaller groups in the seven-party
alliance followed the BNP's march. Leaders of Jamaat and Jatiya
Party (Kazi Zafar) had brief consultation with Begum Zia to review
the situation.
	   When Begum Zia was holding a meeting at Mahanagar filling
station near link road, a group of BNP activists were seen chasing
a group of Awami League activists near Sanarpar. Both the groups
pelted stones at each other.
	   Later the BNP supporters entered the village and ransacked the
area. They also set fire to a shop which was later extinguished by
the people. In this incident one BNP worker was injured.
	   Narayanganj Awami League held a rally at Kanchpur Bridge
crossing from 7 am to 10 am when its leaders Prof Nazma Rahman,
Shamim Osman MP and Major Gen (Retd) KM Shafiullah warned that they
would not allow the marchers to pass through the area.
	   Riot police, armed battalion and Ansars, deployed there passed
the time as onlookers. Local people alleged that some armed
youngsters fired at several trucks and looted several buses which
were either coming from Chittagong or going from Dhaka. There was a
rumour that some of the women passengers were not only looted but
also being molested by the armed hooligans.
	   Later, when trucks and buses were coming to the spot, armed
hooligans stopped them and burst the tyres. As such there was a
total mess on the highway and no vehicles could ply on the road
till the police cleared the way at around 6 pm.
	   Driver Alauddin alleged that the armed goons snatched away 1800
taka from him, while Babul Hossen alleged that he was robbed of
Taka 5000. Besides Sirajul Haque a shrimp businessman said that he
was robbed of Tk 7,000 while another businessman Abu Bakar said
that the armed goons snatched away 12,000 taka from him.
	   One newly-wed woman was forcibly brought down from a Dhaka-bound
bus and was allegedly violated by the armed hooligans.
	   BNP leaders contacted the Home Ministry from the spot by
telephone and the authorities were learnt to have instructed
on-duty police to clear the road as soon as possible.
	   The source in the administration however said that the police on
duty were instructed only at around 4.30 pm to clear the way. The
source expressed surprise that when the administration could have
given instruction instantly why it took about 20 hours time to do
so.
	   Shamim Osman talking to our Narayanganj Correspondent Mostafa
Karim said that they did not do anything beyond the programme
announced by the central leaders. He said that the Awami League
brought out only peace procession in the morning and in the evening
from Shiddhirganj area. He said that the AL workers did not stage
any sit-in on the Dhaka-Chittagong Highway. He alleged that the
workers of the BNP wanted to snatch the buses and trucks on Monday
night. He said as the drivers of the vehicles fled out of fear of
the BNP cadres there was an automatic road barricade.
	   He said that he had heard the reports of firing but did not see
anything like that. He said that there was no intention of
attacking the democratic procession of any party.
	   When asked, the District Administration did not blame anybody
for blocking the road. However Additional District Magistrate Ujjal
Bikash Dutta said that the administration was trying to maintain
law and order.
	   During the tension Begum Zia addressed gathering several times
and each time she urged upon all to be patient in the face of all
kinds of provocation.
	   Addressing party workers after remaining stranded on the
Dhaka-Chittagong Highway at Sanarpar point within the
Dhaka-Narayanganj-Demra (DND) area for more than nine hours, as
rival political activists blocked the way, she said the government
would not be able to undo the movement by closing roads used by the
people.
	   Begum Zia made her address after holding a meeting with the
members of the BNP Standing Committee and some senior leaders at
the roadside office of a petrol filling station and announced the
decision to continue the long march.
	   The BNP chief sought to know from the long marchers if they were
ready to resume the march towards the CHT. The audience replied in
a thunderous chorus, ``Yes.'' She then advised the long marchers to
peacefully wait before the march started again after the painful
delay.
	   BNP workers had earlier become restive and had been raising
slogans in favour of a tough stance to break the barricade at the
Kanchpur point and carry forward the long march. Party workers
expressed spontaneous jubilation when Begum Zia finally announced
resumption of the long march.
	   Earlier addressing the brief rally at Paltan Maidan from where
the march started in the morning Begum Zia charged the government
with conspiracies to hand over the CHT to India. She posed a
question as to why the government did not want the people to go to
the CHT although citizens had the right to go anywhere and hold
meetings and processions.
	   Announcing the start of the long march from there she said,
``Allah is with us.'' She invited all long marchers to join in a
munajat for its success. The munajat was led by Rafiqul Islam Bakul
MP.
	   Leader of the Opposition started the long march of BNP from
Paltan Maidan by warning the government that it would have to bear
the responsibility of any consequences arising out of any
obstruction.
	   She reached the historic site at around 8.40 am and was straight
driven to the centre of the ground in an off-white jeep, driven by
her son Tariq Rahman. The BNP Chairperson briefly addressed the
huge gathering standing on the jeep.
	   The marchers carried national and BNP flags and portraits of
late President Ziaur Rahman and Begum Khaleda Zia. They shouted
various slogans, including down with Sheikh Hasina, scrap the black
CHT accord, and resist Indian conspiracy.
	   From early morning, thousands of party activists from the city,
its adjoining districts and far flung areas started to converge at
the Paltan Maidan to join the march as more than 5000 police and
para-military BDR guarded the capital.
	   Activists of Jamaat gathered at Ramna Green and began the long
march at 9.45 am. Party Chief Professor Golam Azam addressed the
gathering before leading the march.
	   At Sanarpar Begum Zia said that the government had seized all
buses and trucks at the police lines to obstruct the long march
because it had been detached from the people. Begum Zia said that
her party workers had stayed on the highway peacefully for the
whole day.
	   Earlier talking to newsmen immediately after the long march
caravan came to a halt due to obstructions created on the Kanchpur
bridge she alleged that the government had intentionally done this
which proved that the government had done something wrong regarding
the CHT and did not want other people to go there.
	   Meanwhile, the streets of the metropolis were still mostly
vacant and Dhaka dwellers were yet to begin the normal chores of
life when the BNP rally began at the historic Paltan Maidan at 7
A.M. before the start of the long march to the Chittagong Hill
Tracts (CHT).
	   Among the central leaders of the party who reached there early
were: Khondker Delwar Hossain, Barrister Abdus Salam Talukdar,
Chowdhury Kamal Ibne Yusuf, Justice Habibul Islam Bhuiyan, Sheikh
Tayebur Rahman, Mayor of Khulna City Corporation, Khondoker
Mahbubuddin Ahmed, Moudud Ahmed, Dr. Khondker Mosharraf Hossain,
Abdul Matin Chowdhury, Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, Lt. Gen (retd)
Mir Shawkat Ali and Mirza Abbas former Mayor of the Dhaka City
Corporation.
	   Their faces were grim as they already had information that the
route of the long march had been blocked all the way from Jatrabari
to Kanchpur. Moudud Ahmed told one central leader that the earlier
the march was started the better because trouble might increase
with the passing of the morning hours.
	   As streams of people continued to come, BNP's Publicity
Secretary Fazlur Rahman Patal told the gathering that police was
forcibly taking away motor vehicles brought by party workers for
use in the long march.
	   Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan while addressing the gathering advised long
marchers who came in buses and microbuses not to disembark fearing
that the vehicles might be requisitioned by police.
	   After Mannan Bhuiyan's address Muhammad Qamruzzaman of Jamaat
spoke wishing the programme a success. Abdus Salam Talukdar,
Barrister Moudud Ahmed, KM Obaidur Rahman MP, Amanullah Aman MP,
Advocate Nurul Huq Majumder of the National Democratic Alliance,
and Shawkat Hossain Nilo of the Progressive Nationalist Party spoke
at the rally. The Programme was cut short when Begum Khaleda Zia
reached the venue and the long march began with a short speech made
by her. The Paltan area by then turned into a human sea.
	   Our Comilla correspondent adds: the people who came to
participate in the long march here on Tuesday became agitated at
the news that the motorcade of the opposition leader Begum Khaleda
Zia had been obstructed at Shanir Akhra near Dhaka. The agitated
mob uprooted rail-line at Paduar Bazar near Comilla.
	   The agitated mob also ransacked an inter-city train, seven
buses, three trucks, a BDR vehicle, a police van and the local
Awami League office.
	   About 20,000 people from Comilla, Sylhet, Moulavibazar,
Habiganj, Sunamganj, Kishsoreganj, Brahmanbaria, Chandpur, Laxmipur
and Noakhali thronged at the Paduar Bazar on the Dhaka-Chittagong
highway at about 12 noon. The movement of vehicles came to a
standstill on the Dhaka-Chittagong highway as well as the Noakhali
and Chandpur road due to the gathering.
	   The long marchers pelted stones at the inter-city Upakul Express
which was going to Noakhali from Dhaka at about 4.30 pm.
	   At about 5.15 pm the long marchers uprooted the tracks rail near
Paduar Bazar. They also ransacked signalling apparatuses. Train
communication between Dhaka and Chittagong, Noakhali, Chandpur and
some other parts of the country got snapped following the incident.
	   Chase and counter chase occured between the pro-long march
processionists and supporters of a peace rally at Chandina. Four
Awami League leaders including the Comilla (North) district Awami
League general secretary Jahangir Alam Sarker were injured. One of
the injured Kazi Golam Mostafa was admitted to Comilla Medical
College Hospital. Long marchers ransacked a truck at Kabila on the
Dhaka-Chittagong highway.
	   No vehicles plied the Dhaka-Chittagong highway.
	   Begum Zia addressing a way side gathering at Padua Bazar said
that the future movement would be for protecting the independence
and sovereignty of the country and for removing the autocrats from
power.
	   Begum Zia reached Comilla at around 11.15 p.m and addressed the
gathering from her Pajerp Jeep. She urged the people to be united
to bring the downfall of the autocratic government.

World Cup: Germans battle for places in starting lineup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ Coach Berti Vogts has created such an
intense competitive atmosphere in the German team that apart from
goalkeeper Andreas Koepke virtually none of the other 21 players
are certain to be among the starters.
	   While often such rivalries breed jealousies and hostilities, at
least some German players think they can help the team capture its
fourth World Cup title.
	   ``I think our strength can be that everyone accepts that not
everybody can be among the starters and that all players are ready
to take on any role assigned by the coach,'' Olaf Thon said
Wednesday.
	   Thon, the 32-year-old libero, himself is in such a position.
	   Recalled to the team after a four-year absence to replace
injured Matthias Sammer, Thon himself fell victim to an ankle
injury that left his fitness in doubt shortly before the World Cup.
	   That prompted Vogts to recall Lothar Matthaeus, the 37-year-old
veteran with a German record of 125 caps who is in his fifth World
Cup. Matthaeus is usually not content with a bench role.
	   Thon said he wasn't worried. ``It's very good that our coach can
choose from two very good players for each position,'' he said.
	   ``I am relaxed about it, I think the coach will look at the
performance of each players and I think I belong in the starting
lineup,'' Thon said. ``I'll try to play libero but if necessary I
can also play in the midfield.''
	   With so many experienced players around _ Germany's average age
is 29 years and seven months _ many players are used to leadership
positions in their clubs and the national team.
	   Juergen Klinsmann is the captain, a role that used to belong to
Matthaeus, who likes being the center of attention. They have
officially buried the hatchet but their well-publicized feuds could
erupt any time.
	   Midfielder Andreas Moeller said there was good team spirit in
the camp, but that competition was greater than two years ago when
Germany won the European title.
	   ``It's the main difference in our preparation,'' Moeller said.
``Berti has really fired up the competition among us, he's getting
the maximum out of all players.''
	   ``No one feels secure and you can see and feel the fire on the
pitch every day in practice,'' Moeller said.
	   ``I don't really think there is one leader, I think the
leadership is spread out among several players,'' he said.
	   ``Each players should concentrate on his strengths and everybody
will be judged on their performances,'' Moeller said.

	   WILDLIFE in exile. Such is the sorry fate of the country's
numerous wildlife species which have been purged from their natural
habitats by rapid and ill-conceived development.
	   But unlike man, these displaced forest creatures are not endowed
with the intellectual wherewithal for smooth and fast adaptation to
a new environment. Most do not survive. The passing of each day in
a hostile environment brings the animals closer to the brink of
extinction. Without the thick cover of the foliage, they are most
vulnerable to the insatiable appetite of some for exotic meat and
trophies. They either end up on a plate with head and skin pierced
to the wall or left maimed, if not bleeding to death in the traps.
	   Neither are these homeless creatures welcomed in our midst. The
tampering of the natural ecology by urban expansion has driven the
animals to the edge of the concrete jungle and people's backyards.
Sightings of civet cats, monitor lizards, monkeys, slow lorises and
boa constrictors arouse more shudder than sympathy. Ironically,
these homeless creatures are accused of encroaching into the lives
of city dwellers. It is unfortunate that very few are willing to
link the displacement of the animals to forest encroachment by man
- all in the name of development.
	   But it is no longer correct to argue that this is the price we
have to pay for progress.
	   Development is indeed a necessity that should be finely balanced
in harmony with nature. Walking this fine line encompasses the
question of prioritising matters and practicality. True, reality
dictates priorities but it is a realism which must be rooted in the
understanding that man's needs should not assume a greater
importance over the needs of nature's habitants. The endurance and
loveliness of the landscape, plants and animals depend on the human
ability to respect their right to existence.
	   Man is endowed with intellectual prowess and consequently, it is
man who has the greater responsibility to protect the natural
resources as assets which will be turned over to the next
generation with increased, and not impaired, value. Taming nature
does not imply its destruction. Acceptable compromises should be
seen as sustainable solutions.
	   The nation does not lack a comprehensive environmental
protection policy. But the long list of endangered species suggest
that there are troubling weaknesses in its implementation. The loss
of the rhinoceros habitat in the Endau-Rompin area indicates that
our eco-tourism activities pay homage to tourism comfort and needs
than the continued survival of the animals. There is an urgent need
to ensure the country's eco-tourism activities are carried out in a
manner that is sensitive to the needs of the habitats. An animal's
conservation site is not meant to be a circus.
	   As important as eco-tourism may be as a revenue earner, the
authorities should control the type of infrastructural development
built in these areas. It defeats the ultimate aim of environmental
protection if trees are felled and animals booted out to make way
for roads and chalets. The number of visitors per visit into the
wildlife and botanical sanctuaries should also be controlled.
	   The proposed review of the Protection of Wildlife Act is indeed
timely.
	   But it must be realised that the long-term survivability of the
wildlife species and their natural habitats will involve much more
than tougher legislation and set-aside refuge sites. Funds should
be pumped into sanctuaries to ensure they are scientifically
managed.

	   At least twenty persons, including a leader of the Awami League
city unit, were injured and about 30 vehicles damaged when the
workers of BNP and Awami League were locked in a clash in New
Market areas here this evening.
	   Some eight persons were also arrested from different points.
Arms and ammunition were recovered from their possession.
	   Meanwhile, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in Parliament, Dr
Badruddoza Chowdhury today said the long march towards Khagrachari
will start from here at 8 am tomorrow if the situation remains
normal.
	   Senior leaders of BNP, including Badruddoza Chowdhury at a press
briefing this evening alleged that Awami League workers attacked
the procession of BNP in Darul Fazal Market area when the
procession was crossing the area. They claimed that police and
workers of Chhatra League opened fire in the New Market area.
	   When asked, an official of Chittagong Metropolitan Police (CMP)
told The Independent that police lobbed tear gas shells and fired
into the air to disperse the rival groups.
	   Joint Secretary of Awami League city unit Kazi Enamul Hoq Danu
was injured by the brickbats hurled at him by the BNP men in Darul
Fazal Market area.
	   According to city corporation sources, at least 10 vehicles,
including the jeep of the Mayor, were damaged by the BNP activists
at different points in the city. The jeep of the mayor was damaged
in front of the Awami League office where he was attending a
meeting. Some BNP workers entered the City Corporation office and
damaged the vehicles, the corporation sources said.
	   Later addressing a rally at the Kazir Dewri Corner of the Port
city, Dr Badrudduzza Chowdhury alleged the government was hatching
a conspiracy to foil the long march. According to him, the
government will hand over the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) to
Shanti Bahini leader Santo Larma.
	   The president of city BNP Meer Naseer Uddin was in the chair.
The city unit held the rally in protest against the barricade on
the Dhaka-Chittagong Highway near Kanchpur. Badruddoza said the
workers of Awami League were trying to foil the long march
programme of BNP and its allies. He alleged that the government did
not want to allow the exercise of democratic norms and practices in
the country. ``The government had failed to run the state and
become an anti people government'' he said referring to power and
gas crises.
	   Oli Ahmed, member, BNP standing committee and convenor of the
long march supervisory committee alleged that at the directive of
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, local Awami League leaders had sent
six hundred trucks towards Dhaka last night. The Awami League
workers led by Shafiullah MP and Shamim Osman MP of Narayangonj
placed the trucks on the road to foil the long march, he alleged.
	   Oli Ahmed MP warned that the Port city will be paralysed and
Sheikh Hasina will not be allowed to arrive here if the government
does not refrain from undemocratic activities. The rally was also
addressed, among others, by joint secretary of BNP Abdullah Al
Noman and Giasuddin Quader Chowdhury MP.
	   Jamaat-e-Islami also held a rally and brought out processions in
protest against the road barricade at Kanchpur near Dhaka. The
rally was chaired by the Jamaat city ameer Maulana Abu Taher.
Addressing the rally, Shahjahan Chowdhury, Prof Mofizur Rahman,
Afsaruddin Chowdhury and Shamsul Islam called upon the people to
join the long march towards Rangamati led by ameer Professor Golam
Azam tomorrow.
	   Meanwhile, the Awami League city unit held a rally in front of
the party office at Nasimon Bhaban in protest against the attack on
the party office reportedly by BNP workers.
	   Akhteruzzaman Chowdhury Babu, the central Commerce and Industry
Secretary of Awami League presided over the rally. The city Awami
League secretary and Mayor of Chittagong Alhaj ABM Mohiuddin
Chowdhury, vice president Alhaj Abul Kalam Showdagar, Dr Saydur
Rahman, Nayeemuddin and Advocate Ibrahim Hossain Babul addressing
the rally called for resisting the people who were engaged in
anti-social activities.
	   They said, the BNP workers attacked the AL office when they held
a meeting after their procession in support of the peace agreement
on CHT. ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury termed the BNP as the patron of
terrorism and anarchy adding BNP was hatching a conspiracy to
destabilise the country.
	   Our Correspondent from Khagrachari adds: The members of law
enforcing agencies are on full alert in Khagrachari district town
to maintain law and order during the long march of BNP. Besides,
the Army was patrolling the Khagrachari-Chittagong road.
	   Meanwhile, BNP workers are preparing to welcome the long
marchers when they arrive at Khagrachari.
	   Shajuddin, the convenor of the All-Party Unity Council and long
march of BNP said at least four thousand Bangalees were waiting to
receive the long marchers. The All-Party Unity Council held a rally
at 8.30 pm at Shapla Chattar.
	   Earlier, Awami League held a rally at the same place in support
of the peace agreement on CHT. A large number of Awami League
workers carrying white flags attended the rally which was presided
over by Khagrachari district president of Awami League Nurunnabi.
	   The BNP also brought out a procession of trucks in support of
the long march.
	   The chairman of Khagrachari Pourashabha Md. Abul Kashem in a
statement said he will welcome the long marchers in the town.
	   Santo Larma, the chairman of Parbattya Chattagram Jana Sanghati
Samity (PCJSS) now staying in the town has directed his supporters
to maintain peace and discipline during the long march.

	   Government yesterday blamed a group of BNP supporters for
blocking the Dhaka-Chittagong highway in Narayanganj by deflating
wheels of buses and trucks leading to a huge traffic jam.
	   ``Police Super of Narayanganj said a terrorist group, led by BNP
leader Noor Hossain, on Monday night put barricades at Simrai in
Siddirganj thana and forcibly tried to capture buses, mini-buses
and trucks on Dhaka-Chittagong and Dhaka-Sylhet highways,'' said an
official handout here.
	   It said the terrorists also unleashed attacks on the vehicles
and their drivers and assaulted some passengers and snatched away
their money and wrist watches.
	   Narayanganj-Demra-Meghna Sarak Paribahan Sramik Committee
president Taher Khan Babu filed a case with Siddirganj thana in
this connection, the handout said.
	   On information, according to the SP, senior police officials in
the district rushed to the spot. But the barricade already created
a huge traffic congestion on Dhaka-Chittagong and Dhaka-Sylhet
highways.
	   Being requested by police, the handout said, Roads and Highways
Department sent a wrecker to the troubled spot but, it could not
reach there due to traffic congestion on both sides of the
barricade.
	   The handout said SP of Narayanganj informed that police in
cooperation with Roads and Highways Department were trying to bring
normalcy on the road.
	   In a similar version, leaders of bus owners' and workers'
associations have blamed local terrorists of BNP for the disruption
and said such acts in the name of political programme is very
unfortunate.
	   They criticised the attack by BNP on innocent passengers and
demanded legal action against the culprits.
	   Signatories to the statement are Purbanchaliyo Malik Oikya Jote
president Ibrahim Chengish, Mini-bus Malik Oikya Jote president M
Mokter Hossain, Narayanganj-Demra-Meghna-Narsingdi Bus, Mini-bus
Malik Samity president Nurul Amin Maksud, Dhaka-Narayanganj Sarak
Paribahan Sramik Union president M Aiyub Ali and its acting
secretary Jilani Mia.

	   BUILT at a cost of RM120,000, the new cricket pavilion at Kolej
Tuanku Ja'afar, Mantin is the first of its kind in Negri Sembilan.
	   The pavilion which was opened last Saturday by Tunku Tan Sri
Imran Tuanku Ja'afar is a joint venture between the college and the
Silver State Cricket Club.
	   The college provides the ground and the maintenance while the
club has agreed to bear the cost in consideration for a 10-year
priority use of the pavilion and ground.
	   Last Saturday's opening ceremony was held at the ground after a
25-over friendly cricket match between Tunku Imran's 11 and the
President of Silver State Cricket Club's 11.
	   Tunku Imran, who is a trustee and governor of the college, is
also president of the Malaysian Cricket Association and a keen
supporter of the game.
	   The Silver State Cricket Club was founded in 1991 by Bill
Davidson and has about 40 playing members. It participates actively
in all local competitions at inter-club level. The core players
that make up the team come from Perak, Kuala Lumpur and Negri
Sembilan.
	   ``One of the principal aim of building the pavilion is to
encourage more people to take up cricket as a sport. Since this is
the only place with all the sufficient facilities in the State, I
would urge all those interested in playing cricket to come and join
our club, entitling them to play on the ground for free,'' said
club president Davidson.
	   ``I would also like to extend my sincere thanks and appreciation
to all sponsors, donors and contributers who have made the project
a success.''

	   Jamaat-e-Islami ameer prof. Golam Azam yesterday said that the
long march would prove that the people of Bangladesh were against,
what he said, the black' Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace accord.
	   He was addressing a rally of the party at the Ramna Green prior
to the start of the long march towards Chittagong Hill Tracts.
Prof. Golam Azam led the march which started at about 9.45 am with
several thousand activists of the Jamaat-e-Islami shouting slogans
like ``Scrap the black accord, we don't accept the
unconstitutional' CHT agreement''.
	   Sitting on a jeep the 76-year old Jamaat ameer led the marchers
who were riding in buses, cars, jeeps and trucks. Some workers also
followed the motorcade of the marchers on foot.
	   Jamaat-e-Islami nayeb-e-ameer Maulana AKM Yusuf, Jamaat
parliamentary party leader Maulana Delwar Hossain Saidee MP, Jamaat
assistant secretary general Muhammad Quamaruzzaman, Ali Ahsan
Muhammad Mujahid, publicity secretary Abdul Kader Mollah, Jamaat
city unit leaders Maulana ATM Masum and Saiful Alam Khan Milon
spoke. Jamaat city ameer ATM Azharul Islam presided.
	   BNP standing committee member and former minister Barrister
Abdus Salam Talukdar addressed the rally expressing solidarity of
his party with the Jamaat programme. Jagpa vice president Dr. MA
Aziz and Dhaka University prof. Hasanuzzaman also spoke. BNP leader
Anwar Zahid was also present.
	   Prof. Golam Azam said the long march was organised to protest
against the announcement of the three hill districts as the special
area for a particular tribe. He said the Bangalees living in the
Chittagong hill tracts who owned half of the hilly areas were made
second class citizens through the Chittagong Hill Tracts peace
agreement. He said this could not be accepted and added that the
agreement must be cancelled.
	   The Jamaat ameer urged the tribal people not to be misled by the
India propaganda. He said India would soon demand gas, transit and
Chittagong port facilities from Bangladesh, and if those demands
were not met then an independent Jhumland' would be announced. He
said that Hasina government wouln't be able to avert such a
situation.
	   Condemning the government for the repressive measures it has
taken against the long marchers, prof. Golam Azam said ``we will go
to the Chittagong Hill Tracts, inshallah''.
	   Maulana AKM Yusuf said the long march was a spontaneous protest
of the people against the Chittagong Hill Tracts accord.
	   Maulana Delwar Hossain Saidee said the long march was supported
by the Quran and Hadith. He said it was the moral duty of every
Muslim to join the long march. He said all political parties and
intellectuals except those belonging to the Awami League were
supporting the long march.
	   Muhammad Quamaruzzaman said the government was trying to foil
the long march. He said police were creating obstacles at Kanchpur
and Tongi to prevent the long marchers from leaving Dhaka city for
Chittagong.

	   KEN-Air Services beat nine other teams for the second
consecutive year to become champion in the third annual Ansett
Australia Bowl'Em Over finals at Bangsar Bowl recently.
	   Holiday Tours emerged the first runner-up and the third place
went to Bousted Travel.
	   The Ansett Bowl'Em Over clinics were organised by Ansett
Australia for frontline travel agents to offer a fun activity while
provinding an opportunity for the agents to learn a new sport.
	   Seven other teams of five players each who participated in the
finals included top travel agencies in the country - Peter
Stuyvesant Travel, Sime Darby Travel, Deluxe Tours, Gasi Travel,
Sri-America Tours and Falcon Travel.
	   Ansett Australia's country sales manager for Malaysia Henry Goh
said the event was organised to support the country's emphasis on
sports this year.
	   It is also to allow travel industry staff to learn some skills
and socialise.
	   ``The competition was organised in our effort to cultivate
closer ties between the agents while offering an opportunity for
them to learn a new game,'' he said.
	   ``The competition is the culmination of a series of three
bowling clinics held over two weeks and each team had to
participate in at least two clinics to qualify for this final
competition.
	   ``We offer first prize winners a ticket each to Australia and
the first runner-up a ticket each to Jakarta.''
	   The individual men's event was won by Simon Teh of Reliance

Bank boosts lending rate by 2 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Two South African commercial
banks said Wednesday that they were increasing their prime lending
rate by 2 percentage points.
	   ABSA Group Ltd., one of the country's four major commercial
lending groups, said its boost to 20.25 percent would occur
Thursday. NBS Boland also announced an increase to 20.25 percent.
Other banks are expected to follow suit, Dow Jones Newswires said.
	   The interest hike follows the Central Bank's decision last month
to increase interest rates to attract investors to its bond and
currency markets to ward off a speculative raid on the South
African currency.
	   Last week, Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, persuaded
banks to hold off on lifting rates. As a sign of good will, the
bank eased its repo rate _ the main lever for setting monetary
policy _ 0.5 percentage point to 17.50 percent and promised further
cuts.
	   But market turmoil in Asia and eastern Europe has been
accompanied by a further weakening of the rand, bond and equity
markets.
	   ``As ABSA cannot absorb this negative impact on lending margins
for an indefinite period, it had no option but to adjust its
lending rates accordingly,'' the statement said.
	   The move came a day after Finance Minister Trevor Manuel urged
banks to stave off interest hikes.
	   ``We hope banks will grit their teeth in the interests of the
economy for a few more days,'' Manuel was quoted as saying in
Wednesday's Business Day.
	   ABSA is one of South Africa's four major commercial banking
groups, formed through acquisition of three other banking concerns
in 1991.

	   The budget for 1998-99 to be presented in Parliament tomorrow
(Thursday) will introduce a new classification system of public
heads of expenditure to make the budget document clear and easy to
understand by ordinary people, an official source indicated,
yesterday.
	   The source said that the existing budget format developed in
1938 by colonial rulers was now inadequate to meet the requirements
of a modern state in which the role of the government had expanded
to new areas and more activities.
	   The source said that the need for a new comprehensive budget
format was felt by almost all the previous governments.
Accordingly, a working group was constituted in 1989 to suggest
``reforms in budgeting and expenditure control'' (RIBEC). It
carried its work over the past couple of years to develop the new
budget format.
	   Finance Minister SAMS Kibria in his budget speech last year
indicated that he would introduce a new classification system of
public expenditure in this year's budget.
	   An experts group tested the new format in the preparation of
last year's budget and the year before it. The Finance Minister
this year decided to present the budget taking up the new
classification form.
	   Asked what was the difference between the existing format and
the new format, an official source said that the allocations in the
existing system to ministries were made broadbased without
arranging information about financial aggregation at different
levels.
	   The new system would give budgetary information from many points
of view on a ministry, division or sector and on even very small
issues related to them.
	   For instance, the present format did not give information about
how much fuel cost or expenditure for buying stationery were
allocated to a ministry. Likewise, there was no room, said the
source, to find income receipts from the sale of confiscated goods
by police or old stores by customs.
	   The new format had a 13 digit numbers to present wide-ranging
information both on revenue and expenditure sides and capable of
responding to any budgetary queries within a ministry or at the
inter-ministerial level.
	   The database in the new format would be clearer and
comprehensive and offer more analytical capability by using graphs,
charts and other profiles.
	   The new format would reflect the administrative and legal
structure of the government in its framework and directly respond
to the requirements of the government's financial statistics as
mandated by the IMF.
	   It would further facilitate technical integration of the revenue
and development budget as both sides of the budget would be
accommodated within the classification structure.
	   In the new budget, numeric codes would be used as opposed to an
alphanumeric code now in practice. The budget documents and other
reports could be produced in two languages -- Bangla and English -
in the new format from the same source of data stored in the
computer.
	   It would be also applicable to all government's financial
transactions accounted for through the Consolidated Fund or Public
Account.
	   The sources said an on-line network had been established between
the Accounts Consolidation System located in the Office of the
Controller General of Accounts (CGA) and the Budget Database Office
at the Ministry of Finance.
	   It would give the Finance Ministry the ability to monitor
expenditure of the ministries and government's agencies.

EU Commission recommends lifting ban on most British beef exports

conditions for relaxing the ban, comments by EU farm commissioner.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission on Wednesday
recommended lifting the ban on British beef exports that was
imposed more than two years ago at the height of Europe's ``mad
cow'' scare.
	   The 20-member European Union executive body ruled that British
beef and most beef products from cattle older than six months and
younger than 30 months should be cleared for export. That would
cover most potential beef exports.
	   ``We do feel that British beef is safe,'' said EU Farm
Commissioner Franz Fischler. British Agriculture Minister Jack
Cunningham told the BBC the decision would be ``a very, very
important step.''
	   However, the EU's complex decision-making process means it could
still take months before British beef is back on foreign markets.
	   The decision needs approval by a panel of veterinary experts
from the 15 EU nations that meets Friday. If the specialists fail
to agree, EU agriculture ministers will vote on the issue, probably
in July.
	   Germany in particular is wary about letting British beef back
onto its markets, fearing that lingering mad cow fears among
consumers could again drive down the price of all beef.
	   Still, British farmers were elated.
	   ``It'll take the gloom out of the market,'' said David Williams,
who runs the Williams Wholesale slaughterhouse in Woebley, western
England. ``It'll be a great morale booster for the whole
industry.''
	   Announcing the decision, Fischler said strict conditions would
apply to the return of British beef.
	   He said beef on the bone will stay banned; cattle must be killed
in approved slaughterhouses and ``animal passports'' will be needed
to ensure cattle come from herds free of mad cow disease.
	   ``We will do our best to ensure the measures will mean no
further risks for consumers anywhere in Europe,'' Fischler said.
	   The EU slapped a global ban on British beef exports on March 27,
1996, after the British government acknowledged a possible link
between a brain-wasting cattle ailment known as bovine spongiform
encephalopathy _ commonly called mad cow disease _ and an equally
fatal human condition, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
	   Fears that eating mad-cow tainted beef could cause humans to
contract CJD provoked a crisis in the beef industry across Europe
and cattle prices plummeted.
	   Although some animals have come down with BSE in other European
nations, the overwhelming majority of mad cow cases have been in
Britain. The outbreak was blamed on the practice of feeding cattle
the ground remains of sheep and other animals.
	   The first relaxation of the ban came two weeks ago, when the EU
allowed exports of beef from Northern Ireland, where a special
computer tracking system allowed herds to be certified mad-cow
free.
	   Before the ban, Britain's beef exports were worth dlrs 8.1
billion a year.

	   The Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) trading maintained its downward
trend yesterday . The All Share Price Index retreated by 1.20 per
cent or by 8.1 points to close at 664.73 points from Monday's
672.83 points. The price index had a total loss of 113.73 points
during the last three days at a stretch. The number of gaining and
losing issues stood at 55 and 68 respectively, out of total of 126
issues that changed hands yesterday. Three issues remained
unchanged yesterday. If the trend of gradual increase in the number
of gaining issues remains unchanged, the next session may witness
rise both in the price index and the market capital .
	   However ,a DSE dealer said :Sunday's fall was not a traditional
one .According to him, ``we may not call it even a market
correction. The market correction in a stable market starts after a
big rise in the share value and it maintains gradual decline in the
share prices for couple of days unless any other factors take place
in the trading environment.''Responding to the day's trading, the
turnover of the day declined. A total of, 3,44,713 shares and
debentures valued at Taka 31.94 million were traded against
previous day's 4,07,730 worth Taka 37.80 million, marking a fall by
63017 shares and debentures in volume and Taka 5.86 billion in
value respectively on the day.

	   The world's airlines are spending $1.6 billion to avoid being
bitten by the millennium bug, according to the International Air
Transport Association (IATA) , reports Reuters.This does not
include billions more being spent by air traffic control systems,
airports, computer reservations systems and other third party
suppliers and vendors to make sure that global air travel is not
seriously impaired by Year 2000 computer problems.
	   Nor does it include $20 million IATA is spending to assist and
monitor Year 2000 upgrades by suppliers such as commercial airports
and air traffic control systems.By mid-1999, IATA says it will make
available its audit information on airport and air traffic services
readiness so that planners at the carriers can determine whether
there are airports they would like to avoid on January 1, 2000.The
US Federal Aviation Administration is spending $190 million to
update that country's air traffic control system, FAA administrator
Jane Garvey said.
	   She told IATA's 54 annual general meeting here this week that
the FAA was originally thought to have weighed in too late on
upgrading or replacing its systems so that they can function
normally after January 1,2000.In January, Garvey had the programme
accelerated. A Year 2000 project coordinator was appointed within
the agency.Major US airlines are spending over $100 million each to
upgrade their systems. American Airlines is budgeting $160 million
and Delta Airlines $125 million, an IATA official said.

Menem says Videla arrest case is strictly an Argentine affair
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IAN PHILLIPS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Argentine President Carlos Menem said Wednesday the
arrest of former dictator Jorge Videla did not mean other countries
would succeed with lawsuits against other ``dirty war'' officials.
	   Menem, referring to Tuesday's arrest in Buenos Aires of Videla,
said it was a matter strictly ``for the Argentine justice system.''
	   Videla, 71, was charged Tuesday with ordering the kidnapping of
children born to parents who were killed during the 1976-83 dirty
war, and for falsifying identity documents.
	   Menem, whose 1990 pardon freed Videla and other senior members
of the dictatorship from jail, said Videla would have to answer the
charges.
	   ``All those who commit this type of crime must answer for it
before the courts,'' said Menem, on a two-day visit to attend
Wednesday's World Cup opening game between Brazil and Scotland.
	   As chief of the military, then general Videla had final
authority over death squads that waged a war of torture and murder
against political opponents, mainly leftists.
	   A Spanish judge investigating the disappearance of more than 300
Spaniards during the repression has said he wants Videla to appear
in court, either in Spain or Argentina.
	   ``This has nothing to do with them,'' Menem said, referring to
the Spanish investigators after a meeting with French President
Jacques Chirac.
	   ``This is a matter for Argentine justice.''
	   He added that ``contrary to what some might say, this shows that
the Argentine legal system is one of the best in the world.''
	   Argentine human rights groups are urging the Argentine
investigating judge to check allegations that some children of
dissidents who were slain were handed over to members of the
military, who raised them.
	   Videla is accused of being involved in more than 30 such cases.
	   The Argentine government claims 9,000 people disappeared during
that time, but some human rights groups put the figure at 30,000.
	   Videla was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 for human rights
abuses during the dictatorship. He since has lived as a virtual
recluse in the Argentine capital.

	   A TWO-HOUR meeting last night between Financial Secretary Sir
Donald Tsang Yam-kuen and leaders of seven political parties
defused what was quickly building into a head-on collision between
the administration and the parties.
	   Those involved in the discussions were quick to point out
afterwards that the meeting had been ``positive'' and ``not
confrontational''.
	   Liberal Party leader Allen Lee Peng-fei, who chairs the
cross-party coalition addressing the economic decline and
unemployment problems, said earlier there would be no room for
compromise on the six measures to revive the economy.
	   The government would have to accept the lot.
	   He also implied that legislators from the parties might block
legislation and funding applications from the government, unless
the administration accepted the measures.
	   After the meeting Mr Lee said the attitude of Sir Donald and
other officials' towards their proposals had been ``positive'',
even though Sir Donald had not made any commitments on some
proposals involving public money.
	   These include cutting property rates, returning provisional
taxes, reducing fuel taxes and trimming rents for commercial units
belonging to the Housing Authority.
	   Mr Lee said Sir Donald promised to consider the suggestions.
	   He stressed the attitude of the government officials had
improved.
	   ``The most important thing is they are not saying no to all
ideas raised, like before . . . this meeting will be a beginning.''
The next meeting has been scheduled for next week.
	   Sir Donald said both sides had a ``very frank, candid, and open
exchange''.
	   He denied feeling threatened by the combined number of votes the
opposition would be able to muster in the new Legislative Council.
	   ``I don't feel any pressure at all . . . We are like a group of
friends studying the same problem. I don't feel my colleagues
having pressure, either.'' But he did express reservations about
returning provisional taxes because he would have to take into
account its negative effects.
	   There were two measures where consensus was reached _ speeding
up infrastructural works and opening social services posts in a bid
to increase jobs.

	   A MAINLAND dissident will file a case in Hong Kong against
sportswear giant adidas for allegedly using prisoners such as
himself to produce soccer balls and other items for World Cup '98.
Bao Ge, 34, head of the US-based Chinese Voice of Human Rights,
said similar court cases would also be filed in the US, France and
Germany within the next few weeks. Details of the legal battle will
be unveiled by Mr Bao at a press conference in Macau today in time
for the opening of the World Cup in France. The legal action in
Hong Kong may serve as a test case on whether the SAR Government is
adhering to the principles of the International Labour
Organisation's convention against forced labour. The SAR is
required to eliminate forced labour because the convention
continues to apply even after the handover. Beijing, on the other
hand, has not signed the convention. The convention also applies in
the three countries where the cases will be filed. Mr Bao yesterday
said adidas should be held responsible for the use of forced labour
in prison camps to manufacture its products. After his arrest in
1994 for counter-revolutionary offences, he was sent to a labour
camp in Shanghai for three years. ``I was forced to produce the
footballs, some of which were marked with the words `France 98 FIFA
World Cup'.'' Mr Bao said he had submitted a writ to a US court and
was waiting for a reply as to when the legal proceedings could
start. But he refused to reveal whether there would be any form of
protest when the World Cup matches start today. Director of the
Information Centre on Human Rights and Democratic Movement in
China, Frank Lu Siqing, said he was not sure whether Mr Bao would
be successful in his legal battle. ``We are more concerned about
people's awareness on the use of forced labour in the mainland for
the production of goods for big companies.'' He said prisoners on
the mainland were forced to work 16 hours a day without any
compensation. The office of adidas in Hong Kong could not be
contacted last night.

	   KHAGRACHARI, Bangladesh (AP) _ Thousands of protesters who
traveled from all over Bangladesh ended a two day anti-government
rally at a southern town Wednesday, voicing their opposition to a
peace accord with tribespeople in the southeast.
	   Opposition leader Khaleda Zia, who led one stream of protesters
400 kilometers (260 miles) by bus and car from the capital Dhaka,
addressed a cheering crowd of 35,000 at the stadium where just six
months ago, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina signed the accord.
	   ``Success of the long march had proved beyond doubts that the
people in general do not accept the peace accord,'' Zia said.
	   The protesters, who traveled mostly by bus despite calling their
campaign the ``long march,'' say the peace accord with rebels from
the Buddhist Chakma tribe gives the Chakmas too much local power at
the expense of Muslim settlers from the north.
	   Chakma rebels, who surrendered their arms in exchange for local
autonomy, fought the government for 20 years, leaving more than
20,000 people, mostly Muslims, dead.
	   Zia said peace was welcome, but the accord was flawed because it
``sowed the seeds of separatism in the country.''
	   Abdul Quddus Mian, a 47-year-old school teacher, said most
locals participating in the opposition-sponsored protests were
Muslim settlers who felt the peace accord denied them equal status
with the tribespeople. Chakmas, the majority in the region, are
expected to dominate local councils that will have extensive power.
	   The protest was seen as a test of strength for former Prime
Minister Zia, who since losing power two years ago, has called
almost daily strikes, which often erupt into violence. The long
march ended without much violence.
	   The march began Tuesday in Dhaka, where it was delayed nine
hours by a road block of abandoned trucks, many with deflated tires
or no tires at all, set up by supporters of the prime minister.
	   Zia has called for a nationwide strike June 18 to protest
attempts to stop the march. Hasina had said she would allow the
protest. It was unclear whether her supporters acted with her
consent when they set up the road block.
	   Pro- and anti-government protesters fought Tuesday in
Chittagong, the starting point for another stream of protesters,
leaving 60 injured and scores of trucks and shops damaged, police
said.
	   One of the buses carrying protesters to Khagrachari skidded off
the road and fell 300 feet (100 meters) into a ravine, killing
three people and injuring 27.

World Cup: Savicevic, key Yugoslav midfielder, injured
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT GALMIER, France (AP) _ Yugoslav team preparations for the
World Cup suffered a serious setback as their key midfielder Dejan
Savicevic failed another fitness test Wednesday, ruling him out of
the opening match against Iran.
	   The formidable technical skills of the 31-year-old AC Milan star
_ nicknamed ``The Genius'' by Yugoslav and Italian fans _ are
believed to be crucial in Yugoslavia's World Cup campaign.
	   He is also considered the spiritual leader of the squad which
plays in Group F along with Iran, Germany and the United States.
	   ``It is well known what Savicevic means to our team,'' said
Yugoslav captain Dragan Stojkovic. ``He will definitely not play
against Iran and we hope to have him back fully recovered for our
next game against Germany.''
	   Savicevic, who is currently negotiating a transfer from AC Milan
to Fiorentina in the Italian league, suffered a knee ligament
injury while playing a club match about a month ago.
	   He has been plagued by a string of injuries during the past
season in Italy and has rarely played league matches for AC Milan.
During his four-year stay in Italy, Savicevic often was the key
figure in AC Milan's success.
	   Aside from reserve goalkeeper Dragoje Lekovic and Stojkovic,
Savicevic is the only Yugoslav player with World Cup experience as
he led the team to the quarterfinals at the 1990 championships in
Italy.
	   On Tuesday when the Yugoslavs arrived in France, Savicevic only
did light warmup exercises on the edge of the pitch while the rest
of the squad practiced full force. On Wednesday, Savicevic failed
to show up at the rain-soaked training grounds in this picturesque
village just outside Saint Etienne.
	   ``I didn't want to expose him to any risks on the slippery
surface,'' said Yugoslav coach Slobodan Santrac. ``But I hope to
have him ready soon. We are not playing only one match at the World
Cup and there will be several chances for Savicevic to show his
skills.''
	   ``I don't feel fully fit and I'll have to be patient and work
real hard in training to get back to full fitness,'' a grim-faced
Savicevic said as he watched his teammates' training practice
Wednesday.
	   Dejan Stankovic, the 19-year-old rising star who this summer
signed a multi-million-dollar contract with Lazio Rome, is likely
to take Savicevic's place in the midfield against Iran on June 14.

	   Led by the President of the BCI, Sharif M Afzal Hossain the
delegation yesterday met Shahabuddin Ahmed at Bangabhaban here, and
exchanged views on various issues including industrialisation.
	   Hossain said, law and order situation is the precondition of
economic development. He emphasised the heed of infrastructure
development, increase of electricity and gas facilities, protection
of industry, stopping of illegal activities in the name of trade
union and removal of bureaucratic complications.
	   Full globalisation will start after 2005 and to face this

	   BCI president said, the image abroad of Bangladesh at present is
bright and is known as the proper place of investment. The foreign
investors are coming to Bangladesh and the financial structure of
the country is enriched by natural and mineral resources, and these
opportunities must be utilised, he added.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Suspected guerrillas triggered a land
mine that blew up a jeep, killing 10 policemen and two civilians in
southern India on Wednesday, United News of India news agency said.
	   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack in
Warangal district of Andhra Pradesh state, 1,375 kilometers (860
miles) south of New Delhi. Police blamed the banned Peoples' War
Group.
	   The PWG, which did not immediately respond to the allegation,
frequently targets police and government officials, claiming they
connive with rich land owners to oppress poor, low-caste farm
hands.
	   The Marxist group has been fighting since 1980. The violence has
left more than 4,000 people dead.

Police investigating theft of chemical explosives

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Police on Wednesday were investigating the
disappearance of nearly half a ton of chemicals they reportedly
fear could be used by terrorists to make bombs.
	   The disappearance, which could be the result of a bureaucratic
mistake, came shortly after security forces were put on a state of
alert because of a surge in urban terrorism.
	   More than 150 offices and cars have been firebombed since
January. Most attacks, none of which caused any injuries, were
claimed by shadowy, left-wing groups.
	   According to local media reports, 425 kilograms (935 pounds) of
an ammonia-based chemical went missing Tuesday from a mining
company in Larimna, 70 kilometers (43 miles) northwest of Athens.
	   It could be used used to produce a significant number of bombs,
local media quoted police as saying.
	   November 17, one of the world's deadliest militant groups, has
in the past used bombs to target American officials and companies.
They have killed 22 people since their 1975 assassination of the
CIA station chief in Athens.
	   In 1989, November 17 stole dozens of anti-tank rockets from a
military depot. The rockets have been used in several attacks,
including a failed attempt against the U.S. embassy in Athens.

Prosecutor: accused teen claiming Israeli citizenship `cynical
</HEADLINE>
exploitation' &QL; 
 &UR; By VITA BECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli prosecutor argued Wednesday that it
would be ``cynical exploitation'' of Israel's citizenship laws to
allow a U.S. teen-ager charged in a grisly murder in Maryland to
take refuge from American justice by claiming Israeli citizenship.
	   The prosecution wrapped up its case in favor of extraditing
17-year-old Samuel Sheinbein on Wednesday; the defense is scheduled
to present its final arguments in Jerusalem District Court on July
9. No date has been set for a decision.
	   Sheinbein is charged in Montgomery County, Maryland, with
killing 19-year-old Alfred Tello Jr. last September. He fled to
Israel after the murder and is claiming Israeli citizenship in an
attempt to prevent his extradition. Israeli law bars citizens from
being sent abroad to stand trial.
	   Israeli prosecutor Irit Kaan said Wednesday that allowing
Sheinbein to take refuge in Israel would be a ``cynical
exploitation'' of Israel's citizenship laws.
	   Sheinbein ``has no link to the state of Israel and is only using
the state as a means of escaping from the country in which he
committed the crime,'' she told the court.
	   Sheinbein's lawyers argue that his father, Sol, is an Israeli
citizen, and that the status was automatically passed on to him.
	   But Israel says that Sheinbein's father lost his citizenship
because he moved his family to the United States in 1950, before
the country's citizenship law went into effect several years later.
	   ``It's obvious that the Sheinbein family had transferred the
center of its life to the United States before the decisive date,''
Kaan said.
	   Sheinbein, who had never lived in Israel and never held an
Israeli passport, ``never saw himself as an Israeli citizen,'' she
said.
	   Sheinbein's lawyer, former justice minister David Libai, said
only, ``If the father is not an Israeli citizen, then the Interior
Ministry should take away his Israeli citizenship.''
	   Another teenager charged in the murder, 18-year-old Aaron
Needle, hanged himself in his Maryland cell in April.

Catholic bishops appeal to their governments for peace

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Roman Catholic bishops from Ethiopia and
Eritrea have appealed to their governments to end their armed
conflict before it turns into an all-out war.
	   They said war will set back economic development and
``destabilize the already delicate political balance in the Horn of
Africa region.''
	   The joint appeal was signed in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian
capital, Sunday, and released Wednesday by the Vatican.
	   The bishops said they feared the border conflict ``may lead to
an all-out war among brothers and sisters who share a common
history and tradition.''
	   They said they felt ``the urgent duty to make an appeal to our
governments'' before the conflict escalated.

	   A British transport expert has stressed the need for creating
public awareness of road safety to reduce road accidents in
Bangladesh.
	   Both the print and electronic media could make the people aware
of road safety, said Allan Quimby of Transport Research Laboratory
in the United Kingdom at a seminar in the city yesterday.
	   The seminar on ``Road Safety Publication'' was held at the
secretariat of National Road Safety Council of Bangladesh (NRSC).
Some 30 experts on road safety including Chairman of Bangladesh
Road Transport Authority AN Hussain and NRSC Secretariat
Coordinator Patrick Gleeson attended the seminar.
	   Quimby said that road accident is one of the biggest problems in
Bangladesh in the world the situation was deteriorating at a
frightening rate. Publicity in a systemic and scientific manner
could improve the situation, he added.
	   He suggested that documentaries be aired by television centres
and special articles be published in newspapers to create public
awareness of road safety.
	   About 3,000 people were killed in road accidents in the country
last year, according to the seminar sources. The seminer reveled
that the safety problem in Bangladesh is almost double compared to
that in Pakistan and India and 20 times worst than the USA and UK.

	   Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad yesterday urged World Food
Programme (WFP) to continue its assistance for the poor people,
particularly the distressed women.
	   ``The less privileged sections of society particularly the poor
and the distressed women usually receive maximum benefit from food
aid, and hence Azad it should be increased told the WFP country
representative.
	   Werner Kiene, the WFP Representative in Bangladesh, yesterday
called on the Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad at the latter's
office, an official handout said.
	   Kiene who gave a resume of WFP activities in Bangladesh, said
efforts are underway to raise the UN body's cooperation programme
in the country by extending further assistance to the poor and the
needy in Chittagong Hill Tracts.
	   The World Food Programme annually gives around three lakh tons
of food aid to Bangladesh which is valued at Taka 270 crore, the
handout added.
	   The food aid is used in rural development and improvement of the
condition of distressed women and spent through government and
NGOs.
	   Azad requested the country representative to further extend its
activities in aid of rural development and distressed women.

	   A RESCUE hero was missing feared drowned last night after
leaping into a flooded nullah to save two young brothers.
	   The search for father-of-two Lee Ying-kwong, 51, was abandoned
last night because of darkness and atrocious weather.
	   Mr Lee pulled one of the boys, Sze Kin-keung, 9, to safety from
the Quarry Bay torrent.
	   But he was swept away when he went back for the other, Sze
Kin-man, 12, who was later pulled unconscious from the water.
	   The tragedy came on a day of chaos in which torrential rain
brought floods and landslides across the urban areas and the New
Territories, closed courts and schools and swamped homes and
businesses.
	   The red and black rainstorm signals were hoisted for 16 hours _
the longest since the warnings were introduced after another tragic
downpour in 1992.
	   In many areas, the total rainfall exceeded 300mm for the 24
hours to midnight. It was heaviest in Mong Kok, Tai Po and Sai Kung
from 4am to 8am, with more than 500mm recorded in Sai Kung _ site
of numerous landslides and flash floods.
	   As shopowners and householders mopped up, firemen called off
their four-hour hunt for Quarry Bay victim Mr Lee, a recent
mainland migrant, about 8.30pm.
	   Mr Lee's wife, Yip Bo-heung, 44, wept as she came to terms with
the fact that he was dead.
	   ``They did not find my husband,'' she said. ``I am prepared that
he is killed. I have to face up to the reality.'' Sze Kin-man was
in critical condition in Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital
last night after being winched from the nullah not breathing and
with no pulse. His pulse returned in hospital.
	   Kin-Keung suffered only bruises and was in stable condition.
	   The drama began about 4.30pm when Kin-man, Kin-keung and a
friend defied the rain to hike up Kam Tuk Chi Ma Path on Mount
Parker.
	   Minutes later, Kin-keung tried to leap across the 1.5 metre-wide
nullah and plunged in. While his friend Ng Siu-pang, 12, dashed to
call police, Kin-man dived into the torrent after his brother.
	   Both were swept more than 12 metres before being caught in
grating at the mouth of a culvert.
	   Hearing their cries for help, Mr Lee climbed down handrails on
the wall of the nullah and carried Kin-keung to safety.
	   He went back for Kin-man, but the raging water tore his grip
from the grating and he was swept away, as shocked witnesses
watched.
	   ``I saw a man climb down into the nullah,'' one said. ``Soon he
picked up a boy but then he went down again.'' Firemen, summoned by
the friend, arrived to find Kin-man pinned to the grating by the
flood and no sign of Mr Lee.
	   After initial attempts were foiled by the current, they cut
through a safety fence on the bank and two divers abseiled down the
nullah wall to reach the unconscious boy.
	   While the boys were taken to hospital, the search for Mr Lee
began.
	   Rescuers searched the nullah and its outlets in Quarry Bay
Street, Finnie Street and at the waterfront at Hoi Yu Street.
	   Mr Lee, a plumber, was working on a freelance project in Mount
Parker Lodge. He lived with his wife and 11-month-old baby in Lek
Yuen Estate in Sha Tin. Anolder child is in Xinhui.
	   The Sze brothers are also mainland migrants, living in Sunway
Gardens.
	   Plumber repaid debt with his lifeTHE grief-stricken wife of
plumber Lee Ying-kwong, feared drown while trying to rescue two
boys from a Quarry Bay nullah, said she was not surprised by her
husband's heroism.
	   A tearful Yip Bo-heung, 44, said that two years ago, her husband
almost drowned but was saved by a man.
	   ``That left a very deep impression on him. Perhaps because of
this, he wanted to repay (the act) by saving the two boys,'' she
said.
	   Mr Lee had loved swimming since he was a teenager, she said.
	   The couple were married in Xinhui, Guangdong, in 1979.
	   Their eldest son Kwok-hung, now 18, was born there.
	   Mr Lee came to Hong Kong after the birth of Kwok-hung.
	   Three years ago, Ms Yip was permitted to join him.
	   The plumber had always worked hard for the family, making about
$10,000 a month as a part-timer, she said.
	   The couple have a second son, Kwok-fai, now 11 months.
	   The family lives in a public-housing flat in Lek Yuen Estate in
Sha Tin.
	   ``He loves his sons. He loves helping people. This is him,'' Ms
Yip said.
	   She said she wanted the Immigration Department to exercise its
discretion to allow Kwok-hung to see his father's face for the last
time.
	   ``That will be the last time he could see his father's face. I
plead with the government to fulfil this wish,'' Ms Yip said.

	   Members of the armed forces have been deployed at important
power installations and grid sub-stations of the country to avert
any untoward incidents that might occur during the month-long World
Cup football tournament that starts in Paris from today.
	   Two Russian engineers who arrived in capital last Sunday
completed repairs of the Unit 3 of the Ghorashal Power Plant
yesterday, a Power Development Board (PDB) official told The
Independent.
	   On completion of the repairing, the PDB has decided to make the
unit generate 210 mw electricity from today to meet the power
shortage in the country.
	   Petrobangla authorities have assured the PDB officials of
supplying gas as per their requirement to generate electricity.
	   The ministry concerned, the Dhaka Electricity Supply Authority
(DESA) and the PDB in the meantime, have also taken a good number
of steps including forming of 16 high-powered task forces to ensure
a loadshedding free, undisrupted power supply in Dhaka and the rest
of the country during the World Cup football.
	   The steps taken by the agencies concerned on the eve of world
football were decreasing systems loss, snapping of illegal
connections, and closing of all shops and markets in the evenings.
The power supply people felt that 200 megawatts of electricity
could be saved through such steps throughout the country.
	   The task forces to be supervised by Executive Engineers and
Superintendent Engineers and special squads formed in this
connection would help maintain and look after electric lines during
the World Cup so that they could meet the emergency needs.
	   The officials of DESA and PDB apprehend that some sort of
sabotage or other destructive activities might take place at
different installations or power grid sub-stations following
possible loadshedding or shortage of supply of power.
	   Considering the security of these important installations and
sub-grid stations, the DESA and PDB authorities have taken some
precautionary measures. They, in the meantime, have deployed law
enforcing people and their own securitymen at these installations.
In some places, members of the armed forces were deployed, PDB
sources said adding that the number of the armed forces personnel
and Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) would be increased to guard the power
sub-stations especially during the world cup football.
	   In the meantime, news of disruption of power supply as well as
loadshedding at different places including the capital city and
district headquarters continued to be reported.
	   The people of the affected areas gheraoed the power supply
offices at different places of the country demanding normal supply
of power immediately.
	   The power disruption and loadshedding agitated the people in
Netrakona, Gopalganj, Manikganj, Pabna, Brahmanbaria, Sherpur,
Sylhet, Hobiganj, Chittagong, Khulna, Jessore for which they
brought out processions.
	   The frequent power failure in 10 thanas in Netrokona forced the
people to gherao the PDB office to demand smooth supply of power
during the world cup football.
	   Superintendent Engineer and Executive Engineer of Mymensingh
power supply office yesterday visited Netrokona and met the Deputy
Commissioner (DC) and Superintendent of Police (SP) and requested
that the security of PDB officials he ensured, our Netrokona
correspondent said.
	   Our correspondents from different district headquarters and
thanas said that the PDB officials were passing their days in great
anxiety following the frequent disruption of power and
loadshedding. In many cases, they demanded security fearing
possible attacks by angry people, especially during the World Cup
football.
	   Our Barisal Correspondent adds: angry power consumers attacked
the power sub- station at Rupali, Banaripara, Daulat Khan,
Borhanuddin, Swarupkhati, Betagi and Bakergani police stations
following disruption of power and load shedding Monday night.
	   At least 15 persons were injured when the angry people attacked
the Thana Nirbahi Officer's (TNO) residence at Betagi after the
power disruption. Police arrested 8 persons in connection with the
attack on the TNO's residence. The correspondent also added that
power supplies Patharghata and Borgona have remained suspended for
the past 13 and 2 days respectively. Due to shortage of power, the
Barisal Pourasava authorities only supplied 10 lakh gallons of
water against the 90 lakh gallons required by the people.
	   Our Thakurgaon Correspondent said that the office of the
Resident Engineer at Thakurgaon was attacked by angry youths of the
locality following a power disruption for about 16 hours. The
youths from Hajipara brought out a procession and ransacked the PDB
office at 10 yesterday night.
	   The PDB officials filed a case against the youths following the
incident.
	   A total of 1000 rice mills were closed down following the
loadshedding and power failure for which the price of rice went up
causing suffering to the people.
	   UNB from Mymensingh adds: Power supply in five districts under
greater Mymensingh remained cut off for about four hours due to
technical fault in the 33-KV sub-station line near Bhairab on
Tuesday.
	   According to officials, power supply to Jamalpur, Sherpur
Netrokona, Kishoreganj and Mymensingh districts was suspended from
the Ashuganj Power Plant after the fault was detected in the line.
	   They said the power supply to the region was restored at about 6
pm yesterday.
	   Our Rajshahi Correspondent says: Local people of Gomastapur
thana on Monday night attacked the local power supply centre
demanding smooth supply of electricity. The mob also damaged the
furniture at the centre to protect the disruption.
	   APB from Jamalpur adds: In rowdy protests against continuous
loadshedding for long hours, subscribers stormed and ransacked the
Power Development Board offices in three thanas of the district
yesterday.
	   The angry protesters also blocked rail and road traffic,
officials said.
	   They put barricades at the Nandina Bazar Railway Station and on
Jamalpur-Mymensingh highway in the morning in protest against
power-supply disruption in these hot summer days.
	   PDB Resident Engineer Mojammel Haque said that supply of power
in greater Jamalpur district had drooped to 4-5 megawatt over the
past three days as against daily requirement of, 22 MW.
	   The angry people launched separate attacks on PDB offices in
Sadar, Sarishabari and Melandah thanas as power supply shrank to 3
MW on Tuesday, he said.
	   Some of the places faced outages for 10-12 hours on Tuesday due
to the abnormal shortages.
	   In sadar thana, some trains, including Jamalpur-bound Padma and
Dinajpur-bound Teesta, were halted for four hours at Nandina Bazar
station with a rail-blockade enforced at about 10 am.
	   About a hundred vehicles remained stranded on the
Dhaka-Mymensingh highway for three hours due to the barricade.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Governments should enter the 21st
century understanding that peace means more than countries arming
themselves so heavily that no one will attack them, a respected
research institute said Wednesday.
	   The looming conflict between India and Pakistan is a case in
point. Both have nuclear weapons. Both see possession as a
convincing military deterrent to the other. Nevertheless, both seem
potentially on a path to a showdown.
	   ``War is quite possible,'' said Eric Arnett, a co-author of the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute's yearbook. ``It's
also quite possible that nuclear weapons might be used.''
	   Arnett, author of the report's section on military research and
development, said India appeared to have 20-30 nuclear warheads,
compared to 10-20 for Pakistan.
	   SIPRI's annual report is regarded as a definitive assessment of
global security issues.
	   The 29th edition covers 1997, before the balance of power issue
took a worrisome turn with longtime foes India and Pakistan each
demonstrating its nuclear weapons capacity with a series of test
blasts last month.
	   Their armed conflict was one of 25 worldwide last year -- down
from 27 in 1996 and 36 in 1989 -- in which at least 1,000 people
were killed.
	   SIPRI noted that most conflicts since the end of the Cold War
occur within a country rather than between nations; and happen more
often in ``failed'' authoritarian states rather than in democratic,
prosperous ones.
	   ``The security agenda ahead must be founded on a new political
philosophy, encompassing a common, institutionalized system of
standards and shared values rather than concepts based on the
balance of power,'' the report stated.
	   The institute called for the ``complete elimination of nuclear
weapons,'' though the report, and comments from its authors at a
news conference, indicated that's not likely to take place any time
soon.
	   Developments in 1997 were not all discouraging. Favorable events
included the movements toward peace in Northern Ireland and the two
Koreas. Also, the signing of an international treaty on banning
anti-personnel mines, and the ratification by Russia, China and the
United States of the Chemical Weapons Convention.
	   Nevertheless, peace prospects for the Middle East remain
distant, for which Peter Jones, co-author of that section of the
report, blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benhamin Netanyahu.
	   ``Although there is ample blame for all the parties involved,
the conclusion cannot be escaped that Netanyahu's commitment to the
peace process has never been more than equivocal,'' he stated.
	   Additionally, the START II treaty to reduce nuclear arsenals
remained ``in limbo'' in 1997, ``despite agreement between
Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin on a series of measures to boost its
chances of being ratified by the Russian Parliament,'' the report
noted.
	   Among the report's other highlights:
	   _ Annual world military expenditure declined by about one-third
from 1988 to 1997, when spending was estimated to be about 740
billion dollars.
	   _ Russia's military expenditure in 1997 was less than 10 percent
of what the Soviet Union spent a decade earlier.
	   _ Peace accords last year in Liberia, Tajikistan and Bangladesh
can be considered ``major successes in armed conflict resolution.''

	   THE downpour yesterday broke records as it wrought havoc and
brought Hong Kong to a standstill.
	   It brought the first black rainstorm warning of the year, a new
record for the daily rainfall in June, and the longest hoisting on
record of the red and black warnings.
	   During the more than 16 hours from the hoisting of the red
signal at 4.40 am until it was lowered at 9 pm _ the longest since
the system was introduced in 1992 _ schools and courts were closed,
businesses were swamped, hillsides collapsed and roads were
inundated.
	   The downpour, brought by a trough of low pressure along the
South China coast, is expected to continue for the next three days.
	   The red rainstorm warning was upgraded to black at 6.35 am.
	   It was downgraded to red at 9.50 am.
	   As of 11 o'clock last night, 410.4 millimetres of rain has been
recorded, setting a new daily rainfall record for the month since
12 June 1966.
	   ``It's (also) the longest rainstorm warning episode since the
rainstorm warning was introduced in 1992,'' Lai Sau-tak of the Hong
Kong Observatory said.
	   The thunderstorm warning was in force since late Monday night
until 10.40 pm yesterday while the landslip warning, raised at 4.52
am, was still in force early today.
	   The worst-hit area was northern New Territories where flood
water was as deep as 1.5 metres in some locations.
	   Twenty people were injured, including 14 seamen involved in a
collision of two cargo ships off Victoria Harbour, two being hit by
falling objects on Hong Kong Island and four others suffering from
flood-related injuries.
	   A family of four in Siu Lam village was rescued from their home
by Fire Services officers in dinghies when flash floods swamped the
village at 4 am.
	   Two other families, including four adults and one child, were
stranded in Tin Ping Shan village, Sheung Shui about 10 am, and
were also rescued by firefighters in dinghies.
	   Scores of vehicles broke down and had to be towed or pushed away
on flooded roads. At least 20 bus routes were diverted.
	   A total of 74 reports of flooding and 42 cases of landslip were
made.
	   At Kai Tak, 10 flights were delayed. Judges and lawyers today
face a hectic day catching up on a backlog of cases following
yesterday's blanket court closure.
	   The Education Department cancelled classes.
	   The Stock Exchange and the Futures Exchange closed their morning
sessions.
	   A Sheung Shui housewife said she and her husband had been
putting off having a second child because of the flooding.
	   Stalled vehicles add to chaos on the streets FLOODS caused
traffic chaos throughout Hong Kong despite fewer vehicles on the
roads yesterday.
	   Vehicles on the Tuen Mun Highway were stationary for almost the
whole morning because of flooding in Tsuen Wan.
	   In Sai Kung, mud was flushed onto Hiram's Highway, which links
Sai Kung and Kowloon, and vehicles had to slow down.
	   Nathan Road, usually jammed at peak hours, was a scene of
confusion, with broken-down cars and taxis in the rising
floodwaters.
	   Police were kept busy helping move these vehicles to the
roadsides.
	   Double-deckers were still able to negotiate the waters but
getting on or off the buses posed a problem for passengers.
	   Since the buses could not get close to the stops, passengers had
to wade into the flooded road.
	   A Kowloon Motor Bus spokeswoman said buses were running 20 to 40
minutes behind schedule.
	   Services were back to normal in the afternoon when the waters in
Mong Kok subsided.
	   On the island, Peak Tram services were suspended from about 1pm.
	   A spokeswoman said it was not known when services would resume
as the rain had affected work being carried out by the Civil
Engineering Department.
	   MTR and KCR services were not affected. But crowds did not
appear until about 10 am when the observatory lowered the black
rainstorm warning to the red one.

	   The government might set up 10 to 50 MW-capacity skid-mounted
and trolley-mounted plants for quick generation of electricity to
combat the worsening power situation, sources said.
	   ``The government may use the Army's purchase system to procure
the plants within the shortest possible time.''
	   An official of the Power cell said on condition of anonymity
that the country was passing through a crucial phase due to the
electricity crisis and that some quarters were trying to achieve
their selfish ends by exploiting the situation. He said that the
government was trying to solve the crisis as early as possible but
that the situation was too difficult to overcome. He, however, said
that there were yet possibilities of a good result.
	   According to the Power Development Board (PDB), the government
has decided to increase power generation by up to 722 MW by
September 1998.
	   Prof Rafiqul Islam, State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral
Resources told The Independent that by August 31 some 522 MW of
electricity would be generated from different power stations in the
country through utilising their utmost generation capacity and that
two barge-mounted plants would add 200 MW in September contributing
to the total increase of 722 MW.
	   ``We have taken it as a challenge, and we will succeed in
mitigating the sufferings of the people,'' the minister said
expressing his optimism. He added that the Prime Minister herself
had taken charge and was trying her best to tackle the situation.
	   ``We have a long tradition of pursuing a pro-people politics
initiated by the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur
Rahman and we have made a commitment to the people that we will put
in our best efforts in this regard,'' the minister said.
	   It was shown earlier that the average demand of electricity was
2290 MW and the estimated production 1700 MW. But official sources
said that the demand usually increased 10 per cent in each
successive year. And with the increase of 10 per cent the actual
demand stood at approximately 2500 MW. The government therefore has
to think of generating 2500 MW, the minister said.
	   With a view to meeting the growing demand, the government is
quickening negotiations for the 360 MW Haripur power project and
450 MW Meghnaghat Power project.
	   Negotiations were going on with the AES Corporation of the USA
while the Energy Ministry approved the Meghnaghat project last
week. Within a couple of weeks the signing of the deal would be
held between the PDB and AES, ministry sources said.
	   It is learnt from a reliable source that the site preparation of
the Meghnaghat plant has become difficult for unknown reasons. The
PDB source said that a sort of confusion was created in the process
of negotiating the international tender for the site preparation of
the Meghnaghat plant and that the PM's office had ordered an
investigation in this regard. The source said that if it was not
resolved in due time the main project would be hindered and the AES
would demand compensation as per the terms and conditions.

Silver lining to Pakistan's economic woes: Finance Secretary
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with annual economic survey. EDITS to conform. No
pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Although the stock market is down,
the latest credit rating is poor and foreign currency accounts have
been frozen to prevent a panic exodus of U.S. dollars, there may be
a silver lining, Finance Secretary Moeen Afzal said Wednesday.
	   Pakistan may use this economic emergency to make some
fundamental changes to its economic policies, Afzal said.
	   Also Wednesday, Pakistan released its annual economic survey
which showed a healthy growth in the agricultural sector, a modest
increase in the manufacturing sector and annual per capita income
rose five dollars to dlrs 457 in 1997-98.
	   The figures, however, were compiled before foreign currency
accounts were frozen last month after Pakistan tested six nuclear
devices. The explosions were in response to its traditionally
hostile neighbor India, which conducted five nuclear tests.
	   Pakistan expected to be hit with severe economic sanctions as a
result of the testing, which it feared would spark a run on foreign
currency. Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves were at dlrs 1.3
billion, barely enough to pay six weeks of imports.
	   Afzal said changes may include taxing foreign currency accounts,
thus denying rich Pakistanis a tax shelter. Currently, the wealthy
in Pakistan can keep millions of dollars in foreign currency
accounts without having to pay taxes or explain the origins of the
money.
	   Monetary liberalization in Pakistan is barely seven years old.
When Pakistan encouraged foreign exchange accounts, Afzal said it
opened the door wide, promising not to ask the origins of the
money. Critics said that allowed people with black market or drug
money to legally launder it.
	   Afzal said the government wants to correct this, tighten up
regulations and have people pay taxes.
	   The government also wants to push forward with banking reforms
aimed at putting an end to loans with little or no collateral. It
also wants to collect millions of dollars in unpaid loans and widen
its tax net.
	   Barely 1 million people pay taxes in Pakistan and most of them
are small businessmen and professionals. Some of the elite,
including politicians, barely pay dlrs 100 in income tax.
	   It is expected that Pakistan's budget, which is being released
Friday, will be loaded with new tax measures.
	   According to the economic survey, the government hoped to raise
dlrs 7 billion in taxes in 1997-98, but that estimate was later
revised to dlrs 6.4 billion. Even then, the government only raised
dlrs 4.8 billion, 75.6 percent of the target.
	   The deficit is expected to be down to 5.4 percent, slightly over
the target of 5 percent. Inflation should drop to 8.5 percent down
from 10 percent.
	   Since India detonated its first series of nuclear devices on May
11, the Karachi Stock Exchange began a free fall, which has brought
it to a record low of 998 points. Standard and Poor's downgraded
Pakistan on June 1 to a single-B-minus from a single B-Plus and put
Pakistan on a creditwatch.

	   Classes of BUET will resume June 14, after an unscheduled
closure of more than two months caused by wrangling between
government and teachers.
	   A meeting of the Dean Committee yesterday decided to resume the
classes after the ``deadlock'' ended on Monday.
	   It also announced a revised academic programme of the university
and instructed all students to attend the classes timely, said a
BUET press release.
	   The impasse ended on Monday as the BUET Teachers' Association
suspended its strike following an appeal of Vice Chancellor Iqbal
Mahmud.
	   The trouble started on April 4 following a mass resignation 71
teachers of the university from their administrative posts,
including the VC, to protest what they called government's undue
interference in the university's internal affairs.

	   A SOGGY sense of deja vu hung over Nathan Road yesterday.
	   As shopkeepers along the flood-prone Prince Edward section
mopped up yet again, they did so knowing they would have to do it
again . . . and again . . . until a big drainage project is
completed in about four years.
	   ``I expected this scenario last night,'' said Liu Kam-chiu,
whose cafeteria was flooded knee-deep.
	   ``We moved everything to the table tops so as to minimise the
loss.'' Despite the precautions, he estimated his loss at $10,000
to $20,000.
	   ``Every time after the flood, I have to call an electrician to
check all the switches and the stove,'' he said.
	   Mr Liu said yesterday's flood was not the worst he had seen.
	   ``The Drainage Services and the Urban Services Departments came
quickly and the water was gone within an hour.'' At a bakery near
Mr Liu's shop, the staff had erected an iron plate about 1.5 metres
high in the front door the night before, which kept the worst of
the water out.
	   Nonetheless, it took an hour to clean up after the flood, and
business was about $10,000 less than usual.
	   While the clean-up went on, customers stood outside to give
their orders, which staff handed out to them.
	   In a nearby boutique, two saleswomen spent most of the morning
cleaning up.
	   One said they had learnt from past experience and had covered
everything with plastic bags before sealing the door.
	   Workers from the Drainage Services Department and Urban Services
Department were sent to flooding blackspots in Kowloon West.
	   A Works Bureau spokeswoman said improvements to the drainage
system in Kowloon West would be completed in 2002, when the problem
should be solved.

Iraq, U.N. gearing for row on weapons again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The tug-of-war between Iraq and the United
Nations over disarmament may trigger a fresh crisis in the Gulf if
Baghdad continues to insist it has no more information on illegal
weapons.
	   Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler arrives in Baghdad
Thursday, armed with satellite images, charts and material evidence
to back his position that Iraq is still hiding weapons in secret
depots.
	   Butler will carry a three-page list of what he says are Iraq's
unfulfilled obligations to complete the elimination of its illegal
weapons.
	   Until Butler certifies that Iraq has dismantled all its weapons
of mass destruction, Iraq won't be free of the U.N. economic
sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   A glance at Butler's register shows that Iraq still has a long
way to go before obtaining a clean bill of health. For instance,
the list asks Iraq to provide ``full disclosure'' of its
destruction of missile propellants and to account for its
mustard-gas artillery shells and bombs used for chemical and
biological weapons.
	   In his meetings with Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, Butler is
likely to try to prove that Iraq has not yet come clean in the
areas of long-range missiles, chemical weapons and biological
weapons.
	   The mass of evidence that Butler presented earlier this month at
the United Nations swung a number of skeptical Security Council
members to his side. But the Iraqi team, led by Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, remained adamant that Iraq has done all
it could to dismantle its weapons.
	   Sticking to that position could lead to another standoff. The
alternative would be to accept Butler's demands, which would show
that Iraq had lied when it said it had nothing more to declare.
	   Butler's latest mission to Baghdad is similar to the trip he
made early this year when he failed to persuade the Iraqis to open
presidential sites for inspection.
	   That row led to the United States and Britain amassing forces in
the Gulf for a possible strike against Iraq. War was averted by the
last-minute intervention of U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan who
persuaded Iraqi leaders to open the palaces.

Iran to cut oil production by 100,000 barrels per day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with output cut announcement, quote. CHANGES overline.
No pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran announced Wednesday that it will cut
its oil output by 100,000 barrels per day, joining other countries
in an effort to boost global prices.
	   The announcement, which takes effect July 1, was made by the Oil
Ministry following a meeting between visiting Saudi Oil Minister
Ali al-Naimi and his Iranian counterpart, Bijan Namdar Zangeneh.
	   ``Iran undertakes to trim output by 100,000 barrels per day as
of July 1, in addition to the 140,000 barrels per day cut
previously agreed upon,'' the official Islamic Republic News Agency
quoted an oil ministry statement as saying.
	   Saudi Arabia has been lobbying several countries to cut oil
production in an attempt to increase sagging prices that have
hovered around dlrs 14 a barrel, some 20 percent lower than last
year despite cuts in daily global production by 1.5 million barrels
a day.
	   Al-Naimi, who arrived Tuesday in Tehran, briefed Zangeneh on the
recent accord between Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico to cut
back 450,000 barrels a day from the market, Iran's state-run Tehran
radio reported.
	   Iran's new cut will be in addition to the 140,000 barrels a day
production cut it pledged to make in March. Iran said that
reduction should be made in its daily quota of 3.94 million barrels
rather than its actual production level, which fluctuates but is
considerably lower than the quota.
	   Iran, the second-largest exporter in the 11-nation Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, had reportedly been exceeding the
pledged cuts.
	   Al-Naimi earlier visited Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and Qatar
and non-OPEC producer, Oman.
	   He secured a pledge from Qatar to cut 20,000 barrels per day
starting July 1.

	   VILLAGE residents hit by flood waters yesterday expressed hope
that the Home Affairs Department's pledge to move them into public
housing will come soon.
	   ``The government should give us special consideration because of
our situation,'' said Mrs Ng, 40.
	   Mrs Ng, her husband and their two children, Pak-chiu, 9, and
Hiu-ki, 16, have lived in a tin hut in Kwan Tei, Sheung Shui for
more than 10 years. The hut stands in one of the areas worst hit by
the rain.
	   Yesterday was the second time in three weeks that the family had
been forced to spend the night at a temporary shelter in Sheung
Shui, after their hut was flooded again.
	   Mrs Ng said the family had not been able to clean up the mess
caused by the flood on 24 May, the day of the elections.
	   ``But now that my home has been hit again, I will have to buy
many new electrical appliances to replace what was in the hut,''
she said.
	   Mrs Ng said all she and other residents of Kwan Tei, affected by
heavy rain, wanted was to be allowed to live in public housing.
	   ``Mrs Shelley Lau Lee Lai-kuen (Director of the Home Affairs
Department) visited us earlier today and she told me that she would
offer us public housing soon. I do hope it is for real.
	   ``Of course we want to move out but the rents outside are too
expensive,'' Mrs Ng said.
	   Her husband is a vegetable hawker and the rent that the family
pays now is just $1,000.
	   She said she stays awake whenever it rains hard so she can can
sound the alarm if necessary.
	   But not so for young Pak-chiu, he thinks being flooded out makes
for a great adventure. ``I think it's lots of fun and I can tell
you that I have practiced the evacuation more than a million
times.''

Thousands protest Serb attacks, ethnic leader to Europe

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Decrying the latest Serb aggression,
thousands of ethnic Albanians took to the streets of Pristina in
protest Wednesday, while their leader headed to Europe's capitals
to seek assistance for his people.
	   Some 20,000 Kosovo Albanians marched through the main street of
the provincial capital bearing banners that read: ``NATO, Kosovo is
burning'' and ``NATO, tomorrow will be too late,'' and carrying
Albanian and U.S. flags.
	   The protesters fervently chanted ``U-C-K,'' the Albanian
language acronym for the Kosovo Liberation Army _ a militant
organization fighting to wrest the southern province away from
Serbia _ and sang a popular Albanian song, praising their ethnic
leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Groups of protesters leaving the rally _ the 60th consecutive
demonstration _ got into a stone-throwing scuffle near the
university with Serbs. Several cars were stoned and a university
bookstore window shattered. Police intervened and dispersed the
protesters.
	   No further violence was reported early Wednesday elsewhere in
the province, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
Kosovo's restive Albanian majority seeks independence from Serbia,
which stripped its autonomy in 1989 and has since ruled the
province with a heavy military and police presence.
	   Some 30,000 ethnic Albanians also gathered downtown in the
Macedonian capital Skopje, to demand NATO presence in Kosovo.
	   More than 250 people have died in escalating clashes in Kosovo
between Yugoslav troops and ethnic Albanian militants that began in
early March.
	   In last week's fighting alone, more than 50 people were killed
and 200 were missing and presumed captured in western parts of
Kosovo, according to ethnic Albanian sources.
	   Chased by the fighting, some 20,000 Kosovo Albanian refuges
flowed into neighboring northern Albania last week.
	   An additional 10,000 fled to the neighboring republic of
Montenegro, which together with Serbia makes up Yugoslavia. The
Montena-fax independent news agency in Montenegro reported a
``river of refugees'' was crossing dense, mountainous territory on

	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Tanzania threatened Wednesday to
deploy more troops to the Biharamulo region on its western border
with Burundi, where Tanzanian citizens are fleeing alleged attacks
by Burundian refugees.
	   ``We shall dispatch the paramilitary force to conduct special
operations'' there, the independent daily Guardian quoted Home
Affairs Minister Ali Ameir Mohammed as saying.
	   Nearly 500 Tanzanians are reported to have fled from Burundian
Hutu refugees living in camps in Biharamulo district and the Kagera
region.
	   Mohamed said he had already directed the police in Kagera region
to arrest all armed Burundian refugees pending the arrival of the
paramilitary force.
	   There are 109,000 Burundian refugees in camps in western
Tanzania. The U.N. refugee agency has pledged to assist Tanzania to
improve security within and outside the camps.
	   Tanzania has long denied claims by Burundi's Tutsi-led
government that Hutu rebels live in the refugee camps and attack
Burundi across the border.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ After finding two men not guilty
of murder, a court on Wednesday sentenced them to jail for robbing
British immigrant Stuart Gaskell, who was killed during a robbery
in February.
	   Morne Bosch received a 10-year sentence while Winston Blaauw
received a six-year term.
	   Both men were on Tuesday found not guilty of the murder charges.
	   A third suspect, Quintin Marinus, was cleared of all charges.
	   Charges against a fourth suspect, Hilton Scott, were dropped
last month because he was shot in the head and suffered severe
memory loss.
	   Cape High Court Judge Pat Tebbutt said there was grave suspicion
about Bosch's guilt on the murder charge, but suspicion was
insufficient to convict him of murder.
	   ------
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Former President Canaan Banana lured a
young unemployed man to have homosexual intercourse with him on the
promise of finding him a job, the High Court heard.
	   Ernest Ngwenya, a state witness, alleged on Tuesday that Banana
gave him money and arranged later meetings for sex at a hotel in
the second city of Bulawayo and his Harare home.
	   Banana, 62, an ordained Methodist minister who served as
figurehead president after independence in 1980 until 1987, faces
11 charges of sodomy and homosexual assault.
	   He has pleaded innocent to charges that carry a penalty of a
fine or imprisonment.
	   Eleven people allege Banana made unwanted sexual advances toward
them, some saying he abused his power in office to coerce them and
force them to remain silent.
	   Homosexual acts are illegal in Zimbabwe, where President Robert
Mugabe has waged an outspoken campaign against gay rights,
describing same-sex partners as ``lower than dogs and pigs.''
	   Ngwenya, 24, told Judge Godfrey Chidyausikyu he met Banana in
the street in Bulawayo in 1995. The ex-president allegedly invited
him to a hotel and later fondled him until he was sexually aroused
and was made to perform anal sex on Banana.
	   Allegations of Banana's predatory homosexuality emerged last
year during the trial of a police aide who was sentenced to 10
years in jail for the murder of a police colleague who taunted him
as ``Banana's wife.''
	   -----
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ Workmen are dismantling an electric
fence on the border with Botswana to stop the death of wild animals
that got entangled in it.
	   Botswana's Director of Animal Health and Production, M.V.
Raborokgwe, was quoted Wednesday in the Namibian newspaper as
saying his government had ordered the dismantling of one of the
fences in Ngamiland to open up the seasonal wildlife migration
route.
	   Only a 30 kilometer section of the fence on the Northern
Buffalo-Kwando River would be taken down, he said. Work started two
weeks ago.
	   The fence stretches from Caprivi's Mahango Game Reserve to the
Kwando River.
	   Namibia pushed for the dismantling of the fence. A Namibia
Ministry of Environment and Tourism official, Maria Kapere, said on
Tuesday that the two countries agreed that only wild animals and
not cattle be allowed to move freely.
	   Botswana erected effective cattle control areas throughout its
countryside over the past several years to combat hoof and mouth
disease that can also move through wild game herds.
	   ----
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Government negotiators and a
teachers union settled differences over staff layoffs in a
last-minute effort to avert a nationwide strike called for next
week.
	   Sporadic actions, including a stay-away, continued around the
country on Wednesday because union officials were not able to reach
their membership after the agreement was made near midnight
Tuesday.
	   The South African Democratic Teachers' Union hailed the
agreement as a victory, saying all their demands had been met.
	   Education Minister Sibusiso Bengu agreed to a moratorium on
layoffs of temporary teachers and other demands, including
participation of teacher representatives in the budget process.
	   Two smaller teachers' unions were still negotiating with the
government.
	   The government withdrew proposed regulations that the unions
said would have resulted in at least 50,000 teachers losing their
jobs and an increase in student-teacher ratios.

	   A Dhaka-based human rights organisation has proposed that Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina be nominated for the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize,
for her ``unique contribution to the cause of peace.''
	   Sheikh Hasina's name was proposed for the prize in view of her
historic peace initiatives in the Chittagong Hill Tracts that ended
two decades of a bloody ethnic strife there.
	   South Asia Democracy Forum (SADF), having its branches in all
the remaining six SAARC countries, made the proposal on the basis
of a consensus by a jury of eminent personalities from all seven
member-states of the regional forum.
	   The recommendation was conveyed to the Nobel Foundation in Oslo
for consideration, said a press release.
	   ``Hasina's contribution to the cause of peace in Bangladesh as
well as in the world will go down in history as remarkable'' as she
has been able to make her voice of peace heard in the region, the
forum said.
	   ``It is against this backdrop that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
made a fervent appeal to both India and Pakistan that nuclear tests
and missiles can never serve the cause of humanity,'' it said in
its recommendation.
	   The latest peace initiatives in Ireland were taken only after
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina began negotiations with the tribal
insurgents of Chittagong Hill Tracts, the organisation observed.

Iraq, U.N. gearing for row on weapons again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The tug-of-war between Iraq and the United
Nations over disarmament may trigger a fresh crisis in the Gulf if
Baghdad continues to insist it has no more information on illegal
weapons.
	   Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler arrives Thursday in
Baghdad, armed with satellite images, charts and material evidence
to back his position that Iraq is still hiding weapons in secret
depots.
	   Butler will carry a three-page list of what he says are Iraq's
unfulfilled obligations to complete the elimination of its illegal
weapons.
	   Until Butler certifies Iraq has dismantled all its weapons of
mass destruction, Iraq won't be free of the U.N. economic sanctions
imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   A glance at Butler's register shows Iraq still has a long way to
go. For instance, the list asks Iraq to provide ``full disclosure''
of its destruction of missile propellants and to account for its
mustard-gas artillery shells and bombs used for chemical and
biological weapons.
	   In his meetings with Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, Butler is
likely to try to prove that Iraq has not yet come clean in the
areas of long-range missiles, chemical weapons and biological
weapons.
	   The mass of evidence that Butler presented earlier this month at
the United Nations swung a number of skeptical Security Council
members to his side. But the Iraqi team, led by Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, remained adamant that Iraq has done all
it could to dismantle its weapons.
	   Sticking to that position could lead to another standoff. The
alternative would be to accept Butler's demands, which would show
Iraq lied when it said it had nothing more to declare.
	   Butler's latest mission to Baghdad is similar to the trip he
made early this year when he failed to persuade the Iraqis to open
presidential sites for inspection.
	   That row led to the United States and Britain amassing forces in
the Gulf for a possible strike against Iraq. War was averted by the
last-minute intervention of U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan who
persuaded Iraqi leaders to open the palaces.

	   YESTERDAY'S rainstorm was just one of the disastrous effects of
global warming, a visiting international expert said.
	   The bird flu, red tide and mad cow disease are also symptoms of
the greenhouse effect, according to Shen Sin-yan, director of the
Global Warming International Centre in the US. Dr Shen is in Hong
Kong for the 9th Global Warming International Conference and Expo.
	   And the increasing strength of the El Nino phenomenon, linked to
this year's heavy rains and warm spring weather, is a clear
indication that the build-up of greenhouse gases is raising the
global temperature.
	   Dr Shen said humidity pockets created by the rise in the Earth's
temperature allowed micro-organisms to adapt to new environments as
human immune systems weakened.
	   Viruses move from tropical to sub-temperate climates while algal
blooms flourish forming potentially hazardous red tides.
	   He said both the warming effect of burning fossil fuels and the
atmospheric build-up of the carbon dioxide produced increased
temperatures. To counteract this effect water evaporates from the
ocean and the result is storms such as yesterday's downpour.
	   Another effect of heavy cloud cover is loss of sunlight which
leads to failed crops.
	   Dr Shen said: ``We need to stabilise the current climate by
reducing our heat input and greenhouse gases.'' Of Hong Kong's
greenhouse gas emissions, 52 per cent are from power stations.
	   Of all such gases emitted, carbon dioxide accounts for 92 per
cent. Methane makes up 6 per cent and 2 per cent is in the form of
nitrous oxide.
	   The conversion of China Light and Power's Black Point power
plant from coal- to gas-fired production led to a significant
decrease in emissions.
	   Hong Kong currently produces 36.6 million tonnes of greenhouse
gases annually. This figure is expected to rise to 60,000 tonnes
during the next 10 years.
	   Figures released in 1990 show that Hong Kong's per capita
production of greenhouse gases is 6.8 tonnes a year, compared to
19.5 tonnes in the United States.
	   Director of Environmental Protection Robert Law said yesterday
it was hoped the LPG trial scheme would be made permanent this
summer.

World Cup: Spark and unpredictability vs. experience and
</HEADLINE>
doggedness &QL; 
 &UR; By GEORGE JAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Toulouse _ or not to lose.
	   No matter how you say it, Thursday's Austria-Cameroon game in
southern France city will go a long way toward making or breaking
two of the most unpredictable World Cup teams.
	   ``We're not interested in safe soccer,'' said Claude Le Roy,
coach of Cameroon's Indomitable Lions. ``Some risks always have to
be taken.''
	   Defying the defensive, avoid-the-loss tactics so prevalent in
soccer today, Austrian forward Andreas Herzog also dropped hints of
an offense-minded strategy at Stade Municipal _ at least until the
first goal.
	   ``We will try to score in the first few minutes,'' Herzog said.
``Then things will be easier.''
	   The game is probably the best chance for either team to get a
victory at the World Cup, although Cameroon enters the game with
better momentum.
	   Austria was a surprise winner of its European qualifying group,
ahead of the likes of Sweden and Scotland, but lost to lowly
Hungary and the United States in exhibtion matches before posting
unconvincing victories over marginal qualifier Tunisia and even
lower-ranked Liechtenstein. Austrian fans booed at the home games.
	   Cameroon also took first place in its qualifying group in
Africa, and followed it up with a 0-0 draw against the Netherlands
in May and a 2-1 victory over Denmark on Friday, a possible sign
that the Lions have put their miserable 1994 World Cup performance
behind them with an eye on recreating the magic to 1990, when they
became the first African team to reach the quarterfinals.
	   Le Roy appears to have infused his squad with oft-lacking
cohesion and team spirit since May, when he retook the job he had
already held between 1985 and 1988.
	   Cameroon has also survived the loss of Marc Vivien Foe, a
standout midfielder with newly-crowned French champion Lens, who
broke his leg in training. Veteran striker took over as field
leader, scoring both goals against Denmark and restoring the team's
confidence again.
	   Despite their differences, one thought unites the two squads _
the need to get off to a winning start.
	   ``Our World Cup will depend a lot on how we will get out of that
first match against Austria,'' Le Roy said.
	   ``Cameroon is a tough team,'' Austrian defender Anton Pfeffer
said. ``And because it's our first game, we'll have a tough time
coming back if we lose against them.''

	   About two lakh people of 300 villages in five thanas of the
district have been marooned by flash floods caused by heavy rain
and onrush of water coming from across the border.
	   The flood-affected thanas are: Goainghat, Companyganj,
Kanaighat, Jaintapur and Jakiganj.
	   Official sources said 47 mm rainfall was recorded in 12 hours
ending at 9 pm Monday.
	   The rivers in the areas were swelling up while the Kushiara was
flowing slightly above the danger level at some points. The Surma
at Amalsid in Jakiganj was also flowing 9 cm above the danger mark.
	   Several hundred acres of land in the thanas with Aus and Aman
crops have been inundated by the water.
	   The road, linking Goainghat thana to the district sadar, has
gone under water disrupting the communication. Telecommunications
in Kanaighat has also remained suspended.
	   In Cox's Bazar, monsoon set in with thundershower taking a toll
of three people dead and five wounded in the district today.
	   Officials said two people drowned in a boat capsize in river
Matamuhuri while another was killed by lightning in Ramu thana.
	   The district experienced 110 mm rainfall in only six hours from
6 am to 12 noon, resulting in inundation of low-lying areas.
	   Besides, gusty wind with a speed of up to 85 kph swept the
coastal district, uprooting many trees.
	   In Ramu thana headquarters, the main road went under knee-deep
water pouring out of the overflowing Bankkhali river.
	   Two people - a 65-year-old man and a boy of 12 years - drowned
as a ferry boat caught in a storm capsized in the Matamuhuri in
Chakaria thana at about 10 am. Eight others on board, however, swam
ashore, police said.
	   In Ramu thana, Zaker Hossain, 35, was killed by lightning while
working at a riverghat.
	   Five women suffered severe injuries as a thunderbolt boomed on
their house at the offshore Shahpurirdwip in Teknaf thana at about
10-30 am.
	   The injured-Sahana Akter, Zaheda Begum, Lanu Begum, Kajal and
Shaheda-were admitted to Teknaf Thana Health Complex.
	   UNB adds: A tornado lashed two villages of Fatikchhari thana of
Chittagong early this morning leaving a man dead and levelling
about 150 houses to the ground.
	   The storm, with a wind speed of about 112 km per hour, struck
Gahira and Azadi villages at 6 am and lasted for seven minutes.
	   Official sources said some 150 kutcha and semi-pucca houses of
the two villages were damaged.
	   Road communications between Khagrachhari and Chittagong remained
cut off as the road was blocked by uprooted trees.

	   PROPERTY owners may be forced by law to carry out slope safety
work if they continue to neglect doing the necessary maintenance,
an engineering official said.
	   Speaking after a day of landslides following torrential rain,
government geotechnical engineer John Massey said about two-thirds
of private slope owners were neglecting maintenance.
	   ``People are aware of their responsibility, but only about 40
per cent of them are actually doing anything to discharge their
responsibility,'' Mr Massey said.
	   ``It may be necessary to seek legislation to compel private
owners to carry out maintenance of their slopes if further efforts
on public education and assistance to encourage owners to maintain
slopes is not successful,'' he said. ``Certainly 40 per cent of
private owners maintaining their slopes is not satisfactory.''
About 12,000 of the 18,000 private slopes in Hong Kong were
neglected, Mr Massey said.
	   Of these, about 6,000 ``would have high consequences if they
failed'', he said. In addition, about 10,000 government slopes
would have ``high consequences'' if they failed.
	   Mr Massey said the main difficulty in getting private owners to
do the necessary work was the lack of a co-ordinated effort among
property owners.
	   Many buildings had no owner's association to discuss the issue
and come up with the money _ even though most flat owners would not
have to pay more than $1,000 each.
	   Mr Massey said the Geotechnical Engineering Office (GEO) would
step up its television advertising campaign after a survey
indicated that many people still don't know what to do in case of a
landslide.
	   The survey, conducted by Hong Kong University, found that the
number of people concerned about slope safety increased to 76 per
cent last year from 70.1 per cent in 1996.
	   But 30.8 per cent still do not know what to do when a landslip
warning is issued.
	   The results were part of a random telephone survey commissioned
by the GEO last November, in which 1,530 people were interviewed.
	   Robert Chung Ting-yiu of the university said yesterday 40 per
cent of those interviewed did not know the signs of landslips such
as debris falling from slopes. Mr Massey said more TV ads would be
produced to teach the public how to detect signs of a landslip and
what to do afterwards.

	   A QUARANTINE system should be set up for high-risk coral reef
fish which have poisoned at least 200 people so far this year,
provisional urban councillors have urged.
	   PUC members meeting yesterday unanimously passed a motion that
together with the Agriculture and Fisheries Department and
Department of Health contingency measures be adopted and long-term
solutions studied to safeguard people from high-risk seafood.
	   Provisional Councillor Wong Kwok-hing who is also a member of
Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), pointed
to the 268 cases of ciguatoxin poisoning from imported deep-water
coral reef fish so far this year.
	   He said an increasing number of poisoning cases had made it
necessary for the council and government departments to adopt
contingency measures.
	   Long-term solutions, such as an import quarantine system for
high-risk seafood, having sales records and collection systems in
place and developing rapid tests, should also be looked into.
	   Such systems would enable the ``normal sale'' of non-high-risk
seafood, he added.
	   He said it was within the government's power to check dangerous
fish as there were only a few such fish being imported. Coral reef
fish account for about 10 per cent of the 21,000 tonnes of seafood
imported last year.
	   Democratic Party member Fred Li Wah-ming said he had raised a
``very similar'' motion on shellfish last March which was not
supported by DAB members.
	   Mr Wong admitted to have studied Mr Li's motion before drafting
his own proposal. He believed his motion, which concentrates on a
specific kind of fish, was more feasible.

Truth body says it may invalidate 132 amnesty applications
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A panel investigating apartheid
human rights abuses said on Wednesday 132 amnesty applications from
a black nationalist group could be declared invalid by the end of
the week.
	   The Truth and Reconciliation Commission said that accounted for
about half the amnesty applications from the Pan-Africanist
Congress, a radical grouping whose armed wing bombed and attacked
white civilian targets in its fight against apartheid.
	   In a statement issued by its chairman Desmond Tutu, the
commission said the applications would be voided unless the PAC
provided more information on what acts had been committed and the
identities of its operatives.
	   ``No real names or specifics of acts in respect of which amnesty
is sought are given,'' the statement said.
	   Set up in 1995 to probe abuses by all sides in the fight against
white rule, the commission can grant amnesty to people who tell the
full truth about their actions and prove a political motive.
	   Many of the applicants had just filled out their code names on
the application forms which ranged from common African first names
like Sipho to more bizarre nicknames like Scud Missile, Russian
Tank and Karl Marx.
	   The commission was set up after 1994's first all-race elections
which ended apartheid and swept the African National Congress into
power. It aims to uncover apartheid crimes and promote racial
healing.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Governments should enter the 21st
century understanding that peace means more than countries arming
themselves so heavily that no one will attack, a respected research
institute said Wednesday.
	   The recent nuclear testing by neighboring rivals India and
Pakistan is an example. Both see nuclear possession as a convincing
military deterrent. Nevertheless, both seem potentially on a path
to a showdown.
	   ``War is quite possible,'' said Eric Arnett, a co-author of the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute's yearbook. ``It's
also quite possible that nuclear weapons might be used.''
	   Arnett, author of the report's section on military research and
development, said India appeared to have 20-30 nuclear warheads,
compared with 10-20 for Pakistan.
	   SIPRI's annual report is regarded as a definitive assessment of
global security issues.
	   The 29th edition covers 1997, before the balance of power issue
took a worrisome turn with India and Pakistan demonstrating the
respective nuclear weapons capability with a series of test blasts
last month.
	   Their armed conflict was one of 25 worldwide last year _ down
from 27 in 1996 and 36 in 1989 in which at least 1,000 people were
killed.
	   SIPRI noted that most conflicts since the end of the Cold War
occur within a country rather than between nations; and happen more
often in ``failed'' authoritarian states rather than in democratic,
prosperous ones.
	   ``The security agenda ahead must be founded on a new political
philosophy, encompassing a common, institutionalized system of
standards and shared values rather than concepts based on the
balance of power,'' it said stated.
	   The institute called for the ``complete elimination of nuclear
weapons,'' though the report, and comments from its authors
indicated that was unlikely to take place any time soon.
	   Developments in 1997 were not all discouraging. Favorable events
included the movements toward peace in Northern Ireland and the two
Koreas. Also, the signing of an international treaty on banning
anti-personnel mines, and the ratification by Russia, China and the
United States of the Chemical Weapons Convention.
	   Nevertheless, peace prospects for the Middle East remain
distant, for which Peter Jones, co-author of that section of the
report, blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benhamin Netanyahu.
	   ``Although there is ample blame for all the parties involved,
the conclusion cannot be escaped that Netanyahu's commitment to the
peace process has never been more than equivocal,'' he stated.
	   Additionally, the START II treaty to reduce nuclear arsenals
remained ``in limbo'' in 1997, ``despite agreement between
Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin on a series of measures
to boost its chances of being ratified by the Russian Parliament,''
it said.
	   Among the report's other highlights:
	   _ Annual world military expenditure declined by about one-third
from 1988 to 1997, when spending was estimated to be about 740
billion dollars.
	   _ Russia's military expenditure in 1997 was less than 10 percent
of what the Soviet Union spent a decade earlier.
	   _ Peace accords last year in Liberia, Tajikistan and Bangladesh
can be considered ``major successes in armed conflict resolution.''

	   CHIEF Secretary for Administration Anson Chan Fang On-sang said
the first legislative elections under Chinese sovereignty had
produced a balanced legislature, contrary to pre-election
criticisms.
	   Speaking in New York during a 10-day visit to the United States,
Mrs Chan said the outcome proved critics wrong.
	   ``I am aware of criticisms that the election arrangements were
flawed, that they were designed to lessen the prospects of the
pro-democracy candidates, and boost the chances of the so-called
China-friendly candidates. I believe the outcome proved
otherwise,'' she told the annual dinner of the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on Monday (NY
time).
	   ``There were no boycotts, but plenty of hard, noisy, colourful
campaigning, which is very much Hong Kong style,'' she said.
	   ``The elections were conducted freely, fairly and honestly. They
produced a balanced legislature, including a good slew of members
who were most critical of the arrangements.'' Mrs Chan will spend
three days in Washington meeting senior administration officials
and members of Congress.
	   She said Hong Kong had confounded its critics because fears of
loss of freedom through interference from Beijing had proved
unfounded.
	   ``The promises of a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong have
been honoured in word and deed . . . Hong Kong people are now
running Hong Kong within the framework of our constitution.''

Adoption bill clears parliament's upper house
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The upper house of parliament passed amendments to
Russia's adoption law on Wednesday that would tighten control over
foreign adoptions and encourage more Russians to adopt children.
	   The changes, passed by the lower house on Friday, were
unanimously approved by the Federation Council. They must still be
approved by President Boris Yeltsin before becoming law.
	   Yeltsin has not publicly stated his opinion on the subject.
	   The amendments were proposed by the Communist head of the State
Duma's women and family affairs committee, Alevtina Aparina, who
argued they were needed to better protect children's rights.
	   Aparina and her allies said foreign adoption agencies often
bribe Russian officials to arrange illegal adoptions.
	   The amendments that were approved were a watered-down version of
those first proposed.
	   The original version said that Russia must sign agreements with
other countries to codify adoption procedures by Sept. 1, 1999.
Adoption workers and human rights activists warned that the
proposal could discourage prospective adoptive parents and leave
most Russian orphans with no hope of finding a home.
	   There are many more Russian orphans than Russians interested in
adopting them.
	   The final version contained no time limit for the prospective
international agreements to be signed, meaning pending adoptions
will not be stalled by the measure.
	   The bill would allow foreign adoption agencies to operate in
Russia only after their country signs an agreement with Russia
setting out the rules. In the interim, prospective foreign parents
can use the services of proxies and interpreters as they do now.
	   According to parliamentary estimates, there are about 80 foreign
adoption agencies, mostly American, currently operating in Russia,
usually through Russian intermediaries.

	   NICE, France (AP) _ When Brazil and Scotland kicked off the
century's last World Cup on Wednesday afternoon, the German team
had better things to do than watch. It trained.
	   But in a concession to players who wanted to see at least part
of the game, coach Berti Vogts moved forward the start of practice
session to 5:15 p.m. (1515 GMT). Originally, the start of practice
had been set for 5:30 p.m. (1530 GMT), the time of the opening
kickoff.
	   With a slightly earlier start of practice, the players hoped to
see at least part of the second half.
	   The Germans had been the day off Tuesday and did not train
Wednesday morning.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haitians will have to turn off air
conditioners, refrigerators and all other appliances during soccer
matches if they want to watch the World Cup live.
	   The state utility, which routinely cuts off power to the capital
for 12 hours each day, has promised to double the city's
electricity supply to 100 megawatts daily during the tournament.
	   But the power-starved nation cannot generate a further 15
megawatts, the minimum needed to meet a full day's worth of
consumption in Port-au-Prince.
	   Officials therefore appealed to Haitians to turn off all
appliances while watching the soccer matches in order not to
overburden the power system, the Nouvelliste daily reported.
	   Fewer than a third of Port-au-Prince's 2 million residents own
television sets. But many were invited to crowd into friends' homes
or visit neighbors selling seats in front of their TV sets.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Authorities in Bangladesh have beefed
up security around the country's notoriously unreliable power
stations because of concerns that angry soccer fans might attack
them in case of power cuts during matches.
	   Soccer is arguably the most popular sport in Bangladesh. Though
its national team didn't reach the World Cup tournament that begins
Wednesday in France, fans cheer on dozens of local teams.
	   The government flew in two Russian engineers from Moscow on
Sunday to repair a 210 megawatt power station to ensure there was
an adequate power supply in the capital, Dhaka, newspapers
reported.
	   Power cuts are routine in Bangladesh. In some areas, power cuts
last 10-12 hours, resulting in street demonstrations.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Although their national team did not
qualify for the World Cup, Thais are planning to bet a record
amount on the tournament, according to a survey released Wednesday.
	   The tournament will be a boon to a range of Thai businesses,
according to a survey by the Thai Farmers Bank Research Center.
	   Thais will bet about 30 billion baht (dlrs 700 million)
nationwide, the survey said.
	   Aside from bookmakers, a number of other businesses will get a
boost from the event, the research center said. Sales and use of
communications equipment will be on the rise, as fans trade
information by mobile phones, computers and pagers. Newspapers
should see sales increase, and pubs and restaurants with big-screen
televisions should get more business, the survey said.
	   Sales of instant noodles and coffee will also perk up as fans
stay up late at night to watch games because of the time
difference.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ The coach who won the 1994 World Cup with Brazil,
Carlos Alberto Parreira, is back for the 1998 tournament with the
Saudi Arabian team. Parreira has no hopes of winning this time
around.
	   ``Even with a team that has no chance of winning the Cup, just
being here, playing against France, the host country, being a part
of the big picture. ... I just waited to make sure that Saudi
Arabia was not in the same group as Brazil,'' Parreira said
Wednesday in an interview with French daily L'Equipe.
	   Parreira was happy not to be coaching Brazil this time around.
The pressure of having to win was too great.
	   ``Believe me, I don't regret anything,'' said Parreira about his
decision to stop coaching Brazil, ``I'm happy.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French organizing committee and the interior
ministry have put three matches on a security black list. Security
will be beefed up for Netherlands-Belgium, United States-Iran and
Colombia-England.
	   Neighbors Netherlands and Belgium are both notorious for the
animosity between their supporters and the level of organization of
their hooligans. For the United States-Iran match, organizers are
unsure how Iranian fans will behave given the political situation
between the two countries.
	   English hooligans are most feared by the French police and
security forces, especially since the Colombia-England match is in
the northern city of Lens, the French daily le Parisien reported.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ The international soccer federation is setting up a
scholarship fund in honor of retiring FIFA president Joao Havelange
to help students researching soccer-related subjects.
	   The fund will enable students from developing countries to
pursue their studies at universities in Europe and the United
States, FIFA officials said.
	   Applications for the new scholarships will be awarded depending
on the potential impact the studies will have on the development of
football in student's home country.

	   HEALTH authorities are considering setting up an internet link
with Taiwanese doctors on the deadly intestinal virus that has
killed at least 32 babies in Taiwan.
	   The Department of Health says it is continuing to monitor the
intestinal ``enterovirus type 71''.
	   But it stopped short of issuing health alerts to Hong Kong
doctors saying it was waiting for more information from Taiwanese
authorities. A spokeswoman said the department remained concerned
over the outbreak and was monitoring the situation.
	   She said the department was considering setting up an internet
link to Taiwan so that local doctors could obtain more information.
	   President of the Hong Kong Medical Association Dr Lo Wing-lok
said the government should alert doctors and the public to the
potential dangers of the enterovirus, as well as advising
travellers to take precautions.
	   He said an internet site would be the most effective way of
doing that. Yesterday, Singapore's health and environment
ministries announced there was ``no unusual occurrence'' of the
viral infection in the country, but that medical practitioners
would be warned to be on the watch for outbreaks of the illness.
	   At least 10,000 children in Taiwan have been affected by the
virus, which is usually spread through food and physical contact
with an infected person.
	   More than 32 children have died as a result of the infection.
The infection breaks down immunity, leaving infants at risk of
contracting various fatal diseases.
	   Taiwan's health department director, Chan Chi-hsien, said the
rate of infection was slow based on similar outbreaks in the United
States, Bulgaria, and Malaysia.
	   He accused the mainland of hindering Taiwan's attempts to
control the outbreak, because it was not a member of the World
Health Organisation and therefore was unable to get the antiserum
to test the virus.

	   An automobile businessman, Mustafizur Rahman Musa (30), arrested
in connection with the killing of Syed Sadequr Rahman Masum, was
remanded for three days yesterday. The court refused him bail.
	   The Detective police produced him before the court of the Chief
Metropolitan Magistrate at about 2:30 pm seeking seven days remand.
	   According to police, Musa was directly involved in the killing
of Masum.
	   On Monday night, a DB police squad, led by assistant
commissioner Golam Kibria, arrested Musa from Tejkunipara.
	   Earlier, Tejgaon police arrested an autorickshaw-driver, Ismail
Mollah, from the same area in connection with the murder of Masum.
He was sent to jail hajat after the end of the four day remand on
June 7.
	   Masum, an official of a garments factory, was shot dead near his
Tejkunipara residence on June 1.

	   HONGKONG Telecom is among many companies which have agreed to
join a self-help program proposed by the Hong Kong Council of
Social Service to create jobs.
	   A number of companies in the retailing sector will provide
retraining courses as part of the program.
	   The Job Creation Program announced yesterday is aimed at
creating more than 16,800 vacancies.
	   The proposal has been submitted to the Chief Executive's Office
and the Financial Secretary Sir Donald Tsang Yam-kuen.
	   The ambitious project is aimed at helping the unemployed, middle
income group as well as middle and small-sized enterprises overcome
economic hardships through self-help and mutual help.
	   Dr Choi Yuen-wan, chairman of the council's Integrated Project
on Employment, said more than 6,500 vacancies would be created in a
recycling program alone.
	   Plans included creating five flea markets or special areas for
hawkers throughout Hong Kong. These would be tailored for the
disabled to sell hand-made crafts and second-hand goods donated by
voluntary organisations.

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway's inflation rate fell to 2.1 percent
for the 12 months ending on May 15, from 2.5 percent a month
earlier and 2.7 percent in May 1997, the state statistics agency
announced Wednesday.
	   Statistics Norway said the consumer price index for May was
275.4, compared to 275.8 in April and 269.7 in May 1997. All the
figures use 1979 as a base year with an index of 100.
	   The agency said lower electricity rates and a fall in clothing
prices were among the main reasons for the drop in inflation.

	   A COUNTER-PROPOSAL for the municipal councils to take over full
responsibility for food safety and environmental hygiene was likely
to be rejected, Deputy Secretary for Constitutional Affairs Maureen
Chan Leung Mong-lin said yesterday. Mrs Chan was speaking to
reporters after an extraordinary meeting at the Provisional
Regional Council was postponed due to the small number of
councillors who turned up. The meeting was to have discussed the
government's proposal to assume the councils' food safety and
environmental hygiene powers. The proposal was contained in a
public document released last week for public consultation in the
next two months.
	   Mrs Chan said the government was not aware of the councils'
counter-proposal until it was reported in the press last week.
	   She said nowhere else in the world were food safety and
environmental hygiene supervised by a municipal council.
	   Members of the two councils, including chairman of the
Provisional Urban Council Ronald Leung Ding-bong and chairman of
the PUC Lau Wong-fat, had suggested the councils should assume all
duties of food and environmental protection, including those being
supervised by the government.
	   Mrs Chan acknowledged that the government document showed
preference for the assumption of the municipal councils' powers.
	   But she said the public could still give practical suggestions
on protecting public health during the consultation exercise.
	   Mrs Chan said 20 submissions had been received so far on the
Review of District Organisations document, all of which supported
the proposal to strip the councils' powers on food and
environmental hygiene.
	   Responses differed on the four options for the structure of the
district organisations, she said.

	   IT was a truly black day at the Provisional Regional Council
chambers.
	   First came the black rainstorm warning that forced cancellation
of a meeting to hear a briefing on planned reorganisation of the
municipal councils.
	   Next, Deputy Secretary for Constitutional Affairs Maureen Chan
Leung Mong-lin declined to give an impromptu briefing, which put
some councillors in a black mood.
	   Then a group of opponents tried to present Mrs Chan with a big
black paper box symbolising the government's ``black box''
operation in planning the changes.
	   Mrs Chan initially refused to accept it _ making the
councillors' mood even blacker _ but eventually she asked her staff
to receive the ``gift''.
	   The meeting was called off by council chairman Lau Wong-fat,
although 16 members had already arrived, and will be rescheduled.
	   Members accused Ms Chan of being insincere about gathering their
opinions, after she declined to stay on and brief those present.
She rejected the accusation, saying she did not want to have to
give the explanation twice.

Defying a police ban, opposition party gathers illegally
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Defying police orders not to
gather in public, hundreds of supporters turned up Wednesday for a
brightly lit open-air dinner organized by Malaysia's main
opposition party.
	   ``We haven't received any news whether or not the police will
repeal the ban at the last minute, but we're going ahead with the
dinner,'' said Lim Guan Eng, deputy secretary-general of the
opposition Democratic Action Party.
	   Vehicles clogged the road adjoining the field, where over 60
dinner tables had been placed for their supporters. Volunteers
dashed to open more seats for the larger-than-expected crowd.
	   Lim said this was the fourth police crackdown against public
meetings over the past 10 days and the second time police has
banned a gathering organized by the DAP.
	   ``If there's a ban on political gatherings, where is democracy
and where is civil liberty?'' he said.
	   Last Tuesday, Malaysian authorities suddenly withdrew permission
for a meeting of residents to discuss the city's severe water
rationing.
	   Police also broke up a gathering of lawyers at a city hotel on
May 30, saying the organizers hadn't obtained a permit. Lim and his
father, who heads the DAP, were to speak at that meeting.
	   Since the cancelations of public meetings in recent weeks,
dozens of opposition parties, volunteer and consumer organizations
have demanded more civil liberties and free speech.

	   AN alleged top triad member was released yesterday on his own
recognisance after 15 hours of questioning by an examining
magistrate of the Macau District Court.
	   Wong Tat-hou, 30, had been handed to the District Court by
Macau's Judicial Police on Monday.
	   Police said at the time that Wong was facing possible
arraignment over a number of alleged crimes, namely membership of a
triad gang, homicide, blackmail, casino loansharking and
kidnapping.
	   Senior police sources have described Wong as one of the top
office-bearers of the 14K triad gang, whose alleged leader,
``Broken Tooth'' Wan Kuok-koi, has been in pre-trial detention on a
preliminary charge of ``criminal association''.
	   ``Criminal association'' is the local legal term for organised
crime membership.
	   A judicial source said examining magistrate Mario Chaves had
decided to release Wong on his own recognisance because of an
apparent lack of circumstantial evidence.
	   The District Court on Sunday ordered the pre-trial detention of
two female suspected triad members who were allegedly ``very
close'' to their detained leader, Wan.
	   Wong Wan-wa (widely known by her Cantonese nickname Fei Mui or
Fat Girl) and Lam Iok-im (known by her nickname Dai Ga Je or Big
Sister) are both facing a wide range of preliminary charges, namely
criminal association, blackmail, kidnapping and handling
contraband.
	   Wong Wan-wa, 34, is said to be known in the local underworld as
``the queen of smuggling''.
	   The District Court earlier this week also ordered the pre-trial
detention of a local 23-year-old Thai national, Pholpimeis
Suralhart, who allegedly carried an explosive device when arrested
by police last week.
	   He worked as a bouncer for a local discotheque reportedly owned
by Wan. Police sources have said the ``Heavy Club'' discotheque is
a hangout for triad suspects.

Yeltsin fires statistics chief arrested in tax scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin fired the head of Russia's
statistics service who was charged with helping big companies evade
taxes, news agencies reported Wednesday.
	   Yuri Yurkov, head of the State Statistics Committee, was
arrested Monday, along with his deputy and up to 20 alleged
accomplices. Police seized dlrs 1.5 million, dlrs 1 million of it
from Yurkov's home.
	   Investigators accused them of manipulating economic data to hide
the real output of companies and reduce their tax liability, and
with selling classified information about rival companies'
performance.
	   The arrests could have far-reaching implications if it turns out
that data government officials rely on to make policy and collect
taxes was falsified.
	   Tax evasion is a major problem in Russia, from ordinary citizens
to large corporations. The government's inability to collect tax
revenues has slowed efforts to boost the economy.

	   STEPS to deter time-wasting criminals from slowing the wheels of
justice are to be introduced in the Court of Appeal from today.
	   Procedures are being installed which will enable a single judge
_ rather than a full panel of three _ to decide whether to grant
leave for convicts to appeal against their sentence.
	   Applicants who are given leave will have a hearing before a full
panel.
	   Those who are refused leave can still insist on a full court
hearing, but will be warned they could end up serving longer in
jail if their application is considered worthless.
	   The procedures will apply only to appellants who have been
refused legal aid and do not have a lawyer to represent them.
	   The measures follow a judiciary study which showed 85 per cent
of the 400 convicts a year who appeal against sentences were
refused legal aid and were unrepresented.
	   A judiciary spokeswoman yesterday said the scheme was being
introduced ``with a view to reduce the number of unmeritorious
applications before the full Court of Appeal''.
	   The scheme will be tried out for two to three months after being
given the go-ahead by Chief High Court Judge Patrick Chan Siu-oi.
	   It was one of several ideas which were considered by the
Criminal Court Users' Committee under the chairmanship of Justice
Barry Mortimer.
	   When the proposal was revealed almost a year ago by the Hong
Kong Standard it sparked some concern among lawyers and human-
rights activists.
	   But Bar Council chairwoman, Audrey Eu Yeut-mee, SC, said
convicts who persevered to a full court hearing after being refused
by a single judge were likely to face longer in jail.
	   ``It's a filtering mechanism. It gives the applicant some
warning.'' But Ms Eu added the trial would have to be evaluated
before its merit could be determined.
	   The court has the power to order that some of the time served by
a worthless applicant does not count towards his sentence.
	   The judiciary spokeswoman said the scheme was authorised under a
section of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance but ``had not been used
for some time''.
	   ``The matter has been discussed with senior judges of the Court
of Appeal and members of the legal profession,'' the spokeswoman
added.
	   The procedures were to begin yesterday, but will start today
following the closure of all courts because of heavy rain.

	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Under a searing sun, more than 3,000 East
Timorese protested Wednesday against Indonesian control of their
homeland, roaring freedom anthems, briefly brandishing outlawed
rebel flags and bowing their heads in Roman Catholic prayer.
	   Later, a dozen buses packed with students clinging to the
runnerboards and swaying on the roofs drove in a joyous convoy
through Dili, the capital of the former Portuguese colony, shouting
slogans in support of a vote on self-determination.
	   The military, accused of widespread abuses in the disputed
territory, did not intervene. It has kept a low profile since
longtime authoritarian leader Suharto quit last month and a new
government with an agenda of democratic reform took over.
	   The demonstrations were an emphatic rejection of a proposal by
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie to grant special status to East
Timor, which could ease the tight, often violent grip the
government has exerted there since invading in 1975.
	   ``We want total independence. We want to be free,'' said
protester Licinio Branco. Others echoed his view that Indonesian
authorities were taking only half-measures.
	   In another conciliatory gesture, Justice Minister Muladi
announced Wednesday that Habibie had signed a decree allowing the
release of 15 East Timorese political prisoners in Dili. Muladi
said they would be freed ``as soon as possible.''
	   The list does not include jailed rebel chief Xanana Gusmao, a
symbol of the separatist struggle who was hailed by protesters who
gathered in a yard at the state-funded University of East Timor.
	   ``Release Xanana,'' they shouted, fists raised. They unfurled
banners with his image, as well as a poster with a crude drawing of
an Indonesian soldier cutting off the breast of a civilian woman
with a knife. One painted slogan read, ``Get rid of Indonesia.''
	   In an interview broadcast Wednesday on Portuguese state radio,
Gusmao described Habibie as a ``clown'' who loyally served his
mentor, Suharto, while East Timor suffered repression.
	   It was one of the biggest political demonstrations in recent
years, and many protesters said they felt freer to speak out. They
shouted abuse at military officers who peered over the fence from
an adjacent barracks.
	   But activists only flashed banned rebel flags, signaling that
fear of the military still runs deep. In 1991, dozens were killed
when troops opened fire on a protest march near a Dili cemetery.
	   After ordering forces into East Timor, Suharto annexed the
territory as Indonesia's 27th province, refusing to make
concessions despite international complaints about the deaths of
tens of thousands of people. The United Nations does not recognize
Indonesian control there.
	   A new military commander for East Timor, Col. Suhartono
Suratman, was sworn in Wednesday in a ceremony in Dili. His
predecessor and 11 other top officers and soldiers were killed in a
helicopter crash in bad weather last week.
	   The army said it was an accident, but East Timorese separatists
based in Portugal said rebels had shot it down.
	   The guerrilla war against the military has dwindled to
occasional hit-and-run attacks that pose no threat to Indonesian
authority. The symbolism of the long rebel struggle, however, is a
more potent force that serves as a rallying point for
pro-independence activists.
	   On Wednesday, student protesters in buses drove by a military
barracks, shouting ``Viva Xanana'' in honor of the jailed rebel
chief. Dressed only in shorts, a few off-duty officers stepped out
of their homes for a glance before strolling back inside.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ President Elias Hrawi and his son George
are set for an electoral showdown next week, backing rival tickets
in the municipal elections in their hometown of Zahle.
	   Newspapers said Wednesday the race for Zahle would be close, and
the results could have a bearing on the president's political
prospects. Hrawi's extended term of office expires in November, but
it is thought he may accept another extension.
	   Hrawi, his younger son Roy and his nephew, Khalil Hrawi, a
member of parliament, have endorsed a slate of candidates for the
21-member town council in Zahle, eastern Lebanon.
	   But Hrawi's eldest son George has backed the ticket of his
father's arch-foe, Elie Skaff, a Greek Catholic legislator. The
town is mostly Greek Catholic.
	   Zahle, some 37 kilometers (23 miles) east of the capital Beirut,
is the largest Christian city in the Bekaa Valley, where the fourth
and last stage of Lebanon's municipal elections will be held
Sunday.
	   Skaff and Hrawi, a Maronite, are long-time rivals for the
leadership of the town.
	   ``I respect my father and admire his achievements in Zahle ...
but I follow my own convictions in politics,'' George Hrawi told
the newspaper An-Nahar.
	   George Hrawi, who shied away from politics until recently, said
he did not agree with his father's policies. He did not elaborate,
but predicted the disagreement would ``snowball'' in the next few
days.
	   The president has not commented on his son's remarks.
	   Some political observers have speculated that the president may
have advised George to back the rival slate, so that the Hrawi
family would have supporters on the council, regardless of which
ticket wins.
	   A tough town council race is also expected in eastern Lebanon's
ancient city of Baalbek between the Hezbollah and Amal guerrilla
groups.
	   Candidates fielded by Hezbollah, the main guerrilla group
fighting Israel, scored major gains during elections in southern
Lebanon last Sunday and in the Shiite suburbs of south Beirut on
May 24, defeating rivals backed by Amal.

World Cup: Italy seeks to break tradition with good start against

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Italy seeks an untraditionally good
World Cup start in Thursday's Group B match against Chile to launch
its quest for a record-equaling fourth title.
	   Initial matches of past world competitions often have presented
headaches for the ``Azzurri.'' Coach Cesare Maldini and his son
Paolo, the team captain, hope for an easy start this time against
the Latin American team.
	   ``We have a lot of respect for Chile, but we need to begin with
a victory. The first match of the first round is often decisive for
qualifying,'' said Paolo Maldini, a 30-year-old AC Milan defender
with 87 caps on the national team.
	   Italy won the world title in Spain, in 1982, barely escaping
first-round elimination following three draws. It suffered a 1-0
first-match upset by Ireland in 1994 before rallying to reach the
final against Brazil in Pasadena.
	   The Chilean team, which qualified for the World Cup finals
following a 16-year absence, is considered the underdog compared
with three-time champion Italy.
	   However Ivan Zamorano and Marcelo Salas, the Chilean strikers of
international fame, could produce an early sensation in the
tournament if the Italian defense does not prove tighter and more
attentive than in recent warmup games.
	   A defensive lapse of young Alessandro Nesta touched off Italy's
last-minute 1-0 loss against Sweden in last week's tuneup.
	   Nesta is going to mark Zamorano with agile Fabio Cannavaro
taking care of Salas.
	   Zamorano and Salas, who combined for 23 goals in World Cup
qualifying, ``are a threat for any defense,'' Cesare Maldini said.
	   On offense, Italy must overcome the loss of striker Fabrizio
Ravanelli, who was dropped from the squad Wednesday with an
infection in his right lung. The Italians petitioned FIFA for a
roster change, with Parma forward Enrico Chiesa set to take
Ravanelli's spot.
	   Italy will also be without its ``Golden Boy'' Alessandro Del
Piero, just recovered from a right thigh strain.
	   However the team will not miss imagination and play-making skill
in front with veteran Roberto Baggio taking over the place of his
younger teammate.
	   Baggio, Italy's World Cup hero in 1994, said he was looking
forward to an outstanding performance against Chile and then
sitting on the substitutes bench against Cameroon.
	   Del Piero, considered a key to Italy's fortunes in the World
Cup, is likely to return to action against the African team in
Montpellier on June 17.
	   A 2-0 rout of England at Wembley and an undeserved 1-0 loss
against Argentina in recent warmup games have greatly boosted
Chile's prestige and self-confidence while causing alarm in the
Maldini family.
	   ``Chile is not only Zamorano and Salas. Midfield and defense are
good. It's a tough team,'' the Italian coach said.
	   As a result of the growing internationalization of European
leagues, Thursday's match features a duel between club teammates _
Inter Milan's goalie Gianluca Pagliuca on the Italian side and
Chile's Zamorano.

	   DETERMINING the amount of assets that could be recovered from
collapsed Peregrine Investment Holdings is very difficult because
the group is made up of 200 entities, an executive of provisional
liquidators Price Waterhouse said yesterday.
	   Partner Colin Bird said a US$1 billion (HK$7.8 billion) figure
that has been floated might be an over-optimistic assessment of the
amount likely to be recovered.
	   Price Waterhouse is holding a series of meetings this week,
starting today, for creditors to decide the course of action for
Peregrine's winding up.
	   The first meeting will include a vote by contributors on a
decision to apply to the court for an order winding up the company.
	   The second meeting will entitle creditors to determine by
resolution that a liquidator be appointed subject to court
approval, whether an application shall be made to the court for the
appointment of a committee of inspection to act with the
liquidator, and who the committee members are to be.
	   ``At the meetings, we will give the best estimates we can,'' Mr
Bird said.
	   ``It's very difficult to say the exact amount.'' Mr Bird said
his secondment from Price Waterhouse's London office was to view
the Peregrine case from a global perspective, as well as draw on
his experience of dealing with similar cases. ``I have a lot of
experience with these kind of complex firms.'' Questions have been
raised over the circumstances surrounding a US$265 million loan to
an Indonesian company and whether the firm failed to inform the
market about its financial circumstances in a timely manner.
	   The Securities and Futures Commission is under pressure to
explain its lack of action towards the firm and its failure to
launch an inquiry. But SFC sources have not ruled out further
action.
	   If the SFC does not feel it has the power to investigate
Peregrine, Financial Secretary Sir Donald Tsang Yam-kuen can
appoint an inspector to investigate the firm under Section 143 of
the Companies Ordinance.
	   The government will only act if there appears to be
circumstances suggesting its business had been conducted with
intent to defraud creditors.

	   Vast areas of land on both sides of the Iswardi-Sirajganj
railway route near the Bangabandhu Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge
(BJMB) have allegedly been occupied illegally by a section of
influential people . As the day for opening of the long-cherished
bridge is nearing , the unscrupulous and selfish people are waiting
to exploit the full benefit through grabbing the state property
.These people are erecting sheds, semi-pucca and pucca stalls,
shops, houses and even markets on the railway lands much to the
concern of the innocent public. On the other hand, most of the
railway lands from Bhanguria railway station to Boral Ghat and
Boral bridge station to Saratnagar Bazar have been grabbed
illegally by the local people due to negligence of the authorities
concerned, it is alleged.
	   A number of business establishments have been constructed on the
railway lands which have narrowed the roads creating problems for
the general people who travel by trains . Traffic jam is a regular
feature in these areas . About 40,000 acres of railway land worth
about Taka 300 crore are allegedly under the unauthorised
possession of some influential people in the railway's western
zone. As a result the government is deprived of huge amount of
revenue. Meanwhile organised gangs of thugs are stealing the doors,
windows and other valuable property of the railway staff quarters
in the area everyday. This dastardly act should be checked
immediately , as with the opening of the BJMB importance of the
railway station will increase greatly .
	   According to a source of the Paksey western railway estate
office, recovery of the railway property from the clutches of the
illegal occupants is not easy. Permission will have to be sought
from the appropriate authority before eviction of the unauthorised
occupants. The railway authorities launch drive from time to time
to evict the unauthorised occupants , but cannot take action
against them most of the time due to threats and pressures from
vested quarters and political groups. Our Correspondent from
Sirajganj adds: All arrangements have almost completed for opening
of the Bangabandhu Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge (BJMB) on June 23. It
was disclosed at a views exchange meeting on June 3 at the
conference room of the Deputy Commissioner of Sirajganj.
	   The views exchange meeting was presided over by Deputy
Commissioner AKM Shamsuddin and was attended by political leaders,
professionals, journalists and leaders of various socio-cultural
organisations. The Deputy Commissioner informed the meeting that
strict security measures have been taken for opening of the BJMB.
The public meeting at the western part of the bridge at Saidabad is
expected to be attended by about 20 lakh people. The educational
institutions will remain closed to accommodate the guests from 16
northern districts.

Latest polls predict stalemate in early elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Ten days before the country's
early elections, polls indicate a stalemate or a minority
government as a probable outcome of the crucial ballot.
	   According to a Sofres-Factum opinion poll published Wednesday,
opposition Social Democrats led by Milos Zeman have a solid lead
with a 27.8 percent support followed by the Civic Democratic Party
of former Premier Vaclav Klaus with 16.9 percent.
	   A total of 2,025 people were queried in May 7-29, but no margin
of error was given by the polling agency.
	   Zeman and Klaus, citing irreconcilable differences in their
political program and style, repeatedly have ruled out a grand
coalition that would allow majority rule.
	   Klaus led the country through painful economic reforms and the
1993 breakup of the Czechoslovak federation.
	   He was ousted from office after the Christian Democrats, led by
Josef Lux, left his three-party coalition amid accusations of dirty
campaign financing.
	   Soon after Klaus' political demise, his opponents inside the
party, led by former Interior Minister Jan Ruml, defected to form
their own Freedom Union.
	   Lux and Ruml then helped form the current interim government of
Premier Josef Tosovsky, designed to lead the country to early
elections on June 19-20.
	   The move seems to have backfired because the interim coalition
government's two main components are not exactly popular: the
Christian Democrats' support has sunk to an all-time low of 5.4
percent and the Freedom Union has the backing of 7.2 percent of
voters, according to Sofres Factum.
	   Orthodox unreformed communists have a steady support of 9
percent, the xenophobic Republicans hover around 6 percent, and the
a party called Pensioners for Secure Living enjoys a support of 7.8
percent.
	   But the latter three parties are considered extremist and most
likely will be shunned in post-election coalition plans.
	   While the election outcome is still uncertain, Zeman is largely
expected to be the first to have a shot at forming the new cabinet.
	   He has virtually no chance of forming a majority government
without the support of one of the three extremist parties, and he
would need Klaus to tolerate his minority government.
	   President Vaclav Havel's role as power broker could be crucial
if his health allows him to take active part in coalition talks.
	   The absence of a clear winner, frequent party infighting and
personal animosities among leaders who have dominated Czech
politics since 1989 make the ballot, and political negotiations
afterward, difficult.

Thousands protest Serb attacks, ethnic leader to Europe

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Decrying the latest Serb aggression,
thousands of ethnic Albanians took to the streets of Pristina in
protest Wednesday, while their leader headed to Europe's capitals
to seek assistance for his people.
	   Some 20,000 Kosovo Albanians marched through the main street of
the provincial capital with banners that read: ``NATO, Kosovo is
burning'' and ``NATO, tomorrow will be too late,'' and carrying
Albanian and U.S. flags.
	   The protesters fervently chanted ``U-C-K,'' the Albanian
language acronym for the Kosovo Liberation Army _ a militant
organization fighting to wrest the southern province away from
Serbia _ and sang a popular Albanian song, praising their ethnic
leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Groups of protesters leaving the rally _ the 60th consecutive
demonstration _ got into a stone-throwing scuffle near the
university with Serbs. Several cars were stoned and a university
bookstore window shattered. Police intervened and dispersed the
protesters.
	   No further violence was reported early Wednesday elsewhere in
the southern province, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs
9-to-1. Kosovo's restive Albanian majority seeks independence from
Serbia, which stripped its autonomy in 1989 and has since ruled the
province with a heavy military and police presence.
	   In the Macedonian capital Skopje, some 30,000 ethnic Albanians
gathered downtown to demand NATO presence in Kosovo, where more
than 250 people have died in escalating clashes between Yugoslav
troops and ethnic Albanian militants that began in early March.
	   In last week's fighting, more than 50 people were killed and 200
were missing and presumed captured in western parts of Kosovo,
according to ethnic Albanian sources.
	   Chased by the fighting, some 20,000 Kosovo Albanian refuges
flowed into neighboring northern Albania last week.
	   An additional 10,000 fled to the neighboring republic of
Montenegro, which together with Serbia makes up Yugoslavia. The
Montena-fax independent news agency in Montenegro reported a
``river of refugees'' was crossing dense, mountainous territory on
foot to reach Montenegro.
	   Another 50,000 people have been displaced within Kosovo since
March, according to the Pristina-based Committee for the Defense of
Human Rights.
	   Meanwhile, Rugova headed for the European capitals of Paris and
London to attend meetings of the Contact Group nations, which
monitors developments in the former Yugoslavia, and seek help for
his people.
	   Demonstrations announced by the independent human rights
organization Society for Threatened Peoples were to simultaneously
take place in European capitals.

	   A huge amount of by-product of the Panchagarh Sugar Mills such
as molasses and sugarcane coir is wasting. Molasses could be used
as raw materials in distilleries to make alcohol and spirits and
the coir in the paper mills of the country. The Panchagarh mill
produces some eight to 10 lakh tonnes of coir a year, said Yasin
Ali, a sugarcane expert and former principal of the Haji Danesh
Agricultural College, Dinajpur.
	   But the North Bengal Paper Mills at Paksey requires only 80,000
tonnes of coir per year, he further said. Mahbubul Alam, Thakurgaon
Sugar Mills general manager, said the total demand for alcohol and
spirits in the country is 11,000 barrels a year while the sugar
mills produces about 100,000 tonnes of molasses annually.
	   With one in Panchagarh, as many as five distilleries are there
in the country and all these could produce 50,000 barrels of
alcohol from about 50,000 tonnes of molasses a year, Alam added.The
state-owned Carew and Company Ltd is currently working to only 40
per cent of its capacity. But a huge quantity of molasses is lying
waste in the sugar mills which could be used in alcohol-making.
	   The Panchagarh mill general manager Mirza Azim said, most sugar
mills in the country are selling molasses at throwaway prices. If
the distilleries are allowed to export some of their products, they
can well use the excess molasses lying with the sugar mills to
produce more alcohol, Azim added.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The planes are booked, the hotel rooms reserved,
and thousands of Japanese soccer fans are getting ready to cheer on
their national team in its World Cup debut this Sunday in France.
	   The only problem? Most of the tickets haven't arrived.
	   And Japan's tour operators are panicking.
	   Of the 14,700 tickets ordered for Japan's opening match Sunday
against Argentina, only 2,200 have been delivered, Jun Ishiyama,
spokesman for the Japan Association of Travel Agents, said
Wednesday at a news conference.
	   The 13 travel agencies who attended the news conference said
they may be forced to cancel tours because time is running out.
	   Some of the tour operators even admitted they have considered
using the black market to acquire missing tickets.
	   ``I can't believe this,'' said Shigeki Murayama, managing
director of Nippon Travel Agency Co. ``We have organized many tours
in the past for variety of sports events, including Olympics, but a
problem like this has never happened.''
	   The tour agents have already paid ticket fees to the World Cup's
official organizing agents, and they had been ordered through
authorized vendors, Murayama said.
	   The tickets had been promised by mid-May, he said.
	   While apologizing to their customers, tour agency officials
placed the blame squarely with the French World Cup organizers.
	   ``Delay in ticketing by the World Cup organizers has caused the
trouble,'' said Tsutomu Igarashi of Japan Travel Bureau.
	   It was not immediately clear whether it was only Japanese tour
groups that were having the ticket problem.
	   Earlier in the day, JATA protested to the French department of
tourism, as well as the French Embassy in Tokyo, demanding an
investigation and explanation of what was causing the delay.
	   JATA's Ishiyama said the association is currently conducting a
survey of Japanese travel agencies who are organizing World Cup
tours, and will also send a written protest to the World Cup
organizers.
	   Japanese tour agents said they have not received a clear
explanation or apology from the event's officials.
	   Tour agency officials declined to disclose how many tickets had
been delivered for Japan's two remaining first round games.
	   But they said canceling tours for the first game alone would
cost them an enormous amount, especially for those who are flying
chartered flights to Paris.
	   The Japanese team, making its first ever World Cup finals debut
in the nation's soccer history, will play against Argentina on
Sunday in Toulouse, Croatia on June 20 in Nantes and Jamaica on
June 26 in Lyons.

	   A total of 983 illegal immigrants were arrested by the 32nd
Battalion of the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) from different border
points during the last five months. A total of 234 eases were also

World Cup: Key midfielder Choi injures ankle, further damages South
</HEADLINE>
Korean bid &QL;

 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ South Korea's campaign to win its first match in
five World Cup appearances has suffered yet another blow as one of
its key midfielders, Choi Sung-yong, injured his ankle. He may have
to miss the team's first match against Mexico this week.
	   It is the second blow in less than a week for the South Korean
squad, which saw its star striker Hwang Sun-hong hurt his left knee
last Thursday during a 1-1 draw with China.
	   Hwang will not play in the team's opening match against Mexico
on June 13 in Lyon, and it is unlikely Choi will either, team coach
Cha Bum-kun said after a training session Wednesday.
	   ``We have two injured players now,'' said Cha. ``Choi's ankle
will probably keep him out of the first match, it is difficult to
say. Maybe he can play the second game.''
	   Choi, who twisted his right ankle in Tuesday's closed training
session, was forced to miss Wednesday's practice, instead doing
fitness training in a nearby gym. Hwang, however, was present on
the field, doing stretching exercises and jogging lightly around
the field.
	   Though the team's line-up has taken a few punches, Cha refuses
to let the situation dampen the team's spirit.
	   ``We are missing two players right now but the rest of the
team's condition is improving,'' said Cha, a former international
who led South Korea to the World Cup in Mexico in 1986. ``So there
is no problem right now.''
	   ``The team is at 80 percent of its top condition and after this
afternoon and tomorrow's training it should be at about 95 percent
of its top form,'' Cha said.
	   Though the South Koreans usually play in 4-4-2 configuration,
the absence of Hwang will probably force Cha to go for a 3-6-1
setup. He used that formation with relative success in a 2-1 loss
to Brazil in a friendly last August and its 2-1 qualifying victory
over Japan in Tokyo last September.
	   Cha will likely play South Korea's top-scorer Choi Yong-su up
front and place heavy emphasis on the midfield in an effort to
strangle opposition attacks. The team's only hope of scoring in
such a case would be on a break.

Report: Turkish police storm pro-Kurdish paper, censor edition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Police seized hundreds of copies of a
pro-Kurdish newspaper for printing statements by a Kurdish rebel
leader, the paper said Wednesday.
	   Istanbul-based Ulkede Gundem was censored late Monday night
after printing a report in which rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan
called on village guards to stop fighting.
	   About 90,000 village guards have been recruited by the
government to fight Kurdish rebels in the southeast.
	   A later edition was distributed without the report on Tuesday.
	   In Wednesday's edition, the paper said it was seriously
concerned by increasing state pressure on the daily's editorial
policy.
	   Prosecutors were not available for comment.
	   The police often confiscate copies of the paper on charges of
separatist propaganda. Last month, an appeals court imposed a
10-day ban on the daily for publishing an article advocating
Kurdish separatism.
	   Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party has been waging a guerrilla war
for autonomy in Turkey's southeast since 1984. The war has claimed
some 37,000 lives.

	   Heatwave that has been sweeping through the divisional town and
its adjoining areas for the last one week has made the life of the
people miserable. Local meteorological office sources said, the
highest temperature recorded in Rajshahi was 40.1 degrees Celsius
on Monday while the lowest was 29.5 degrees. During the past week
the highest and the lowest temperature were 38 degrees and 29
degrees on an average respectively.
	   The difference between the highest and the lowest temperature
being minimum, the people are suffering from persistent heatwave.
The heatwave has caused a number of problems for the people
including profuse sweating and turning the colour of urine yellow .
Aged people and children are the worst sufferers. Blisters have
been noticed on the bodies of school children. Most of the schools
have withdrawn their ``follow in parade'' due to sizzling heat. At
least 25 people have been reported to be killed in heat-related
complications in the district during the last seven days.
	   Rajshahi Medical College Hospital sources said, the patients
with high pressure, diarrhoea, influenza and tonsilitis are being
admitted in increasing numbers in the hospital. The roads of the
city turn deserted after 12 noon. The businessmen of the city are
almost sitting idle in their shops in absence of customers . Due to
broiling heat people do not come out of their homes to buy things
of their choice except in emergency cases.
	   On the other hand frequent power disruption has added to the
suffering of the people . Supply of water in the city areas has
also disrupted due to sweltering heat and loadshedding. In many
parts of the city the hand-driven tubewells have become inoperative
due to sharp fall in the level of underground water intensifying
the suffering of the city people.

	   More than 100 feet area of the T-head of Sailabari groyne in
sadar thana has been washed away by strong currents of the river
Jamuna causing loss amounting to Tk. three crore on Sunday night .
It is learnt that the T-head of Sailabari groyen had been
threatened by erosion for the last two years but the local
authorities of the Water Development Board (WDB) did not take any
step to protect the groyen which played a vital role in arresting
erosion at the area.
	   With the sharp rise in the water level of the Jamuna, strong
currents caused by onrush of the northern hilly waters hit the
T-head of the groyen and on Monday night about 100 feet area of the
T-head was washed away creating 50 feet depth at the area. Timely
steps to protect the groyen might have cost hardly Tk 10 to Tk 12
lakh , but due to collapsing the T-head about Tk three crore will
be needed to reconstruct the same. The WDB authorities have started
dumping of cement concrete blocks and boulders at the affected area
with little result due to maximum depth of water in the Jamuna.

Former TV executive named new Australian envoy to Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A former television executive has been
named Australia's new ambassador to Vietnam, the Australian Foreign
Ministry said Wednesday.
	   Michael Mann will replace Susan Boyd, who took up her posting as
Australia's envoy to Vietnam in October 1994. Boyd, who earned a
reputation for being outspoken and witty, will be posted to Hong
Kong.
	   Mann worked from 1994-1997 as chief executive of Australia
Television under the state-owned Australian Broadcasting
Corporation, and continued in that position after the network was
taken over by Channel Seven.
	   Before his broadcast work, he served as a diplomat in Osaka,
Phnom Penh, Rome, Beijing and Bali, having joined what was then
called the Department of External Affairs in 1966.
	   In February 1998 he resumed his diplomatic career by rejoining
what is now called the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
	   His appointment coincides with the 25th anniversary of the start
of bilateral relations between Australia and Vietnam. Australia is
the 12th largest foreign investor in Vietnam, with projects valued
at dlrs 800 million.
	   Bilateral trade in 1997 amounted to dlrs 823 million, up from
less than dlrs 2 million in 1982.

	   CHINA'S central bank governor yesterday warned the current
weakness of the Japanese yen was severely hurting the mainland's
external trade, but pledged to keep the renminbi stable.
	   ``The depreciation of the Japanese yen is having a very negative
impact on Chinese imports and exports and the utilisation of
foreign capital,'' People's Bank of China (PBOC) governor Dai
Xianglong said. ``The depreciation of the yen will also cause more
pressure on China's economic structural reforms and adjustments.''
The US dollar briefly climbed above 141 yen for the first time in
seven years before easing in late trade.
	   Mr Dai urged the Japanese government to take stronger measures
to stem the drop of the yen and prevent further regional
instability.
	   ``I believe the depreciation of the Japanese yen is not
conducive to the stability of the East Asian countries. It has also
exerted pressure on China. However, the exchange rate of the yuan
will continue to be stable,'' he said.
	   On Monday, currency dealers warned that the drop in the yen had
put more pressure on the yuan in ``grey-market'' forward trading.
Economists said the falling yen could have wide-ranging
repercussions for the mainland economy.
	   Wang Zhen-quan, an economist with a Hong Kong research
institute, said the falling yen would hurt the mainland's export
trade and cut direct foreign investment into the country.
	   About 60 per cent of mainland exports in Asia go to Japan.
	   However, DBS Securities economist S W Chu did not think the
weakening yen would cause immediate pressure on the yuan.
	   ``China's central bank is cash-rich and it can intervene in the
market if necessary,'' he said.

Jewish group honors German president for reconciliation efforts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany's Jewish community awarded President Roman
Herzog the Leo Baeck Prize Wednesday for his efforts in building
understanding among Germans, Jews and other groups.
	   Ignatz Bubis, chairman of Germany's Central Council of Jews,
which awards the prize, said Herzog had taken every possibility in
speeches to note Nazi atrocities so that they are not forgotten.
	   Bubis cited Herzog's ``deeply humanitarian convictions'' and
said the president has made clear how ``strongly he has taken to
heart the coexistence of different cultures and religions.''
	   Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski, who attended the Berlin
award ceremony, lauded Herzog for ``breaking the last ice'' in
reconciliation with Poland when he asked the Polish people for
forgiveness during 50th anniversary ceremonies marking the Warsaw
uprising against the Nazis in 1994.
	   Herzog said Germany had suffered a terrible loss when it tried
to wipe out Jewish culture during the Nazi period. He also called
for more tolerance in Germany today, especially toward foreigners,
and welcomed a revival in Germany's Jewish community.
	   ``Openness for a better future should rule our thoughts and
dealings, not defending against supposed foreigners or unknowns,''
he said.
	   The Leo Baeck prize is named after the rabbi of the same name
who was the top Jewish representative in Germany during the Nazi
era. It has been awarded annually since his death in 1956 to people
who helped build warmer relations between Germans and Jews.
	   Baeck was deported to the Nazi concentration camp Theresienstadt
in what is now the Czech Republic in 1943. He survived the ordeal,
lived in London after the war and taught for a while at the Hebrew
Union College in Cincinnati, Ohio, while working to restore
understanding between the Jews and Germans.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hard-line lawmakers on Wednesday demanded
the impeachment of Iran's liberal interior minister, accusing him
of jeopardizing the Islamic nation's stability.
	   The impeachment motion was the latest attack by conservative
members of Iran's ruling clergy on officials loyal to reformist
President Mohammad Khatami, who took power last August.
	   Thirty-one members of Iran's Majlis, or parliament, signed the
motion urging that Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri be impeached
for, among other things, allowing a rally last month to protest the
influence of the hard-line clergy in Iran.
	   After Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri read out the motion, Khatami
rose to his minister's defense, calling him ``our capable brother,
an outstanding personality of the revolution and the system.''
	   The motion accuses Nouri of ``creating tension in the society,
making provocative interviews and speeches in different provinces
and appointing inexperienced people to managerial posts at the
ministry.'''
	   His ``continuation in the post is detrimental to tranquility and
stability in the country,'' the lawmakers said, according to the
official Islamic Republic News Agency.
	   In the past few weeks, hard-liners have described Nouri as
incompetent and called for his resignation.
	   In the letter, the deputies protested the minister's open
support for Tehran Mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi, who was arrested
in April on corruption charges.
	   Nouri has 10 days to appear before Parliament, where hard-liners
hold a slight majority, and respond to the accusations in the
impeachment motion, which will then be put to the 270-member body
for a vote.
	   Khatami's landslide victory in May 1997 shook the foundations of
Iran's clerical rule and was considered a triumph for civil
liberties in this Islamic republic.
	   Khatami still struggles, however, with hard-line opponents who
accuse him of betraying the 1979 Islamic revolution led by the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
	   Ali Khamenei, who succeeded Khomeini, remains Iran's powerful
spiritual leader.

Kickoff nears for France '98
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Wednesday's developments: arrests, Air France
strike settled, Ravanelli dropped; TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By BRIAN TRUSDELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ It's easy to tell the opening kickoff of the World
Cup is getting closer _ the tone is getting more desperate.
	   ``We must go for the throat,'' Scotland's Gordon Durie said
Tuesday.
	   The 33-year-old striker and his teammates was expecting the
world to watch when Scotland takes the field against four-time and
defending champion Brazil in Wednesday's opening match of France
'98.
	   ``If we sit in and try and defend, they have players who can
destroy you,'' Durie said.
	   On the final day before the opener, World Cup activities
officially got underway Tuesday with a parade of four 18-meter
(60-foot) mechanical giants and 4,500 costumed extras through the
middle of Paris.
	   The Champs Elysees was awash with Brazilians in yellow,
Argentines in sky blue and Scots in all kinds of tartan kilts.
	   But the celebration was marred by clashes between drunken soccer
fans, Parisian youths and riot police. Thirty-four policemen were
injured, including one who was in critical condition after being
hit in the head with a beer bottle.
	   About 15 people _ including two Scots _ were arrested in the
unrest, during which police used tear gas to disperse drunken
soccer fans and apparently also Parisian youths who threw bottles
and tried to knock down a phalanx of policemen, using a steel
barrier as a battering ram.
	   There was better news Wednesday morning when Air France and its
pilots resolved a 10-day strike that had severely embarrassed the
country in the days leading up to the World Cup.
	   The company called for an immediate return to work. But the
airline has said it could take three days for service to return to
normal once the strike ended.
	   On Tuesday, the FIFA presidential election lingered a day more
than expected with Sepp Blatter, the winner, ``categorically''
denying rumors and reports that he bought the election.
	   ``Mr. Blatter vehemently refuted the allegations and said he
would investigate the source of such malicious reports,'' he said
through a FIFA release. ``He stressed that he reserved the right to
take legal action against those seeking to defame him.''
	   Rumors apparently were fed by a story in the International
Herald Tribune on Tuesday which quoted Johansson, the president of
UEFA, possibly indicating that Monday's vote wasn't fair.
	   ``Something happened somewhere,'' Johansson was quoted as
saying. ``I had so many promises of votes that I am, to put it
mildly, surprised and disappointed to be beaten so
comprehensively.''
	   Meanwhile, Brazil and Scotland, along with Morocco and Norway,
who were to play Wednesday night in the tournament's second match,
made final preparations for their debuts.
	   ``We must understand this moment,'' Brazilian midfielder
Leonardo said. ``I want to make history.''
	   Scotland was the team in position to create shockwaves, having
never advanced past the first round in eight trips to the finals
and won only four of 20 matches.
	   ``We have to lift ourselves to another level and show we can
compete against Brazil,'' said midfielder John Collins, who will
earn his 50th cap when the match kicks off at 5:30 p.m. (1530 GMT).
``We will need a superb performance that night as well as in the
other two games if we are to progress.''
	   The second Group A match of the day was a much-lower profile
affair, featuring two teams that both were bounced from the United
States after the first round in 1994.
	   However, the match was considered anything but a game between
equals.
	   Norway went into the match unbeaten in its last 14 games and
having outscored its last three opponents by a combined scored of
13-2. The ``Drillos'' are being picked by most experts to be the
second team that advances out of Group A with Brazil.
	   Morocco, conversely, will be a major surprise if it gets past
the first round.
	   It struggled to a 1-1 draw in its final prep match against Chile
on Thursday, allowing the equalizer in the 90th minute on a header
by Marcelo Salas.
	   Elsewhere, other teams still fretted about injuries.
	   Nigeria, Italy, the Netherlands and Germany all dealt with
various infirmities.
	   The Africans learned that starting defender Jero Shakpoke had
broken his collarbone and would be out for the tournament, and
forward Daniel Amokachi was felled by a twisted right knee.
	   Amokachi hurt himself about an hour into Tuesday's training
session when his foot got caught in the damp turf as he attempted a
shot. An assistant team trainer said it would Wednesday before the
extent of the injury was known.
	   Italy seemed to have good word on Alessandro Del Piero and
Moreno Torricelli on Tuesday, but Fabrizio Ravanelli, suffering
from an infection in his right lung, was dropped from the team
Wednesday and was due to be replaced by Parma forward Enrico
Chiesa.
	   Dutch captain Ronald de Boer twisted his left ankle in training
Monday and didn't practice Tuesday. His status for the Netherlands'
opening World Cup Group E match Saturday against Belgium in St.
Denis was still to be determined.
	   And in the German camp, midfielder Christian Ziege missed his
third day of training with a fever and defender Thomas Helmer sat
out a second day with a thigh injury.

	   ELECTRONIC products maker Tonic Industries Holdings expects 10
per cent growth for 1998 despite the economic crisis.
	   Executive director Au Wai-man yesterday said total orders
received this year are expected to see a 40-50 per cent increase,
thanks to the rising popularity of portable compact discs (CDs) and
related products.
	   The substantial increase in orders has been boosted by
favourable conditions in the US market as well as increased demand
from Europe.
	   ``With the popularity of portable CDs and mini- disc products,
product prices are expected to see a 5 per cent drop in general
this year compared to last year,'' Mr Au said.
	   Tonic's new mini-disc products will begin production and be
launched later this year.
	   The ``MD mini HiFi'' systems will be sold at US$150 (HK$1170) to
US$200 and account for less than 10 per cent of total turnover.
	   Profit margin will be maintained at 20 per cent.
	   The effect of the plunge of the yen on the company is still
unclear and will be seen in the next month or two, he said.

World Cup: Spanish veteran Zubi says he may not be finished yet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHANTILLY, Spain (AP) _ Just three weeks after his retirement
was announced, 36-year-old Spanish keeper Andoni Zubizarreta
surprised many Wednesday by saying he may not be finished yet.
	   ``I said I was finished with Valencia and the Spanish league,
but nothing else,'' said Zubizarreta at the Spanish team base north
of Paris. ``Who can talk about retirement when you're just about to
take part in a World Cup?''
	   On May 16, the media in Spain took Zubizarreta's comments that
``his batteries were running out'' and that he had played his final
league game to be the confirmation of months of rumors that the
veteran keeper was hanging up his boots.
	   ``Playing all your life, who wouldn't want to continue
playing,'' he said, adding with a smile: ``Working is the difficult
part.''
	   ``Right now I have absolutely no offers, besides to stay on at
Valencia or work for the (Spanish) federation,'' the Basque keeper
said. ``You never know what happens in life. I never close the
door. What I'll do after July 12, the truth is I don't know.''
	   Zubizarreta has been Spanish coach Javier Clemente's preferred
keeper since he took over the team in 1992. A fellow Basque,
Clemente has regularly had to fend off criticisms that Zubizarreta
was finished.
	   ``Zubi is number one. He works a lot harder than many younger
players,'' Clemente said of him prior to coming to France. ``It's
about time Spaniards were appreciated in the same way as foreign
stars are.''
	   Zubizarreta has 124 caps for Spain and has allowed in 96 goals
since he first appeared for the side in 1985.
	   In domestic league play he has manned the posts for 622 first
division games with Athletic de Bilbao, FC Barcelona and, most
recently, Valencia.
	   Asked how he felt about playing a fourth World Cup, he said:
``More excited because you know what's to be won.''

Eritrea seeks African help to end conflict with Ethiopia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Eritrea wants mediation by Egypt and other
African nations to end its territorial dispute with Ethiopia that
has turned into war, an Eritrean envoy said Wednesday.
	   ``Both Eritrea and Ethiopia have good relations with Egypt,''
which should facilitate Egyptian mediation between the two
neighbors, Abdullah Mahmoud Jaber, an adviser to Eritrean President
Isaias Afwerki, told reporters.
	   He earlier met with President Hosni Mubarak, and said the
Egyptian leader promised to ``play his role to prevent the African
Horn region from exploding.''
	   The dispute between Eritrea and Ethiopia is over a swath of land
that both claim.
	   Border skirmishes broke out on May 6 when Ethiopia accused
Eritrea of incursions. Ethiopian warplanes bombed an Eritrean
military airport in the capital, Asmara, on Friday and Saturday,
touching off serious hostilities.
	   Rwandan and U.S. mediators have proposed a peace plan that
Ethiopia has accepted. Eritrea says it the proposal is too sketchy.

Dozens end protest outside U.S. Embassy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ More than a dozen members of a
self-proclaimed ``pro reform'' group ended a protest Wednesday in
front of the U.S. Embassy after being persuaded to leave by
security personnel.
	   The demonstrators left in the evening after a five hour protest
to demand Washington speed up a dlrs 43 billion bailout plan by the
International Monetary Fund.
	   ``Where is your promise IMF'' and ``We care about people, not
about politics'' read banners displayed in the peaceful protest.
	   Wednesday's protest was the latest in a series outside the
embassy since last week.
	   Early in the day, Hubert Neiss, top IMF's official in Asia,
arrived in Jakarta to conduct a thorough review of the IMF-led
bailout for Indonesia.

	   Seventeen years ago V.S. Naipaul undertook a journey through
Indonesia, lran, Pakistan and Malaysia, which formed the basis of
perhaps his most significant travel book, among the believers .
Much has happened in these lands since then, politically and
economically, including the bloodbath of the Iran-Iraq War. All
this tempted Naipaul back for a second set of journeys (from
1995-1997) of which his latest book, Beyond Belief: Islamic
Excursions Among the Converted Peoples, is the fruit. Back in 1971
Naipaul had said, ``When I speak about being an exile or a refugee
l'm not just using a metaphor, l'm speaking literally''.
	   In that year he had lived in Wiltshire, the West lndies, South
America, and New Zealand. I met him on a flight from Rome to
Bombay, a journey that produced his second book on India -- India:
A Million Mutinies Now. When one considers his movements over the
past 48 years after he left Port- of- Spain in 1950, his life has
been a series of onward bookings-- or, speaking literally and
figuratively, flights. Vidiadhar Surajprasad Naipaul was born in
the country town of Chaguanas in Trinidad in 1932, of a family
originating in Uttar Pradesh in India. At the age of seven he was
taken to Port-of-Spain to live, and there he received his early
education. One guesses that his upbringing was very similar to
Anand's (Biswas's son ) in A House for Mr. Biswas.
	   ln 1950 he joined University College, Oxford . Naipaul's first
novel was The Mystic Masseur published in 1957, at his age of 25.
Then one of his masterpieces A House for Mr. Biswas, at the age of
29. Mr. Stone at 30, An Area of Darkness at 32, The Mimic Men at
35. The Times described him as `` the youngest of the W.H. Smith
Award winners, and a quarter of a century light of the average.''
If Naipaul had a country he would have made a useful diplomat for
difficult postings . He has travelled to the interiors of India and
Africa and South America, and crossed North America; he has
reported on them. And he has travelled the Islamic world resulting
in two of his books.
	   He speaks French well and Spanish, though his Hindi is tentative
as I found on the flight to Bombay.He has had more home addresses
than any author that I know of. Once Naipaul had a house in
Stockwell. It was in a poor condition when he bought it, but he
renovated and redecorated it. Then he went to Africa. less than two
years after returning from Africa he sold the house, moved into a
hotel, then into a friend's house, and finally went to California.
It makes moving for him something like the colonial ideal on a
small scale, setting a place on its feet and then withdrawing from
it. The Srinagar Hotel Liward where Naipaul was a guest (he gives
it a chapter of An Area of Darkness), actually improves with his
residence, as he puts idling employees to work, reminding them of
their duties, encouraging them in their skills.
	   I find that it is as a travel writer that Naipaul performs best,
though his A House for Mr. Biswas was really a masterpiece. His
eye, attentive for the smallest detail, can give an apparently
common landscape or unremarkable physique many features. Hence his
books dealing in or originating from his travels are such
remarkably good reads. A few years ago, Naipaul made a statement --
much ridiculed at the time--to the effect that the novel had died
as a viable literary form, and that the future lay with non-fiction
narrative. To an extent, his latest book Beyond Belief vindicates
that claim of his . The designation Writer in his passport ( a
British passport but no more an indicator of his nationality than
Joseph Conrad's was) describes him perfectly . He has never been
anything but a writer.
	   As he says: `` I have never had to work for hire; I made a vow
at an early age never to wotk, never to become involved in people
in that way. That has given me a freedom from people, from
entanglements, from rivalries, from competition . I have no
enemies, no rivals, no masters ; I fear no one.'' I wish many of us
could say the same.

	   A MISSION from the influential Hong Kong General Chamber of
Commerce will leave today for a three-day visit to Beijing to
assess mainland economic policies that could affect the SAR.
	   The chamber was also considering whether to lobby for controls
on wage increases and rents to boost Hong Kong's competitiveness.
	   And it wants bank to reduce the interest rate to help Hong
Kong's small and medium-sized enterprises.
	   The Beijing mission, which is being led by chairman Peter Sutch,
is the chamber's first since last year's change of sovereignty.
	   ``We want to hear from senior officials China's economic
policies as they affect Hong Kong,'' said chamber director Eden
Woon.
	   C C Tung, brother of Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa,
will be one of the delegation's two deputy leaders.
	   Addressing the Lions Club of Tai Ping Shan yesterday, Mr Woon
said Hong Kong was going through a period of adjustment as a result
of the crisis. That warranted controls on wages and rents, he said.
	   Mr Woon said some international firms were reconsidering setting
up headquarters in Hong Kong because of the drop in property
prices.
	   The chamber is also backing the Hong Kong dollar peg to the US
currency, believing it would stabilise the economy and give foreign
investors confidence.
	   Mr Woon also said that the chamber expected the US Congress to
renew the mainland's most-favoured nation status, which was
important for the local economy.

World Cup fever rises in Britain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Even before a ball was kicked Wednesday, the World
Cup was the undisputed No. 1 item on just about every British
agenda from the House of Commons in London to the Loch Ness Pub _
in Brazil.
	   With the World Cup expected to be telecast to 37 billion viewers
over the next month, Britain is clearly gripped with soccer ever.
	   The morning's front-page headlines were dominated by reports of
a riot on the Champs Elysees and a brawl between one-time England
World Cup hopeful Stan Collymore and celebrity girlfriend Ulrika
Jonsson in a Scottish pub in Paris.
	   The opening World Cup match later in the day between Scotoland
and Brazil also took precedence over matters of state in the
Commons.
	   Prime Minster Tony Blair told the chamber he hoped to ``keep an
eye on'' the game.
	   ``I'm sure the whole House joins me in wishing the Scottish and
English teams the best of luck in the World Cup,'' he said to
cheers from members of both parties.
	   The World Cup won an early mention in the Commons as Labor MP
Jim Fitzpatrick managed to squeeze a good luck message for Scotland
into a debate on housing reform.
	   His good cheer prompted a politically incorrect retort by his
colleague, Karen Buck, who suggested that all men in politics would
have only one thing on their minds for the next month.
	   Scots living in London, wearing the blue Scotland football
shirts and draped in national flags, started booking their places
early at the bars and ordering drinks in time for the kick-off.
	   Meanwhile, exiled Scots in Brazil gathered at Rio de Janeiro's
own Loch Ness pub for the long-awaited opening game.
	   The kilt-clad fans felt at home among familiar surroundings of
draped Scottish flags, posters and blue and white soccer balls.
Chef Walbercy Valentim said the menu would include some traditional
fare but definitely no haggis.
	   Back in Britain, even the Salvation Army's newspaper, The War
Cry, got in on the World Cup act, producing the front page headline
``Hod's Squad'' _ referring to England coach Glenn Hoddle's side.
	   The back page remained soccer free but the front page was
devoted to the England team, likening the squad to the final 12
apostles chosen by Jesus.
	   The War Cry editor Captain Charles King said every week he
focused on whatever people were talking about and clearly this week
it was the World Cup.
	   In Glasgow, the World Cup caused a mass exodus from work places
as hordes of people converged on the city center before kick-off.
Others made straight for the nearest pubs to claim a vantage point
in front of TV screens beaming the game from Paris.
	   Chancellor Gordon Brown, a Scotsman, ensured the government was
represented officially at the game, travelling at his own expense
to take advantage of a ticket offered by French Finance Minister
Dominique Strauss-Kahn.
	   Brown joked that Ms. Strauss-Kahn had threatened to hand the
ticket to Brazil's Finance Minister if he did not take it up.
	   Soccer fans who were stuck at Heathrow Airport, away from a more
preferred viewing venue, got a sneak glimpse of the World Cup and
the future of television.
	   In the first public demonstration of digital TV, passengers were
able to watch the tournament kick-off on special wide-screen
televisions at the airport.
	   However, not everybody was happy about the British public's
obsession with the World Cup.
	   Leading economist Maurice Fitzpatrick, of accountancy firm
Chantrey Vellacott, said businesses stood to lose out this month
because of workers leaving their posts to watch soccer.
	   He estimated the World Cup could cost bosses more than 1 billion
pounds (dlrs 1.64 billion), as the economy sacrificed one-third of
day's output over the month.
	   Fitzpatrick said that figure could increase drastically if
England and Scotland go through to the second round.
	   The music industry was also caught up in a World Cup it can't
ignore.
	   World Cup songs could score a hat-trick at the top of the charts
in Europe _ and Three Lions '98 is leading the field.
	   The Baddiel, Skinner and Lightning Seeds song sold 98,000 copies
during the first two days of sales, 20,000 more than its closest
rival Vindaloo by Fat Les.
	   And predictions are that Dario G's Carnaval De Paris _ based on
a European terrace chant _ will enter the charts at No. 3 on
Sunday.

British cattle farmers relieved `mad cow' nightmare may be ending
</HEADLINE>

prices, EDITS to tighten &QL; 
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ After two years of devastation that seemed like a
bad dream, British cattlemen finally got word Wednesday that the
``mad cow'' nightmare could be ending.
	   From livestock auctions to cattle farms, Britain's beef industry
cautiously applauded the announcement that European regulators want
to lift an export ban.
	   But the ban wasn't immediately repealed, and the optimism in
Britain's cattle country was tempered by recognition that the
battered market has no chance of bouncing back instantly.
	   ``There's no real reason to throw your hat in the air,'' said
Paul Gentry, who auctions cattle in Newark, about 120 miles (192
miles) north of London. ``This is good news, but whether it
materializes, your guess is as good as mine.''
	   Prices for live cattle at Gentry's lot are as much as 50 percent
lower than before the European Union banned all exports of British
beef.
	   A likely end to the ban improved the mood among farmers selling
livestock at Gentry's auction on Wednesday morning, but did nothing
for prices.
	   ``You can't believe it's gone on so long and cost so much
money,'' Gentry said.
	   Still, the prospect of an end to the crisis was just what
everybody in the industry has been waiting for.
	   ``It'll take the gloom out of the market,'' said David Williams,
who runs the Williams Wholesale slaughterhouse in tiny Woebley,
western England. ``It'll be a great morale booster for the whole
industry.''
	   Williams' wife, Sheila, alluded to more blows that the beef
dealers have suffered _ including the Labor government's ban of all
beef on the bone in Britain, based on the minuscule possibility
that T-bones or prime rib could give humans the incurable brain
ailment caused by the mad cows.
	   ``Is that bone-in, or bone-out?'' Mrs. Williams asked as the
European Commission recommended that British farmers be allowed to
export beef and most products from animals older than six months
and younger than 30 months.
	   Actually, the bones will have to be out.
	   The British farmers have bitterly complained that they make some
of the world's best beef but have seen the product unfairly
tarnished by British government bumbling and European politics.
Some consumers remain scared to eat British beef, and many
restaurants in Britain advertise non-British beef on their menus.
	   The crisis exploded in March 1996 when Britain acknowledged a
link between cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE,
and the fatal human brain ailment Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.
	   European Union veterinary experts still must study Wednesday's
recommendation on lifting the export ban, and it could be put to a
vote of agriculture commissioners from the 15 EU nations.
	   ``We've now turned the corner and we're in the home straight,''
said Ben Gill, president of the National Farmers Union. ``The
momentum must not be lost. We are confident that the huge weight
which has burdened the farming community for more than two years
will soon be removed.''

	   The glorious history of Mainamati is the pride of the nation. A
nation is known not only by its present activities but its previous
achievements dignify its identity. All the archaeological
discoveries of our country occurred in the present century. The
excavations expose the ruins of Mahasthan, Paharpur and Mainamati.
Our knowledge of the works of Jnan Atish Dipankar, one of the great
preachers of Buddhism throughout the whole of South East Asia or of
Mahasthabir Shilbhadra, one of the greatest scholars of his time
and Acharya (head) of Nalanda Viswavidyalaya, have been possible
only due the large-scale excavations. Mainamati of Comilla is
famous for Buddhist cultural heritage. The culmination of Buddhist
civilisation that took place from eighth century to the 12th
century occurred here. But evidence of this was hidden under earth
till the Second World War.
	   During the war, the existence of this civilization was first
noticed. Some five miles away from Comilla town, Shalban Vihar and
other fragments of the culture are found. The name Shalban' was
derived from the name of a nearby village Shalbanpur. The large
Vihar, 550ft. X 550ft. in area has a wall of 16.5ft. A total of 115
rooms having an area of 12ft. X 12ft. each have been identified
which are set surrounding the whole area.Everyday thousands of
visitors come to Mainamati to have a glimpse of the past. They
wander here and there destroying the brick-pieces. This may lead to
the quick destruction of the excavated sites. Couldn't we impose
any restriction on roaming of the visitors? No one, except the
staff and historians who will be allowed there with prior
permission, should have the right to walk on the brick-made places.
All walking should be on the ground only.
	   If possible, an over-bridge over the hall-room can be set up so
that the visitors can have a glance from above. This sorry state of
affairs is not only at the Shalban Vihar. Since we are failing to
protect these historical ruins, it would have possibly been
betterif we had not excavatedthem.

	   CHIEF Secretary for Administration Anson Chan yesterday warned
the non-renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading
status with the United States would undermine the SAR's capability
to act as a ``fire wall'' to prevent the Asian financial crisis
from spreading globally.
	   Mrs Chan made the remark in the annual dinner of the Hong Kong
Trade Development Council at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York.
	   She said Hong Kong would suffer if the MFN status was revoked.
``There would be a loss of income up to US$4.5 billion (HK$35
billion) and around 61,000 to 87,000 jobs. This would not only deal
a devastating blow to business confidence in Hong Kong when we are
grappling with the fallout from the regional turmoil.
	   ``It would also undermine our ability to continue to play the
role of a fire wall in the Asian financial crisis.'' She pointed
out that continued US investment and trade in the region were of
utmost importance to the revitalisation of the hard-hit Asian
economies.
	   ``We strongly believe that a successful Hong Kong will
contribute to the success of China.
	   ``A successful China will contribute to the success of Asia. And
a successful Asia, fortified by the lessons learned from recent
adversity, will resume its role as a catalyst for growth of the
global economy.'' Despite the current difficulties, she believed
Hong Kong's economic prospects for the longer term remain good.
	   ``This is underpinned in particular by sustained high economic
growth and further reform and opening up in the mainland of China
and, of course, the continued buoyancy of the US economy.'' She
added a soft landing of property prices and rentals will help
contain the cost of doing business in Hong Kong and improve the
SAR's competitiveness.

	   Peace, joy, happiness, calm joviality and serenity are the
effect one experiences in the desert of this mechanised world, when
one looks at the rich array of 41 paintings of Shahla Vinita Karim,
put on show at the city's Drik Gallery from 4 June to 10 June.
These works of oil and mixed media done within only five months
with strenuous effort have become the second solo of the artist in
Bangladesh - the first one being in 1995 at the La Galerie. At the
previous exhibition in Bangladesh, Vinita put only water-colour
paintings.Born in Yangon, Myanmar, the artist moved from place to
place, country to country for the sake of her life and art. She had
her education in Fine Arts Studies at Gerlesborg Art School, at
Stockholm, Sweeden in 1981 and joined two art workshops - the first
one under guidance of SOLANKI, International Women's Association'
in Chennai, India in 1996 and the second one under Shahabuddin
Ahmed at Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy this year.
	   Besides the two in Bangladesh, she had five more solo
exhibitions in Switzerland. She also participated in four group
exhibitions.Presently a free-lance artist, Vinita has also many
private and institutional collections in Dhaka and Chittagong in
Bangladesh; in Nuremberg and Munich in Germany; Stolkholm and
Gothenberg in Sweden; Colorado, Los Angeles and Detroit in the USA;
Berne, Murten, Geneva and Zurich in Switzerland; and Delhi, Chennai
and Mumbai in India.An artist expresses his or her self through
images - whatever be the medium he or she works in - words, sounds
or colours, and the world is so full of objects. Choosing the right
objects, interpreting them and putting them into harmonious ways to
express his or her thoughts and feelings make one artist superior
to another. Vinita can choose objects, manipulate them in a
masterly way with her brush using strong colours of her choice
until a thought-provoking and finished work is produced.
	   Take, for example, her Quest For An Arcadia where she lodges
herself in a jovial yet serene mood with rich and vibrant colours,
but very subtle and gentle in expression of abstract and
semi-abstract figures, to live in a world of Arcadian fantasy from
this strife-torn cruel world. She finds peace and happiness in her
works - in the objects she chooses, in the atmosphere she creates,
not like an escapist but as her spontaneous and genial self finds
her true abode there.Boat as a symbol of journey predominantly
recurs in a number of her works. Drawing a composition, to Vinita,
is like a journey into the inner self. ``Painting objective and
abstract compositions is more like a continuous dialogue with her
own inner self - it is the mood, the feeling that ultimately
decides the shape of her composition; but the effects are
nevertheless equally thought provoking,'' says Syed Monzoorul Islam
about the process of making of Vinita's art.''Life is a mystery and
a journey,'' she remarked.
	   The boat symbol thus appears to be very apt as far journey
through this mysterious life and exploration of her true self on
the canvas are concerned. She has an Infinite Attraction for life,
for its Radiant Beauty, for its Rhythmic Movement, for its Golden
Harvest - she enjoys all the positives life can offer. She is not a
blind but a true optimist.Vinita also celebrates nature - water,
birds, flowers, plants, sunshine, moonlight, etc. ``Nature is the
source of everything, she is the kind mother earth for all,'' she
said. Interplay of light and darkness and the mysterious night
appear to her with meanings. Her objective work Nocturnal Verses
with a full-blown lily and a bud growing from the core of the night
and abstract ones Nocturnal Mystery - 1, 2 suggestive of riddles
and mysteries involved with night are among the many works that
speak of her calm and cool seeing eyes.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli prosecutor argued Wednesday that it
would be ``cynical exploitation'' of Israel's citizenship laws to
allow a U.S. teen-ager charged in a grisly murder in Maryland to
take refuge from American justice by claiming Israeli citizenship.
	   The prosecution wrapped up its case in favor of extraditing
17-year-old Samuel Sheinbein on Wednesday; the defense is scheduled
to present its final arguments in Jerusalem District Court on July
9. No date has been set for a decision.
	   Sheinbein is charged in Montgomery County, Maryland, with
killing 19-year-old Alfred Tello Jr. last September. He fled to
Israel after the murder and is claiming Israeli citizenship in an
attempt to prevent his extradition. Israeli law bars citizens from
being sent abroad to stand trial.
	   Israeli prosecutor Irit Kaan said Wednesday that allowing
Sheinbein to take refuge in Israel would be a ``cynical
exploitation'' of Israel's citizenship laws.
	   Sheinbein ``has no link to the state of Israel and is only using
the state as a means of escaping from the country in which he
committed the crime,'' she told the court.
	   Sheinbein's lawyers argue that his father, Sol, is an Israeli
citizen, and that the status was automatically passed on to him.
	   But Israel says that Sheinbein's father lost his citizenship
because he moved his family to the United States in 1950, before
the country's citizenship law went into effect several years later.
	   ``It's obvious that the Sheinbein family had transferred the
center of its life to the United States before the decisive date,''
Kaan said.
	   Sheinbein, who had never lived in Israel and never held an
Israeli passport, ``never saw himself as an Israeli citizen,'' she
said.
	   Sheinbein's lawyer, former justice minister David Libai, said
only, ``If the father is not an Israeli citizen, then the Interior
Ministry should take away his Israeli citizenship.''
	   Another teenager charged in the murder, 18-year-old Aaron
Needle, hanged himself in his Maryland cell in April.

	   THERE should be laws to protect workers from unreasonable
dismissal and wage deductions when they stay home during a black
rainstorm warning, a union leader said.
	   Confederation of Trade Unions chief executive Elizabeth Tang
Yin-ngor said thousands of people went to work yesterday despite
the storm warning.
	   ``The workers are worried either of losing their jobs or getting
wage deductions so they decided to go to work,'' she said.
	   Hundreds of worried workers flooded the hotlines of the Labour
Department and offices of local trade unions with queries.
	   The department said employers and employees should reach an
agreement without delay on work arrangements during bad weather.
	   ``Employers are strongly advised to adopt a flexible approach in
drawing up work arrangements during inclement weather,'' a
spokesman said.
	   ``Due consideration should be given to employees' safety in the
workplace as well as their journey to and from work.'' The
department's code of practice for typhoons and rainstorms states
that employees injured in a work-related accident during a storm
are entitled to compensation.
	   The same rule applies to civil servants.
	   But Ms Tang said existing laws were inadequate to protect
workers unable to go to work during heavy rain or natural
calamities.
	   She said a pre-handover law against unreasonable dismissal did
not cover the absence of workers because of natural disasters, and
the department's guidelines for rainstorms allowed employers to
deduct wages if workers were absent or late.
	   ``This is unfair because the rainstorm is beyond the control of
workers.'' Newly elected legislator and unionist Leung Yiu-chung
said he would study whether to revive his private member's bill
against unreasonable dismissal to increase protection for workers.

Germany opposes intervening in Kosovo without U.N. mandate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany said Tuesday it would not support
any military intervention in Yugoslavia's separatist republic of
Kosovo without a U.N. mandate.
	   In response to a reporter's question, government spokesman Otto
Hauser said that Germany would not support such an intervention
without a U.N. mandate, even in the case of an ``emergency.''
	   NATO defense ministers were to meet in Brussels on Thursday and
Friday to consider military options, expected to include direct
intervention to stop violence between Serbian forces and separatist
ethnic Albanians. More than 250 people have died in clashes in
Kosovo since early March.

	   World famed German poet-playwright-director Bertolt Brecht would
have been a centenarian on the 10th February this year had he still
been alive. Theatre practitioners, playwrights, critics and, above
all, the theatre audience all over the world are celebrating his
birth centenary. Newspapers, magazines, journals, television and
radio media, have, in the meantime, widely covered Brecht's
hundredth anniversary. In Bangladesh Brecht's centenary is going to
be celebrated in a befitting manner jointly by the Bangladesh Group
Theatre Federation, the International Theatre Institute and the
Goethe Institute. He died in 1956 at the age of 58.
	   But he is still a socio-politically relevant and popular
playwright in many countries in the world. Brecht's life was truly
dramatic. His life in Adolf Hitler's Germany, life of a fugitive in
Scandinavia, life of a refugee in the United States of America and
subsequent banishment from the USA for non-American activities and
return to his native land after the second World War, which by then
changed to German Democratic Republic (G.D.R.) as the socialist
part of Germany, busy days in his own theatre organisation Berliner
Ensemble' made his entire life sonorous as well as spicy. During
his life time he worked with a good numbers of celebrated
directors, theorists, actors and actresses, composers, musicians
which included Erwin Piscator, a pioneer of the political theatre
movement and Charles Laughton, a highly talented stage and film
actor of his time.
	   In 1947 Brecht directed The Life of Galileo in the USA where the
lead role, Galileo was portrayed by Charles Laughton reflecting
Hiroshima massacre. In 1994 an interesting biography of Bertolt
Brecht entitled The life and Lies of Bertolt Brecht by John Fuegi
was published. This book of more than 700 pages contains many a
exciting, often scandalous and unbelievable information regarding
Brecht, which, quite naturally blemish to his world-reputation. The
contents of this book is interesting, readable and at the same time
debatable. Financial Times commented on the book as a provocative
detective story, like the best of Le Care'. This book, perhaps,
carries lots of truth about the great German playwright-director
but ultimately that could not tarnish his image to his innumerable
fans and admirers. Brecht carried with himself a number of cultural
and literary identities.
	   He was and is still acknowledged as a poet, a composer, a
playwright, a director and an innovator of a new theatrical form.
Brecht in the midway of his career turned out to be a people's
playwright'. Since then, an ardent believer of Marxism and
Leninism, his whole life was spent in establishing proletarian
theatre. In collaboration with another stalwart in the field, Erwin
Piscator, Brecht endeavoured to use theatre as political weapon in
order to help changing the society where there would be no
difference between the haves and have-nots. But to achieve this
goal, he never used theatre as a poster or an instrument of
political propagation. Plays written and directed by him, as such,
never lacked the high prosaic quality of dialogues and artistic
fervour in its entirety. As a carrier of message of his plays, he
evolved a new theatrical form, which was quite opposed to age-long
established Aristotelean or Dramatic theatre. This dramatic form is
well-known to today's theatre practitioners as Epic theatre' which
is essentially narrative in nature.
	   Brecht as a theatre director never believed in creating a stage
illusion by using realistic stage decors, effect-light projections,
superb costumes, make-up and back-ground music or sound effects. He
always tried to avoid these ideal traits of dramatic theatre. He
never meant to baffle or mesmerize the audience with the illusory
effects on stage. He always thought that an emotionally charged
audience tends to see the happenings on stage through a veil of
mist and thus how he fails to see the social realities. He tried to
disillusion the audience by using all the stage aids as open, stark
and artificial. He tried to impress upon his audience that what
they are watching is a play, hence unreal, may be, it is mere
repetition of a street accident which happened this morning. He
wanted to elevate the fun-loving audience to dispassionate or
rather scientific audience.
	   In his search for properly arming his theatrical form, he
applied Alienation or A-Effect through the introduction of chorus,
posters, placards, slide projections, songs and, at times, quite
irrelevant dialogues. Thus, how he used to intervene against the
coiling emotion within the minds of the audience and keep them free
from the contrived mood. With conscious efforts, he turned his
plays narrative and episodic with the skillful use of prologue and
epilogue. It needs to be mentioned that Brecht picked up the
narrative form of theatrical performance from the Orient, specially
from China and India. Brecht went so far to propagate that an actor
who is crying on stage, the audience has the right to laugh at him
and conversely an actor who is laughing on stage, the audience
might feel like crying for him. Alas, Brecht's propagation in
several occasions turned into contradiction as also happened with
the initiator of modern Method' acting in theatre, Russian
Stanislavsky.
	   This reminds us of the oft-used maxim, theory contradicts the
practice. Brecht's plays have to-day been universalized because of
the unique qualities of the plays in getting assimilated and merged
with any society irrespective of geographic settings. That his
plays, specially the ones with political messages, are easily
adaptable to any society irrespective of its cast, colour and creed
of the masses, once again reminds us that mankind remains to be a
political being and as such life and art are inseparable. As
Germans have no problem in identifying the annihilator Hitler
through the gangster of the play The Resistable Rise of Arturo Ui,
similarly Bangladeshi audience had no problem in identifying their
own gangster when they saw the Bangla adaptation of the same play
entitled Dhurta Ui at the Guide House auditorium in Dhaka. The
Group Theatre Movement of the country intensified when the Dhaka
audience first saw his play The Good Person of Setzuan in 1975.
	   The production won the heart of the entire community of the then
theatre-goers. After that Dhaka stage continued to be enliven with
his plays one after another, like Puntila and his Man Matti, The
Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagony, The Three Penny Opera, The
Caucasian Chalk Circle, Mother (Brecht &AMP; Gorky)'' The Resistable
Rise of Arturolli, The Life of Galileo, Man is Man and Mother
Courage and Her Children. Audience in Chittagong also saw his play
Sinora Carrer Rifle, The Exception and the Rule and The Measures
Taken. In fact, Brecht is the most practised foreign playwright in
our country who surpasses Shakespeare and Moliere's popularity.
Dewan Gazir Kissa - an adaptation of his play Puntila and His Man
Matti has the rare distinction of the country's most popular
production which has recently completed 300 performances. Through
the connection of Brecht, we saw the work of an extremely revered
and meritorious German theatre director, Fritz Bennewitz who
directed in Dhaka Brecht's play Man is Man in Bangla. Fritz died in
Germany a few years ago.
	   Entire life's experience taught Brecht to be merciless against
hypocrisy, religious bigotry and all kinds of conceits and he did
not fail to express his insurmountable hatred to these social
vices. He has become a man of our heart because he speaks in our
terms socially, politically and above all theatrically. In his
hundredth birth anniversary, I am sure, theatre lovers of the
country will not fail to pay their heartfelt tribute to the genius
of the most living playwright of the century, Bert-Brecht. We hope,
he will stride through the next millennium with equal might.

	   THE electronics manufacturer and distributor, IDT International,
has escaped adverse effects of the economic crisis, posting a 30
per cent increase in profits amounting to $180.8 million for the
year to 31 March 1998. The turnover of the company was $1.7
billion, a 55 per cent increase from $1.1 billion in the previous
period.
	   Total earnings per share were 19.4 cents comparing with 16.4
cents in the previous financial year.
	   The directors have recommended paying shareholders a final
dividend of 6 cents per share, bringing dividends for the year to
8.5 cents per share.
	   ``The group has not been adversely affected by the recent
financial turmoil and economic downturn in the Asian region since
its manufacturing operations are entirely located on the mainland,
and sales to the Asian markets, excluding Japan, are very small,
while sales to customers in the major markets of Europe, the USA
and Japan, are conducted either in US dollars or the currencies of
those countries,'' said IDT International chairman Raymond Chan.
	   ``I am very happy that the financial year ended 31 March 1998
has been another fruitful year for us and all core business
divisions performed very favourably,'' said Mr Chan.
	   ``The first two months of the new financial year showed a
satisfactory beginning to the year with sales in line with
management plans and ahead of the same period last year,'' he
added.

Egypt hangs two Islamic militants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt on Wednesday hanged two Muslim
militants convicted of killing a policeman, police said.
	   Mohammed Fawzi Abdel Adhim and Mohammed Mustafa Sulaiman were
hanged early in the morning at Istanaf prison in Cairo, police
officials said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Their deaths raised to 11 the number of Islamic militants
executed this year. The extremists have been waging a violent
campaign to destabilize the secular government of President Hosni
Mubarak.
	   A state security court in February sentenced the two to death
after a retrial in which they were found guilty of the 1993 slaying
of a policeman in the southern town of Tama, 340 kilometers (240
miles) south of Cairo.
	   The two had earlier been found innocent after a court found that
laboratory tests of the bullets allegedly used to kill the
policeman did not match guns that police said were used in the
attack.
	   A military prosecutor refused to endorse that ruling and
referred the case to a higher court.
	   Since 1992, more than 1,200 people have died in the insurgency
by Muslim militants. Most of the casualties have been police and
extremists.

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Toulouse _ or not to lose.
	   No matter how you say it, Thursday's Austria-Cameroon game in
this southern French city will go a long way toward making or
breaking two of the most unpredictable World Cup teams.
	   ``We're not interested in safe soccer,'' said Claude Le Roy,
coach of Cameroon's Indomitable Lions. ``Some risks always have to
be taken.''
	   Defying the defensive, avoid-the-loss tactics so prevalent in
soccer today, Austrian forward Andreas Herzog also dropped hints of
an offense-minded strategy at Stade Municipal _ at least until the
first goal.
	   ``We will try to score in the first few minutes,'' Herzog said.
``Then things will be easier.''
	   The game is probably the best chance for either team to get a
victory at the World Cup, although Cameroon enters the game with
better momentum.
	   Austria was a surprise winner of its European qualifying group,
ahead of the likes of Sweden and Scotland, but lost to lowly
Hungary and the United States in exhibtion matches before posting
unconvincing victories over marginal qualifier Tunisia and even
lower-ranked Liechtenstein. Austrian fans booed at the home games.
	   Cameroon also took first place in its qualifying group in
Africa, and followed it up with a 0-0 draw against the Netherlands
in May and a 2-1 victory over Denmark on Friday, a possible sign
that the Lions have put their miserable 1994 World Cup performance
behind them with an eye on recreating the magic to 1990, when they
became the first African team to reach the quarterfinals.
	   Le Roy appears to have infused his squad with oft-lacking
cohesion and team spirit since May, when he retook the job he had
already held between 1985 and 1988.
	   Cameroon has also survived the loss of Marc Vivien Foe, a
standout midfielder with newly-crowned French champion Lens, who
broke his leg in training. Veteran striker Francois Omam Biyick
took over as field leader, scoring both goals against Denmark and
restoring the team's confidence again.
	   Despite their differences, one thought unites the two squads _
the need to get off to a winning start.
	   ``Our World Cup will depend a lot on how we will get out of that
first match against Austria,'' Le Roy said.
	   ``Cameroon is a tough team,'' Austrian defender Anton Pfeffer
said. ``And because it's our first game, we'll have a tough time
coming back if we lose against them.''

World Cup: Injury makes Arendse's dream a nightmare
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Arendse comment, details of injury, treatment;
Radebe training again &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VICHY, France (AP) _ South African players have long dreamed of
finally getting the chance to play in a soccer World Cup. For
goalkeeper Andre Arendse, the dream has become a nightmare.
	   Injured in training Monday, Arendse will miss the tournament
after having damaged ligaments removed from his left knee on
Tuesday night.
	   ``My dream is gone,'' the lanky Fulham F.C. player, who turns 31
later this month, said after getting out of the hospital Wednesday.
``I have to put it behind me.''
	   Arendse led South Africa to victory in the 1996 African Nations
Cup tournament but was dropped from the team last year after former
coach Clive Barker resigned.
	   He regained his spot under new coach Philippe Troussier, who
took over in March, but was expected to back up Hans Vonk of
Heerenveen F.C. and Brian Baloyi of local club Kaizer Chiefs at the
World Cup. Team officials named Paul Evans of local club Supersport
United as Arendse's replacement.
	   The news was not all bad Wednesday, as captain Lucas Radebe of
Leeds United returned to fulltime training after bruising his heel
in Saturday's 1-1 draw against Iceland.
	   South Africa begins play Friday night in a Group C clash against
host France in Marseilles. Arendse's injury was a lone
disappointment so far for players lapping up the experience of
their country's first World Cup.

	   The French are hosting soccer's biggest bonanza, the World Cup,
in an absolutely electrifying atmosphere. The first ball will roll
today in the match between Brazil and Scotland as fans all over the
world get ready to enjoy every bit of it. To many, soccer is an
inspiring symbol of national pride; to others, it is a passion not
rivalled by anything else. Today, it is more than a sport -- a
great leveller, a converging point for humans of every colour and
creed. And what more can we expect from a pursuit which, at first
glance, appears to be nothing more than a brawl for the possession
of a mere ball?It is precisely here that modern soccer differs so
greatly from its ancient form. It is no more a brawl. So the fans
love to watch the superstars who have elevated the game into
something of a subtle art with tremendous ball-control, strategic
planning, stamina, and an almost uncanny ability to score goals.
	   And they have to beat the ever vigilant and sturdy defenders who
won't allow a fly to go past them -- let alone an enemy striker!
Yet, the impossible will happen time and again. It is really
interesting to see how people in this country have prepared
themselves for the matches. They are not ready to miss anything
whatsoever. Buying television sets and appealing for an
uninterrupted supply of electricity (a logical demand, in any case)
are indicative enough of their deep love of soccer. They do not
have a team of their own, but that does not affect the enthusiasm.
There are those big teams to choose from -- Brazil, Argentina,
Germany, to name but a few. The bond of soccer seems to transgress
the national boundaries and all other barriers . The fight for
supremacy will quite possibly remain confined to the artistic Latin
Americans and the robust Europeans, as most pundits believe the
dangerous Africans' will have to go a little further to win the
World Cup.
	   Brazil appear to have an edge; but in the presence of so many
formidable sides, few experts will hazard a prediction not
punctuated with some ifs' and buts'. We look forward to a month of
exciting, quality football that should please the game's countless
fans.

	   CATHAY Pacific Airways said yesterday it had signed a deal with
Virgin Atlantic Airways to lease two of its B747-200 aircraft to
the London-based carrier.
	   Cathay Pacific said that the lease agreement would last five
years, and Virgin had an option to extend it for a further two
years as well as an option to purchase the aircraft.
	   The two aircraft are amongst the five B747-200 ``Classic''
aircraft that Cathay is planning to sell or lease this year. ``The
move is in response to the current market conditions and taking
into account the fact that Cathay will be taking delivery of 13 new
aircraft in 1998-99,'' Andrew Herdman, general manager, group
corporate affairs said.
	   Cathay is in discussions with other airlines for the sale or
lease of the remaining three aircraft.
	   ``We are still in discussions with other airlines on the
possibility of a sale or lease,'' Mr Herdman said.
	   A Virgin Atlantic spokeswoman in London said the carrier was
also in negotiations with Cathay for the lease of the three other
aircraft.
	   ``We are looking at various options and it could include leasing
of more aircraft from them,'' she said.
	   Virgin's leasing of Cathay's aircraft is in addition to the five
Boeing 747-200 aircraft it bought from Air New Zealand in a US$130
million (HK$1.01 billion) deal last month.
	   Mr Herdman refused to reveal the amount Virgin would be paying
for the lease, but an aviation analyst speculated that it could be
between $12 million and $15 million per 747-400 aircraft a year.
	   ``So if Cathay is able to lease all the five aircraft, they
could get anything between $60 million and $75 million a year,''
Wilson Fen, an aviation analyst at Shenyin Wanguo Securities, said.
	   But he added that the secondary market for aircraft was quite
tight and hence Cathay would be unable to find a buyer under the
present weak economic situation.
	   Cathay has said earlier that if it cannot get a good price for
the aircraft it prefers mothballing them till the time the aviation
market picks up.
	   Virgin Atlantic said it intends to utilise the leased aircraft
and the ones it bought from Air New Zealand to additional routes it
has recently added, namely Barbados and Antigua in the Caribbean.

	   A plea has been sent out to the highest level of the government
by the joint committee of a few markets of the city to arrest
terrorists from Adarsha Hawkers Market. A joint committee
representing Bangabazar, Gulistan, Mahanagari and Adarsha Hawkers'
Market has in a memorandum called upon the Prime Minister to free
the markets by July 14, failing which a sit-in demonstration will
be organised in front of Bangabhaban.
	   A memorandum has also been sent to the President.Forceful
occupation of markets is a new form of intimidation of the small
traders while the old forms of extortion are all there.
Extortionism is so random and unchecked that many traders are
finding it impossible to ply their trade. Ultimately it is the
common consumers who have to pay for the extortions. As the racket
was not busted, it went on escalating and struck its roots deeper.
This has been going on for nearly twenty years. Sometimes these
extortionists were even backed, directly or indirectly, by
political parties. The hawkers, shop-owners and traders protested
but were helpless.
	   Perforce they had to meet the rapacious demand for donation
under various pleas and the extortionists were emboldened more and
more. The shop-owners of some markets, in their desperation, even
considered deployment of private police to deal with the
extortionists. This would have further worsened the law and order
situation. Any current improvement in the situation of extortionism
is only quantitative, not qualitative. As for street hawkers, they
have to pay not only to youths but also to some law enforcers.
	   And now it is clear that hawkers, shop owners and small traders
are subjected to other kinds of harassments and intimidations, like
outright occupation of markets by exercising muscle power. A series
of mysterious fires have occurred in the markets of the city
recently. If entrepreneurship, trade and commerce are to be
expanded, the problems faced by the small traders should be
attended to with due seriousness.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Tues. - The problem of `corrupted' Bahasa Melayu
over radio and television should be rectified, Information Minister
Datuk Mohamed Rahmat said today.
	   He said many views had been forwarded and criticisms levelled at
RTM over its role in propagating Bahasa Melayu as the national
language and the development of a national culture.
	   ``I welcome the views as in our haste to develop and modernise
the country, we should not forget our responsibility in
implementing the national agenda.
	   ``In this respect, the problem of language and culture is
important as they reflect our integrity and identity,'' he said
after a meeting with Malay linguists at Angkasapuri, here.
	   In addition to representatives from organisations like Gapena,
Mohamed also invited those from linguistic societies in
universities and the recent Fifth Literary Congress to give their
views on the matter.
	   Mohamed said he had received a memorandum containing the
resolutions passed at the congress relating to language and culture
closely associated with RTM's responsibility.
	   ``The problem on the use of corrupted Bahasa Melayu which some
feel has reached a critical stage should be resolved, although we
accept the fact that language is alive and should develop with
time.''
	   Panel chairman Datuk Rais Yatim who was also present said among
the problems which cropped up were pronounciation which was not
standard and the use of `bahasa rojak'.
	   The latter is a mixture of Bahasa Melayu and English.
	   On the Barisan Nasional Member of Parliament from Sarawak
reported to be saddled with some A$2 million (RM4.8 million) in
debts after losing in a casino in Australia, Mohamed said it was a
disgrace.
	   ``If it is true, I hope someone would take action since it is a
disgrace,'' said Mohamed who is BN secretary-general.
	   The MP reportedly paid half of the debts today and would settle
the balance by instalments.

	   HONG Kong's stock broking industry is headed towards further
consolidation as reflected by the declining number of brokers being
used by fund management companies.
	   The 1998 Reuters Survey of Hong Kong and China companies _ the
first such survey in this market _ showed that of the fund
management groups participating, 49 per cent said they were using
fewer broker teams and 46 per cent planned to increase their own
in-house research resources.
	   The survey, conducted by Tempest Consultants Ltd, also showed
that fund managers are complaining of a lack of transparency at
companies and poor broker research.
	   Tempest director Stephen Parker said: ``If a market is to be
efficient it has to be based on knowledge and information,'' he
said.
	   The survey of institutional investors and finance directors also
found that fund managers were seeking direct contact with
companies, indicating frustration with the quality of broker
research provided on locally listed firms.
	   ``The fund management groups do say that a lot of broker
research is really, really bad,'' said Mr Parker.
	   Based on the survey of finance directors and fund management
groups, Templeton Investment Management's Allan Lam was voted
``Best Individual Fund Manager'', Fidelity Investments was chosen
``Best Fund Management Group'', Merrill Lynch was picked ``Best
Broker Sales Team'', and Credit Lyonnais was voted ``Best Broker
Execution''.
	   The survey was done over the past three months and involved Hong
Kong's 350 largest quoted firms and the 100 largest institutional
investors.

	   General Sani Abacha's running feud with democracy seems to have
ended. The Nigerian President is reported to have died of a heart
attack last Monday. After Moshood Abiola won the free and fair
election in 1993, General Abacha abrogated the election result,
jailed Abiola and nearly 60 other leaders. He also forced into
exile and imprisoned political leaders, besides cultural and labour
figures as well. Seizing power in a bloodless coup d'etat, he did
not hesitate to shed blood. Assassinations and executions removed
whomever he believed was a threat to his regime.
	   What earned him great infamy was the execution of playwright
activist Ken Sara-Wiwa along with eight other Ogoni activists
despite appeals for clemency from the world.Sitting atop Nigeria's
vast oil wealth, its chief export, Abacha's inept and corrupt rule
pushed the poverty level of the country from almost 41 per cent in
1992 to about 80 per cent this year. Nigeria's electorate suffered
paradoxically from perennial fuel scarcity. Over 90 per cent of
eligible voters boycotted this year's election in a show of unity
not seen since the independence days among the 250 tribes that are
often at loggerheads with one another, and who make up the 105
million Nigerian nation.
	   The April presidential election saw five political parties
participating - and all of them nominated Abacha as their
candidate! The visit by the Pope earlier had fuelled a hope Abacha
might keep his promise to hand over power to a civilian
administration through free and fair elections as Abacha repeated
his previous promises during the Papal visit in a loud voice. But
soon it became clear Abacha had little interest in helping to build
the democratic process in a country which has seen one military
coup after another since the collapse of the civilian government
following the Biafran civil war in 1967. Hopefully with Abacha's
demise Nigerians should now be in a position to build up a
democratic system of governance that can perpetuate itself.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Tues. - A 32-year-old housewife told the Sessions
Court today that she was knocked down by a motorist driving a
Proton Wira after she refused to move from a vacant parking lot.
	   Koo Mei Fong said the motorist also knocked down her
two-year-old daughter Chiew Yuen Kee and her niece Chin Sim Yee who
were with her.
	   She said she saw Chin, who was pinned under the vehicle, asking
for help and a woman carrying Chiew.
	   Koo said she had earlier been threatened by the driver when she
refused to move away from the empty parking lot.
	   Koo was giving evidence at the trial of businessman Teh Chuan
Ann, 40, who is charged with attempting to commit culpable homicide
not amounting to murder of Koo, Chiew and Chin.
	   Teh, of Taman Tenaga, Cheras, is alleged to have committed the
offence on Jan 25, this year, about 7.30pm at the Jaya Jusco
supermarket car park in Taman Maluri, Cheras.
	   He also claimed trial to two separate charges of committing
mischief by causing damage of above RM25 to the vehicles owned by
Lau Kiat Kean and Liong Mun Kong at the same place and time.
	   Koo said she had told Teh that her sister, May Chan, was going
to park her car at the parking lot.
	   She said Teh replied, ``Try asking your sister to park there and
see what happens.''
	   Koo said at that time she did not believe Teh would drive his
car and knock them down.

	   CONTRIBUTION from property rental is expected to be increasingly
important for Miramar Hotel and Investment Co during the next three
years, director and group general manager Peter Yu said yesterday.
	   With the addition of 110,000 square feet of extra space at the
extension of the Miramar Shopping Centre, the total floor area of
the complex has been expanded to nearly 400,000 sq ft.
	   An extra 230,000 sq ft of space has also been added to the
office tower, bringing the total area to 700,000 sq ft.
	   Speaking after the official signing of the tenancy agreement
between Miramar Hotel and the Grande Entertainment Group, Mr Yu
said that despite the current soft retail leasing market, the
Miramar Shopping Centre is able to maintain a greater than 95 per
cent occupancy level, while the office tower has also achieved more
than 90 per cent occupancy.
	   Property rentals accounted for some 73.9 per cent of the group's
total profit of $228.2 million in fiscal 1997 and the weighting
from this operation is expected to be even more substantial in the
next few years. Mr Yu said monthly rental for Miramar Shopping
Centre ranges from $30 to $200 per sq ft, which the group considers
is a very reasonable level.
	   He admitted that a few existing tenants have asked for rent
reduction and the group has agreed to reduce the rent temporarily
and would re-adjust the rent when market conditions improve.
	   He said the group would invest millions of dollars to promote
the shopping arcade during this year and planning is also underway
for a new footbridge to be completed by the end of the year which
will link the Miramar Shopping Centre and Hotel Miramar's shopping
arcade which will help increase traffic and benefit both tenants
and shoppers.
	   For the hotel operation, Mr Yu said the occupancy for the
Miramar Hotel remains at a healthy 80 per cent, but the average
room rate has dropped some 30 per cent since early 1998 compared to
the level a year ago.
	   He admitted that contribution from the hotel operation is
expected to drop this year, but the group will continue its effort
to expand its operation by finalising more hotel management
contracts.
	   He noted that the group is currently under negotiation to manage
two four-star hotels on the mainland.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Tues. - Some 50,000 pupils from secondary schools
nationwide will be given free tickets to the Commonwealth Games to
liven up the atmosphere at sports venues.
	   Besides the tickets, food and insurance coverage will also be
provided for the pupils under a programme called Projek Khas
Sekolah-sekolah.
	   Accommodation is available for pupils from out of the city.
	   Education Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak, who launched the
project today, said the Games would help inspire pupils to excel in
sports.
	   ``It is important to cultivate a love for sports among
schoolchildren when they are still young.
	   ``The pupils will also help liven up the atmosphere at the
stadium with their thunderous cheers,'' he said, adding that there
would be 5,000 pupils a day at the Bukit Jalil stadium throughout
the 10-day Games.
	   Also present during the launch today was Sukom Ninety Eight
Berhad executive chairman Jen (Rtd) Tan Sr Hashim Mohd Ali.
	   The project is a joint effort between Sukom and CYAD Consultants
Sdn Bhd.
	   Three organisations have come forward in support of the project.
They are CYAD Consultants which donated RM100,000, Kingsmen
Builders Sdn Bhd which gave RM50,000 and Konsortium Pembuat
Alatulis Malaysia Sdn Bhd with RM25,000.
	   Najib said at least RM12 million was needed to make the project
a success.
	   ``The money will be used to buy tickets, bring pupils to the
stadium, provide refreshments, souvenirs and insurance coverage.''
On how the selection would be done, Najib said priority would be
given to pupils who excelled in sports and co-curricular
activities. ``We leave the selection to the project committee and
the ministry's schools division.''
	   Najib said each school would be accompanied by two teachers.

	   A new dimension has been added to the nuclear arms race in the
Indian sub-continent by the explosion of six nuclear devices by
Pakistan in the desert of Baluchistan. Earlier, on May 11 and 13
India conducted five nuclear tests in the desert state of
Rajasthan. The lid put on by the five nuclear powers led by the USA
has been blown apart. There has been a basic discrimination in the
arrangement for nuclear monopoly engineered by the USA. The five
nuclear powers, namely, the USA, Russia, China, UK and France have
enjoyed a nuclear weapons monopoly. The USA has tried strenuously
to so organize the world that no other country attempts to join the
nuclear club. India had exploded a nuclear device as far back as
1974. In other words, she was in possession of nuclear technology
and the question was not whether but when she would carry out the
tests of her weapons.
	   After nearly a quarter century she carried out the tests. In
between the USA has carried on a tireless campaign to put a halt to
all testing. The fact that five permanent members of the Security
Council of the UN have enjoyed a monopoly of the nuclear weapons
points to a situation of discrimination, which has bedevilled the
world. In between China has joined the nuclear club in a big way
advancing the argument that what she wanted was not a stop to
proliferation of nuclear weapons but a total ban of the weapons.
Indeed nuclear ban has eluded the grasp of the permanent members of
the Security Council. It is a thousand pities that the nuclear arms
race should come to the Indian sub-continent. If we take the
universe as a whole the Indian sub-continent stands out amongst the
most backward and poor. Left behind in the race for economic
development, the expression teeming million' can be very aptly used
for the area. There has been for long half a century a race between
India and Pakistan on conventional weapons.
	   The addition of nuclear weapon will only increase the economic
burden manifold. In retaliation for the five nuclear blasts carried
out by India, Pakistan has reacted by blasting six nuclear weapons.
This tragi-comic situation would not be so grim had it not been for
the fact that the two major powers of the sub-continent have fought
three wars since their independence from Britain half a century
ago. The focus of the territorial dispute is Kashmir, in the north
of both India and Pakistan. The war over this territory started
from the moment the two countries achieved independence back in
1947. Indeed all attempts to extricate the sub-continent from the
dispute between the two major powers of the sub-continent have
foundered on the rock of disagreement on many issues and mainly
Kashmir. Attempts to find a forum where they could cooperate like
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) have not
made any headway because of the attitude of the two major members
of the Association. Political issues are barred from SAARC.
	   Yet it has surfaced again and again and vitiated the atmosphere
within the organisation. When SAARC was launched there was a
glimmer of hope that it would emulate the highly successful ASEAN.
The result has been a dismal failure as far as SAARC is concerned.
With the testing of nuclear weapons by India and Pakistan, the club
is not only widened but nuclear weapons passed into the hands of
states with not a very strong economic base. It goes right into the
hands of Third World countries. The question that must preoccupy
the nuclear states, but primarily the sole superpower USA, is
whether the club can be limited to its present officially announced
seven members. There is open speculation that Israel possesses the
bomb. With the explosion of the Islamic' bomb, long dreamt of by
some Arab leaders, principally Muammar Gaddafi of Libya, will there
not be an enormous interest in acquisition of the bomb by some
wealthy Arab states?
	   India has carried on her nuclear arms programme irrespective of
the consequences that it would bring in her relations with
Pakistan. She had exploded a device back in 1974 and was marking
time to carry out significant tests. Indian agenda is different
from that of Pakistan: India is a large country, with population
only second to that of China; she has vast resources-and
technologically she is among the most advanced of the world. She is
eager to join the select club of the big powers and hence her
effort to join the Security Council as a permanent member. She is
carrying on the campaign in all the chancelleries of the world and
her voice has been properly registered. Explosion of nuclear device
is an attempt to join the big club. Pakistan has been operating on
a limited agenda.
	   That is that she must match India in weapons. She has no hope of
joining the big league but is determined to match India in the game
of power play. There is a psychological factor that is at work in
this dangerous nuclear arms race. Whereas India has reservations
about the partition of the sub-continent on religious lines, a
reservation that Indian politicians underline every now and then,
Pakistan feels threatened by these utterances. Pakistan has sought
security in weapons and hence her open embrace of the USA since the
beginning of the Cold War. There is talk of moratorium on nuclear
weapons. There is too much euphoria within the two countries to
discuss such a possibility immediately. Yet the leaders of the two
countries of the subcontinent will soon find out that with the
nuclear weapons the best that can be achieved is a balance of
terror.
	   Ever since the USA dropped those bombs on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, nuclear weapons have been perfected manifold but they lie
in silos. There is a general realization that they are too
dangerous, too devastating in its destructive capacities, to be
used. As has been rightly said, with those weapons the world could
be destroyed many times over.The best that could be hoped for is
that India and Pakistan, after their euphoria has died down, will
reflect cooly over the situation and come to a modus vivendi. If
the great powers with a fantastic nuclear arsenal have come to this
conclusion, there is no reason why India and Pakistan should be any
different. The world is sufficiently unstable as it is. There is no
need to add new elements to this volatile situation.

EU Commission delays decision on banning teething products
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Commission delayed
Wednesday a decision on whether to ban certain plastic teething
products for babies amid fears chemicals they contain may cause
cancer.
	   The European Union executive body opened an investigation into
teething products that contain two widely-used pthalates, a
chemical substance used in plastic objects to make them supple.
	   The ban, if adopted, would target objects that children might
put in their mouths. Pthalates, which recent scientific evidence
suggests may contain cancer-causing agents, are used in some
teething rings and other products for babies to chew on during
teething.
	   `There is not enough scientific evidence yet to justify a ban,''
said Pietro Petrucci, spokesman for the EU's Commissioner for
Consumer Affairs Emma Bonino.
	   The 20 EU commissioners are expected to discuss the ban again
when they meet next Wednesday but it's unclear whether they will be
able to take a decision by then.
	   EU officials said scientists must determine what level of
pthalates leaking from toy to mouth could pose a health risk and
whether the substance goes through the digestive system or remains
in the body.
	   The Commission must also decide whether the ban should be
applied as an emergency measure - to be applied immediately - or as
a consumer protection measure that will take months to be
implemented in the 15 EU countries.
	   ``If we impose an emergency ban, we must have solid scientific
proof because otherwise any company can take us to court and
overturn it,'' an EU official said on condition of anonymity.
	   A small group of EU countries favor an immediate ban but others
would like to find out first how dangerous the pthalates are.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Tues. - Among the souvenir items for the coming
Commonwealth Games here is one with a difference - a
mind-challenging series of puzzle books which will serve to
stimulate the brain cells of readers besides providing them general
information about the Games and the country.
	   To be launched by next month, the books are targeted at both
adults and youths.
	   Mindplus (M) Sdn Bhd managing director Sam Samarasinghe, who is
also the author of the books, said there were six types of books
under the series - Mind Bending Puzzles, Creative Puzzles, IQ
Puzzles, Tricky Puzzles, Sports Puzzles and Ingenious Puzzles.
	   The books are also available in Bahasa Malaysia.
	   The Bahasa Malaysia versions are called Teka-Teki Minda,
Teka-Teki Kreatif, Teka-Teki IQ, Teka-Teka Bestari, Teka-Teki Sukan
and Teka Teki Pintar.
	   Samarasinghe is a graduate of the Imperial College, University
of London in the United Kingdom and the University of Ceylon and
holds various qualifications from professional engineering
institutions.
	   He said each book, priced at RM39.90 contained 100 puzzles and
information on the history of the Commonwealth Games, the coming
Games in Kuala Lumpur, sports champions of Malaysia, places of
interest and advertorials.
	   Mindplus (M) Sdn Bhd is licensed by Sukom Ninety Eight Sdn Bhd
to produce the books. Juranas Sdn Bhd is the sole distributor.
	   Samarasinghe, who has written several puzzle books in the past
20 years, said each 230-page hardcover book has full-colour
illustrations and pictures.
	   ``I looked at souvenir books from the previous Commonwealth
Games and Olympic Games and saw that readers generally lost
interest in them after the events.
	   ``By incorporating puzzles, there will be sufficient material in
the books to keep a reader occupied well after the Games,'' he
said, adding that it took him five years to complete writing the
entire series.
	   He said the puzzles needed lttle more than elementary knowledge
to solve as many were based on well-known mathematical and logical
principles.
	   ``The puzzles will help sharpen the reader's analytical process,
logical thinking and mathematical skills.
	   ``At first glance, some of the puzzles may appear difficult but
upon careful reading and thinking, readers will find that the
solutions are relatively easy to get,'' he said, adding that
answers to the puzzles were available in the books.
	   Samarasinghe said the books were also targeted at tourists as it
would provide them invaluable information about Malaysia.
	   Juranas executive chairman Aziz Massod said besides being sold
at the Games venues, the books would also be available at
bookshops.
	   ``We are also looking for sponsors among corporations and
airlines. They can buy the books in bulk and distribute it to
customers and passengers.''
	   Big companies and conglomerates are encouraged to buy the books
as one of the ways to support the Commonwealth Games.
	   The books can be given away as gifts or souvenirs with records
of the Commonwealth Games held here.
	   Corporate sponsors can also buy in bulk and distribute the books
to schoolchildren who may find the puzzles interesting.
	   Those with enquiries can forward them to Juranas at 03-2927311
or 03- 2931224.

Thousands protest Serb attacks, ethnic leader to Europe

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Decrying the latest Serb aggression,
thousands of ethnic Albanians took to the streets of Pristina in
protest Wednesday, while their leader headed to Europe's capitals
to seek assistance for his people.
	   Some 20,000 Kosovo Albanians marched through the main street of
the provincial capital bearing banners that read: ``NATO, Kosovo is
burning'' and ``NATO, tomorrow will be too late,'' and carrying
Albanian and U.S. flags.
	   The protesters fervently chanted ``U-C-K,'' the Albanian
language acronym for the Kosovo Liberation Army _ a militant
organization fighting to wrest the southern province away from
Serbia _ and sang a popular Albanian song, praising their ethnic
leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Groups of protesters leaving the rally _ the 60th consecutive
demonstration _ got into a stone-throwing scuffle near the
university with Serbs. Several cars were stoned and a university
bookstore window shattered. Police intervened and dispersed the
protesters.
	   No further violence was reported early Wednesday elsewhere in
the province, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
Kosovo's restive Albanian majority seeks independence from Serbia,
which stripped its autonomy in 1989 and has since ruled the
province with a heavy military and police presence.
	   Some 30,000 ethnic Albanians also gathered downtown in the
Macedonian capital Skopje, to demand NATO presence in Kosovo.
	   More than 250 people have died in escalating clashes in Kosovo
between Yugoslav troops and ethnic Albanian militants that began in
early March.
	   In last week's fighting alone, more than 50 people were killed
and 200 were missing and presumed captured in western parts of
Kosovo, according to ethnic Albanian sources.
	   Chased by the fighting, thousands of Kosovo Albanian refugees
flowed into neighboring northern Albania last week. About 11,000
have been registered by international relief officials so far, but
the actual total is believed to be much higher.

	   The wetlands of Bangladesh, an invaluable component of the
environment and biodiversity consist of both coastal and inland
water bodies including rivers, streams, fresh water lakes, marshes
(Haor, Baor and Beels) water storage reservoir, fish ponds, flooded
cultivated fields and estuarine system with extensive mangrove
swamp. The total area of the country's wetlands has been variously
estimated at seven to eight million hectares, about half the area
of the country. All these wetlands form a unique mosaic of habitat
with extremely rich diversity of flora and fauna. Wetlands in
Bangladesh have great ecological, economic, commercial and
socio-economic importance.
	   They contain very rich components of bio-diversity of local,
national and regional significance. According to experts, among the
estimated 5000 species of flowering plants and 1500 of vertebrates
in the country, up to 300 plant species and some 400 vertebrate
species are judged to be dependent on wetlands for all or part of
their life span. Wetlands also provide habitat for a variety of
resident and migratory waterfowl, a significant number of
endangered species of international interest and a large number of
commercially important one. The inland capture fisheries is based
on the vast freshwater resources with some 270 species of fin and
shell fish.
	   There is a substantial basis for the view that the country's
natural resources, especially the Sundarbans could support
development of richer tourism. They also support a significant
range of other activities such as extraction of reed harvesting of
edible aquatic vegetation and their products, medicinal herbs,
shells, etc. Cultivation of rice is a major activity in and around
the wetlands of Ganges-Brahmaputra flood plains and haor basin.
During the dry season, domestic livestock are allowed to graze in
the marshes and turfs. Of late, wetlands are also being used as
duckery.
	   Globally, the concern for well-management of wetlands has
remarkably grown since the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands.
Bangladesh has demonstrated its concern through the National
Environment Policy convening a workshop on wetlands and in signing
the Ramsar Convention in May, 1992. The broad objectives of the
Ramsar Convention are to stem the loss of wetlands and to ensure
their conservation in view of their importance for ecological
processes as well as for their rich flora and fauna. While the
importance of wetlands for bio-diversity has long provided the
driving force for wetland conservation, the economic benefits have
been realized by people and government only recently and major
investments have been made in this direction.
	   In view of the above content, Bangladesh Centre for Advanced
Studies (BCAS), a leading non-government research and policy
institute of the country has set up a centre named the Wetland
Research and Training (WRTC) at Vennabari in Gopalganj district.
Founded in 1994 as a field centre of BCAS, the WRTC aims at
evolving participatory model similar to NEMAP (National Environment
Management Action Plan which is a well-acclaimed participatory
planing home and abroad) for conservation and sustainable
management of wetlands of the country. From its reception, the WRTC
situated over a plot of 3 acres of land has been involved in
activities which promote environment and natural resource
conservation, sustainable development, participatory management,
democracy issues, horticulture and aquaculture practices.
	   The Centre has also implemented several programmes to achieve
all these. The main objectives of WRTC is to carry out research and
training on environmental aspects and these include: t research on
Water Resource Management. Wetland Bio-diversity, Participatory
Wetland Management t training and dissemination of research
findingst providing information to policy makers, government and
non-government organisations to develop sustainable management
programmes on natural resources and to develop livelihood system in
rural areas.t documentation of research results, training and
workshop proceedingsThe WRTC activities are as follows: t
conducting participatory survey on aquatic and terrestrial natural
resourcest conducting action research on various development issues
t undertaking various environmental programmes including natural
resource conservation, environmental training and tree plantationt
strengthening GO-NGO collaboration t augmentation of natural fish
production by protecting brood fish in Kua in Chanda Beel.
	   The WRTC already started aquaculture practices in 330 decimal
ponds of its own area. Major carps and indigenous species were
stocked in the waterbodies with following objectives: (1) to
increase the income of the centre and (2) to conserve the rare
species of fish and aquatic resources of the wetland through
distributing fingerlings of the rarer species among the people. The
centre also has tested and succeeded in producing hatchlings of
snail eggs. It has stocked 800 snails to increase their production.
In coming years the centre has plan to produce about a million
hatchlings of snail and grow them for marketing.

	   THE State Government aims to get a revenue of RM6 billion from
four million tourists during the Visit Penang Year 1999.
	   State Tourism Committee chairman Datuk Kee Phaik Cheen (BN-Batu
Uban) told the House that the target was realistic based on the
recent tourism revenue and strategies taken by the Visit Penang
Year 1999 organising committee which she chaired.
	   Last year, the State gained about RM4.7 billion revenue from
3.17 million tourists, while in 1996, it was RM5 billion from 3.4
million tourists.
	   Kee said the committee had promoted tourism products and family
reunion, agro-tourism, eco-tourism, heritage trail and shopping
thrill packages.
	   The major events to be held next year are Flora Fest in March,
Penang International Food Festival (April), Penang Golf Circuit
(July and December), Penang Arts Festival (August), Penang Shopping
Carnival (October) and Penang International Trade Fair (November
and December).
	   Kee said a promotional campaign would also be carried out on the
PenangNet homepage.
	   Asked by Tan Cheng Liang (BN-Jawi) on the condition of the
beaches in the State, Kee said the committee was working closely
with the municipalities to ensure that they were clean at all
times.

	   BAD weather conditions apparently prompted the Paliburg Group to
extend until tomorrow the registration of sales of flats at its
Park Royale residential project in Yuen Long.
	   Registration was originally scheduled to end today while the
first day of sales remains on schedule this Saturday. Last night,
the company said it was offering for sale an extra 50 flats on top
of the 200 units it initially offered.
	   Before last night's announcement, property analysts expected it
to be oversubscribed by about 10 times, as a result of a 10-15 per
cent price discount offered by the company, making the project one
of the cheapest in the New Territories.
	   Midland Realty senior district manager Lawrence Wong Wai-wing
said the subscription rate was an indication of flat prices in Yuen
Long since the project is the first to offer various club
facilities in the district.

Blair: threat of force is key to Kosovo solution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A credible threat of military force is a
prerequisite for a diplomatic solution of the crisis in Kosovo,
Prime Minister Tony Blair said Wednesday.
	   Western European government have been pressing Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to refrain from violently suppressing
ethnic Albanians. NATO defense ministers are expected to consider
plans for possible intervention, including perhaps sending in
troops, air strikes or a no-fly zone over Kosovo.
	   ``Is not one of the lessons of Bosnia that diplomacy seems to
work somewhat better with President Milosevic if it is backed by a
clear and credible threat of compulsion?'' Liberal Democrat leader
Paddy Ashdown asked Blair in the House of Commons.
	   ``Yes, I would agree with that entirely. That's precisely why we
are trying to arrange the maximum support so that we can take
military options should diplomacy fail,'' Blair said.
	   Blair added that he believed Milosevic would only respond to
``diplomatic pressure is if that is backed up by the threat _ the
credible threat _ of military force.''
	   ``Now, the sole hurdle that remains in our way at the present
time is getting the necessary support for that course of action. We
are working as hard as we possibly can,'' Blair said.

	   A TOTAL of 2,301 low-cost houses in Seberang Perai Tengah (SPT)
and Selatan (SPS) districts still have no takers, Deputy Chief
Minister Datuk Shariff Omar (BN-Permatang Berangan) told the House.
	   Shariff, who is chairman of the State Housing Committee, said
the houses were among 4,878 units built in 14 projects in the two
districts.
	   Of SPT's 3,168 houses built under seven projects in Tan Sri
Janggus, Taman Impian Indah, Taman Sri Delima, Taman Titi Panjang,
PPR Sungai Rambai and Taman Pauh, there were only 2,156 buyers.
	   Of SPS' 1,710 houses built under seven projects in Taman Bandar
Mutiara, Taman Pekatra, Taman Seruling Emas, Taman Merak Jaya,
Taman Bukit Panchur, Taman Idaman and Taman Tambun Indah, only 421
applied to buy them.
	   ``Eligible buyers from the lower-income group of both districts
who are registered with the State Housing Department should seize
the opportunity to own low-cost units now.''
	   On the RM6.2 million rental and maintenance arrears of public
houses owed by the occupants till March 1998, Shariff said the
State Government would act against the defaulters.

	   SHEFFIELD, England (AP) _ Sheffield Wednesday is close to
signing Philippe Troussier, South Africa's French World Cup coach,
as its new manager.
	   Wednesday chairman Dave Richards met with Troussier in France on
Tuesday and club officials reported the two sides were close to a
deal.
	   ``Nothing's signed, but we have been talking and there's a very
good chance of things succeeding,'' Troussier said.
	   The 43-year-old Frenchman would succeed Ron Atkinson, whose
contract with the Owls was not renewed at the end of the season.
	   Troussier has also been contacted by Scottish champions Celtic,
whose coach Wim Jansen left just days after the club clinched the
title.
	   Troussier has coached clubs and national teams in South Africa,
Ivory Coast, Morocco, Nigeria and Burkina Faso.

	   The six nuclear devices conducted by Pakistan on 28 and 30 May,
1998, needless to say, created a threat to regional and
international peace and security. India detonated five nuclear
devices a few days earlier and began nuclear arms race in South
Asia. Actually, Pakistan applied deterrence approach to maintain
balance of power in South Asia. On the other hand, India detonated
five nuclear devices to maintain balance of power with China. At
the time of Cold War, United States followed massive nuclear
programmes. This was because of the fact that Soviet nuclear
programme was not fully known to United States. There was, however,
a balance of power between North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
(NATO) and Warsaw Pact. According to Hans J. Morgenthau, ``The
balance of power and policies aiming at its preservation are not
only inevitable but are an essential stabilizing factor in a
society of sovereign nations''.
	   So the question of balance of power is related to the nuclear
devices of India and Pakistan. But after disintegration of Soviet
Union, geo-economics is more important than geo-politics. Side by
side, it is spreading and becoming the dominant phenomenon in
regional and international context. In traditional international
politics, the goals of great powers were to ensure and extend the
physical control of territory. In the ongoing era of free market
economy, the goals are to extend the market.But it is a matter of
regret that South Asian states, India and Pakistan, are going ahead
in the traditional style. As a result economic development, human
development and poverty alleviation programmes would not gain
momentum.
	   With the celebration of golden jubilee of their Independence,
India and Pakistan began nuclear arms race bypassing the more
important poverty alleviation programme. The Indian sub-continent
is now witnessing an atmosphere of tension and conflict. Pakistani
President Mohammad Rafiq Tarar declared a state of emergency
against the threat of external aggression' as the country faced
sweeping economic sanctions. World leaders condemned Pakistan's
nuclear tests. US President Bill Clinton condemned Pakistan for its
nuclear explosions. US is considering has imposed economic sanction
upon Pakistan like upon India. Japanese government declared
suspension of new economic aid and loans. Nations around the world
condemned Pakistan. Britain, Australia and some other nations
condemned it.
	   So it is evident that economic consequences for Pakistan would
be severe because its economy is dependent on foreign aid. Side by
side, foreign investment in Pakistan and India is under threat. It
is also obvious that the economy of Pakistan would be hard hit. The
socio-economic structure of Pakistan and India will undergo jolts
for escalating the arms race. But in reality South Asia is a
prospective area in the era of geo-economics. There are some
disputes between India and Pakistan and between India and China.
Yet with the end of the Cold War bargaining approach of Thomas C.
Schelling seems to be more relevant, and important, than deterrence
approach in the hostile relationship between two countries.
	   So Indo-Pakistan, Sino-Indian disputes could be settled through
bilateral and regional level and negotiations the future of the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) would
brighten. Consequently, the socio-economic development of South
Asia would be a reality and the South Asian nations would emerge as
great economic powers. It is necessary to close the nuclear
umbrella of the nations because the impact of nuclear weapons on
history was devastating.

	   PENANG will recruit and retain foreign workers only if the State
experiences a shortage of local workers, the House was told
yesterday.
	   Chief Minister Tan Sri Dr Koh Tsu Koon (BN-Tanjung Bunga) said
the State would practise a flexible and pragmatic labour policy
emphasising its economy and local workers.
	   ``The estimated 70,000 foreign workers currently in Penang are
serving as a cushion and will be only retained if there are not
enough local workers,'' he said when winding up the debate on a
motion of thanks to the Yang di-Pertua Negeri Tun Hamdan Sheikh
Tahir for his opening address.
	   Koh said the welfare of local workers had and would always be
the Government's main concern and focus.
	   ``This concern and focus will serve as a basis for our economic
development strategy in promoting investment, tourism, trade,
services, property, agriculture and other sectors.''
	   He also said there had been an increasing number of Bumiputeras
and Indians in professional occupations in Penang.
	   ``In the combined category of engineers, architects, scientists,
system analysts and technicians, the number of Bumiputeras
increased more than eightfold from 671 from a total of 3,483 in
1980 to 5,520 from a total of 14,869 in 1991.
	   ``The number of Indians in this category increased fourfold from
391 in 1980 to 1,603 in 1991, while the Chinese increased a little
more than threefold from 2,211 to 7,622 in the same period.''
	   He also said that between 700 and 900 study loans of RM2,500
each had been allocated over the past five years.
	   Of this figure, between 28 and 45 per cent were given to
Bumiputera students, between 49 and 66 per cent to Chinese students
and between six and nine per cent went to Indians.

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Why is General Motors struggling through its
seventh strike in 18 months even though competitors Ford and
Chrysler have relatively peaceful relations with labor?
	   Analysts say one reason is that GM has been behind its rivals in
going through tough reorganizations and cost-cutting.
	   ``It's a history of bad management,'' analyst David Healy of
Burnham Securities Inc. said Tuesday. ``If Chrysler and Ford can
manage their union relations so there are no strikes and costs are
good, you have to lay the problem on GM's door.''
	   So far, Wall Street has reacted favorably to the strike even
though the world's largest automaker once again faces the threat of
a North American assembly shutdown, with the potential loss of
hundreds of millions of dollars in production.
	   GM's stock has fallen only slightly since the strike began last
week. In morning trading Wednesday, its stock was up slightly, at
31 1/4 cents to dlrs 73.50 per share on the New York Stock
Exchange.
	   ``General Motors is perceived as a multilayered bureaucracy that
is very high-cost and very slow-moving,'' Healy said. ``Any signal
that this is changing through making plants more efficient or
making the organization more flexible is welcomed on Wall Street.''
	   A seventh assembly plant was closed Wednesday because of the
strike at the Flint Metal Center. The Linden, New Jersey, plant
that makes midsize sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks was
shut down, affecting 2,360 workers, the company reported.
	   The strike earlier caused the closure of assembly plants in
Michigan, Ohio, and Kansas. In all, about 17,300 UAW
union-represented workers have been affected. The shutdowns came
quickly because modern assembly plants use a just-in-time delivery
system for parts, rather than costly warehousing at the plants.
	   Talks resumed Wednesday at the plant as the strike entered its
sixth day. No progress has been reported so far.
	   More shutdowns are expected as the strike continues. A total of
16 cities across North America have GM plants that use doors,
hoods, engine cradles and other parts made at the Flint Metal
Center. Analysts estimate the lost production could cost GM dlrs
300 million a week if all those plants close.
	   And if the union strikes another key parts plant in Flint on
Thursday, as it has threatened, virtually all of GM's North
American production could come to a halt.
	   GM insists efficiency is the key issue at Flint, that outdated
union work rules prevent it from using new equipment in ways that
would increase productivity and save money.
	   The UAW maintains it already has negotiated rule changes, but
that GM has not followed through with all of a dlrs300 million
investment it promised.

Duma debates bill setting rules of president's dismissal

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian president would have to undergo a
medical exam if he failed to work full time for more than four
months, under a bill given preliminary approval Wednesday in the
lower house of the Russian parliament.
	   The bill could strengthen the hand of Boris Yeltsin's opponents,
who have long claimed he was unfit for office on health grounds.
	   The Russian constitution says a president must step down if he
suffers a ``lasting inability to exercise his powers.'' The
constitution does not explain the process for removing a president
on these grounds, and the new bill is intended to fill the gap.
	   The bill needs final approval by the State Duma and approval by
the upper chamber of parliament and Yeltsin himself before it
becomes law.
	   The vagueness of the constitution has fueled controversy since
Yeltsin's heart illnesses and bypass surgery in 1996.
	   Doctors say Yeltsin has fully recovered from his surgery and is
in good condition, but Communists and other foes disagree. They
argue he is unfit for office and should step down.
	   Under the bill, parliament may demand a medical exam if a
president is unable to work full time for more than four months or
if doctors order him to reduce his workload.
	   Either house of parliament would be authorized to ask the
Supreme Court to appoint a team of doctors to examine a president
and, based on their findings, rule whether he could remain in
office.
	   The Russian constitution also says that a president can be
impeached if he breaks the law.
	   Communists and others have repeatedly tried to launch
impeachment motions against Yeltsin. All such moves have fizzled,
mostly because Russia's constitution gives the president the upper
hand in confrontations with parliament.
	   Communists are trying to bring another impeachment motion
against Yeltsin, and plan to discuss the issue on Thursday.
	   Even if the Duma votes to start the impeachment proceedings, the
motion has to go to the upper chamber, which is made up of regional
officials, many of whom are loyal to Yeltsin. The charges will also
have to by approved by both the Constitutional and Supreme Courts _
a highly unlikely development.

prison official hostage for 18 months to pressure the government to
move group's prisoners to jails in the northern Basque region, but
denied planning to kill him.
	   The four defendants were responding to charges of kidnapping and
conspiring to murder Jose Antonio Ortega Lara on the opening day of
their National Court trial.
	   All the four men face up to 32 years in jail if convicted on
both counts.
	   Jesus Maria Uribechevarria Bolinaga, Javier Ugarte Villar, Jose
Luis Erostegui Bidaguren and Jose Miguel Gaztelu were arrested last
July hours before police rescued their captive from a hideout in
the northern town of Mondragon.
	   The ETA abducted Ortega Lara in January 1996 and kept him in a
3-meter by 2.5-meter (9-foot by 7-foot) windowless room for 532
days, conditioning his release on improved conditions for 450
jailed members of the group.
	   At the beginning of the trial, the National Court exempted the
former hostage from taking the witness stand after a medical
evaluation presented on Tuesday concluded this could seriously
worsen his already delicate psychological condition.
	   Wearing white T-shirts demanding that Basque prisoners should be
held in Basque jails, the four defendants denied that they planned
to kill or starve their captive to death if the government did not
give in to their demands.
	   The defendants said they had treated ETA's longest ever hostage
correctly.
	   When Ortega Lara was released from captivity his muscles were
wasted, he had lost 51 pounds (23 kilos) in weight and become
anemic.
	   But the four accused stressed that they had fed him everyday and
that they did not have the medical knowledge necessary to diagnose
or treat any illnesses he might have had.
	   ETA, an acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has killed
nearly 800 people and kidnapped 71 people since it began fighting
for independence of northern Spain's Basque region in 1968.
	   Prosecutors are also seeking compensation of 65 million pesetas
(dlrs 424,836) for Ortega Lara, and the trial is expected to
conclude Thursday.

	   THE State Government will set up an international business
development centre to act as a one-stop agency to carry out
trade-related activities and co-ordinate with the international
business community to boost the State's commercial and service
sectors.
	   State Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Committee chairman
Datuk Dr Sak Cheng Lum (BN-Bagan Jermal) told the House that the
Penang Trade Council was finalising a project paper on the proposed
IBDC.
	   The IBDC, he said, would act as a one-stop agency to group all
domestic public and private business agencies to deal collectively
with international business communities like the European Union,
Asean, the US, Japan, Taiwan, China and South Korea for mutual
benefit.
	   It will be a co-ordinating body to set up proper infrastructure
and transportation systems, free commercial zones and other
facilities, and carry out programmes such as international-level
seminars, dialogues and conferences pivotal to business growth.
	   ``The State Government hopes to utilise the IBDC as a cohesive
unit to boost Penang's growth as a regional industrial, commercial
and service centre to benefit the local business community and the
public in general,''
	   Dr Sak said in replying to points raised during debate on the
motion of thanks to the Yang di-Pertua Negeri Tun Hamdan Sheikh
Tahir for his opening address.
	   Dr Sak said presently, many government departments and agencies,
besides various business organisations and companies, were working
independently to establish international business links.
	   However, he said: ``The IBDC does not necessarily mean setting
up a complex or building to act as an international trade centre.
It can even be a division under the Penang Development
Corporation.''
	   Dr Sak said two more free commercial zones - one each in the
Malaysia Airports Berhad complex in Bayan Lepas and North
Butterworth Container Terminal in Bagan - would be established.
	   The proposed FCZ in Bagan will also be a regional trade and
service distribution centre.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sales and profits for Japanese companies fell in
the quarter ended in March, and managers say they are more
pessimistic about the economy than they've been in at least 15
years, according to a government survey released Wednesday.
	   Pretax profits for Japanese companies plunged 25.4 percent in
the three months ended in March compared with a year earlier as
sales sank 6.8 percent, the largest decline in 40 years, the
Ministry of Finance said in a quarterly survey.
	   The report follows a string of bad news for the Japanese
economy, which is stuck in its worst slowdown in decades. Many
economists expect a report due out later this week will show the
country has sunk into recession.
	   The survey, which was conducted in May, also showed corporate
managers didn't expect economic conditions to improve anytime soon.
	   The survey's business sentiment index for major manufacturers _
a measure of corporate optimism _ sank to minus 36.1 from minus
31.0 a quarter earlier. The index is the difference between the
percentage of companies which say the economy is worsening from
those that say it's getting better. A negative number indicates
there are more pessimists than optimists.
	   The survey also indicated that the growing pessimism is
affecting companies' planning for the future. New investment by
Japanese corporations decreased by 5.8 percent over the quarter.

	   Greenhouse gas emissions - blamed for global warming - may cause
the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and raise the average
global sea level by four to six metres, beginning as early as the
next century, a new scientific study predicted recently. Using
recent technological advances in climate modelling and new
scientific research on ice and oceans, Michael Oppenheimer, chief
scientist at the New York-based Environmental Defense Fund, made
three predictions on the impact of climate change on the Antarctic
Ice Sheet. In two of the three scenarios, complete melting would
raise global sea level by an average four to six metres, causing
major coastal flooding worldwide, Oppenheimer wrote in the latest
issue of the scientific journal Nature.' In the other scenario, the
internal ice shifting within the ice sheet could cause the melting
to slow down.
	   With its 3.8 million cubic kilometers of ice at the South Pole,
the West Antarctic Ice Sheet posed the 'most immediate threat of a
large sea-level rise, owing to its potential instability,''
Oppenheimer said. Changes in ocean temperature and circulation
expected to accompany global warming could disintegrate the large
ice sheet, as early as next century, he said. The West Antarctic
Ice Sheet first attracted widespread attention 30 years ago when
scientists suggested that global warming caused by greenhouse gases
might cause its disintegration. Greenhouse gas emissions -
including carbon dioxide created by the burning of coal, gas and
oil, are believed by most atmospheric scientists to cause the
warming of the Earth's surface and a change in the global climate.
	   In 1995 an international panel of scientists that advises the
United Nations on the issue, predicted that the average global
temperatures could heat up between one and 3.5 degrees Celsius
during the next century. Last year, scientists declared 1997 the
warmest year on record, and the fact that nine of the past 11 years
set new records for warm temperatures bolstered the view that
greenhouse emissions were raising the average temperature. Over
time, these increases could cause changes in climate, including the
increased frequency and intensity of storms, floods, heat waves,
and droughts, the scientists said. To deal with this threat 38
industrialised countries agreed at a conference last December in
Kyoto, Japan to reduce their emissions of six greenhouse gases by
about six percent overall between 2008 and 2012.
	   While countries work out the details of the Kyoto agreement, the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated that the lack of
scientific understanding of the effects of global warming on the
West Antarctic Ice Sheet limits the ability to predict the risk of
the collapse' or melting.' But Oppenheimer warned that, as
countries begin to formulate global warming policies, 'the
potential hazards from the collapse of the ice sheet is too large
and irreversible'' to be considered at a later date. Conflicting
scientific views on the effect global warming would have on ice
caps had confused the issue, Oppenheimer said. Until recently,
scientific studies argued that the West Ice Sheet and Antarctica as
a whole were growing not disintegrating or melting. Similarly the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated that over the
past century Antarctica did not cause sea-levels to rise at all.
Yet, recent studies had found high melting rates under the floating
ice, he added.
	   In combination with other findings of shrinking icebergs, these
new melting rates exceeded the estimated growth of the ice in the
West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Oppenheimer pointed to studies made of
two ice shelves to the north of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet that
had been disintegrating for several decades, possibly because of
local atmospheric warming. While most scientists agreed that the
ice sheet was shrinking, they disagreed on how fast it will melt
and what the consequences would be. In an effort to simplify the
controversy, Oppenheimer produced what he believed would be the
three most probable effects of global warming on this relatively
unstable sheet of ice. Each of the three most likely possibilities
varied according to how fast the West Antarctic Ice Sheet responded
to the melting and disintegration of various glaciers and ice
shelves in the area. Using the climate change predictions of the
Intergovernmental Panel and the continued growth in greenhouse gas
emissions, Oppenheimer predicted that in two of the possible
scenarios sea levels would rise four to six metres.
	   While most of the sea-level increase would occur beyond the
twenty-first century for several hundreds of years, the process
could begin in as early as 50 years. Some reports said the process
already had begun. In the other scenario, Oppenheimer believed that
internal ice shifting within the ice sheet possibly could cause the
melting to slow down.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Tues. - The Penang DAP was split 8-8 last night
when it voted on whether the two suspended national officials and
another who was removed from his position should be allowed to
present their case to the members.
	   The deadlock, sources said, had thrown the party into the deep
end as Penang is its power base.
	   On June 3, the DAP's central executive committee suspended
national vice-chairman Liew Ah Kim and treasurer Fung Ket Wing for
criticising the leadership. National publicity secretary Wee Choo
Keong was removed from his position.
	   Of the 18 State DAP committee members, one abstained while
another was not present. The meeting was chaired by Penang DAP
chairman Teoh Teik Huat.
	   Those in favour were Teoh, deputy chairman Gooi Hock Seng,
political bureau chief K. Balasundram, treasurer Cheah Teik Hoe,
youth chief Te Beng Hai, Ong Hock Hun, Ong Eng Khuan and organising
secretary Goh Kheng Huat.
	   Those against were State vice-chairmen Lim Hock Seng and
Zulkifli Ismail, secretary Chow Kon Yeow, publicity chief and Batu
Lanchang State Assemblywoman Chong Eng, Gooi Seong Kin who is
Secretary-general Lim Kit Siang's political secretary, women's
chief Wong Good Yew, Tan Mei Ling and Danny Lauw. Phee Boon Poh
abstained while K. Raman did not vote.
	   Chow said the matter was only ``discussed in passing and not in
detail.''
	   He said the State committee had yet to decide if a formal
meeting should be held to discuss the matter after being briefed by
Kit Siang tonight.
	   However, party sources said it was heading towards a major
crisis.
	   They said the matter was discussed when the three requested that
they be given a fair chance to explain matters.
	   The Penang DAP has about 2,000 registered members. They said it
would be unfair if the committee members only heard Kit Siang.
	   Liew, Fung and Wee have been referred to the disciplinary
committee headed by vice-chairman Ahmad Nor for further action.
Until the board meets, they will remain as CEC members.
	   Liew, Fung and Wee however called for an ``independent and
impartial''
	   committee to investigate the charges against them.
	   Kit Siang claimed that they had made statements that had
undermined party morale, created confusion and caused disharmony as
well as disunity.
	   He had said the decision to remove them followed complaints from
the Malacca and Perak State committees.

World Cup: ``Magic Garden'' gives surreal opening to World Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. DENIS, France, (AP) _ Bugs on stilts, floating soccer balls
and trumpeting bungee jumpers gave a surreal tone to the opening of
the 16th World Cup.
	   As the ``wave'' went around, 600 acrobats and volunteers acted
out the planting of a ``magic garden'' in Stade de France stadium,
where Brazil and Scotland kicked off the competition minutes later.
	   The crowd of 80,000 laughed and cheered as a lone soccer ball,
steered by remote control, rolled elusively around the pitch, with
five ballboys in vain pursuit.
	   Stiltwalkers dressed as striped insects stalked among 380 pudgy
green ``hedge hoppers'' who brought a rippling, 8,000 square-meter
canvas on to the field.
	   As the stilt bugs sowed the canvas with yellow ``pollen'' helium
balloons, 10 bug-costumed acrobats _ current or former members of
the French trampoline team _ bounced up from beneath. Giant flowers
of red, orange, pink and yellow sprouted and a soccer ball arose
from each, exploding with hundreds of balloons.
	   Organizers said the ceremony was cleared with aviation
authorities to keep the 3,000 balloons from interfering with air
traffic.
	   The surprise came from the roof, where 32 bungee jumpers with
trumpets spouting colored smoke and streamers leaped off and
dangled in mid-air, releasing flags of each country taking part in
the tournament.
	   Director Yves Pepin, whose idea was chosen from 20 submitted to
organizers, said the garden was a symbol for ``the most colorful of
dreams ... football dreams.''

Queen Mother unveils plaque to honor policeman killed in World War
</HEADLINE>
II

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's Queen Mother Elizabeth made it easier
Wednesday for Stephen Robertson to rest in peace.
	   The mother of Queen Elizabeth II, who lived in Buckingham Palace
with her husband King George VI throughout World War II, honored
the young policeman with a plaque on the spot where he was mortally
injured 57 years ago.
	   The ghostly figure of the police constable in his wartime
uniform is said to creep stealthily around the tombstone that marks
his grave at Chadwell Heath Cemetery. He has become a London legend
since his death in the line of duty in March 1941.
	   On that fatal night in the heat of the war, Robertson was
patrolling the garden outside the palace, while the king and queen
rested inside.
	   German bombers dropped a basket of phosphorous bombs on the area
Robertson was guarding, and the 25-year-old policeman fought to put
out the flames. Then, a second enemy aircraft scored a direct hit
on part of the building.
	   Stones from the destroyed area fell on Robertson, who mustered
his last energies to cry for help. He died in an ambulance.
	   His friends and former colleagues lobbied for the plaque and
suggested the royal family honor the constable. Many told the Queen
Mother on Wednesday that Robertson did not usually patrol the area
of the palace grounds where he died.
	   Irene Hunt, a close friend, said she spoke with him the day he
died.
	   ''He told me that he had changed duties and asked me to hold his
hand because it was dark at Buckingham Palace,'' she said.

	   SUHAIDI Samiran knows he has a bright future. As third officer
on board Puteri Delima, a liquefied natural gas (LNG) vessel
belonging to Petronas Tankers Sdn Bhd, this 23-year-old is being
groomed to be ``master of his own vessel''.
	   He is one of the young people in the company's Malaysianisation
programme. The country's LNG transportation sector, says Suhaidi,
has great demand for young people who aspire to be captains and
chief engineers.
	   ``The job pays very well, with basic necessities like food and
clothing covered. And by being at sea for months, we have the
opportunity to save.
	   To top it all, my monthly salary is also tax-free.
	   ``If you are the type who loves to travel, then this job is
definitely for you. I've been sailing for five years and it has
taken me to countries in the Middle East, Europe, North and South
America and all over Asia,''says Suhaidi.
	   Puteri Delima is one of the most advanced LNG vessels in its
class. The 274-metre-long ship is equipped with the latest
computer-controlled navigation and engine management system which
enables it to be operated unattended during the night.
	   With a top speed of 20 knots, she can bear a full load of more
than 58,800 tonnes of cargo. She is also capable of generating 2.9
megawatts of electricity and process about 20 tonnes of freshwater
from the sea for the boilers and crew's daily consumption.
	   The ship has three accommodation decks which can house more than
40 people in all, and basic amenities like a dining hall, kitchen,
lounge, recreation room, gym, swimming pool and laundry facilities.
	   Puteri Delima is one of five Petronas Tankers ships which
deliver LNG to Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. It takes six days for
a vessel to reach Tokyo Bay in Japan from Bintulu in Sarawak.
	   Suhaidi, like many of his fellow officers on board the Puteri
Delima, began his career at Akademi Laut Malaysia or ALAM in
Malacca before signing up as a deck cadet under a Petronas
scholarship.
	   ``I wasn't very sure about what I wanted to do after completing
my SPM exams and thought of taking up law or medicine. But when I
saw a advertisement for shipping cadets, I was attracted and knew
that I was on my way to becoming a professional sailor.
	   ``I chose a career on a ship because I love working in a tough
environment. Desk jobs, suits and ties aren't for me. My family
members are very supportive. I personally feel that the prospects
for young people are good although many might think it is not
rewarding.''
	   Suhaidi's understudy, Deck Cadet Mohd Hatta Salmongel, 20, feels
that many young people are not aware of the challenges and perks
that the maritime sector offers.
	   ``My father encouraged me to join the merchant navy after I told
him about my plans to sail with Petronas. The pay is comparatively
better than many other jobs I was considering.
	   ``There's lots of fun and adventure in sailing. I was very
nervous when I boarded and trained on a ship for the first time
because I was not used to the conditions at sea. I have three more
years of training at sea and am looking forward to putting in about
15 to 20 years in this career,'' says Hatta.
	   To sign up as shipping cadets, the minimum qualification is a
Grade One in SPM with distinctions in science, physics and
mathematics. Prospective applicants should also be physically fit
with good eyesight, be able to swim and willing to endure long
trips away from home.
	   Supervising Suhaidi and Hatta is Captain Derek Wallace, a
55-year-old Briton who thinks highly of his junior officers.
	   ``I've been with many Malaysian cadets for over 10 years in
other vessels of similar capacity. These young men are very
enthusiastic because they pay very close attention to what they
have to learn.
	   ``They are well-behaved and polite compared to cadets in the UK.
But the only thing is, they need to speak out. Communication skills
are an important factor in keeping the ship going.
	   ``Many of the earlier batches of cadets were fluent in English
but I find the later batches less proficient. They have to buck up
because English is an internationally-recognised seafaring
language,'' says Wallace.
	   As master of Puteri Delima, the man has a huge task in keeping
the morale of his men high and delivering his cargo on time and
incident-free.
	   This responsibility, he says, will soon be managed by the junior
officers and cadets once they are ready to take the helm.
	   Steering the ship to its designated course and managing the
safety procedures on board are the deck officer's job. But this
task would not be complete without marine engineers like Third
Engineer Sharmee Abdul Hamid.
	   The pursuit of knowledge and adventure travel lured him into the
maritime sector as third engineer on board Puteri Delima.
	   The 24-year-old was sent by Petronas Tankers to train at South
Tyneside Maritime College in Britain for four years before being
posted to serve on board several of the Puteri-class tankers.
	   As Puteri Delima's third engineer, Sharmee is required to sail
for a period of four months before breaking for two-month shore
leave. Leaving one's family behind is a tough thing to do but this
sacrifice, he says, must be made if a person decides to choose a
career at sea.
	   ``I have a tight schedule to keep which occupies most of my
time. As an engineer, I am responsible for ensuring that the ship
sails with no downtime.
	   ``The safety of this ship and its crew takes top priority. This
requires me to be alert and careful in managing the ship's
engineering system.
	   ``It definitely pays off to see a smooth voyage to our
destinations. The bonus here is the temporary shore leave we enjoy
once we offload the LNG at ports in Taiwan, South Korea and
Japan.''
	   Supervising the transfer of technology and nurturing the
knowledge of our young engineering officers are the tasks of Chief
Engineer David McCallum. The 47-year-old Scotsman, whose task is
similar to the ship's master, has four engineering cadets under his
wing.
	   McCallum feels that the young men are being pushed very hard to
achieve the objective of running the vessels on their own.
	   ``There are many aspects of managing a vessel of this class that
we can't learn from books. You will need years of practical
experience. ``It is my job to see to it that these men are trained
to carry out their jobs but my main concern is the rapid pace that
they have to go through. It is fine if they can absorb so many
things in such little time.
	   ``But the challenge here is to handle real-time crises at sea.
Such situations can erode their confidence if they do not have much
experience.
	   But on the whole, we have a group of fine young lads who are
very dedicated to their careers. I think with time, they would be
able to lead the country's next generation of maritime engineers,''
McCallum concludes.

Thousands of World Cup tickets still undelivered in Japan

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The planes are booked, the hotel rooms reserved,
and thousands of Japanese soccer fans are getting ready to cheer on
their national team in its World Cup debut this Sunday in France.
	   The only problem? Most of the tickets haven't arrived.
	   And Japan's tour operators are panicking.
	   Of the 14,700 tickets ordered for Japan's opening match Sunday
against Argentina, only 2,200 have been delivered, Jun Ishiyama,
spokesman for the Japan Association of Travel Agents, said
Wednesday at a news conference.
	   Five travel agencies decided to cancel their World Cup tours for
the Argentina match after the news conference because they fear
they won't receive the tickets in time, Kyodo news reported.
	   Other major tour operators who attended the press conference
said they may be forced to cancel as well.
	   Some of them even admitted they have considered using the black
market to acquire missing tickets.
	   ``I can't believe this,'' said Shigeki Murayama, managing
director of Nippon Travel Agency Co. ``We have organized many tours
in the past for variety of sports events, including Olympics, but a
problem like this has never happened.''
	   The tour agents have already paid ticket fees to the World Cup's
official organizing agents, and they had been ordered through
authorized vendors, Murayama said.
	   The tickets had been promised by mid-May, he said.
	   While apologizing to their customers, tour agency officials
placed the blame squarely with the French World Cup organizers.
	   ``Delay in ticketing by the World Cup organizers has caused the
trouble,'' said Tsutomu Igarashi of Japan Travel Bureau.
	   It was not immediately clear whether it was only Japanese tour
groups that were having the ticket problem.
	   Earlier in the day, JATA protested to the French department of
tourism, as well as the French Embassy in Tokyo, demanding an
investigation and explanation of what was causing the delay.
	   JATA's Ishiyama said the association is currently conducting a
survey of Japanese travel agencies who are organizing World Cup
tours, and will also send a written protest to the World Cup
organizers.
	   Japanese tour agents said they have not received a clear
explanation or apology from the event's officials.
	   Tour agency officials declined to disclose how many tickets had
been delivered for Japan's two remaining first round games.
	   But they said canceling tours for the first game alone would
cost them an enormous amount, especially for those who are flying
chartered flights to Paris.
	   The Japanese team, making its first ever World Cup finals debut
in the nation's soccer history, will play against Argentina on
Sunday in Toulouse, Croatia on June 20 in Nantes and Jamaica on
June 26 in Lyons.

	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ Adventurous words like ``audace''
_ daring _ haven't been heard much lately. French parlance again
has a touch of ``winning at all cost'' ahead of Friday's opening
match against South Africa.
	   Following a training session with a fully fit squad early
Wednesday, coach Aime Jacquet turned to tactics in the afternoon
and is expected to return to a much more conservative concept than
what was promised two months ago.
	   Gone are the thoughts of a three-man defense and a bolstered
attacking midfield. Back is the solid four-man defense and the two
defensive midfielders. Too much is at stake for any thoughts of
folly.
	   ``The important thing is to win,'' said playmaker Zinedine
Zidane, the man to whom the French will for to provide the creative
spice and add a sense of ``grandeur.''
	   ``The result before all, then it comes down to content,'' said
Jacquet, adding the first round games will all be ``close and
stressful.''
	   Youri Djorkaeff, who will be relied upon for a deft touch and
the inspirational pass, was very frank. ``We don't care to play
well and lose. We'd rather play bad and win.''
	   South Africa already has promised a physical game and a
defensive bulwark to contain the French in the first half before
hoping for a counter in the second to clinch a World Cup upset.
	   Jacquet warned his players not to throw caution to the wind, and
defensive backs Bixente Lizarazu and Lilian Thuram will have to
control their urges to make breaks on the wings so as not to expose
the defense to a counter.
	   It's a far cry from the days this spring when that grand Gallic
phrase ``audace'' was often on Jacquet's lips.
	   ``One does not exclude the other,'' he said Wednesday.
	   After Friday's game in Marseille, France plays Saudi Arabia on
June 18 and closes out its Group C campaign against Denmark on June
24.
	   The final two days ahead of the opening match will be spent
working on set pieces and on improving the flow from Zidane and
Djorkaeff to the forwards. Despite inspirational performances from
20-year-old David Trezeguet, Jacquet is expected to start Zidane's
pal Christophe Dugarry and the French leagues leading scorer
Stephane Guivarc'h.
	   The striker has only one goal in seven internationals,
increasing fears that France will rarely get more than one goal out
of a game.
	   ``If I don't score, it's because there are no chances,'' said
Guivarc'h.
	   That defense may have to come to the rescue again.
	   Central defender Laurent Blanc has saved France on countless
occasions, scoring a dozen goals for Les Bleus, which makes him
second in the scoring list among the 22.

	   RECENTLY, my brother, two sisters and I decided to buy our
father a gift, to show our appreciation for all his efforts in
bringing us up to be good people.
	   It was just a small gift, something that he needed badly in the
past few months but couldn't get around to buying, for obvious
reasons.
	   My brother and sisters made a collection. But not finding enough
to buy the gift, my mother chipped in and even included a small
card to go with it.
	   Having wrapped the gift, we all waited anxiously for dear Papa
to come home from work, and as soon as he arrived we presented him
the gift, accompanied by kisses and hugs.
	   Papa was very surprised as it was not his birthday nor an
occasion for gifts, and asked what it was for.
	   We replied that it was a gesture to show our love and gratitude,
seeing how hard he slogged everyday to earn enough money for all of
us, and especially knowing from our mother how he used to take with
him just a slice of bread for lunch in the office.
	   As an ordinary worker his pay is just enough for us to get by
each month, without any savings and treats that others may have,
like the occasional outings or new clothes.
	   Although we have what we want in terms of necessities, we do not
buy something new when we can still use whatever we have, like torn
shoes, faded and shrunk school uniforms, and books borrowed from
neighbours or relatives.
	   When there is a need to wear something nice for a special
occasion, mother will quietly borrow them from her relatives
without telling Papa about it, and sometimes use old dresses,
sewing over them again and again to make them look new.
	   I remember the day when I had to attend school on Childrens'
Day, and mother had to cut my elder sister's dress to patch on to
my old one which was too short and tight for me.
	   Though the dress still looked old and faded I was happy because
it was comfortable, and clean.
	   Papa opened his present and was shocked to find what he had
wanted all along, a Thermos flask that he could put his coffee in
to bring to the office.
	   With bleary eyes he thanked all of us, carefully rewrapped the
present and quietly went to his room.
	   We were all so happy to see the joy on his face and thanked God
for being able to buy him the flask.
	   The next day Papa came home from work and brought several
T-shirts for all of us, plus some nasi bungkus for dinner.
	   We were of course overjoyed to see new clothings, and ate the
food.
	   Early next morning when all of us were getting ready for school,
we overheard mother asking Papa for his flask, as she wanted to
fill it with coffee for him to take to the office.
	   And then we heard from Papa that with the receipt he found in
the gift, he returned to the shop to exchange it for the T-shirts,
and also to buy the food.
	   This is pure love, a parent's sacrifice for his children in
times of hardship.
	   In spite of the difficult circumstances around us, he would
rather see us happy and comfortable than satisfy his own need.
	   What is a flask if he can continue to keep his family happy, and
to see that we have food and clothing.
	   Let us have faith in each other, and be happy with whatever we
have.
	   Let us not succumb to pressure when times are bad, but be
thankful for the small things that we have.
	   And let us slog on until we overcome our problems whatever they
are, so that we can proudly say that we have tried, and have
succeeded in helping each other out.

New uncertainty over death toll in German train wreck
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CELLE, Germany (AP) _ A week after postwar Germany's deadliest
train disaster, officials were still uncertain Wednesday about how
many people were killed in the crushed and twisted wreckage.
	   After lowering the death toll twice _ to 95 on Tuesday _ police
spokesman Michael Hanke said the number was now being raised.
``With certainty there were 96 dead, and possibly the number will
rise to 99,'' he said.
	   Forensic experts have been having trouble making a definitive
count because many of the bodies were mutilated.
	   In Hanover, 20 kilometers (13 miles) to the south, the Lower
Saxony state parliament held an hour of speeches and prayers in
honor of the victims of last Wednesday's crash.
	   The parliamentary president, Rolf Wernstedt, praised the efforts
of rescue workers and residents of Eschede, the village north of
Celle where the crash occurred.
	   Afterward, lawmakers joined rescue workers and victims'
relatives for a memorial service in Market Church, a restored
Gothic landmark that is the city's main church.
	   The service started at 11 a.m., around the same time that the
high-speed InterCity Express train derailed and slammed into the
support pillar of an overpass. The impact brought 200-300 tons of
concrete down onto the jackknifed passenger wagons.
	   ``It happened a week ago today at this time: the terrible noise
of destruction, the giant cloud of dust, the stillness and then the
screams,'' Lutheran Bishop Horst Hirschler said in his address to
mourners.

Tundra on fire in Russian Far East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Fires are burning in 10,000 hectares (almost
25,000 acres) of tundra in Russia's Far East, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said Wednesday.
	   The moss on the tundra in the Koryak region is dry and easily
catches fire, the news agency said. When the moss absorbs moisture
it serves as the staple food for reindeer in the Koryak region.
	   The region lacks easy access so there was little hope of brining
in firefighters, ITAR-Tass said, quoting the ministry for emergency
situations.

	   FOR years, the threesome Eddy Choong, David Choong and Amy
Choong were just about the best in the world of badminton.
	   Eddy and David combined with devastating effect and demolished
every pair before them; David and Amy won a string of mixed-doubles
titles against the strongest opposition; the immaculate Eddy won 48
national and international Singles titles - a feat that is unlikely
to be surpassed.
	   Eddy, David and Amy lived solely for badminton and their efforts
have been crowned.
	   In 1959, I had a first glimpse of the ``Terrible Twins'' of St
Michael Institution, Ng Boon Bee and Tan Yee Khan. Our team met
Perak schools in the North Zone final. The match was played in the
old market, a derelict, ramshackle building of the colonial era.
	   The firepower was awesome. Tan was lanky and tall. Ng, the
``Pocket Hercules'', could jump like a Jack-in-the-Box and smash
with devastating effect. Needless to say the Penang schoolboys were
packed off with a 5-0 defeat.
	   From such humble beginnings, they went from strength to strength
and before long were world champions.
	   The ice-cool Dane, Morten Frost, had dominated the badminton
world for umpteen years. Recently the world witnessed our coach,
through his magnificent, tactical manoeuvre bringing down his
former Danish teammates.
	   Well done, Frost! In the doubles, Ong Poh Lin is without a peer.
His usual partner was Ismail Marjan. In the Thomas Cup of 1948 and
1952, he combined effectively with Ooi Teik Hock to prevail.

Kinkel says hard drug use up 20 percent in Germany last year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Hard drug use in Germany rose 20 percent
last year and the damage ``must not be minimized,'' the German
foreign minister said Wednesday on the final day of the U.N.
special session on drugs.
	   Delegates from about 150 countries are expected to wrap up the
three-day conference Wednesday night by adopting a plan to curb
trafficking, money-laundering and narcotic cultivation by 2008.
	   During his speech to the conference, German Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel said drug users were ``getting younger all the time''
and the ``the range of drugs supplied ever wider.''
	   ``In Germany we have unfortunately since 1995 seen a steady
increase in the number of users of hard drugs, a rise of 20 percent
last year alone,'' Kinkel said without giving figures.
	   Kinkel urged greater international cooperation to curb
trafficking and applauded a recent declaration by China and
Southeast Asian nations to increase their own regional efforts to
combat drugs.
	   Kinkel indicated that Germany would not follow the example of
neighboring Netherlands and relax laws against ``soft'' drugs.
	   ``Drugs and the harm they do must not be minimized,'' he said.
``They are no token of the modern lifestyle.''
	   During the conference, leaders of drug-producing nations of
Latin America and Asia have blamed the global drug problem on
consumption in wealthy countries and begged them for help to
eradicate crops, offer farmers alternatives to growing cannabis,
coca and opium and for help in improving their own law enforcement.
	   ``Two or three years ago, people in Kyrgyzstan had only a
theoretical idea what heroin is,'' said Kubanychbek Jumaliev,
president of the former Soviet Central Asian republic. ``Nowadays,
it has become one of the main drugs on the illegal market.''
	   Before the conference, some private organizations criticized the
U.N. strategy, saying it was modeled on the U.S. ``war on drugs''
which they called an expensive failure.
	   ``Like the drug war itself, the U.N. drug summit was a
failure,'' said Dr. Ethan Nadelmann, director of the Lindesmith
Center which promotes alternative drug control strategies. ``Rather
than producing the intended unity, the drug summit exposed deep
divisions ... between drug war zealots who advocate spending on a
failed policy and the reformers who want new approaches to protect
our countries and our children.''
	   European delegates generally stressed the need for treatment and
rehabilitation of addicts, as well as programs to offer Third World
farmers incentives to stop growing narcotics.
	   During his speech Monday, President Clinton announced a dlrs 2
billion, five-year media campaign against drugs targeted at young
people. But U.S. officials were non-committal on U.N. proposals for
a growers' incentives program in Afghanistan, Myanmar and
elsewhere.
	   Washington opposes financing programs in countries which have
not been officially certified as U.S. allies in the drug war.
Neither Afghanistan nor Myanmar, formerly Burma, have been
certified.
	   Many countries resent the certification system as an insult to
sovereignty. Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo called for a
``balanced strategy'' in which ``no one can become the judge of
others and no one feels entitled to violate other countries' laws
for the sake of enforcing its own.''
	   But the conference has produced no calls from government
officials to follow the Dutch model and relax controls on ``soft
drugs.''
	   ``No government should jeopardize this situation by considering
to legalize narcotic drugs for other purposes than medical and
scientific ones,'' Danish Health Minister Carten Koch said Tuesday.

World Cup: Klinsmann says no deal yet with Los Angeles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ German captain Juergen Klinsmann said
Wednesday he had not made a deal to join the Major League Soccer
team Los Angeles Galaxy after the World Cup.
	   The 33-year-old striker was reacting to a report in the French
newspaper L'Equipe that he had reached a deal with the Galaxy a few
weeks ago.
	   L'Equipe said sources close to Alan Rothenberg, US Soccer chief,
had confirmed the agreement.
	   But Klinsmann denied it. ``It's all made up. there is no deal,''
he said at the German World Cup headquarters near Nice.
	   Klinsmann confirmed, however, that MLS officials had contacted
him in March.
	   ``I made it clear that I would decide only after the World
Cup,'' Klinsmann said.
	   Klinsmann is quitting the national team after the World Cup.
	   After a partly frustrating season, Klinsmann has left his London
club Tottenham and is without a club at the moment.

	   I REFER to Enoch Sng's letter (NST, May 27) on the New
Remuneration Scheme for civil servants which was introduced in 1992
and in particular, his claim that ``the NRS is beneficial to
Government employees, and the various workers' unions will vouch
for that''.
	   If the NRS is intrinsically beneficial, all teething problems
would have been ironed out by now, and we would not have a
continuous stream of complaints.
	   It is patently unreasonable for a so-called star performer to be
given a career-long monetary advantage over his colleagues on the
basis of a mere 12 months outstanding performance as perceived by
his superiors. A month or half-month's bonus is enough.
	   What happens if the so-called star performer under-performs
after being given a double or triple increment when no avenue
exists for withdrawal of these increments?
	   When department heads are appointed on a rotation basis (every
two years is not unusual) and the number of employees is large
(say, over 100), is it humanly possible for him to assess fairly?
Might not his judgment be superficial and impressionistic?
	   The NRS is indeed beneficial, but only to a handful of civil
servants, and at the unconscionable cost of disaffection among the
overwhelming majority.
	   Since everything hinges on the annual assessment by one's
superior and there is little transparency in the whole exercise,
the danger of abuse and favouritism is real, not imaginary.
	   As an ex-civil servant with nothing to gain, I sympathise with
my colleagues who are still in service, and whose esprit de corps
is slowly but surely being undermined by the inequities of the NRS.
	   At a time of national austerity, the Government can ill-afford
to stick to a remuneration scheme which is questionable and
unacceptable to the workers' unions.

	   BESIDES the moral duty of all to bring home their cash
investments abroad to contribute towards overcoming the economic
downturn, the Government has provided a further incentive by
exempting earnings brought in by individuals from abroad from
taxation until the end of the year.
	   While this is appreciated, the need for individuals to submit an
application to the Treasury is not understood. One would have
thought that such approval should be applicable only to funds being
taken out of the country.
	   Are there circumstances where approval will not be given by the
Treasury? This seems contrary to the official policy to get back as
much of the funds as possible from abroad! The hassle of obtaining
this approval will serve as a deterrent especially when
comparatively higher returns are available for investments
overseas.

Two Iranian papers stop publishing, one after losing its license
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ One of Iran's most popular newspapers,
Jameah or ``Society,'' had its license revoked Wednesday after its
editor was convicted of defamation.
	   The revocation came hours after a second newspaper ceased
publication because the Press Supervisory Board was accusing it of
unethical reporting.
	   The two moves are seen as a setback for the press freedom
promoted by moderate President Mohammad Khatami since he took
office in August.
	   A court banned the editor of Jameah, Hamid Reza Jalaipur, from
working in a similar position for one year and fined him 16 million
rials (dlrs 3,500), the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
	   The prosecution accused Jalaipur of publishing ``insults and
lies.'' The substance of the charge was not disclosed, but
state-run television has said that the Islamic Revolutionary Guards
Corps had accused the paper of falsely publishing that their
commander was opposed to liberalization.
	   Jameah is regarded as a newspaper that tests the limits of the
press freedom introduced since Khatami came to power. An afternoon
paper, its run of 200,000 copies sells out within hours.
	   The publisher of Gozaresh-e-Ruz, or Daily Report, Mohammad
Mahdavi Khorrami said he had voluntarily stopped publishing the
paper until a verdict in the case brought by the supervisory board,
a third newspaper, Salam, reported Wednesday.
	   The Justice Ministry is reviewing the complaint against
Gozaresh-e-Ruz. If the paper is prosecuted in court, it could also
lose its license.
	   A liberal publication, Gozaresh-e-Ruz was launched only last
month. On its third day it printed a front-page picture of a
teenage boy with a teenage girl wearing a head scarf. The caption,
``Friendship Under Fear,'' referred to the prohibition on dating
under Iran's strict Islamic code.
	   A Culture Ministry official, Ahmad Borqani, was quoted this week
as saying that Gozaresh-e-Ruz had followed ``quite an inappropriate
path from the beginning of its publication.''
	   Borqani told the Iran News that Gozaresh-e-Ruz had also printed
``a false report'' about Iranian officials transferring money to
overseas bank accounts.
	   The reforms introduced by Khatami are said to enjoy the support
of most Iranians. But conservative elements in the government,
particularly in the judiciary, are opposed to his policies.

Poland, World Bank discuss loan for mining restructuring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz met
with World Bank officials Wednesday to discuss loans totaling dlrs
1 billion for rescuing Poland's coal industry.
	   Balcerowicz said Poland has two weeks to present a detailed plan
to heal the once-thriving industry, which has debts exceeding 13.6
billion zlotys (dlrs 3.9 billion).
	   ``We can not wait. Losses are accumulating,'' said Balcerowicz,
who met with Basil Kovalsky, World Bank director for Poland and the
Baltic States.
	   The two agreed the mine industry must be privatized quickly.
Poland has already taken steps as part of overall industry reforms
in preparation for joining the European Union.
	   Over the next four years, 105,000 of Poland's 237,000 miners
will lose their jobs and coal production will be cut to 112 million
tons from 137 million tons last year.
	   By 2001, Poland expects the coal mines to turn a profit of 410
million zlotys (dollars 117 million).
	   World Bank director Kovalsky said the plan ``has the potential
to lay the basis for a competitive, efficient coal industry in
Poland.''
	   Coal mining, the leading hard-currency earner during communist
times, is still heavily subsidized under Poland's eight-year-old
market reforms. production.

	   MY brother recently enrolled in a local university and for the
first week was subjected to numerous, off-syllabus activities,
which included sleeping at 1am and waking up at 3am, being shouted
at and generally being inconvenienced.
	   It is hard to understand the limited mentality of such people
and their desire to maintain a tradition which is both infantile
and pointless.
	   As common sense would dictate, students who enrol at
universities are no longer children; they are to all intents and
purposes, adults. Why should adults be subjected to an introductory
period of humiliation and so-called
``getting-to-know-your-seniors''?
	   I graduated from a university in the United Kingdom where such a
tradition was nowhere to be seen, and yet a healthy student
atmosphere was apparent. That is why I propose that we abolish such
unhealthy practices.
	   Taken to extremes, we come across physical and mental abuse that
borders, and even crosses the line to criminal acts. Those guilty
of inflicting pain and humiliation on new students should not only
be expelled from their universities, but also be treated like
criminals.
	   The effect of such practice is three-fold.
	   First, it embodies a bullying attitude in senior students;
Second, it signifies that senior students are either retributive in
nature, and/or are lacking confidence in dealing with new students;
and third, each new generation of students will emerge into a
working society lacking in confidence due to the misplaced belief
that those before them should be feared merely because of
seniority.
	   The craving for ``control'' over the freshman, or to ensure the
freshman is courteous, polite, respectful towards them shows an
almost perverse desire for power without having the intelligence to
do so in a more constructive way.
	   In our pursuit to be recognised as a developed and civilised
nation, such absurd customs should be left in the past, where they
rightfully belong.

	   IT is disappointing that many of us were deprived of a live
telecast of the English FA Cup final between Arsenal and Newcastle.
	   Ever since Astro took over the rights to televise English
football matches, we were left with delayed telecasts or highlights
of some important matches.
	   We appreciate RTM's effort, but there is nothing like live match
broadcasts.
	   I hope TV3 or RTM will take the initiative to obtain the rights
to English football matches before the new season begins.

	   Visions of garbage-fueled ``Back-To-The-Future'' cars became
more of a reality Tuesday as a two-day international conference on
the use of non-polluting ethanol fuel came to a close The
conference's purpose was to promote the production and use of
ethanol as a clean transport fuel. Ethanol is obtained from
renewable resources such as corn, sugar cane and any other organic
substances.
	   Sweden uses a variety of cellulose fibers such as potatoes,
wheat and wine in its ethanol production, Swedish Ambassador Karin
Elmbom said.
	   Ethanol is an alcohol that can be blended with or used in place
of current petroleum-based fuel products. ``Essentially anything
that has cells can someday be turned into a clean fuel,'' Elmbom
said. That means any organic waste material, including everyday
household garbage, could someday be converted into fuel energy. The
drawbacks in the use of cellulose are the lack of technology and
high production costs involved.
	   ``The prospect of putting our potatoes to use in another form is
certainly interesting, but we're going to have to weigh the
costs,'' National Confederation of Potato Producer's Executive
Director Ana Cecilia Rios said.
	   The conversion speed for producing ethanol alcohol from
cellulose material is, however, much longer due to its smaller
sugar content making the process more costly.
	   ``At this point it's technically tougher to produce ethanol from
cellulose than corn, for example,'' said Dave Loos, a member of the
U.S. Governor's Ethanol Coalition (GEC). Loos was at the conference
along with other U.S. officials to discuss Illinois state's success
with using corn in ethanol production. ``In Chicago, 90 percent of
the gas contains 10 percent ethanol, which not only significantly
reduces the effects of ozone depletion, but gives our corn
producers another revenue outlet'' said Loos.
	   Ethanol burns to produce water and carbon dioxide, a global
warming gas. It does not, however, produce acid-rain pollutants
such as sulfur or nitrogen oxides.
	   Since the introduction of the Gas Reformulation Bill - an
amendment to the Clean Air Act in 1990 mandating the phase in of
corn-based ethanol fuel in highly polluted U.S. cities - the price
of a bushel of corn has increased 20 percent. Phoenix, Ariz.,
Albuquerque, N.M. and most recently Las Vegas, Nev. fall under this
pollution-control mandate while many cities in California have
adopted similar measures.
	   New investment such as the construction of a 65-million-dollar
ethanol processing facility in Freeport, Ill. makes ethanol even
more appealing. The site will employ 25 people and will encourage
several other spin-off industries.
	   Mexican sugar cane growers want a piece of the action, as well.
Following dramatically reduced demand for Mexican sugar due to an
increase in the use of high fructose corn syrup, sugar cane used
for ethanol could revive sugar's tenuous market situation. Brazil
currently uses sugar cane for ethanol production and now mandates a
22-percent blend for a majority of its gasoline. 17-20 percent of
the cars - primarily Volkswagens made in Mexico and modified for
Brazil - run on 100-percent ethanol.
	   As a result of the conference, the GEC has decided to form an
alliance with the Mexican governors of sugar-producing states.
	   Not everyone is completely optimistic, though. ``I'm just not
sure if the economics are here in Mexico - I imagine ethanol is
going to need some type of subsidy to make it interesting for
investors,'' said agro-economist Ken Shwedel.
	   The United States just extended a 5.4-cents-a-gallon subsidy
until 2007 for ethanol production and now produces over 1.5 billion
gallons annually.
	   Ethanol, potentially seen as competition to Mexico's monopolized
petroleum market, may also have to overcome difficult political
obstacles to be successfully introduced in this country.
	   ``I think Pemex (Petroleos de Mexico) could really learn from
the Brazil experience,'' said Jeffrey Knight of the Wisconsin State
Department of Administration. ``Brazil has been successful in
integrating petroleum interests to make the fuel non-threatening to
the oil industry,'' he said.
	   Amoco Oil Company has taken the lead in the United States on
funding ethanol projects and research and British Petroleum and
Shell have also stepped into the ring. ``I'm not sure if these
companies are getting involved to appear environmentally friendly,
or just because it makes good sense,'' said Loos.
	   A foreign oil industry official said Pemex is in a great
position to get involved in ethanol because it already has access
to some of the chemical bases needed for processing. The only thing
lacking, he said, is a little vision and coordination on behalf of
Pemex executives.
	   Luis Tellez, Mexico's Energy Secretary gave a positive welcome
at the start of the conference saying that his department is open
to any new ideas and wants to strengthen ties to other energy
sectors.
	   ``It's encouraging to see his (Tellez's) participation in the
conference. It seems to me he is doing some pretty innovative
things,'' Shwedel said.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Tues. - A cashier spent just two weeks to siphon
about RM12.5 million from a Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Bhd branch in
Johor before disappearing overseas with RM5 million, it was
revealed today.
	   Initial police investigations showed that the 43-year-old man
might have used forged travel documents to flee either to China or
to Hong Kong.
	   Johor police have contacted the Interpol branch at the Federal
police heaquarters in Bukit Aman to facilitate investigations to
track down the fugitive.
	   It was learnt that the cashier - who had been solely responsible
for handling money at the BBMB branch in Johor Baru - had allegedly
kept aside a large sum of money daily to deposit into a fixed
deposit account in his name, at a Hongkong Bank Malaysia Bhd
branch.
	   It is believed he had been doing this for about two weeks in
April, taking out cash daily.
	   Following this, he went on leave for an unspecified number of
days and then failed to return to work.
	   Suspecting something amiss after the man's family had also
failed to locate him, the BBMB branch initiated an audit check. The
probe led to the discovery of discrepancies in documents relating
to cash deposits and withdrawals which were initialled by the
cashier.
	   When bank officials discovered that the man might have siphoned
about RM12.5 million, they lodged a police report at the Johor Baru
Central police station on April 30.
	   The NST understands that following the discovery of the loss,
the branch manager and his deputy were suspended, pending an
internal inquiry.
	   Police contacted Bank Negara in order to freeze all accounts in
the man's name and managed to recover RM7.5 million which was still
in his fixed deposit account at the Hongkong Bank Malaysia Bhd.
	   Johor Criminal Investigation Department chief Senior Assistant
Commissioner II Mohd Mokhtar Hassan said police were trying to
determine whether the alleged siphoning of funds was a one-man
operation or whether the fugitive might have had accomplices.

	   The Citizens' Debtors Assembly (ACDB) appealed Tuesday to
opposition parties to end congressional negotiations on the bank
bailout fund (Fobaproa) issues, and to propose alternative options.
	   ``Banks should be given a deadline to recapitalize, absorb their
losses, and should negotiate individually with debtors to recover
part of their losses,'' said ACDB representative Gerardo Fernandez.
	   ``The Party of the Democratic Revolution and National Action
Party (PRD and PAN) are deceiving the public because their
negotiations in Congress will benefit only a small amount of
bankers,'' he said. To date, Fobaproa has overtaken 550 billion
pesos in bad bank loans, and the debt is increasing as banks are
being paid interest for some of the debt that was converted into
10-year bonds at cetes- (treasury notes) fixed interest rates.
	   Fernandez questions why cetes, more profitable for banks but an
extra burden for taxpayers, were issued instead of UDIs
(inflation-fixed treasury notes). UDIs would conserve the value of
money more, ``while cetes cause taxpayers to take on more debt.''To
annually prop up the cost of Fobaproa in interest rates alone,
Fernandez said ``government earnings need to increase by about 12
percent.''Both left-of-center PRD and right-leaning PAN have
threatened to stop the financial reform package in Congress if
Fobaproa issues are not dealt with.
	   ``Mexican citizens' position and responsibility, represented by
Congress, is not one of negotiating for anything, not for
democratic or political reform,'' Fernandez said.
	   Mishandling of Fobaproa in other ways has increased taxpayer
debt unfairly.
	   ``Fobaproa helps recapitalize banks that in theory will be
resold to foreign banks at ridiculous prices, take Citibank for
example,'' he said.
	   Analysts find it hard to lend credence to all debtor
organizations, however.
	   ``Populist groups are trying to get attention through publicity
stunts, so its hard to get any credibility,'' said Patrick Boucher,
Santander brokerage banking analyst.
	   Some of these groups do ``whatever is possible to get out of
their obligations,'' he said.
	   But not all are irresponsible. It is important to tell the
difference between groups that provide feasible solutions and those
that try to escape their debt, he said.

Ames returns to Europe after visa problems in U.S.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SLALEY, England (AP) _ Trinidadian golfer Stephen Ames returns
to the European tour Thursday after visa problems forced him to
leave the U.S. circuit.
	   Ames, forced to withdraw from U.S. Open qualifying, will play in
the 650,000 pound (dlrs 1.07 million) European Grand Prix
tournament at Slaley Hall near Newcastle.
	   The 34-year-old also plans to play in the Irish Open and the
Loch Lomond tournament leading up to the British Open, after which
he hopes his visa problems will be resolved and he can return to
the U.S. tour.
	   ``It's a sourish note why I'm here but I'm just looking forward
to playing some golf again. I've done nothing since May,'' he said.
	   Ames, who first played on the European tour in 1992 after a
similar visa problem in the United States, said his current
predicament could not have come at a worse time.
	   ``I was playing the best golf of my life,'' he said.
	   ``It's an administrative problem,'' he added. ``I have a visa
which I thought extended to the end of the year but when I left my
home in Canada to play in Texas three weeks ago I wasn't allowed in
and an immigration official told me the visa had expired.''
	   Ames has won 457,300 pounds (dlrs 750,000) in five seasons on
the European tour and is a favorite for the tournament starting
Thursday as most of Europe's big names opted to prepare for the
U.S. Open.

	   A NEWSPAPER report that the vast Endau-Rompin area has fewer
than five rhinoceroses from the 20 to 25 animals five years ago is
a clear indication of the increasing threat to Malaysian wildlife
and their habitats posed by the country's rapid development.
	   Thanks to the environment-conscious local print media, the
public has been reminded time and again that not only are the
Malaysian rhinos being threatened but also the tigers, tapir, orang
utan, elephants, leatherback turtles and river terrapins. In fact,
they are on the brink of extinction, included among the endangered
species in the World Conservation Union's red list. The country has
already lost two species - the Javan rhino and the green peafowl -
which once roamed the lowland regions. An anxious Wildlife and
National Parks Department has reported that the list of mammals and
birds under threat is growing. It laments that most of the
wildlife's habitat is in forests outside its jurisdiction and this
has impeded efforts to protect the animals.
	   Against this grim scenario, it was thus most appropriate that
Malaysia became the second country in Southeast Asia on Monday to
adopt the Asian Conservation Awareness Programme. The programme
will provide the opportunity to non-governmental organisations, the
private sector and the public to be actively involved in the
conservation of threatened wildlife.
	   The multimedia campaign launched to create awareness about the
possible extinction of endangered species caused by consumption and
buying of wildlife body parts appears to have the essential
ingredients to get the message across. The message ``When the
buying stops, the killing too''
	   should jolt the conscience of those who unknowingly contribute
to wildlife extinction. It is true that many people, particularly
the East Asian community and their overseas communities, may have
unwittingly contributed to endangering wildwife through regular
demand for medicine and other health products, ornaments and
jewellery made from animal body parts.
	   Belief in and adherence to traditional practices and ignorance
are contributory factors.
	   At home, it is encouraging that increasingly the Federal
authorities are moving towards greater protection of the country's
rich flora and fauna, particularly the endangered species. It is
the hope of those concerned with the environment that the new
National Biodiversity Policy will see better conservation of
wildlife resources, including some 6,000 animal species.
Undeniably, the policy can only be effective if State Governments
take the lead in its implementation as matters relating to land and
resources on land fall under their jurisdiction.
	   Globally, the campaign against the wildlife trade remains a
tough battle as it is lucrative and has a huge network. The
multi-billion dollar illegal wildlife trade ranks third after the
dadah and black market arms business. From the marketable products
which poachers can extract from the rhinos, bears, tigers,
elephants and turtles, it is not surprising that specific species
have been targeted for the protection programme. An arduous task
ahead for concerned countries notwithstanding, an all-out sustained
international effort towards depriving the traders of a market
through education and tough legislation coupled with stringent
enforcement, will undoubtedly have a potent effect given time.
There should be no let-up on this.

	   NOT since Joh Bjelke-Petersen a decade ago has Queensland
figured as much in national life. Queenslanders in the sunbelt
northern Australian State go to the polls on Saturday with more
than the answer on who will form the next State Government hinging
on the results.
	   Prime Minister John Howard is keeping a close watch, as he
contemplates calling his own snap Federal election. So too his
fellow conservative partners in the Federal coalition Government,
the opposition Labor Party, and every one with an interest in where
Australia is headed.
	   Around this State election, the tensions of time-worn Australian
social division are building up to a new defining moment: country
suspicion of city, poor standing up to rich, black against white,
new immigrant versus Old Australian, battlers taking on the elite.
	   Just as with the then Queensland Premier Bjelke-Petersen in
1987, the tension is centred on one individual - this time on
Bjelke-Petersen's fellow Queenslander Pauline Hanson.
	   And just as with the failed Joh-for-Canberra campaign to draft
Bjelke- Petersen as leader of the Federal Government, the Hanson
appeal is to extreme conservatism. As with Queensland then, the
tide is surging from the heartland of populist simplicity - this
time diffused in a backlash against economic and cultural
insecurity.
	   Hanson, far from being the meteorite that Howard dismissed her
to be, has surfaced as the rock on which Howard's Liberal Party,
governing in coalition with the rural-based National Party, might
flounder.
	   Polls show the Liberal-National coalition Government in
Queensland is in danger of being routed. The opposition Labor Party
will be voted in to government with a big majority.
	   Ominously, Hanson's One Nation party could win up to four seats.
At the very least, it could hold the balance of power in the State
Parliament.
	   The inconvenience that would pose to State governance is the
least of concerns. The worry is what the rise of One Nation is seen
to mean, for Australian attitude to One Nation.
	   Queensland is the first electoral test for Hansonism, where One
Nation is putting up 79 candidates for the 89-seat Parliament.
	   Hanson herself had come into politics as an independent member
of the Federal Parliament. It was her controversial maiden speech
in Parliament in September 1996 that catapulted her into prominence
as the face of bigotry in Australia, spawning a phenomenon that
inspired the formation of the One Nation party.
	   A strong showing by One Nation in Queensland spells trouble for
the Federal election that Howard is poised to call. There, too, the
electoral fortune of the Howard Government is of secondary concern.
	   `Hansonism' threatens the very heart of Australian social
cohesion, and Australia's place in the region. As the former
Liberal Party leader John Hewson puts it, ``our aspirations for
integration with, recognition by, and leadership in Asia (will be)
annihilated''.
	   A credible showing by One Nation in electoral contests will
reinforce perceptions of a resurgence of racism in Australia. It
will stall the cause of Aboriginal reconciliation, and Australia's
engagement with the global community.
	   Howard last week launched his first personal attack on Hanson,
accusing her of fanning racism with behaviour verging on those of
the deranged.
	   Hanson had renewed her attack on the ``Aboriginal industry'' in
another speech in Parliament. It was a performance calculated to
milk publicity for One Nation in Queensland.
	   To the political pundits, Howard had played into the hands of
One Nation. Hanson is seen to have finally succeeded in goading
Howard into acknowledging her as a force in Australian politics.
	   The Howard reaction does not hearten the likes of social
researcher Hugh Mackay. ``The answer to Hansonism is not to clobber
Mrs Hanson but to offer an alternative view of Australia and a
superior set of values,'' says Mackay.
	   Howard is seen to fall short on that score. While raising his
voice against Hanson, he continues to refuse to write One Nation
off in his coalition Government's electioneering strategy.
	   He refuses to direct his party members standing for election not
to direct preferences to One Nation candidates.
	   Voting in Australia is compulsory, but elections are not
determined by a simple majority. A single-member preferential
voting system is used to ensure the winning candidate ultimately
has the support of the majority of voters.
	   In an electorate with more than two candidates, voters are
required to rank all candidates in order of preference, with the
votes of minor candidates distributed to the remaining candidates
until a majority is determined.
	   Thus in how-to-vote cards, candidates tell their supporters who
to direct their second and subsequent preferences to.
	   Howard has refused to tell his party members what to do about
One Nation candidates. Not only that, his State colleagues in
Queensland have directed their party members to put One Nation
ahead of the Labor Party in the elections.
	   The decision flies in the face of strong feeling among
conservative party members at State and national levels. They
include Howard's deputy, Treasurer Peter Costello, other State
premiers, and party elders such as former Prime Minister Malcolm
Fraser.
	   The decision smacks of the worst form of political expediency,
says Fraser. It gives One Nation a respectability it does not
deserve, at a time when its support is surging among disenchanted
voters espousing all sorts of causes.
	   Racism is only the most obvious ugly face of Hansonism. The
phenomenon is riding the tide of disillusionment with mainstream
politics, bringing together under one banner the most unlikely of
bedfellows.
	   Extremists of the ``lunar Right'' are marching in step with
members of the gun lobby, conspiracy theorists railing against the
loss of national sovereignty to global governance, economic
nationalists, supporters of the environmental movement and
population control, and people opposed to the multicultural and
Aboriginal ``industries''.
	   One thread through these disparate interests are libertarians
reacting against the ``thought police'' of mainstream politics, the
media and other institutions, and their alleged stifling of
political debate.
	   Some among the disparate interests vehemently stand up to
racism. Like journalist Paul Sheehan, who three weeks ago published
a book seen as likely to be taken up as ``the bible'' that the
semi-literate Hanson and her advisers neither had the brains nor
ability to articulate.
	   Sheehan's Among the Barbarians: The Dividing of Australia, went
into a second reprint days after its launch.
	   Sheehan is no redneck Hanson supporter. Indigenous rights and
culture ``are at the very centre of the Australian soul'', he
writes in an article inspired by his new-found fame.
	   The dramatic change in Australia's racial and ethnic mix since
World War II ``is one of the world's most successful cultural
transformations''.
	   And Asian immigrants ``have provided a jolt of energy and talent
that Australia needed''.
	   To Sheehan, the suppression of debate is a defining reality in
Australian politics in the 1990s. ``The deliberate submerging of
these issues, and the resentment against those who have imposed the
silences, is the real strength of Hanson,'' he says. ``It is not
her policies.''
	   Caught up in all this high-brow debate, and the repugnance of
racism, is the basic insecurity of country Australia, from which
Hanson draws most support.
	   ``The rise and rise of Pauline Hanson can be directly attributed
to the major political parties and their total lack of
understanding of life in the bush,'' one Letter to the Editor came
in from small-town Wonthaggi.
	   Country people can relate to Hanson's ``nervousness and lack of
understanding of the big picture''. As with any rural community,
life is ``pretty simple''. The fears of the community have little
to do with Aboriginal land rights and immigration from Asia. They
fear the loss of tariff protection and the ``not-so-level playing
field''.
	   This sentiment is strong at a time when a Bureau of Statistics
study on social trends shows that in the decade since the
Joh-for-Canberra drive, Australia has become richer, healthier and
cleverer, but not quite sharing it around. The rich are getting
richer, and the poor poorer.
	   ``Racism has no place in Australian society, town or country,
but will fester as rural communities slip further into recession,''
writes Mark Rennie in his letter to The Age.
	   ``History shows us that the first victim of hardship is
tolerance.''
	   The Queensland result will hold valuable lessons for Canberra.

	   U.S. and Mexican Cabinet members, as well as presidents Clinton
and Zedillo are set to start high-level talks in Washington D.C.
once the U.N. special summit on drug-trafficking finishes.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and her Mexican
counterpart, Foreign Relations Secretary Rosario Green, will head
delegations starting Wednesday that will focus on border issues and
how both countries can work together to halt drug-trafficking.
	   The two-day meeting will be the 15th binational conference
between Cabinet leaders from Mexico and the United States.
	   Fourteen working groups will tackle such varying issues such as
immigration, drug-trafficking, money-laundering, science and
technology, education and border issues, among others, said Jose A.
Zabalgoitia, spokesman for the Mexican Embassy in Washington. About
eight or nine Zedillo Cabinet members will attend the meeting,
Zabalgoitia said.
	   U.S. State Department Press Secretary Michael Hahn said a
similar number of Cabinet members from President Clinton's
administration will be attending.
	   The work sessions will be held after Zedillo and Clinton meet in
New York at a special U.N.
	   anti-drug summit, which focuses on controlling drug-trafficking.
Both leaders will discuss the Casablanca money-laundering
operation, as well.
	   After the meeting, Clinton and Zedillo will deliver a public
release together announcing ``greater cooperation in the war
against drugs'' by both Mexico and the United States.
	   It is possible that Mexican secretaries will hold interviews
with Clinton on Thursday, Hahn said.
	   It is suspected that both will discuss Operation Casablanca, an
affair that has caused a great deal of friction between both
countries.

	   AS the clock ticks towards the World Cup '98 kick-off between
Brazil and Scotland (11.30 tonight), it's time to file away the
facts, figures, vital details and trivia on players and teams
meeting in France.
	   Where does a fan start?
	   AllSports' seven commemorative and special editions - all
published by Sunburst Communications - on this 16th soccer series
make an ideal curtain-raiser.
	   World Cup '98 (available in English, Bahasa Malaysia, Mandarin
and Tamil) traces the history of the Cup, from its inaugural match
in Montevideo, Uruguay, in July 1930, to the last meet in the
United States four years back.
	   This year, 32 teams will play in 64 matches - an increase over
the 24 and 52, respectively, in 1994. (Only 13 countries were
represented in Montevideo.) Japan, South Africa, Croatia and
Jamaica are making their Finals debut.
	   The magazine introduces the 10 host cities and venues, and lists
the match guides and tables of the eight groupings. The
complimentary wall chart should help diehards keep track of who's
playing who, when, and the scores.
	   Bookmakers favour reigning champions Brazil to lift the Cup for
a fifth time, and the task of turning on the magic rests on hotshot
Finals debutant Ronaldo (a reserve in the last tournament). Can the
richest footballer in the world deliver, without Romario as
partner? Will three- time winners Italy and Germany equal Brazil's
feat? Where do France, England and Argentina stand in the
competition?
	   As they say, the ball - which, by the way, has been modified
over the years - is round, and the team with the right combination
of skills, tactical know-how, grit and luck will lift the FIFA
World Cup, a trophy that has its own special story.
	   The current official match ball, called the Tricolore, is
designed to fly higher, faster and straighter - making it a
nightmare for goalkeepers.
	   Is there a `Dream Team of the 20th century'? Yes, and AllSports'
line-up includes ``Kaiser'' Franz Beckenbauer; Bobby Moore, who
skippered England's victory in 1966; ``Hand of God'' scorer
Maradona; 1974 Dutch captain Johan Cruyff; Eusebio, alias the
``Black Pearl'', top scorer (nine goals) for third-placed Portugal
in 1966; and the inimitable Pele, who made his debut at 17 in
Sweden 40 years ago. The publishers also pick the 16 teams expected
to make the second round.
	   Both selections grace the pages of World Cup '98 Superstars
(editions in English and Bahasa). These tabloid-sized mags provide
full pin-ups of 39 top footballers and all the competing teams,
plus leading goal scorers in the last 68 years. They also profile
the coaches, a good number of whom were key players in their time.
	   France '98 also packs morsels on match venues and schedules. Its
bonus is a Star Parade of those expected to shine on French turf.
	   Brazil, which claimed permanent possession of the original Jules
Rimet Trophy after being the first to win a hattrick (1958, 1962,
1970), takes front spot in this magazine's Hall of Fame. Readers
also get to walk down memory lane with the players who figured most
in the decades dating back to 1930.
	   Don't miss the bite-size items on what happened during USA '94.
Reports had it that French husbands, fevered by wives calling them
to the dinner table in the midst of matches, often turned violent.
Over 10 per cent of battered wives blamed the World Cup for their
bruises and welts.
	   Many Thai schools closed a day after the final match, to enable
students to catch up on sleep! Over in Rio de Janeiro, a Brazil fan
stabbed his brother-in-law to death for supporting Italy, the
losing finalist.
	   All in, these World Cup publications provide a wealth of
information on a sporting fest that's expected to attract 37
billion television viewers worldwide (32 billion previously) over
the next 33 days. The range of their focus - from country flags to
team crests to top-ranking goal scorers and the arduous road
leading to France - should keep readers in top form till July 12.

Nordic weapons makers announce joint venture company
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Three Nordic defense industry firms
announced plans Wednesday to form an ammunition company.
	   Norway's Raufoss AS, Sweden's Celsius AB and Finland's Patria
Industrier OY said their joint venture would have its headquarters
in Norway and operate under the name Nordisk Amunisjonshus, or the
Nammo group.
	   Norway is a member of the NATO alliance, while Sweden and
Finland are neutral.
	   The new company, being created from the ammunitions divisions of
all three firms, will have about 1,400 employees and an annual
turnover of roughly 1.5 billion kroner (dlrs 200 million).
	   Raufoss will own a 45 percent stake, while Celsius and Patria
will share the remaining 55 percent.

	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Fighting broke out Wednesday
between Eritrean and Ethiopian troops in or near a contested border
area in northwestern Ethiopia, and both sides once again accused
the other of striking first.
	   A proposal by Eritrea that Egypt and possibly other African
nations join the United States and Rwanda in attempts at mediation
risked further complicating the situation in the already volatile
Horn of Africa.
	   ``Eritrean forces attacked our biggest post on the Badme-Shiraro
front at Erde Mattios, and fighting is continuing,'' Ethiopian
government spokeswoman Salome Tadesse said.
	   She said Erde Mattios lies south of the Tekeze River, outside
the so-called Yirga triangle, a 400-square-kilometer
(160-square-mile) contested slice of northwestern Tigray province.
	   The Eritrean News Agency, however, said Ethiopian forces
attacked Eritrean troops ``in the Badme area inside Eritrean
territory.''
	   Meanwhile, a U.S. team trying to facilitate a peaceful
settlement to the hostilities was expected back in Addis Ababa
later Wednesday, diplomatic sources said. It would be the third
time U.S. facilitators had travelled to the Ethiopian capital since
the simmering border dispute erupted into fighting on May 6.
	   The United States and Rwanda have put forth a four-point
proposal to stop the fighting and start talks. Ethiopia accepted,
but Eritrea demurred, claiming the plan, which suggests that
Eritrea withdraw to positions it held before May 6, needed more
work.
	   ``The proposal as it exists is still on the table and is still
valid,'' said a Western diplomat, on condition of not being further
identified. He added, however, that the plan could be ``worked on
around the edges.''
	   Regional military sources say that under the plan, Rwanda would
supply the peacekeeping forces to enforce demilitarization of
disputed border regions.
	   In Cairo Wednesday, Eritrean officials said they wanted Egypt
and possibly other African nations to mediate the conflict as well.
	   ``Both Eritrea and Ethiopia have good relations with Egypt,''
which should facilitate Egyptian mediation between the two
neighbors, Abdullah Mahmoud Jaber, an adviser to Eritrean President
Isaias Afwerki, told reporters after meeting with President Hosni
Mubarak.
	   But Egypt and Ethiopia do not always see eye-to-eye on issues in
the Horn of Africa. Egypt has been backing one set of faction
leaders in an attempt to secure peace and set up a national
administration in war-ravaged Somalia; Ethiopia backs their rivals.
	   Asked why the Eritreans would be pushing into territory they
hadn't previously claimed belonged to them according to the Italian
colonial boundary drawn up in the 19th century, the Ethiopian
spokeswoman replied:
	   ``It is a difficult question to answer from here. They are
insane.''
	   Italy colonized Eritrea in 1885 but was defeated in its attempt
to conquer Ethiopia as well. Britain assumed control of Eritrea in
1941, and the territory later came under a U.N. mandate until 1962,
when it was absorbed into Ethiopia.
	   Rebels under Isaias' command fought Ethiopia for 30 years to
gain independence. They succeeded in 1993, after helping Ethiopian
rebels under now Prime Minister Meles Zenawi oust a 17-year
military dictatorship in 1991.
	   Ethiopia has not offered any figures on its own military
casualties but says Eritrea has suffered heavy losses at Erde
Mattios, some 600 kilometers (372 miles) north of Addis Ababa and
Zala Ambessa, 600 kilometers (372 miles) to the northeast.
	   The Western diplomat expressed concern that both Ethiopia and
Eritrea had pulled troops off their borders with Sudan to bolster
other fronts, thus weakening their western defenses. Both countries
support Sudanese rebel organizations fighting the National Islamic
Front government in Sudan.

Ames returns to Europe after visa problems in U.S.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SLALEY, England (AP) _ Trinidadian golfer Stephen Ames returns
to the European tour Thursday after visa problems forced him to
leave the U.S. circuit.
	   Ames, forced to withdraw from U.S. Open qualifying, will play in
the 650,000 pound (dlrs 1.07 million) European Grand Prix
tournament at Slaley Hall near Newcastle.
	   The 34-year-old also plans to play in the Irish Open and the
Loch Lomond tournament leading up to the British Open, after which
he hopes his visa problems will be resolved and he can return to
the U.S. tour.
	   ``It's a sourish note why I'm here but I'm just looking forward
to playing some golf again. I've done nothing since May,'' he said.
	   Ames, who first played on the European tour in 1992 after a
similar visa problem in the United States, said his current
predicament could not have come at a worse time.
	   ``I was playing the best golf of my life,'' he said.
	   ``It's an administrative problem,'' he added. ``I have a visa
which I thought extended to the end of the year but when I left my
home in Canada to play in Texas three weeks ago I wasn't allowed in
and an immigration official told me the visa had expired.''
	   Ames has won 457,300 pounds (dlrs 750,000) in five seasons on
the European tour and is a favorite for the tournament starting
Thursday as most of Europe's big names opted to prepare for the
U.S. Open.

	   MERSING, Tues. - The Johor Government will ensure that the State
economy gains resilience through continuous pursuit of balanced
development.
	   This is besides the short-term measures aimed at cushioning the
effects of the current economic problems, Menteri Besar Datuk Abdul
Ghani Othman said today.
	   He described the long-term strategy for balanced development as
an integral part of the reformation process that should
continuously be pursued by Umno and the Government.
	   Speaking at a news conference after the Johor Umno Convention,
he summarised the main issues deliberated during the closed door
function at the Sibu Island Resort.
	   Ghani, who is also Johor Umno liaison committee chairman, said
the need for balanced development, between material and spiritual,
small and big industries, agriculture (including food production)
and industrial sector and between the public and private sectors,
was emphasised during the convention.
	   He quoted the example of the Italian economy, which was strong,
partly due to their small and medium-scale industries.
	   Ghani said as the country was facing economic problems, the
convention called for greater solidarity and strength within the
party, so that efforts could be focused on overcoming the problems
at hand.
	   ``We (Johor Umno) agreed to hold an economic convention to
discuss in detail the steps which can be taken in the near term to
help ease the problems.''
	   He said the convention also agreed that in the efforts to
overcome economic woes, justice, including social justice, must be
upheld.
	   ``The measu1res should not only promote growth, but maintain
justice.
	   Therefore, we need measures to ensure that traders and small
entrepreneurs are not neglected.''
	   These, he said, would include helping small traders in Johor
Baru city to carry out their businesses.
	   Ghani said the need to develop small towns, such as Ayer Hitam,
into commercial centres to provide more opportunities for local
businessmen, was also touched by the delegates.
	   In his assessment of the convention, which was officially opened
by Deputy Prime Minister and Umno Deputy President Datuk Seri Anwar
Ibrahim on Monday, Ghani said the convention had generated
important and intelligent ideas from divisional leaders who were a
combination of young and long-serving party members.

Government to sell share in airline to foreign bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The Czech government said
Wednesday it is planning to sell a small share in the state-run
Czech Airlines (CSA) to a foreign bank.
	   Transport minister Petr Moos said the state would retain a
majority share in the airline after the possible sale that should
yield at least 500 million koruna (dlrs 15.1 million) into the
company.
	   ``This alternative investor ... is an interim step toward
finding a strategic partner for CSA in the long-run,'' Moos said.
He said the move is aimed at increasing the company's base capital.
	   Talks should be completed before the government steps down
following parliamentary elections scheduled for June 19-20,
according to the minister.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with later police report; police saying known hooligan
among those arrested; TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Late-night clashes between drunken soccer fans,
Parisian youths and riot police left 34 policemen injured,
including one in critical condition after being hit in the head
with a beer bottle, police said Wednesday.
	   The others were only slightly injured, according to a police
report. The man in critical condition was the commander of a
motorcycle unit.
	   About 15 people were still in custody late Wednesday. Among them
was Stephen Stapley of Scotland, well known as a soccer hooligan in
his country, a police official said on condition of anonymity.
	   The incidents Tuesday night and early Wednesday on the stately
Champs-Elysees boulevard marred the festive atmosphere of the
meticulously planned pre-World Cup events.
	   Police had to use tear gas to disperse drunken soccer fans and
apparently also Parisian youths who threw bottles and tried to
knock down a phalanx of policemen, using a steel barrier as a
battering ram.
	   Among the others in custody were a second Scottish fan, an
Algerian, a Liberian and a Congolese, police said. The
nationalities of the rest weren't immediately known.
	   The World Cup kicked off Wednesday afternoon with the opening
match between Brazil and Scotland. Thousands of Scottish fans have
descended on Paris for the match.
	   Some of them claimed the violence wasn't all the fault of the
soccer fans. They said youths from Paris' troubled suburbs actually
began the disturbances.
	   ``Some young kids started throwing things just for the hell of
it, I think,'' said Derek Christie, from Fife in Scotland.
	   His friend, John Morrison of Inverness, said: ``Everybody was
having a good time, and I don't think they liked it.''
	   When the unrest between the groups got out of hand, the police
charged, they and other witnesses said.
	   In London, the Foreign Office confirmed that two Scots were in
custody in Paris, but said it was for a separate incident from the
troubles in the center of Paris.
	   ``They are currently being held in police custody on assault
charges,'' a spokesman said.
	   In the early morning hours Wednesday, bands of soccer fans were
roving the streets, many desperately seeking transportation back to
where they were staying.
	   Outside a Scottish pub in the Marais district, a group of
partying fans in kilts blocked traffic. When a taxi tried to drive
through, the fans surrounded it, a few of them jumping on the hood
and pounding on the windows. The taxi, and other cars, hastily
retreated.
	   The trouble began around 10:30 p.m., when dozens of people threw
beer bottles at the helmeted riot police, who responded by charging
at them. The fans dispersed. The incident was repeated several
times.
	   About an hour later, just after midnight, several hundred
people, led by young fans armed with security barriers as battering
rams, tried to break through a line of policemen on the
Champs-Elysees.
	   This time police charged them and used tear gas. The fans
quickly dispersed.

EU takes first step to close mad cow chapter

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Declaring British meat safe again, the
EU head office on Wednesday proposed to lift a global ban on
British beef exports imposed in 1996 because of ``mad cow''
disease.
	   ``We do feel British beef is safe,'' EU Farm Commissioner Franz
Fischler said. Yet it may take months before British beef reaches
dinner tables in the rest of the European Union and beyond.
	   The measure goes first to a panel to veterinary experts from all
15 EU states.
	   Their first meeting is Friday but the experts are divided. If
they don't resolve their disagreement, the lifting of the ban will
be put to a vote by the EU agriculture ministers.
	   Germany, in particular, is wary about resuming British beef
sales, fearing a consumer backlash. Chancellor Helmut may not be in
the mood for concessions in the runup to September elections.
	   In London, British Prime Minister Tony Blair welcomed Fischler's
proposal. However, mindful of the problems that may lie ahead, he
added, ``There's still a long way to go. I counsel caution until we
are through all the various stages of the European negotiation.''
	   The export ban was imposed in March, 1996, after reports that
mad cow disease, a brain ailment in cattle known as bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, is related to an equally fatal human
variant, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
	   The ban started a public health scare causing a slump in demand
for beef across the EU which spent billions of dollars to buy up
beef to support farmers.
	   Also, the ban soured Britain's relations with its partners to
the point that then conservative prime minister John Major
boycotted routine EU business.
	   When the ban was imposed, Britain's beef exports were worth dlrs
8.1 billion a year.
	   Fischler put strict conditions on the resumption of British beef
exports: the meat must be deboned and from animals aged between six
and 30 months of age. The cattle must be killed in approved
slaughterhouses and hail from herds guaranteed to be BSE-free.
	   ``We will do our best to ensure the measures will mean no
further risks for consumers anywhere in Europe,'' Fischler said.
	   The suggestion to lift the entire ban on British beef exports
came two weeks after the EU announced exports from Northern Ireland
could be resumed. That region, unlike the rest of Britain, has a
cattle database that lets officials trace mad cow disease with any
sense of confidence.
	   Though other EU nations have reported cases of mad cow disease,
the overwhelming majority have been in Britain. The outbreak was
blamed on the practice of feeding cattle the ground remains of
sheep and other animals.
	   Britain banned such feed Aug. 1, 1996, and now claims all cattle
born after that ban are free from the disease.
	   Britain also slaughtered 3 million cattle judged at risk and
forbade the sale of cattle parts thought most likely to harbor the
disease.

Kuwaiti government closes deportation center for stateless
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The Kuwaiti government has closed a detention
center for stateless Arabs that had drawn criticism for years from
human rights activists and Kuwaiti lawmakers.
	   The detainees are known as bidoun, taken from the Arabic
``bidoun jinsiya,'' or ``without citizenship.''
	   Most bidoun, who number about 120,000, have lived in Kuwait all
their lives. For decades, they were treated as citizens, but
beginning in 1985, the government made them illegal residents.
	   The government says most of them have other passports that they
are hiding to get Kuwaiti citizenship and its benefits.
	   The Interior Ministry said Wednesday that most of the detainees
were released on bail or were allowed to leave the country and that
the government had closed the Talha Deportation Center.
	   The rest were moved to a smaller center, it said. It did not say
how many remained, but 600 people were held there last month.
	   The inmates at Talha were bidoun with no identification papers
and no permanent residence or debtors who could not leave the
country before they paid what they owed. They also included some
Iraqis who had refused to return home.
	   Human rights groups and lawmakers have criticized the center,
which was set up at a school after the 1991 Gulf War that freed
Kuwait from a seven-month Iraqi occupation.
	   They said some detainees were held there without court orders,
sometimes for years. Dozens have gone on hunger strikes or slashed
their wrists to demand freedom.

World Cup: U.S. says Germans lack respect
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos XLF101-107 &QL; 
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-JEAN D'ARDIERES, France (AP) _ Germany may talk the talk
about respecting the U.S. soccer team, but American players don't
believe it.
	   ``If I could sense any weakness, they may be overconfident,''
midfielder Preki Radosavljevic said Wednesday. ``That could be our
chance.''
	   Ever since the draw in December, Germany has said it must be
careful not to overlook the Americans, who've risen to No. 11 in
the FIFA rankings.
	   ``They say in the papers they do, but deep down they don't
respect us at all,'' Radosavljevic said. ``They think we have a
long way to go. I think they'll take us seriously, but I don't
think they respect us.''
	   So how does the United States react as it prepares to open World
Cup play against the Germans in Paris on Monday?
	   ``It doesn't make you mad, it makes you try harder,'' he said.
``I want our team to prove to everyone in the world we can play in
America.''
	   U.S. forward Brian McBride, who spent one season in Germany,
wasn't as outspoken as Radosavljevic, but he left the same
impression.
	   ``There is definitely a different psychological attitude to this
team,'' he said of the Germans. ``I think they're a very confident
team. I don't think they disrespect us. They're just very confident
in themselves.''
	   At the U.S. camp in the Beaujolais countryside, it's clear the
Americans feel they have something to prove.
	   ``When I was younger, it was always great to be the underdog,''
McBride said. ``Now it's the same way. Before, it was the bottom of
the ninth. Now, it's the soccer field.''
	   Radosavljevic may have more to prove than most. The
Yugoslav-born midfielder spent nine seasons in U.S. indoor soccer,
about as far from the World Cup as you can get in soccer while
still drawing a paycheck.
	   From 1992-95, he went back to the outdoor version, scoring four
goals in 46 games for Everton in England's Premier League and seven
in 47 games for Portsmouth at the next level down.
	   He was 33 by the time he became a U.S. citizen in 1996 and
joined the American team. During all those years, he hadn't thought
about playing in a World Cup.
	   ``Not for States,'' he said, speaking English with a heavy
accent. ``I was thinking a little bit playing for Yugoslavia,
especially when I was playing in England. But they never called me
_ and here I am.''
	   In February, he scored one of the biggest goals in U.S. history,
giving the Americans their first victory ever against Brazil. The
Brazilians had been 8-0 against the Americans, outscoring them 19-0
since 1930.
	   News of that game blew through the soccer world like a storm,
and Radosavljevic became a marked man. When the Americans played
the Netherlands 11 days later, two or three defenders usually
stayed close to him.
	   ``In those situations, Preki has got to learn to give up the
ball rather than dribbling,'' U.S. coach Steve Sampson said.
	   Radosavljevic's role in this World Cup appears to be as a sub.
He came off the bench to score in consecutive games against Brazil
and Costa Rica at the CONCACAF Gold Cup last winter.
	   ``I don't know any player in the world who likes to come off the
bench,'' he said. ``I think it's a difficult role.''
	   When the Americans meet Yugoslavia in their final first-round
game on June 25, it will be the day after Radosavljevic's 35th
birthday. He said he doesn't hold any grudges against his former
country.
	   He just wants a win.
	   ``That,'' he said, ``would be a good present for me.''

	   KANGAR, Tues. - Pas has shortlisted four potential candidates
for the Arau parliamentary by-election on July 4, its State
commissioner Hashim Jasin said today.
	   They included Hashim, a medical doctor and a lawyer.
	   Hashim, a college lecturer, said the party's headquarters would
announce the candidate on June 23, a day ahead of nomination day.
	   ``Pas has been active in the constituency due to the looming
general election. When the Arau seat fell vacant following the
death of incumbent Kamaruddin Ahmad of the Barisan Nasional, it was
a matter of us stepping up our activities,'' he added.
	   State BN sources said several names are being considered for the
by- election.
	   Three of these had been submitted to Prime Minister Datuk Seri
Dr Mahathir Mohamad by the Arau Umno division headed by Menteri
Besar Datuk Seri Shahidan Kassim.
	   Topping the list are former Menteri Besar and appointed Umno
supreme council member Tan Sri Dr Abdul Hamid Pawanteh and Senators
Abu Bakar Ismail and Mastika Junaidah Husin, the sources said.
	   The other is Shahidan's political secretary, Baharuddin Ahmad,
they said.

Kuchma approves harsh measures to increase revenues, slash deficit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma gave the government
a two-month deadline Wednesday to find ways to slash government
spending and increase revenues.
	   Ukraine is struggling to get its economy in order while it tries
to negotiate new loans from the International Monetary Fund. At the
same time, it is facing frequent strikes and protests by unpaid
workers, including a miners strike that began last month,
	   An IMF mission is expected in Kiev this week to assess Ukraine's
progress in implementing conditions for a dlrs 2.5 billion loan.
	   Last month, the government met one of the key conditions,
slashing the planned budget deficit to 2.3 percent of gross
domestic product from 3.3 percent, although the plan still needs to
be approved by the largely leftist parliament.
	   The IMF refused to approve a loan to Ukraine last year because
of the former Soviet republic's stalled economic reforms.
	   Kuchma's decree also forbids Cabinet and particularly the
Finance Ministry from considering appeals for tax breaks or the
cancellation of tax debts from other ministries, as well as from
regional executive bodies and enterprises.

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Three large Nordic defense industry firms
announced plans Wednesday to form an ammunition company.
	   Norway's Raufoss AS, Sweden's Celsius AB and Finland's Patria
Industrier OY said their joint venture would have its headquarters
in Norway and operate under the name Nordisk Amunisjonshus, or the
Nammo group.
	   ``The European defense industry has long been in need of
restructuring and it is natural that this process should start in
the Nordic countries,'' Celsius chief executive office Lars
Josefsson said in a communique.
	   ``United, Nordic defense companies will be much stronger than if
they stand alone,'' he added.
	   Norway is a member of the NATO alliance, while Sweden and
Finland are neutral.
	   The new company, being created from the ammunitions divisions of
all three firms, will have about 1,400 employees and an annual
turnover of roughly 1.5 billion kroner (dlrs 200 million).
	   Raufoss will own a 45 percent stake, while Celsius and Patria
will share the remaining 55 percent.
	   Celsius alone has about 11,000 employees and annual sales of
about 1.5 billion dollars.

	   SAYINGS OF BUDDHA - Teachings on Spiritual Cultivation
illustrated and interpreted by Tsai Chih Chung (Asiapac): Transient
acts, ego, desire, evil, disaster and suffering. Offset these with
endurance, detachment, proper beliefs and thinking, acceptance,
truth - road maps laid down by the Buddha 2,500 years ago. ``No
universal truth contains the ego-self,'' he stressed. Take the
middle path and purify your will. Rise above the pollution of the
mind and slowly, you'll arrive at the ultimate destination -
serenity.
	   FICTION TOM CLANCY'S OP-CENTRE: Balance of Power created by Tom
Clancy and Steve Pieczenik (HarperCollins): This fifth title in
Clancy's Op-Centre series, which highlights US intelligence and
crisis management technology, takes the action to Spain. Rumours
are rife that someone is out to start another civil war. Who, and
why? As the Spanish and American diplomatic service join forces to
avert such strife, an Op-Centre representative in Madrid is
assassinated. What next?
	   EATERS OF THE DEAD by Michael Crichton (Ballantine Books): In
the 10th Century, Arab courtier Ibn Fadlan headed north from
Baghdad into what is now Russia. During his three-year journey, he
encountered the Vikings, a race who appalled him with their
barbaric customs. Sexually wanton women, filthy surroundings and
ruthless human sacrifices. Crichton draws from Fadlan's manuscript
and sends him out again, this time on a fictional encounter with
``the monsters of the mist''.
	   NON-FICTION MANGLISH - Malaysian English at its Wackiest by Lee
Su Kim (Times Editions): Say it anyway will do. It don't matter as
long as you connect.
	   In short, Malaysians readily mangle words and expressions when
they flock together. Hang grammar, tenses and pronunciation. Only
cheh kai folk care about that. More shiok to absorb all the slang
and ethnic terms, and be understood.
	   ONLY THE PARANOID SURVIVE by Andrew S. Grove (Doubleday):
Sudden, unexpected change can throw the best laid plans awry. How
do you keep a rein on calendar, career, customers and emotions when
chaos reigns? Grove, named Time magazine's Man of the Year 1997,
examines how ``tidal waves''
	   affect business, and how they can be harnessed to strengthen an
organisation. Given his experience helming Intel, his slant is on
computers and high-tech industry.
	   DIALOGUE: Rediscover the Transforming Power of Conversation by
Linda Ellinor and Glenna Gerard (John Wiley &AMP; Sons): A dialogue is
not just talk. It involves thinking aloud, widening information
arteries, and taking responsibility for one's actions. In short, it
is the springboard to ``being the change you wish to see''. Good
dialogues centre round questions which make up the larger picture.
They get at the root of recurring problems and encourage creative
thinking.
	   THE CHINESE BUSINESS ELITE IN INDONESIA AND THE TRANSITION TO
INDEPENDENCE 1940-1950 by Twang Peck Yang (Oxford University
Press): Arrivals from China (called the totok) and the Outer
Islands, combined with the home-grown Peranakan Chinese of
Indonesia, make up the country's commerical bourgeoisie. How did
this community operate? What sort of partnerships did the Chinese
businessmen forge with, say, Indonesian revolutionaries or the
power-holders? Twang taps written and oral sources to collate his
research.
	   THE FENG SHUI WORK BOOK by Wu Xing, illustrated by Meilo So
(Asiapac): Health, prosperity and happiness, the triple goals of
life, are yours for the taking once you learn how to tap your ch'i.
Bad feng shui can be righted by using the Pa Tzu compass to map
your lucky/unlucky directions.
	   From home to office, the Wu Xing team of Joanne O'Brien, Martin
Palmer, Zhao Xiaomin and Eva Wong show how you can improve your
environment, room by room.
	   TRADER VIC II: Principles of Professional Speculation by Victor
Sperandeo (John Wiley &AMP; Sons): Lies, fallacies and distortions are
rampant in investment. Sperandeo sieves through them and plucks out
a sound investment philosophy, principles of market forecasting,
trends of money, credit and the business cycle, lessons on the
stock market, and the personality of a stock trader.

Defense ministers to seek plans for Kosovo intervention
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Russian quotes, possible NATO measures &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - With the Serb-led Yugoslav army beefing
up its forces in Kosovo, NATO defense ministers face a growing
belief that the only way to stop the violence may be direct
military intervention.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen and his 15 NATO colleagues,
meeting at alliance headquarters here Thursday and Friday, are
expected to order military planners to take a hard look at the
intervention option, whether that be sending in troops, conducting
air strikes or enforcing a no-fly zone.
	   ``The worsening of the situation makes it more than advisable to
work out credible options for military action, to have them ready
for a political decision at any time,'' German Defense Minister
Volker Ruehe told reporters.
	   Cohen acknowledged ``a general consensus there should be
accelerated planning'' and that ``all NATO members feel an
increased sense of urgency.''
	   ``There is a genuine concern throughout the region that if this
goes unchecked, it could have much wider implications than just
Kosovo,'' he said.
	   NATO ambassadors worked late Wednesday on detailed instructions
for the military, including a clear statement of the objective of
any intervention.
	   Also under debate was a series of immediate measures, including
air maneuvers in the next few days over Albania and Macedonia as a
show of strength, moves to military establish training and exercise
centers and using NATO transport to help cope with refugee flows.
	   More than 250 people have died in clashes between government
forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, armed wing of the Albanian
independence movement. Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of
the province's population, demand independence from Serbia, the
larger of two republics in Yugoslavia.
	   The United States and its allies support autonomy for Kosovo but
oppose rebel demands for independence.
	   In recent days entire villages in Kosovo have been flattened and
thousands of people driven from their homes.
	   ``Kosovo is in grave danger of becoming another Bosnia,'' said
Carlos Westendorp, the High Representative in Bosnia, the man
responsible for enforcing the civilian aspects of the Dayton peace
accords.
	   ``It is as if we repair one house, only to discover the one next
door is burning down,'' he said. ``This is supposed to be the year
of returns to Bosnia, but it is rapidly becoming the year of the
exodus from Kosovo.''
	   The United States and the European Union have imposed tough
economic sanctions on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, but
few hold out much hope that will result in a government pullback in
Kosovo.
	   ``We have learned the Serbs don't respond to pressure unless it
is military pressure,'' said a senior NATO official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   NATO military planners have for the past two weeks been
following earlier instructions to study indirect options for
pressuring Milosevic. Those involve dispatching up to 20,000 troops
to Albania and Macedonia, including reinforcement of the existing
750-man U.N. force in Macedonia, and helping both countries secure
borders while dealing with refugees and arms smuggling.
	   But, noted another NATO official, ``With the events of the last
week, shoring up the periphery seems of secondary value.''
	   Intervening in Kosovo would require a sound legal basis.
	   The United States is backing a British effort to win U.N.
Security Council approval for a resolution authorizing ``all
necessary means'' to deal with the situation in Kosovo.
	   The Russians have opposed this so far. President Boris Yeltsin
says he will try to use his influence with Milosevic, but remains
firmly against intervention.
	   ``Urgent measures are needed there,'' acknowledged Russian
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev after a meeting with Belgian
officials. But he added: ``I think we haven't explored all the
peaceful measures that we can use.''

	   KOTA KINABALU, Tues. - The Election Commission has started
making preparations for the Sabah State election which is expected
to be held within the next nine months.
	   Election Commission chairman Datuk Harun Din said early
preparations were necessary to ensure the election was conducted
smoothly.
	   Based on last year's electoral rolls, 697,336 people are
eligible to exercise their voting rights compared to 598,312 in the
last State election in March 1994 .
	   ``If the State election is held this year, we will use last
year's electoral rolls.''
	   Harun said although the dissolution of the State Assembly was
the prerogative of the State Government, it must be noted that its
five-year term would end in March next year.
	   ``It (election) might be held at any time and therefore we want
to be fully prepared,'' he told a Press conference after opening a
two-day course for returning officers today.
	   Harun said the commission was also checking on old ballot boxes
to determine if they could still be used or needed to be replaced.
	   Harun said the commission had identified 603 polling centres and
1,085 polling stations throughout the State for the election.
	   About 5,000 will be involved in conducting the election which is
expected to cost the commission about RM5 million.
	   Harun disclosed that 13,917 names were struck off the State
electoral rolls over the last three years after they were found to
have registered using the same identity card number with different
names or had moved out of the State.
	   On the re-delineation of the election boundaries, Harun said it
was not done to give advantage to any political party.
	   Certain political parties claimed that they had a better chance
of winning after the drawing of the new boundaries.
	   Harun also reiterated that the commission would be more flexible
in dealing with objections filed on nomination day.
	   ``Nomination is not an exercise to reject but to accept
candidates,'' he said, adding that the commission would not like to
see people making a mockery of the election.

Report: Jerusalem's Arab population growing faster than Jewish
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Jerusalem's Arab population is growing far
faster than the Jewish population and is expected to make up almost
half of the city's population in 20 years, according to a report
released Wednesday.
	   Arabs make up 30 percent of Jerusalem's population. Because of
their higher birthrate, they are expected to grow to 45 percent
over the next two decades, according to the Jerusalem Institute for
Israel Studies.
	   ``It's a matter of concern when the non-Jewish population rises
a lot faster than the Jewish population,'' Jerusalem Mayor Ehud
Olmert told reporters.
	   Since 1967, when Israel captured east Jerusalem, the city's Arab
population has increased by 164 percent while the Jewish population
has increased by 113 percent, the institute's report said. In 1967
Arabs made up about 25 percent of the city's population.
	   In 1996, the latest year for which figures are available, the
city's Arab population increased by 3.7 percent, while the Jewish
population increased by one percent.
	   Jerusalem had a population of 602,100 at the end of 1996, of
which 180,900 were Arabs and 421,200 were Jews.
	   Some 5,900 people left the city during 1996 _ 5,700 of them
Jews. Most of those who left were secular Jews driven out because
of Jerusalem's high cost of living.
	   Olmert recently issued a plan to assure that the Jews remain a
majority in Jerusalem. The plan calls for the annexation of Israeli
towns west of Jerusalem.

Designers, artists offer pricey World Cup souvenirs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - From a Niky de Saint Phalle sculpture to a Hermes
scarf, World Cup souvenirs may never been so pricey, - as French
artists and top designers cash in on soccer mania.
	   Eighty contemporary artists from all over the world are showing
works inspired by the little round ball at an upscale Parisian
gallery.
	   For the fashion-conscious, there's a limited edition Louis
Vuitton soccer ball for the well-heeled.
	   It's covered with the traditional brown leather emblazoned with
the famed LV initials and costs 2,800 francs (drls 466).
	   Nini Ricci has come up with a black-and-white soccer ball you
can wear. It's a leather purse with two white straps and sells for
9,500 francs (dlrs 1,583).
	   Hermes, known for creations celebrating special events including
the bicentennial of the French Revolution, toasts the soccer
extravaganza with a scarf depicting a soccer player kicking balls
to the four corners of the silken square.
	   At 1,490 francs (dlrs 248), it runs no more than the other
Hermes designs.
	   Among the works on show at the Enrico Navarra gallery is a Saint
Phalle free-standing piece with two soccer players in brightly
colored uniforms. One is bouncing a ball on his knee while the
other rolls on the grass.
	   Other pieces include multi-screen video art by U.S. artist Nam
June Paik and an accumulation of mascots under plexiglass by French
pop artist Arman.
	   The gallery's the most expensive is an oil painting by Francesco
Clemente which goes for 1.5 million francs, while the cheapest is a
digital image for 12,000 francs (dlrs 2,000) by Michael Roy.
	   But soccer fans on shoestring budget needn't despair. France is
overflowing with cheap T-shirts, pins and socks all decorated with
the World Cup mascot.

Institute to probe government's postwar treatment of Holocaust
</HEADLINE>
victims &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Prompted by lingering concerns,
the Dutch government has ordered an investigation into its postwar
treatment of Holocaust survivors and other World War II victims.
	   The probe will be launched next year by the well-respected
Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation, David Barnouw,
the institute's spokesman, said Wednesday.
	   The investigation was prompted by recent controversies that
pointed to insensitive treatment of Dutch Jews and mismanagement of
their possessions after the war.
	   ``The question is whether the government and local officials
were there to receive them (survivors) properly after the war,''
said Barnouw.
	   The probe will also examine the treatment of other victims,
including Gypsies and Jehovah Witnesses, as well as former
prisoners of Japanese camps in the colonial Dutch East Indies, now
Indonesia.
	   One incident, which was revealed last year, was a selloff by
Dutch civil servants of valuables that belonged to Holocaust
victims.
	   During the sale in 1968, Finance Ministry employees auctioned
off _ among themselves and at bargain-basement prices _ jewelry and
other valuables belonging to Dutch Jews who died in Nazi death
camps.
	   Over 75 percent of Dutch Jews _ more than 100,000 people _
perished in the Holocaust.
	   Those who survived faced an uncaring postwar government
oblivious to their sufferings, said Ronni Naftaniel, a spokesman
for the Jewish organization, the Center for Information and
Documentation on Israel.
	   ``The major complaint was the coolness of the government,'' said
Naftaniel.
	   He said government red tape had also prevented Jews from
reclaiming their possessions after the war. Even today, some
families are still trying to recover their assets.
	   Although the investigation will not lead to reparations, it can
still help heal old wounds.
	   ``Survivors are not satisfied with the way the government dealt
with them then, they are trying to get back some understanding and
sympathy,'' Naftaniel added.

	   SIGMARINGEN, Germany (AP) _ Some 8,300 soldiers from five
European countries that make up the Eurocorps started a week of
military maneuvers Wednesday on the border between France and
Germany.
	   A high point of the exercise called ``Pegasus'' will be the use
of the multi-national troops to span the Rhine river with a pontoon
bridge at Offendorf in the Alsace region, a German military
spokesman at Stauffenberg Caserne in Sigmaringen said.
	   The Eurocorps, originally formed by France and Germany in 1993,

	   WATCHING Shakespeare films is more fun than reading about them.
I realised this sombre truth when reading a recent pair of books:
Shakespeare and the Moving Image, edited by Anthony Davies and
Stanley Wells, and Filming Shakespeare's Plays, by Anthony Davies
(both Cambridge University Press).
	   They are a leaden consequence of The Growth of Academic
Criticism (Stanley Wells), itself an outcome of the days when film
courses were introduced into what had hitherto been unsullied
Departments of English.
	   ``In my day,'' growled an Americana academic, ``films were what
we saw when we cut lectures, not went to them.'' Film reviewers in
those days included Graham Greene (whose film criticism is
first-class) as well as Pauline Kael. But now academics have moved
in, if not taken over. Films of Shakespeare are ``useful
resources'' and ``educational tools'' (Ace Pilkington). Their
Commentaries follow. As the French military say, ``L' intendance
suivra''.
	   An immediate consequence is a peculiarly arid species of
formalist analysis. Did you know that the average length of takes
in Olivier's Hamlet is 21 seconds, which is a little more than
Kozintsev's Hamlet, and that the takes in Tony Richardson's Hamlet
average 27 seconds? Go on, bring that nugget along with you to your
next dinner-party, and set the table on a roar.
	   I gleaned it from Neil Taylor, who adds, ``The high-angle shot
can easily communicate moral significance''. Not to me it can't.
All I can see is directors ringing the changes, in concert with
cameramen who like to set their crew shinning up the rigging, and
hoping to impose upon gullible reviewers. Your film bore is a bore
absolute.
	   Still, some themes emerge. There is the eternal ``tension
between text and visuals''. As a general rule, a Shakespeare text
may well need 50 per cent to be cut for cinematic purposes. (This
is not absolute, as Branagh's full-text Hamlet shows; but that was
a controversial experiment.) The peculiar gift of the camera, its
capacity to record surfaces, really has to be indulged. Besides,
cameras are getting better all the time. The technology was in its
adolescence for the black and-white Romeo and Juliet of 1936. That
couldn't show us much of Verona; Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet
(1968) could.
	   For Zeffirelli, the towns (Verona was shot in Gubbio, Tuscania
and Pienza) became ``an additional character''. Nowadays, the
camera is so eloquent and precise an arbiter of reality, so
advanced a Chorus to the action, that it demands rights that were
never plausible even a couple of decades ago.
	   Technology will not solve the director's problems. After all,
what does Shakespearean reality look like? An unthinking naturalism
is no kind of policy. Take As You Like It. As I've pointed out, you
can have osiers (willows) and you can have olive trees; they
co-exist in the text. But you can't have them co-existing in the
real world, not if you want Arden to be in Warwickshire. They
belong to different climates and regions.
	   The landscape of The Tempest has the same ambivalence. Is it a
Mediterranean, sub-tropical island, or something much cooler, as
near home as the Scillies? The director will have to choose his
location, and choose the bits of it to record, and through which
lens. And filter.
	   Anyway, what is the camera for? Kozintsev gave the
fundamentalist answer: ``The advantage of the cinema over the
theatre is not that you can even have horses, but that you can
stare closer into a man's eyes; otherwise it is pointless to set up
a cine camera for Shakespeare.''
	   There's a moment in his King Lear where a boat is shown beating
up against the river. Even in the spacious days of Soviet budgets,
it must have been an expensive boat, fitted out to be of its
period. Kozintsev holds the shot for about one second. That's it,
no more boat. Kozintsev did not, as it were, overvalue ``horses''.
	   Then there's the recurring problem of comedy. This is a
well-known difficulty, and Shakespearean films have not cracked it.
Nearly all the best Shakespeare films have been tragedies or
histories. And there's a reason: comedy requires a live audience,
the lack of which poses a killing threat to the film.
	   I once saw a live RSC production of As You Like It just after
the TV version had been screened. The difference was enormous. The
screen version was drab, inert, the acting absorbed into the green
textures of the trees that the camera unwisely made love to. The
stage Touchstone struck up a rapport with his audience, and kept
them in good spirits. Interaction made the comedy work.
	   Michele Willems tells the story of a Merchant of Venice made for
French TV. The actor playing Launcelot Gobbo had rehearsed
successfully performing before an audience of technicians,
cameramen and actors. When silence was required in the studio for
the filming, he became panic- stricken, and the comic quality of
his playing went down. In the end the director felt obliged to cut
the scene. The actor needed an audience, and he needed laughs. Is
it possible that a director may one day opt for canned studio
laughter?
	   The proliferation of Shakespeare films leads to that stock
academic resource, Compare and Contrast. Peter Brook's King Lear
and Grigori Kozintsev's King Lear came out in consecutive years, as
though they had agreed to supply examiners with off-the-peg
questions. ``Show how Brook's treatment of Cordelia differs from
Kozintsev's.'' A student might have to think a little about the
question; the examiner, not at all.
	   I allow though that the occasional insight can arise, and I was
rather taken with a woman student's quoted remark, ``that whereas
Oliver's Henry is the lover every man would like to be, Branagh's
is the lover every woman would like him to be''. Not glamour, but
sincerity is the word! (Discuss) Today's films are
inter-referential. That is to say, there are several pre-existing
versions of some key plays; in the latest, the director will want
to display his awareness of precedent. Branagh's film of Henry V
defines itself in relation to Olivier's film. It is no exaggeration
to say, to react adequately to Branagh you have to know Olivier.
	   Take the climactic shot of Branagh's Agincourt sequence. ``The
long slow tracking shot across the battlefield of Agincourt after
the battle, across the corpses and the survivors, as Henry walks
across it with a dead boy in his arms, is a clear definition of the
film's central attack on the values of war, a recognition of the
costs of battle. But it is also a deliberate inversion of the most
famous shot in Olivier's film, the long tracking shot of the charge
of the French knights at the beginning of the battle.''
	   (Peter Holland) Olivier's French charge from right to left,
Branagh's Henry walks from left to right. This is the consequence
of that. I find this just, but depressing. One is drawn into an
ever-widening pool of allusion. The heroic age is over, when
creative geniuses explored new territory. Now people make movies
about other people's movies. As Gombrich said, ``All art owes more
to other art than it owes to Nature''.
	   Let us draw the conclusions. The Shakespeare filmography is
vast. What films ought one to know about? I'll offer a list of a
dozen films as a core canon. The list is personal but not
idiosyncratic, and I think pretty well everything in it would be
generally agreed. TV versions and ``free adaptations'', such as
Kurosawa's, are excluded.
	   I begin with Reinhardt's A Midsummer Night's Dream (1936), the
first film of modern times one can take seriously. (James Cagney's
Bottom is excellent, and Mickey Rooney's Puck much better than
legend allows.) After that comes Olivier's great trio, Henry V
(1944), Hamlet (1948), and Richard III (1955).
	   Then comes Mankiewicz's Julius Caesar (1953), memorable for
Marlon Brando's Antony.
	   Orson Welles' Falstaff/Chimes at Midnight (1965) covers the two
parts of Henry IV, and contains some astonishingly realistic battle
scenes.
	   Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet (1968) showed just what an Italian
could do with the textures of Italy.
	   Kozintsev's Hamlet (1964) I consider superior even to Oliver's.
The same director's King Lear (1970) is a landmark, to be set
alongside Brook's King Lear (1969).
	   Branagh's Henry V (1989) and Much Ado About Nothing (1994) are
not to be missed.
	   Other candidates we will pause upon.

Onetime lover: Gucci ex-wife incapable of having him killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ A businessman who said he had a love affair
with Maurizio Gucci's ex-wife testifed Wednesday that she never
could have arranged the murder of the fashion scion.
	   Patrizia Reggiani Martinelli is on trial for ordering the
killing of Gucci in 1995. Four other people, including the alleged
hit-man, also are defendants.
	   Renato Verona said he had a ``sentimental affair'' with Reggiani
Martinelli in 1994, after the couple divorced, the ANSA news agency
said.
	   Also coming to her defense was a dentist, Andrea Stramezzi, who
said he was a close friend, and corresponds with her now in prison.
	   The two men said Reggiani Martinelli was afraid Gucci would
dissipate the family wealth to the harm of the couple's two
children, ANSA reported.
	   The prosecution says the woman was obsessed with Gucci's estate,
and enraged about an alimony cut, so she allegedly paid her
co-defendants dlrs 300,000 to arrange and carry out his killing.

	   PARIT, Tues. - The new Nordin Bridge, connecting Parit town and
Tanjung Belanja was opened to traffic late yesterday.
	   Many motorists who expected it to to open in the morning
following an announcement by Deputy Transport Minister Datuk Railey
Jeffrey last week, were disappointed to see it was still closed,
forcing them to use the old Bailey bridge.
	   Only the motorcycle lanes on both sides were open to traffic.
	   The 279-metre two-lane Nordin Bridge across the Perak river,
which is part of the Federal Route 73 between Parit and Beruas, was
constructed to replace the old bridge of the same name built in
1954.
	   The old bridge was damaged by the 1969 floods. Bailey bridges
have been used since then.
	   According to State Insfrastructure and Public Utilities
Committee chairman Datuk Ong Ka Chuan, the bridge could not be
opened earlier because of ``minor technicalities'' such as the
absence of road signs and markings.
	   Work also had to be carried out to level the riverbank slopes
under the bridge.
	   Construction of the RM10.5 million Nordin Bridge began in 1995.
It was built based on the concept of Prestressed Segmental Box
Girder.
	   The total width of the bridge is 11 metres. Its height from the
normal water level is 9.46m, about 4.07m above the highest flood
level in the area.
	   With the opening of the bridge, motorists will be assured of
better access to the State's coastal areas such as Beruas, Pantai
Remis, Sitiawan and Lumut. Before 1928, ferry services linked the
two sides of the river.
	   The first crossing was a pontoon bridge suitable only for small
vehicles. When it collapsed in the 1931 floods, ferry services
resumed until the concrete submersible Nordin bridge was
constructed in 1954.
	   However, the coastal areas are also accessible via the Ipoh-Sri
Iskandar-Lumut road.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Tues. - The hotel industry is still short of
workers and has not seen much retrenchment, even with the economic
slowdown, said Culture, Arts and Tourism Minister Datuk Sabbaruddin
Chik.
	   He said the booming tourism and hospitality industry needs at
least 160,000 workers to cater for 100,000 rooms with a ratio of
two workers per room. There are now 130,000 workers in the
industry.
	   He said with most city hotels maintaining a 70 per cent
occupancy rate for the first half of the year, the demand for
workers would be even greater.
	   ``Right now, we are still employing foreign workers. I do not
think there is any decision to send them back immediately. However,
this is applicable only to those who are not working as frontliners
such as the cleaners and kitchen helpers.''
	   Sabbaruddin said this to reporters after witnessing the signing
of a Memorandum of Understanding between HRR Travel-Trade
management services and Wigan and Leigh College, United Kingdom.
	   With the memorandum, Wigan and Leigh College will work in
collaboration with the newly-established Travetrade College of
Hospitality and Tourism to offer internationally-recognised
qualifications in the field of hospitality and tourism.
	   Also present were chairman of Travetrade College Ibrahim Ahmad,
its managing director Leela Mohd Ali and Wigan and Leigh College
vice- principal Frank Brogen.
	   He said statistics compiled by the World Travel and Tourism
Council showed that travel and tourism are the world's largest
employer, generating more than 120 million jobs worldwide, hiring
one in 15 workers.
	   ``Although we are just recovering from a bad spell during the
two haze- hit months last year, the negative effects of dengue,
cholera and coxsackie diseases, the weakening ringgit has increased
tourists arrivals from the United Kingdom and US.''
	   ``If the haze does not recur this year, we can expect to see an
average of 70 per cent occupancy rate for all hotels. We are
confident of attracting 6.8 million visitors this year,'' he said.
	   Sabbaruddin said last year tourism revenue was RM10.5 billion
from an estimated 6.5 million visitors, a decline of 13 per cent
compared to 11.5 billion from 7.1 million visitors in 1996.
	   In view of this, he said, the country's tourism industry was in
urgent need of quality tourism education.

Reports: Camacho ready to sign as Real Madrid coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Former Real Madrid player Jose Antonio
Camacho will be the new coach for his old team and current holder
of the European Champions Cup, news reports said Wednesday.
	   Camacho will sign for the Spanish powerhouse on Thursday, sports
daily Marca reported, although the newspaper did not give details
of the contract.
	   Real Madrid has refused to confirm that Camacho is set to
replace German Jupp Heynckes, who was sacked on May 28th, and
become the team's third coach in three years.
	   ``It is a well known secret but until he (Camacho) actually
signs we cannot confirm it'' club spokeswoman Marta Santesteban
said. ``He would be a popular choice because he is a lifelong
Madrid player.''
	   Camacho, who played for the national Spanish squad 81 times, was
a regular on Real Madrid's first team between 1974 and 1989 when he
retired from the pitch to sit on the bench.
	   He coached first division Espanyol last season.
	   Other reported candidates to take over from Heynckes have been
Sven Goran Eriksson, the Swedish coach of the Italian team Lazio;
Morten Olsen of Ajax; Arsene Wenger of Arsenal; and Ivica Osim of
Strum Graz.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Tues. - The Meteorological Services Department
today said there was currently no indication that Malaysia will
experience the La Nina phenomenon which brings heavy rains and
probably floods.
	   The department spokesman said should the phenomenon occur, it
might not affect the people as much as the El Nino - the opposite
of La Nina - had for the past few months.
	   ``The effects of La Nina will not be as great as El Nino,'' the
spokesman said when contacted by the New Straits Times.
	   She was responding to a comment by the Singapore Meteorological
Service which claimed that Southeast Asia would be experiencing a
``fairly strong''
	   La Nina, bringing heavy rains and possibly floods.
	   The Malaysian Meteorological Services Department spokesman said
there was not much research done on the La Nina here and most
information was obtained from world meteorological centres.
	   ``Although it is seen as the opposite of El Nino, its effects
are not exactly the opposite,'' she said.
	   She also said indicators at the moment were unclear and that it
was very difficult to conclude the La Nina would occur.
	   Seen as the opposite of the El Nino phenomenon, which results
from the warming of the ocean off the coast of Peru, La Nina is
caused by waters there cooling more than usual, bringing with it
heavier than normal rains.

	   IPOH, Tues - A petrol kiosk operator was punched and robbed of
about RM8,500 by five well-dressed men in Lorong Lahat today.
	   The operator, who only wanted to be known as Fong, said he was
about to open for business about 6.45am when the men drove up in a
Madza 323 car and asked for RM20 worth of petrol.
	   One of them then went to the toilet while the others got out of
the car and stood beside him.
	   After he had filled up the car, one of the men punched Fong
while the other, armed with a knife, forced him into his office.
	   Fong was then ordered to hand over about RM8,000. They also took
a few hundred ringgit from him.

Uncertain fate for those imprisoned under Abacha
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Nigeria &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ They stare blankly from newspaper ads
placed by desperate loved ones _ plaintive ads with haunting
headlines like ``Where is Femi?'' or ``Whatever happened to
Bagauda?''
	   They are the faces of those who dared to criticize or resist
Nigeria's deceased strongman. Scores who disappeared during Gen.
Sani Abacha's five-year dictatorship remain imprisoned, and there
is lingering uncertainty over their fate under the new military
regime.
	   Throwing his opponents behind bars was a harsh hallmark of
Abacha, who died Monday of a heart attack. Now Nigerians are
waiting to see if his successor, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, will
show mercy and release at least some political prisoners.
	   Despite strident appeals from human rights groups, there were no
signs Wednesday that Abubakar was even considering freeing any of
the several hundred government critics imprisoned by Abacha, who
jailed thousands during his rule.
	   It appeared highly unlikely that the top political prisoner _
businessman Moshood Abiola _ would win his freedom anytime soon.
Abiola was the presumed winner of 1993 presidential elections
before Abacha declared the results invalid and seized power in a
coup.
	   Abiola was accused of treason, a crime punishable by death, for
resisting Abacha's annulment of the elections. Jailed without a
trial, he remains in prison, a symbol of Abacha's tyrannical rule.
	   ``Releasing prisoners of conscience imprisoned for defending the
most basic human rights would give a strong message to the Nigerian
people and to the international community that this is a government
ready to allow the exercise of fundamental freedoms,'' Amnesty
International said in a statement.
	   Although Abacha's government in May released 142 inmates ranging
from obscure dissidents to traffic offenders, none of the
best-known political prisoners was among them.
	   Those include Abacha's former right-hand man, Gen. Oladipyo
Diya. In April, he was sentenced to death by firing squad for
allegedly plotting to topple the government last December. Diya,
54, claims he was framed; the sentence has not been carried out.
	   Many of Nigeria's most prominent prisoners were sentenced in
connection with an alleged 1995 plot to unseat Abacha, though
critics have long charged the allegations were invented to lock
away opponents. Twenty-two people, including politicians, activists
and journalists, were convicted in connection with the alleged
plot. Among them:
	   _ Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, 62, Nigeria's head of state from
1976-1979. Obasanjo, who is serving a 15-year treason sentence,
voluntarily relinquished the presidency after an election and went
on to became a formidable critic of Abacha.
	   _ Beko Ransome-Kuti, a medical doctor and brother of the late
Afrobeat music star Fela. He was convicted of being an ``accessory
after the fact to treason'' and is serving a 15-year sentence.
	   _ Four journalists sentenced to 15 years for ``accessory after
the fact to treason'' for their coverage of the coup attempt trial.
On Wednesday, Paris-based Reporters Without Borders wrote to
Abubakar urging him to free the four, among 15 jailed Nigerian
journalists.
	   Other prominent prisoners include Frank Kokori, the president of
Nigeria's Oil Workers Union. He has been held in detention without
charge since a three-month oil workers' strike he led in 1994.
	   Dr. Frederic Fasheun, who took over as leader of the Campaign
for Democracy after Ransome-Kuti was arrested, has been held since
February 1997 in connection with a spate of deadly bombings that
rocked Lagos. He has not been charged.
	   Food, water and medicine are in short supply or nonexistent at
prisons, said Nwabueze Okoro, vice-chairman of Nigeria's Civil
Liberties Organization. Political prisoners are refused visits and
are often held in hidden locations, he added.
	   Ogaga Ifowodo, a senior researcher with the CLO, was arrested
last November.
	   ``There have been no charges. They haven't held a trial,'' Okoro
said. ``We don't even know where he is.''

Russian military crisis: More dying now than during Chechen war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More Russian servicemen died last year, in
peacetime, than the year before, when Russia was still bogged down
in its war in Chechnya, according to statistics released Wednesday.
	   At the current rate, even more will die this year.
	   The figures, released in parliament and reported by the
ITAR-Tass news agency, offer some of the starkest evidence yet of
the crisis affecting Russia's military.
	   From January to April of this year, 132 members of the armed
services committed suicide, according to the figures contained in a
resolution passed by the State Duma, the lower house of Parliament.
	   The resolution expressed the Duma's concern over the harsh
conditions in the military. Over the past several years, the
Russian military has been plagued by plunging morale, grim living
conditions, and a rash of suicides, hazing deaths and
soldier-on-soldier shootings.
	   ``The actions of officials that have caused this situation in
the army and the navy border upon crime,'' the Duma resolution
said.
	   According to the Duma statistics, 1,037 members of the army and
navy died in 1996, the last year of the war in Chechnya. In 1997,
the number of deaths rose to 1,057. For the first four months of
this year, 477 died. If that rate persists, more than 1,400 can be
expected to die this year.

Air France reaches agreement with striking pilots

	   PARIS (AP) _ After all-night talks, pilots agreed on Wednesday
to end a 10-day strike that has kept Air France from flying players
and fans to the World Cup and soured confidence in the company _
and the country.
	   Nobody really celebrated the agreement, in which the pilots
accepted Air France shares for salary cuts, something the company
had proposed originally.
	   The carrier said it would take 48 hours for all service to
return to normal. At Charles de Gaulle airport, north of Paris, red
lights ominously flashed ``annule'' and ``canceled'' for most Air
France flights Wednesday.
	   Only hours after the strike ended, the World Cup got under way
with the first match, Brazil vs. Scotland.
	   The strike's end did little to appease irritated passengers and
airport workers.
	   ``The pilots can do what they want, but I was against their
strike,'' said Nathalie Seulin, who works at the information desk
at Charles de Gaulle. ``Air France was picking up again, and now
they've lost everything.''
	   ``The pilots are like babies with pacifiers in their mouths,''
said Didier Bernard, a 38-year-old security guard at the airport.
``As soon as you take it out, they cry.''
	   Jean-Cyril Spinetta, president of Air France, called the
agreement a good compromise for the company, employees and
passengers.
	   But he added that the consequences of the strike were ``heavy,''
and said the company had lost a billion francs (dlrs 166 million.)
	   ``Now we have to think of confidence, confidence in Air France,
confidence in its clients,'' he said.
	   In concessions to the pilots, the carrier said it would scrap a
two-tier salary scale, under which new pilots earned less than
their colleagues. The highly paid pilots felt that that system
undermined cockpit solidarity.
	   The pilots seemed satisfied.
	   ``On the whole, the agreement is a good one for everybody,''
said Christian Paris, a spokesman for the SNPL, the main pilots'
union.
	   ``The company had its constraints and its objectives to achieve.
I think it will be able to reach them,'' he said.
	   The strike, coming as the world focused on France, had deeply
embarrassed the government.
	   It inconvenienced thousands of World Cup fans, who had to switch
airlines at the last minute or find alternative transportation.
	   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin welcomed the agreement _ but said
it had been too long in coming.
	   ``But I hope the company above all will benefit, because that is
my primary objective and what guided me throughout this period,''
he said after a Cabinet meeting.
	   Besides disrupting the World Cup, the government had feared the
strike could jeopardize investor confidence and eat up profits
ahead of plans to partially privatize the state-owned airline.
	   Wednesday's agreement was reached with the SNPL, the main union
representing the vast majority of Air France pilots.
	   The pilots had been protesting 500 million francs (dlrs 83
million) in proposed salary cuts. Air France had said the cuts were
needed to provide capital to modernize the airline, which was saved
from bankruptcy in 1993 but reported profits in 1996 and 1997.
	   Air France said part of the agreement involved guaranteed
training for young pilots, at least part of which would be paid for
by the company. The salary-for-shares swap is voluntary.
	   As well as the airline strike, France has been hit in recent
days by walkouts by train drivers, baggage handlers, and some bus
services. There were no major walkouts Wednesday.

	   KUCHING, Tues. - Parti Bansa Dayak Sarawak said today it would
investigate allegations that one of its Members of Parliament owed
Perth-based Burswood Casino A$2 million (RM5.2 million) in gambling
debt.
	   Secretary-general Dublin Unting said if it was true, the matter
would be brought before the party's supreme council.
	   Asked whether he knew who the MP was following an AFP report
from Perth today identifying the MP as a senior member of the PBDS,
Unting said he did not.
	   PBDS president Datuk Leo Moggie when contacted in Kuala Lumpur
said it was a personal matter which would be discussed ``when the
time comes''.
	   The PBDS has six MPs. They are Jimmy Donald (Sri Aman), Jawah
Gerang (Lubok Antu), Datuk Sng Chee Hua (Julau), Billy Abit Joo
(Ulu Rajang), Datuk Leo Moggie (Kanowit) and Joseph Mauh Ikeh
(Selangau).
	   In a front-page report today, The Malay Mail said the MP was one
of eight Malaysian high rollers to be served with writs to recover
bad debts totalling RM10.8 million.
	   The others are doctors, lawyers and businessmen. They owe the
casino between RM120,000 and RM2.4 million each, dating as far back
as 1994.
	   AFP reported from Perth today that the writs would be issued in
Perth in about a month and would be served on the MP in Malaysia.
	   The report quoted Christopher White, a director of the
investigation firm Asean Protective Services as saying that the
debts were incurred at Burswood in December 1994 and January 1995
while the MP was holidaying in Australia.
	   The firm was engaged by Burswood to investigate and prosecute.
	   ``We have attempted to negotiate with him since 1995 and he has
refused to take part,'' White said. ``He made offers and counter
offers but finally refused to pay.''
	   White said there were dozens of Malaysians said to owe an
estimated A$25 million in gambling debts to casinos across
Australia.
	   He said the move to initiate legal proceedings marked a change
by Australian casinos which had previously preferred to negotiate.
	   ``We are well aware that these people have assets and, it would
appear, are refusing to pay only because in the past, the casinos
have not taken legal action,'' he said.
	   White said the debts occurred well before the Asian economic
problem.
	   ``Most of these debtors had the ability to pay then - and most
still do.''
	   Meanwhile, Bernama reported that the MP today made a
``significant down payment'' towards settling the debt and would
pay the balance in instalments.

Drug problem is downside of the collapse of Soviet Union
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: REWRITES, UPDATES with Russian delegate saying number of
addicts in Russia rose 60 percent last year &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Drug traffickers have established links
across Central Asia to smuggle narcotics from Afghanistan to
lucrative markets in Western Europe, taking advantage of the
collapse of the Soviet Union.
	   And leaders of the newly independent states, including
Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, complain they
lack the resources to combat criminal syndicates based in Russia
and Western Europe.
	   ``Two or three years ago, people in Kyrgyzstan had only a
theoretical idea what heroin is. Nowadays, it has become one of the
main drugs on the illegal market,'' Kyrgyz Prime Minister
Kubanychbek Jumaliev, told the U.N. special session on drugs
Tuesday. The three-day conference ends Wednesday.
	   The end of the Soviet Union's police-state internal controls
gave traffickers a freer hand to move opium and other drugs across
Central Asia to the streets of Berlin, Paris, London and other
Western European cities.
	   Russia's deputy foreign minister, Yury Ushakov, told the
conference Wednesday that in the final years of the Soviet Union,
the number of Russian addicts was rising about 10 to 15 percent a
year.
	   Last year, the figure rose by 60 percent, Ushakov said.
	   U.N. officials say the problem is made worse because of the
decades-long instability in Afghanistan, which along with Myanmar
produces most of the world's illicit supply of opium.
	   The newly independent states of Central Asia, some with their
own instability problems, lack the means to control their borders
and maintain surveillance on drug traffickers moving in and out of
Afghanistan.
	   ``Today, it is possible to say with confidence that the main
source of growing, producing and delivering drugs to the European
countries is Afghanistan,'' said Foreign Minister Abdulaziz Kamilov
of Uzbekistan.
	   Afghan factions use drug money to buy more weapons, which in
turn produces more fighting and instability, he said.
	   The president of Tajikistan, Emomali Rakhmonov, complained that
the international community has devoted considerable resources to
fighting drugs in Latin America and Southeast Asia but has left
poor Central Asian states on their own.
	   Rakhmonov said that in 1991, the year the Soviet Union
collapsed, police in Tajikistan seized only 22 pounds of narcotics.
In 1997, Tajik police seized more than 4.5 tons. That, he
estimated, was no more than 15 percent of the total amount of drugs
that passed through Tajik territory.
	   ``The Republic of Tajikistan is not yet in a condition to
finance independently the programs and measures to combat this
evil,'' Rakhmonov said.
	   Kamilov, the Uzbek foreign minister, suggested that the European
Union help Central Asian states establish a coordination center to
monitor the flow of drugs and develop plans for curbing it.

Villa striker apologizes for fracas with girlfriend
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with Villa statement

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Aston Villa striker Stan Collymore has apologized
for punching and kicking his celebrity girlfriend in a Paris bar
during a World Cup party _ an incident which could jeopardize his
career with the club.
	   Ulrika Jonsson, 30, a Swedish-born television personality,
returned to her home in England following the incident Monday
night. On Wednesday, she announced that she had ended her
relationship with Collymore.
	   ``I would like everyone to know that I am fine and I confirm
that my relationship with Stan Collymore is now over,'' Jonsson
said.
	   Collymore's adviser and agent Paul Stretford confirmed witness
reports, including that of a Scottish Television news reporter,
that the player hit and kicked Miss Jonsson at a late night World
Cup party for Scotland fans on Monday.
	   Scottish Television reporter Martin Geissler said Collymore
``dragged her out of the bar into a back room, pushed her to the
ground and aimed kicks at her head. She was lying on the ground
screaming and bar staff then grabbed Collymore and threw him out.''
	   Stretford read a statement issued by Collymore, 27, in which he
admitted that ``a stupid and silly argument had developed
throughout the course of the day.''
	   ``My actions were totally reprehensible, something I am not
proud of and finding very difficult to come to terms with. In a fit
of petulant temper I struck out at the girl I love and immediately
regretted my actions, but by then it was too late.
	   ``I could hide behind a facade of excuses and no comments but
petulance, jealousy and possibly having too much to drink are the
real reasons behind this regrettable and avoidable incident.''
	   Collymore also confirmed that he had been head-butted by someone
in the bar, and he apologized to that unidentified man ``for
causing him to feel that he had to take such action.''
	   Collymore said he had privately apologized to Miss Jonsson.
	   Collymore played in some of England's World Cup qualifying games
but was left off the squad for the finals in France.
	   He was Britain's most expensive player when he transferred from
Nottingham Forest to Liverpool for 8.5 million pounds (dlrs 13.8
million) in 1995. Collymore never lived up to his billing and later
moved for 7 million pounds (dlrs 11.4 million) to Aston Villa,
where he also has been a disappointment.
	   His future with Villa was uncertain after the latest incident.
	   ``Naturally we are very disappointed,'' the Birmingham club said
in a statement. ``The player is not due back until July 8, but we
will be talking to him to discuss the position at the earliest
possible opportunity.''
	   Collymore's status was further put into jeopardy when club
chairman John Gregory confirmed he was interested in signing
Italian striker Fabrizio Ravanelli.

Deputy finance ministers discuss Russia, Asian crisis at G-7 talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - Russia's battered economy and the Asian financial
crisis were at the center of talks Wednesday among deputy finance
ministers of the world's leading industrialized nations.
	   No new financial aid packages for either area were announced.
	   Following the regularly scheduled Paris meeting, U.S. Deputy
Secretary Lawrence Summers said the Group of Seven industrialized
countries were ready to consider additional aid for Russia as
``necessary and appropriate.''
	   Confidence in the Russian economy has been shaken recently as a
result of a sharp slide in the stock market, a debilitating miners'
strike and the sluggish rate of economic growth.
	   Summers said the G-7 nations welcomed ``in particular recent
actions to strengthen tax administration.''
	   The Russian government's chronic inability to collect taxes has
left it unable to pay state workers and forces the government to
service a heavy debt.
	   Summers called for quick implementation of the IMF program and
of reforms to accelete growth, saying they are ``the most crucial
actions Russia can take to build market confidence.''
	   The G-7 include the United States, Canada, Japan, the United
Kingdom, Italy, France and Germany. Russia now participates at all
major summits.
	   The G-7 officials also discussed the weakness of the yen.

Al Fayed to erect tribute to Princess Diana at Harrods department
</HEADLINE>
store

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Mohamed Al Fayed plans to commemorate the first
anniversary of the deaths of Princess Diana and his son, Dodi
Fayed, with a tribute at Harrods department store, his spokesman
said Wednesday.
	   Al Fayed, the multimillionaire owner of Harrods, is considering
erecting an image of the princess and his son encased in the symbol
of a dove, said the spokesman, Laurie Mayer.
	   The tribute may stand outside the store for all passers-by _ not
just Harrod shoppers _ to view, Mayer said.
	   ``It will be permanent,'' he said, adding, ``I think it will be
substantial.''
	   A shrine has been set up beside the store's Egyptian staircase
ever since the couple's Aug. 31 deaths in a Paris car crash.

African leaders approve peace mission to Eritrea, Ethiopia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By GLENN McKENZIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ A delegation of African leaders
will visit the troubled Horn of Africa region in a bid to end a
deadly border dispute between Eritrea and Ethiopia, the
Organization of African Unity confirmed Wednesday.
	   Members of the peace mission will try to persuade both parties
to agree to a cease-fire and peace talks, OAU Secretary-General
Salim Ahmed Salim said.
	   He was speaking at the end of a summit attended by the leaders
of 29 OAU member states.
	   The 34-year-old pan-African body, which is headquartered in
Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa, did not overestimate its chances of
success.
	   ``We have to be modest,'' Salim said. ``Just because the OAU
adopts resolutions doesn't mean that the two countries will respect
them,'' Salim said. ``It is up to the parties involved to end the
hostilities.''
	   Eritrean Foreign Minister Haile Woldetensae welcomed the
proposal and said his country was willing to immediately withdraw
its troops from disputed territory to create a de-militarized zone.
	   Eritrea was also prepared for direct talks, Woldetensae added.
	   There was no immediate reaction from his Ethiopian counterpart
Seyoum Mesfin, also attending the summit. On Tuesday, Seyoum said
his country did not favor a ``proliferation of mediation
attempts.''
	   The OAU peace mission will led by Burkina Faso President Blaise
Campaore in his capacity as chairman of the pan-African body and
will also include a Rwandan envoy.
	   Mediators from Rwanda and the United States drafted a four-point
peace proposal last week that included recommendations that Eritrea
withdraw to positions held prior to May 6 when the hostilities
began. Ethiopia approved the plan but Eritrea said it was
incomplete.
	   Woldetensae said fighting continued Tuesday on several fronts
and both Ethiopia and Eritrea had suffered ``serious civilian
casualties'' as a result of the border conflict.
	   ``This is not a skirmish. This is a war,'' the Eritrean minister
said.
	   The Eritrean minister said his country had not been prepared for
the fight, which followed a resolution by Ethiopian parliament
demanding Eritrea pull out of several border areas.
	   ``We never thought to build a Berlin Wall on our border,''
Woldetensae said. ``We always thought a long-term peaceful
settlement would be reached. We still believe that is possible.''

Italian defense chief expects U.S. to judge Marines fairly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's defense chief said Wednesday Italians are
confident American military authorities will vigorously prosecute
the U.S. Marine crew whose plane cut a cable car line, causing the
death of 20 people.
	   With U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen at his side, Defense
Minister Beniamino Andreatta played down the Americans' decision to
have the Marines tried in the United States, exercising their right
under a NATO accord.
	   Cohen was in Rome for talks with Andreatta about the crisis in
Kosovo.
	   An EA-6B Prowler jet, on a training exercise from Aviano air
base in northeast Italy, sliced through a cable at an Italian ski
resort Feb. 3, sending all 20 aboard the gondola plunging to their
death.
	   All four Marines have been charged in the United States with
involuntary manslaughter, negligent homicide, and other charges of
destruction of military and civilian property and dereliction of
duty. If convicted on all counts, they could spend the rest of
their lives in prison.
	   Military hearings, the equivalent of a civilian grand jury, for
the four-man crew, have been under way in Camp Lejeune, North
Carolina.
	   ``I don't see any determination for revenge on the part of
Italian prosecutors nor determination to defend on the part of U.S.
prosecutors,'' Andreatta told a news conference. ``What I see is a
commitment that justice be done.''
	   Claiming jurisdiction in a case that had strained U.S.-Italian
relations, an Italian prosecutor last month asked for indictments
of the crew on manslaughter even though the Italian government
itself has accepted American prosecution.
	   Investigations by both the Americans and the Italians have
indicated crew error, concluding that the men were flying too low
and too fast.

Egypt refusing to entry to Hamas leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt is refusing to allow Sheik Ahmed
Yassin, the spiritual leader of the radical Islamic group Hamas, to
travel to Cairo, Hamas officials said Wednesday.
	   Yassin, who was scheduled to arrive in Cairo from neighboring
Sudan Tuesday night, has had to remain in Khartoum since Egyptian
authorities told him that he may not fly to Cairo, said Mohammed
Nazal, Hamas spokesman in Jordan.
	   Yassin has asked to transit through Cairo on his way back to his
home in Gaza.
	   Egyptian officials were not available for comment.
	   Palestinian sources said Egypt was waiting for Israel to grant
permission for Yassin to return to Gaza.
	   ``They don't want another exiled leader, specially someone like
Yassin, to be stuck in Egypt,'' they said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Islamic extremists in Egypt have been waging a violent campaign
to destabilize the secular government of President Hosni Mubarak.
	   Israeli leaders appear to be leaning toward allowing Yassin back
into Gaza, in part because keeping him out could trigger violence
by Hamas supporters. Israel controls the borders of Gaza.
	   Senior Egyptian officials are expected to discuss Yassin's entry
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat when he arrives in Cairo
Thursday.
	   Yassin has been on a 3 1/2-month tour of Muslim countries to
raise funds and drum up support for Hamas.
	   Hamas opposes peace with Israel. Its military wing has killed
more than 100 Israelis in scores of attacks in recent years.
	   The group's popularity in the Palestinian lands, especially
Gaza, is seen as a growing threat to Arafat's authority.
	   Yassin was freed from an Israeli jail last fall in exchange for
the freedom of two Israeli Mossad agents captured in Jordan during
a bungled assassination attempt against another Hamas leader.

World Cup: Late Collins penalty keep Scots even 1-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ John Collins buried a 38th-minute
penalty kick and Scotland kept Brazil to a 1-1 draw at halftime of
the opening match of the 16th World Cup on Wednesday.
	   Collins' penalty came after Cesar Sampaio, who gave Brazil the
lead on a fourth-minute header, was called for running over the
back of Kevin Gallacher as the Scot tried to get to the headed
cross from Christian Dailly.
	   Collins, who plays for AS Monaco and has a legion of fans in
France, drilled the penalty to the lower left corner and gave no
chance to Brazilian keeper Taffarel.
	   Sampaio was yellow-carded for his foul on Gallacher, wiping out
his effort that put Brazil in the lead.
	   Cesar Sampaio's deflected a corner kick from Bebeto at the near
post, beating not only Scottish goalkeeper Jim Leighton, but Craig
Burley and Collins who were marking the Japanese-based midfielder.
	   The Scots were clearly outplayed through most of the half,
taking nearly half a minute to get the opening kickoff beyond the
midfield stripe and rarely looking threatening. It gained more of
the possession as the half wore on, but failed to maintain it for
any extended period.
	   Twice the 39-year-old Leighton, the oldest player in the
tournament, was forced into dramatic saves. In the 16th minute he
had to parry a blast from Roberto Carlos on the left side of the
penalty area, and again in the 20th he knocked away a close-range
shot from Ronaldo, who twisted three defenders around before
getting off his attempt from near the goal box.
	   Scotland's best chance before the penalty came in the 29th
minute when Junior Baiano had to use the outside of his left heal
to clear a short-range cross into the goal box from Kevin Gallacher
with Gordon Durie closing to convert on the pass.
	   The new ban on the tackle-from-behind was tested twice in the
first half.
	   Darren Jackson took a swipe in the 17th minute at Junior Baiano
as the Brazilian went forward with the ball from in midfield. Both
players stayed on their feet and Spanish referee Jose Garcia Aranda
only whistled Jackson for the foul.
	   He issued no card to Jackson, but did summon him over for a
verbal warning.
	   Brazilian defender Aldair was issued a card in the third minute
of injury time, bringing down Gallacher and apparently lucky not to
be ejected.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Lineups &QC; 
	   Brazil: Taffarel; Cafu, Aldair, Junior Baiano; Cesar Sampaio,
Giovanni, Dunga, Rivaldo, Roberto Carlos; Ronaldo, Bebeto

Coup plotters planned revolt weeks in advance, says witness
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ Two alleged coup leaders were preparing
their revolt at least six weeks before they led a group of rebels
in an assault on the state broadcast center, a court heard
Wednesday.
	   the testimony, on the second day of the nation's largest treason
trial, contradicted suggestions that the bungled Oct. 28 coup
attempt was hastily carried out at short notice by disgruntled and
drunken officers.
	   Army Capt. Christopher Musonda, a state witness in the treason
trial of 77 coup suspects, testified he had been an information
officer with the broadcast center when he was approached last
September by two of the alleged coup leaders.
	   He told the High Court in Lusaka that Capt. Steven Lungu and
Capt. Jack Chiti asked him six weeks before the coup attempt for
details on how the broadcast center was normally defended.
	   Musonda said he refused to divulge details of his unit's guard
duties.
	   During the coup attempt, Lungu allegedly made a announcement on
state radio under the pseudonym of ``Captain Solo'' that President
Frederick Chiluba had been toppled.
	   All those charged, including two politicians, appeared in court
together and are charged with treason, an offense that carry a
possible death sentence.
	   Lance Cpl. John Ngulube, the first of 163 state witnesses
scheduled to testify in the trial, on Tuesday told Judge Japhet
Banda he was approached in a bar two weeks before the attempted
coup and was asked to join a conspiracy to overthrow the
government.
	   The coup attempt crumbled when loyal troops quickly recaptured
the state radio station.
	   Earlier in the hearing, Banda rejected a defense application to
dismiss treason charges against Dean Mung'omba, head of the small
opposition Zambia Democratic Congress Party, and Nakatindi Wina, a
ruling party women's leader.
	   Lesser charges against former President Kenneth Kaunda and a
bodyguard of failing to report prior knowledge of the revolt were
dropped on June 1.
	   Kaunda, 74, led the nation to independence and ruled for 27
years until he was ousted by Chiluba in Zambia's first democratic
elections in 1991.

Warning strikes as retail workers push for higher wages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ About 300 retail workers in Hesse
state staged walkouts Wednesday, as union and employer
representatives prepared to return to negotiations next week to
settle a wage dispute.
	   The HBV union is demanding wage increases of 4.5 percent for
some 175,000 retail workers in the Hesse state region, but after
three rounds of failed talks that ended last month, the employers
last offer was 1.26 percent.
	   HBV spokesman Guenter Wolters said the union was preparing to
call for more walkouts prior to resumption of negotiations next
Tuesday.
	   Meanwhile, the HBV, which also represents wholesale workers who
are demanding 5 percent pay increases in the northern Hamburg
region, said 250 people at two companies staged warning strikes
there. Employers in Hamburg have offered 1.7 percent raises.
	   In Bavaria state, where some 40,000 wholesalers work, the union
and employers agreed on 2.5 percent raises effect July 1, which HBV
said was an acceptable offer.

World Cup opens to sounds of bagpipes and samba
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MORT ROSENBLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Special Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ A Brazilian ablaze in green and
yellow danced a Highland fling with a tanked-up Scot, whose
blue-painted pals in kilts sang a samba rhythm in passable
Portuguese with a Scottish burr.
	   It was that kind of day. Only a lucky 80,000 World Cup fans got
through the gates of France's brand new space ship-stadium, but
that did not stop the bagpipe and conga drum carnival outside.
	   A Scot in a skirt inadvertently stepped on a whooshing air vent,
a la Marilyn Monroe, and proved the widely held belief that nothing
is worn under a kilt.
	   ``Who's going to win?'' reflected Ray Sangster, a dignified
Aberdeen executive with Scottish colors emblazoned on both cheeks.
``Brazil, of course. But it's all about being here to enjoy the
moment.''
	   He grinned widely and added, ``Win or lose, we'll party all
night.''
	   Most other Scots said they thought they would win, even if all
Brazilians were certain that they would not.
	   ``It'll be 2-0, I promise you,'' assured Tom Brown, in a red
fright wig, who was down to the dregs of a liter of scotch. The
number ``18'' was penned on its side. ``I've already done the other
17,'' he said, possibly exaggerating.
	   Brown had a ticket, and he insisting on showing it. With
elaborate ceremony, he tucked his shirt and unzipped a money belt
wrapped around his waist. ``Here!'' he said, with a snaggle-toothed
grin.
	   A Brazilian weaved back and forth through the crowds on a
12-foot-high bicycle, hardly noticed among the costumes, color and
clamor.
	   Four fetching French women in old-fashioned red striped bathing
costumes posed for photos _ for a price _ with fans from both sides
who tried to get the most for their money.
	   In one corner, Charlotte Bosch, a Norwegian make-up artist,
charged nearly four bucks a cheek (20 francs) to decorate fans from
a rainbow of watercolors spread out on a blanket.
	   ``I do Brazil, Scotland, any country you want,'' she said. Bosch
had painted more Scots, often in full face colors from hairline to
neck. Brazilians preferred more discreet flags, on which she
carefully included the stars of the Southern Cross.
	   One customer was Jo Miranda, 23, with a shaved head and a
diamond in his ear. A student in Switzerland, he came over even
though he failed to get a ticket.
	   ``Brazil, 3-0. Write it down,'' he commanded, waving a clear
plastic cup of cola that was suspiciously pale and reeked of rum.
	   Miranda was furious with France was not making more tickets
available for foreigners. ``Michel Platini really screwed up,'' he
said, referring to the French soccer hero who is co-president of
the organizing committee.
	   His friend, Cristiano Fernandes, flew over from Miami although a
French travel agent did not deliver the ticket he bought. A scalper
outside offered him one for dlrs 2,000.
	   Nearby, a man carried a sign in two languages: ``I'm looking for
a ticket. Normal price please.''
	   Thousands of supporters for each team made it inside, thundering
applause at every slight advantage. When Cesar Sampaio butted in
the first goal, the yellow section went wild. Then it was
Scotland's turn.
	   Scottish fans included Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, who
sat in a luxious box with French President Jacques Chirac and Joao
Havelange, the retiring president of FIFA, the international
football association.
	   The crowd loved elaborate opening ceremonies, a symbolic
flowering of the world.
	   Fat fuzzy green seeds danced the length of the field, then
covered in with green, from which five huge buds sprouted. These
bloomed into colorful sphere, which released thousands of balloons
over the Stade de France.
	   In contrast to snarls over the past week, transportation systems
seemed to work. Metros and fast suburban trains, if jammed with
rowdy people, rolled along steadily. Taxis got through the freeway.
There was not an empty seat in the house.

Three factions accuse Ethiopia of interfering in Somali affairs

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somali (AP) _ Three factions loyal to south Mogadishu
faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid on Wednesday accused Ethiopia
of interfering in Somali affairs by supplying weapons, ammunition
and arms to the breakaway Republic of Somaliland.
	   The three factions _ the Somali National Movement, the Somali
Democratic Alliance and the United Somali Front _ originated in
northwestern Somalia _ the same territory now claimed by
internationally unrecognized Somaliland.
	   Forces loyal to Mohamed Ibrahim Egal formed the breakaway
republic in 1991 after some faction leaders allied to oust dictator
Mohamed Siad Barre, and Somalia then broke up into myriad fiefdoms
protected by militiamen loyal to clan-based factions.
	   In a strongly worded statement issued in Mogadishu, the three
factions also condemned Ethiopia for defying resolutions by the
United Nations, the Organization of African Unity and the regional
Inter-Governmental Authority on Development imposing an arms
embargo on Somalia.
	   The faction leaders also charge that Ethiopia violates Somalia's
territorial integrity by sending military envoys to the Somaliland
capital, Hargeisa.
	   The three factions said Ethiopia is serving its own military and
economic interests by opening a mission in Hargeisa and offering an
office to Egal's representatives in the Ethiopian capital, Addis
Ababa.
	   The three factions called in Ethiopia to refrain from actions
that may worse the security situation in the volatile region of the
Horn of Africa.
	   Ethiopia has been accused of supplying weapons and ammunition to
erstwhile Aidid rival and north Mogadishu warlord Ali Mahdi
Mohammed and to the Somali Salvation Democratic Front based in
northeastern Somalia.
	   Ethiopian forces are also reported to have entered the Somali
border region of Gedo in support of the Somali National Front
faction which is fighting the Islamic fundamentalist group
Al-Itihad Al-Islam.
	   Ethiopia's military officers are also reported to be holding
training camps for Hawadle clan militiamen in the central Somali
region of Hiran. At least 750 former militiamen trained in and
supervised by the Ethiopia are said to be active in Hiran.
	   Nearly all Somalis trace their ancestry to six original clans.
These are divided into sub-clans and extended families _ most of
which have become created armed units for protection since the
breakup of the Somali state in early 1991.

Bitterness and hope in shadow of shiny stadium

	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Barely a football field away from the
World Cup's main stadium, Mamadou Soumare can hear the roar of the
crowd from his housing complex.
	   ``I don't have a seat, but you still hear the music and the
cries,'' said Soumare, the 16-year-old son of African immigrants.
	   Across a footbridge over a canal is the shiny and massive Stade
de France, where tens of thousands of soccer revelers have come
from around the globe to cheer on their teams.
	   They rub elbows with some of the locals, who sell souvenirs or
work as security guards. Some locals won drawings for tickets, but
many others feel shut out, in more ways than one.
	   The Stade de France cost 2.6 billion francs (dlrs 430 million),
and Saint-Denis, a suburb north of the capital, bargained with
Paris to secure more than that amount in development funding.
	   But the funding so far has created only a few hundred long-term
jobs in this depressed town where France once buried its kings.
	   Many say the money isn't trickling down to enough people in an
area devastated by industrial decline.
	   ``The exterior has changed, but the interior is the same,'' said
Soumare, whose Franc-Moisin housing project had a recent facelift
but remains plagued by unemployment and crime.
	   ``They spent so many billions and still people are living on the
edge,'' said Fred Fiquet, a 29-year-old jobless graffiti artist who
stencils his tags on T-shirts.
	   Getting a permit to hawk them outside the stadium would cost too
much, so the nearby Decathlon sporting goods store is selling them
instead.
	   ``I love soccer. It's important to life. But people like me
can't go. The locals aren't enough of a part of the event,'' he
said.
	   The front page of the Le Monde newspaper recently ran a cartoon
of the shiny Stade de France surrounded by high-rise slums. On the
scoreboard was 350 billion francs for the stadium, 0 for housing.
	   ``We Lost!, We Lost!, We Lost!'' shout the shabby buildings.
	   The cartoon outraged city officials, starting with Communist
Mayor Patrick Braouezec. ``It's a caricature, and it's particularly
unjust,'' he said in an interview.
	   ``There's a lot more work to do,'' he said. But the stadium
``was a good deal, because we gained 10 years in urban
development.''
	   Development funding helped the city give the Franc-Moisin
complex new landscaping, a paint and trim. It extended the subway
to a university and built a train station for the stadium.
	   The project brought improved roads and covered France's main
northern highway _ which slices through the heart of the city _
with parks. Outside the stadium is a new commercial complex with
cinemas, fast food restaurants and a sports department store that
all employ residents from Franc-Moisin.
	   ``This used to be a really tough place,'' Sam Berrandou said as
he strolled through Franc-Moisin with his young son. Five police
buzzed by on scooters.
	   But unemployment here remains at 17 percent overall and 28
percent among young adults, and crime has risen in recent years in
the town of 91,000 people.
	   Overcrowding in sometimes violent classrooms sparked a five-week
strike by the city's teachers and students. Parents joined in with
them last month, when they clasped hands around the Stade de
France.
	   ``We didn't want to them to forget us,'' said Darline Guervil,
15, who was part of the human chain. The government promised 3,000
new teaching jobs for the Seine-Saint-Denis department, or region.
	   Officials hope the stadium will help attract a center for sports
medicine, housing, restaurants, a bowling alley and other
businesses, creating more jobs.
	   Mohamed Aid-Ouazou, 21, who's been hired temporarily as a city
transit security aide, is skeptical. ``You know what I think? After
the World Cup, there won't be any more work,'' he said.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Tues. - Despite the current economic situation,
the Health Ministry has increased its annual budget for medicines
in Government hospitals and clinics due to the increase in their
cost and the growing number of patients.
	   The budget allocated for medicines this year was RM274 million -
an increase of RM14 million compared to last year - said Health
Minister Datuk Chua Jui Meng.
	   However, he said the amount was still insufficient to meet the
cost of medicines which had risen by about 15 per cent in the past
year, as well as the number of patients which increased by some 20
per cent in Government hospitals and clinics.
	   He said for this reason, the ministry was expecting to receive a
RM78 million loan from the World Bank, through the Finance Ministry
to supplement its existing budget.
	   He said despite the situation, the ministry had asked State
health authorities not to ``be stingy'' and hold back on medicines
to cut cost.
	   ``The Government has given its assurance that money will be
available for medicines,'' he told reporters after his opening
speech on the second day of the third Health Ministry annual
dialogue.
	   In his speech, Chua said the local traditional medicine industry
had made tremendous progress towards complying with the Good
Manufacturing Practise in order to receive legitimate licensing.
	   He said last year, 40 traditional medicine manufacturers were
licensed compared to 11 last year.
	   Ninety more manufacturers are expected to be licensed by the end
of this year.
	   Chua urged the local pharmaceutical industry to invest more in
research and development to produce new drugs, so that the country
can be self- sufficient in medicine supply.
	   Sixteen industrial organisations presented their memorandums at
today's session including representatives of the Cosmetic, Toiletry
and Fragrance Association, Pharmaceutical Association of Malaysia,
National Homeopathy Council, Malaysian Medicinal Industry
Association, and the Soap and Detergent Industry.

Britain rules out 2008 bid, points to 2010
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The British Olympic Association on Wednesday
virtually ruled out a London bid for the 2008 Olympics, setting the
stage instead for a 2012 candidacy.
	   The BOA noted that Toronto, Osaka and Istanbul have confirmed
their intention to bid for the 2008 games. The Spanish city of
Seville has also declared its candidacy, while Buenos Aires is also
expected to enter the race.
	   The BOA said it is unlikely the 2008 games will be awarded to a
European city since the 2004 summer games will be held in Athens
and the 2006 winter games will be staged at a European venue still
to be determined.
	   A BOA statement said it is continuing to study the issues of
transportation, accomodation and sports facilities for a possible
2012 bid.
	   ``A later bid gives us the opportunity to ensure that we have
the time to plan effectively ... and to deal with the complexities
of mounting a successful bid,'' BOA chairman Craig Reedie said.
	   The United States has already announced its intention to bid for
the 2012 games, with nine separate bids under consideration by the
U.S. Olympic Committee.

Proposed talks to end coup attempt in Guinea-Bissau collapse
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with talks called off &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Talks between renegade soldiers and a
parliamentary delegation collapsed Wednesday just before they were
due to begin, diminishing the chances of a peaceful end to the coup
attempt in the West African Nation of Guinea Bissau.
	   ``The (planned) negotiations fell apart because the president
said he couldn't vouch for the delegation's safety (in the rebel
held areas),'' opposition politician Helder Vaz said on Portuguese
state radio RDP-Africa.
	   The four-member delegation was hoping to mediate a peaceful
solution to the standoff between the rebels and government troops
surrounding them, but President Joao Bernardo Viera said he did not
agree with the talks proposal because he could not guarantee the
deputies' well-being.
	   Vaz said the soldiers who launched the coup attempt on Sunday
feared a major offensive against their positions after learning
that foreign troops were disembarking at Bissau port.
	   He accused the international community of standing by while the
government prepared a ``bloodbath''.
	   Troops from neighboring Senegal and the Republic of Guinea
arrived in the country on Tuesday to support the government forces.
	   An unknown number of rebels, led by former armed forces chief
Brig. Gen. Ansumane Mane, are holed up at a military complex, in
the suburb of Bra, 15 kilometers (10 miles) outside the capital.
	   Miguel Amado, the European Union representative in Bissau, said
in a telephone interview that the planned talks had not been
rescheduled. ``We are trying to convince the government not to
attack the rebels,'' Amado told the Lisbon bureau of the Associated
Press.
	   A ceasefire was in place in preparation for the talks, according
to Amado, but he was not sure whether it would hold.
	   A spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Bissau said the capital was
quiet Tuesday night.
	   ``There was some sporadic mortar fire overnight, but it was a
whole lot quieter than it has been,'' Bryan Hunt said in a
telephone interview. ``It's a stalemate situation.''
	   Mane, describing himself as head of the self-proclaimed Military
Junta for the Consolidation of Democracy, Peace and Justice, said
in a statement Tuesday that he had no intention of seizing power
himself. The statement called on the President and the government
to step down.
	   Foreign Minister Fernando Delfim da Silva rejected the call for
an early ballot, saying legislative elections were scheduled for
this year and a presidential election was due in 1999.

	   SHAH ALAM, Tues. - The Selangor Government has warned heads of
departments, staff and politicians that it will take to court
anyone leaking Government secrets.
	   Menteri Besar Datuk Abu Hassan Omar said he would not compromise
on matters which are classified under the Official Secrets Act.
	   Speaking to reporters after attending the State-level 11th
convention on ``Kumpulan Meningkat Mutu Kerja'' at Dewan Jubli
Perak here, Abu Hassan said it had come to his knowledge that
several state secrets and documents had been leaked to the public
in the last few months.
	   ``We are yet to know who was responsible for the leakage but we
are viewing it seriously. What we fear most is it falling into the
wrong hands,'' he said, declining to say what the secrets are.
	   Abu Hassan said classified information discussed at meetings
held either at State or district levels have been leaked to the
public.
	   ``This is not good and this trend must be stopped. The public
might not know these are official secrets and they might pass it on
to others including the media. We want to control it before it gets
out of hand.''
	   Abu Hassan said at the last two weekly state executive council
meetings he had stressed this to all Exco members and department
heads to ensure that state secrets and documents classified under
OSA are not leaked out.
	   He said security at the State Government building, which was
``very lax''
	   was being tightened.
	   ``Public and Press members who come to the State Government
building must co-operate with the authorities concerned by
complying with the security measures,'' he added.
	   Earlier in his speech, Abu Hassan said he was happy that several
Government departments and agencies had formed quality groups to
boost productivity by providing better counter services, resolving
consumer problems efficiently and having a good documentation
system which saves a lot of time. ``As we move into realising the
State's Vision 2005, there is need for more value added service and
departments must work towards resolving all forms of complex issues
that arise with development.''
	   He said departments and agencies should come up with more
positive and fast measures on resolving current issues such as
haze, forest fires, water shortage and rationing and most of all
public complaints.
	   Abu Hassan directed State secretary Datuk Hashim Meon to ensure
all government departments and agencies, including local
authorities, form groups to study how best their respective
departments can further improve their services.

	   PORT KLANG, Tues. - An oil tanker, Petro Ranger, which was
released from custody by the Chinese authorities two weeks ago,
arrived in Port Klang yesterday after undergoing minor repairs in
Singapore.
	   All its seven Malaysian seamen and its new captain, a
Singaporean, were onboard the vessel.
	   The Malaysians were identified as Saravanan Subramanian, Mohamed
Nazri Selamat, Abdul Kadir Soad, Sani Anak Ugie, Mohd Faizal Mohd
Ghazali, Mohd Shizul Khan M. Razali and Mohd Samsuri Abdul Kadir.
	   They are expected to leave the ship today, after being
interviewed by officers from the Marine Department's Maritime
Safety Division.
	   The division's director, Captain Ahmad Othman, said the ship's
former captain, Kenneth Blyth - believed to have suffered
depression following his ordeal at the hands of Indonesian pirates
- was allowed to leave for Australia by ship's owner, Petroships
Pte Ltd, after the crew was released.
	   He said the crew were interviewed by the Singapore authorities
last week before they were allowed to leave.
	   Ahmad said the crew had concurred with the Chinese authorities'
finding that the pirates were Indonesians who boarded the vessel
while it was enroute to Vietnam on April 16.
	   In an unrelated case, Ahmad said the department had received a
report from the Indonesian authorities on an attempted pirate
attack on a Malaysian cargo ship on March 27.
	   The ship, Malaysian Empress, was sailing to Sabah when it was
trailed by a group of men in a speedboat for several hours.
	   The report said the group sped off when the ship's crew turned
on its deck lights.

World Cup: Milutinovic juggles lineup to offset injuries
</HEADLINE>

	   RESSONS, France (AP) _ Wrestling with a slew of injuries,
Nigeria coach Bora Milutinovic tried various lineup combinations in
practice Wednesday, including working Mobi Oparaku at right back
just hours after the defender was placed on the roster.
	   ``I have 22 players and may wind up using them all,''
Milutinovic said with a smile. ``Anything is possible. I will
announce my lineup one hour before we play.''
	   Oparaku substitutes Jero Shakpore, who was ruled out with a
broken collarbone.
	   The lineup woes do not end there for the Super Eagles, who are
looking to build on their success at the 1994 tournament _ where
they reached the second round in their debut appearance _ and the
1996 Olympic gold.
	   Striker Daniel Amokachi skipped the training session in this
village north of Paris because of a twisted right knee suffered
Tuesday.
	   In addition, Inter Milan forward Nwankwo Kanu, who can dominate
any defense when healthy, worked on his own for the third straight
day.
	   He may rejoin his teammates Thursday, Milutinovic said, but time
is running out for the 21-year-old to reach match fitness ahead of
Saturday's opening game against Spain at Nantes.
	   In a scrimmage at the end of the two-hour session _ the longest
Nigeria has had since arriving in France last Saturday _
Milutinovic juggled his formation.
	   The stocky Oparaku, who plays for Belgian club Kepellen, worked
mostly in Shakpore's spot in the right flank. FIFA, soccer's
governing body, approved the roster substitution Wednesday morning.
	   The rest of the backline looks set, with captain Uche Okechukwu
and Kanu's Inter Milan teammate Taribo West in the middle and
Celestine Babayaro on the left.
	   With Kanu and Amokachi unavailable _ and striker Emmanuel
Amunike not even on the squad because of a knee injury _
Milutinovic had veteran Rasheed Yekini and 1997 African Player of
the Year Victor Ikpeba up front.
	   As he has all week, Milutinovic stressed containment at midfield
and defensive help, with players working on covering passing lanes.
	   The Yugoslav coach, hired in February after being dismissed by
Mexico, expressed concern he has not had sufficient opportunities
to work with the players. The uncertainties with the lineup can't
help.
	   ``You never know how much time you need to mold a team,'' said
Milutinovic, coaching his record fourth different country at a
World Cup. ``You can work years and not get a good result or do
well with little work.''
	   The latter has not been the case for his team, which has lost
exhibitions to Germany, Yugoslavia and the Netherlands.
	   Sunday Oliseh insisted the string of poor outings has not
dampened the players' outlook.
	   ``We may not be candidates for the title, but definitely for the
second round. We just want to do better than (we did in) 1994,''
the Ajax of Amsterdam midfielder said, ``and we expect to.''

	   CONTRASTING SCENES ... for these passengers at the Sultan Abdul
Aziz Shah International Airport in Subang (right) yesterday,
nostalgia was not quite the word to describe the country's main
international airport for 33 years. It has less than three weeks to
go.
	   From June 30 it will be a whole new scenario as passengers
travel through the Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang,
dubbed the most modern and sophisticated airport in Asia.
	   It will certainly be goodbye to congestion as Subang is now
handling beyond its capacity of 16 million passengers annually.
	   With 479,404sq metres of passenger space, the new airport will
be capable of handling about 25 million passengers in its first
year of operation.
	   KLIA will have more open areas for passengers to move about, and
higher ceilings to add to its ambience.
	   And with more facilities and retail outlets, it will also offer
passengers a higher level of convenience.
	   As Subang wound down its operations, it was a different scene at
KLIA.
	   Yesterday, workers at the new airport were busy preparing for
its opening ceremony on June 27.
	   The picture shows the arboretum at KLIA's Satellite A building
in the background, depicting the airport's concept of being ``A
forest in an airport and an airport in a forest''.
	   Visitor Ted Klainer, from the United States, looks at the Flight
Information Display System in the foreground which will provide
passengers information on aircraft gates, check-in counters and
flight times.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Tues. - The first batch of 300 Malaysian soldiers
serving under the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's
Stabilisation Force in Bosnia-Herzegovina is expected to arrive
home tomorrow.
	   The 790-strong Malaysian Contingent V, based in the former
Balkan republic, will return home in stages following the end of
Nato's mandate in the country.
	   A Defence Ministry spokesman said the first group, led by Mej
Zulkafli Abdul Aziz, would touch down at the Royal Malaysian Air
Force base in Subang.
	   Armed Forces chief Jen Tan Sri Ismail Omar is expected to
receive them.
	   He said the second and third group would arrive home on June 26
and July 10, respectively.
	   On the assets used during the mission, the spokesman said they
would be transported from Split, Croatia, early next month.
	   Malcon V, led by Kol Syed Khalid Syed Mahmod, assumed duties
from Malcon IV last December.

Two Iranian papers stop publishing, one after losing its license
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from editor-in-chief of Jameah, color,
ADDS byline.
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ One of Iran's most popular newspapers,
Jameah or ``Society,'' had its license revoked Wednesday after its
editor was convicted of defamation.
	   The revocation came hours after a second newspaper ceased
publication because the Press Supervisory Board was accusing it of
unethical reporting.
	   The two moves are seen as a setback for the press freedom
promoted by moderate President Mohammad Khatami since he took
office in August.
	   A court banned the editor of Jameah, Hamid Reza Jalaipur, from
working in a similar position for one year and fined him 16 million
rials (dlrs 3,500), the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
	   Jameah's editor-in-chief, Mahmoud Shamsolwaizine, told The
Associated Press that the newspaper will continue to publish
because the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance has not
officially informed it of the revocation.
	   ``The ministry has to issue that order and so far it has not
done so,'' he said, adding that once the order is issued, Jameah
will appeal. ``Meanwhile, we will continue to publish our paper.''
	   The offices of the newspaper were operating Wednesday evening,
with writers and photographers preparing material for Thursday's
issue.
	   ``We strongly protest this order and we believe this is the
harshest punishment for freedoms in the history of Iran's press,''
Shamsolwaizine said.
	   The newspaper's telephone lines were jammed with callers
expressing their support. Some offering to stage rallies to protest
the court ruling.
	   ``We believe this is a political game,'' Shamsolwaizine said.
``The judiciary should prove that this order is a judicial matter
and in that case we will accept it.''
	   Jameah is regarded as a newspaper that tests the limits of the
press freedom introduced since Khatami came to power. An afternoon
paper, its run of 200,000 copies sells out within hours.
	   The prosecution accused Jalaipur of publishing ``insults and
lies.'' The substance of the charge was not disclosed, but
state-run television has said that the Islamic Revolutionary Guards
Corps had accused the paper of falsely publishing that its
commander was opposed to liberalization.
	   The publisher of Gozaresh-e-Ruz, or Daily Report, Mohammad
Mahdavi Khorrami said he was voluntarily stopping the publication
of his paper until a verdict in the case brought by the supervisory
board, the newspaper Salam reported Wednesday.
	   The Justice Ministry is reviewing the complaint against
Gozaresh-e-Ruz. If the paper is prosecuted in court, it could also
lose its license.
	   A liberal publication, Gozaresh-e-Ruz was launched only last
month. On its third day it printed a front-page picture of a
teenage boy with a teenage girl wearing a head scarf. The caption,
``Friendship Under Fear,'' referred to the prohibition on dating
under Iran's strict Islamic code.
	   A Culture Ministry official, Ahmad Borqani, was quoted this week
as saying that Gozaresh-e-Ruz had followed ``quite an inappropriate
path from the beginning of its publication.''
	   Borqani told the Iran News that Gozaresh-e-Ruz had also printed
``a false report'' about Iranian officials transferring money to
overseas bank accounts.
	   The reforms introduced by Khatami are said to enjoy the support
of most Iranians. But conservative elements in the government,
particularly in the judiciary, are opposed to his policies.

Six arrested in connection with Rwandan genocide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ Six Rwandans have been arrested in
connection with the 1994 ethnic slaughter in their country, the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda said Wednesday.
	   One of the six, Emmanuel Bagambiki, has been indicted by the
tribunal on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. He was
prefect of the southwestern border town of Cyangugu.
	   The other five were arrested provisionally, as allowed by he
tribunal's rules.
	   They are Mathieu Ngirumpaste, once a top foreign ministry
official and president of Rwanda's former ruling party, the MRND;
Edouard Karamera, former party vice president and interior minister
of the interim government; Joseph Nziorera, former president of
Rwanda's National Assembly; Juvenal Kajelijeli, former mayor of the
town of Murkingo; and Omar Serushago, a leader of the interahamwe
militia that carried out much of the killing.
	   At least 500,000 people were killed in Rwanda over a three-month

	   The tribunal has indicted 35 people; 24 of whom are now in
custody at the tribunal in Arusha. Four are standing trial and one
has pleaded guilty to genoide and crimes against humanity.
	   The latest arrests were carried out by authorities in the West
African countries of Benin, Togo, Mali and Ivory Coast, the

	   A BILL to allow the corporatisation of the Penang Water
Authority is expected to be approved in the current meeting of the
Penang State Legislative Assembly.
	   And residents are very concerned. Their experience with
``corporatisation'' and ``privatisation'' has not been entirely
pleasant.
	   Each time they hear these words, they know that rates are going
up.
	   It has not been different this time. Penang residents have been
warned of an imminent increase in water rates.
	   This worry was reflected in the State Assembly proceedings when
several backbenchers and the lone Opposition representative sought
assurances that the corporatisation would benefit the public.
	   Barisan Nasional Assemblyman for Permatang Pasir Ahmad Saad
claimed the services of Penang Port Sdn Bhd were deteriorating and
that fewer ships were calling at the port, where operations were
corporatised in 1994.
	   The Penang Port management is seeking to reduce its staff of
2,300 by not more than 700 through a voluntary retrenchment scheme.
	   Its executive chairman Datuk Zahrain Hashim said the port could
reduce its RM60 million annual expenditure on salaries by RM20
million.
	   Ahmad observed that at the end of the day, the problems faced by
the retrenched workers would be laid on the lap of the Government.
	   Before corporatisation, there was one general manager, but
today, in addition to a senior general manager, there are 10
general managers.
	   One general manager - heading the bulk cargo terminal - has only
33 workers under him.
	   Each general manager earns between RM6,500 and RM8,250 and
enjoys numerous perks including a Peugeot 405SR automatic and a
laptop computer.
	   Staff of Penang Port Sdn Bhd have reservations about some of the
management's decisions, including the purchase of a RM1 million VIP
boat.
	   Penang Port Commission Employees' Union president Zamri Abdullah
said: ``Why buy the boat? It is not going to generate revenue, only
incur expenditure.''
	   In all fairness, it must be said that the PPSB under Zahrain has
not done that badly.
	   There was a 12.5 per cent increase in cargo throughput last year
with a total of 19.69 million tonnes against 17.5 million tonnes in
1996.
	   In 1993, the pre-tax profit was RM24.14 million but after
corporatisation in 1994, this increased to RM41.48 million.
	   In 1995, the pre-tax profit was RM36.01 million and in 1996, it
dropped to RM22.03 million. Last year's profit has yet to be
announced.
	   In 1994, turnover was RM138.87 million, in 1995, it was RM156.02
million, and in 1996, it stood at RM159.71 million while operating
expenditure kept increasing from RM104.71 million (1994) to
RM117.32 million (1995) and RM133.30 million (1996).
	   In 1993, the turnover was RM126.94 million while operating
expenditure stood at RM108.41 million.
	   With negative news about the PPSB management circulating, Penang
residents can be forgiven for being wary about a corporatised PWA.
	   Port and ferry charges were raised when the PPSB came into being
and their fear of an increase in water rates has been confirmed by
Chief Minister Tan Sri Dr Koh Tsu Koon.
	   ``The Government will ensure that the increase will not burden
the people,'' he said in giving an assurance.
	   How? Any increase is bound to be a burden on the wage earner,
especially during difficult times.
	   But Koh is only mouthing what every government leader says. Each
time toll and electricity rates or food prices increase, we hear
the ubiquitous quote: ``We will ensure that the increase in
rates/prices do not burden the public.''
	   Barisan Nasional Assemblywoman for Jawi Tan Cheng Liang voiced
the thoughts of many when she asked: ``Since the PWA has been
making profits running into tens of millions of ringgit, why raise
rates?''
	   According to Koh, the increase is to discourage people from
wasting water.
	   Residents find it easier to gulp down water than this logic.
What if Tenaga Nasional Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd and food outlets
raise charges to ``prevent wastage''?
	   Another issue is who will head a corporatised PWA? Will an
experienced and skilled man be appointed or, as is not uncommon,
someone with political connections get the post?
	   Zamri points to the PPSB as a case in point: ``Datuk Zahrain,
who was then Tanjung Umno division chief, was inexperienced but he
was made executive chairman.
	   ``Is this the manner in which the Government operates in
corporatisation efforts?
	   ``Politics and business should not mix. It is unhealthy. When
politicians are appointed to head business entities or appointed
directors, many problems will arise.''
	   The Government would do well to heed Zamri's observation, which
also reflects that of many Penang residents.

	   PETALING JAYA, Mon. - Hotels have until October to start billing
customers according to a nett charge instead of indicating charges
for service and Government tax.
	   Culture, Arts and Tourism Minister Datuk Sabbaruddin Chik said
even though the ministry would not penalise hotels, their
non-compliance would be viewed as ``lackadaisical and
irresponsible''.
	   The current ++ price tagging practised by the majority of the
hotels nationwide, represents a 10 per cent service charge in lieu
of tips and five per cent Government tax.
	   Sabbaruddin was speaking to reporters after launching the
Malaysia Bagus Luxury Holidays at the Sheraton Subang.
	   After a series of discussions, the Hotel Owners' Association
Malaysia had agreed to discard the ++ tag while giving a nett rate
for guests and to include the service and Government tax in its
nett price.
	   ``Hoteliers will not lose anything if they withdraw the ++
signs. The price will not be lower than now,'' he said. Coupled
with other attractive packages, hoteliers would get more guests.
	   Sabbaruddin said guests would find it easier to calculate their
bills.

	   SINGAPORE has always had a reputation far beyond its shores. The
great port of a hundred years ago where Conrad changed ships so
often, Maugham's early century Grand Hotel of whiskey stengahs and
scandalous stories, the notorious mid-century haven of sin and
crime, followed by a comparatively quiet decade from which it
emerged as the world's squeaky-cleanest city, currently too - if we
are to believe its more serious writes - Big Brother's last
fortress of mental regimentation in return for material prosperity,
why should it not also become, continuing its present development,
the modern robot city of the future? Which is what the back cover
of The Singapore String tantalisingly advertises will happen.
	   Its English author Jenny Gay has lived in Singapore, married to
a Singaporean, for 25 years. She is qualified in Social Work,
English and French literature, Philosophy, and teaching, and is
currently the principal of Chatsworth International School.
	   A (quite unnecessary) photo shows her happily seated with her
mother, husband, and two sons. None of this is interesting for its
own sake, of course, unless Gay is also a good, in addition to
being a serious, writer.
	   At once, let me say that she is, absolutely, in every one of the
11 stories in the volume.
	   These stories, she claims in a preface, are not predictions but
only portrayals of ``a few of the infinite number of positive
futures for Singapore''. Yet she coyly adds that perhaps
Singapore's future ``fact'' may go further, ``indeed show itself to
be stranger than (her) fiction''. For this to happen her stories -
indeed, all good futuristic writing, whether fantasy or science
fiction - should be related to, should be viable projections of,
the present.
	   This, all but one attempt to be. Projecting the future of
today's Emancipated, Emotion-drained, Reason-regimented Singapore
Female, she creates a sexless 17-year-old genius (`Sweet Little
Singapore Miss') who, when it is Singapore's turn to be World
Capital some time after World Unity in 2025, is chosen to be World
President; another ugly she who runs a phenomenally successful
health centre (her story, `Twenty-First Century Mosquito', is the
least futuristic in the book); and yet a third unloved genius who,
having discovered a way for women to have babies without sexual
intercourse, gets rid of nearly all males from the university's
medical faculty (`Hysteria').
	   On the theme of the Machine-controlled Society we have a lonely
woman whose social life is determined and eventually terminated by
her futuristic computer phone (`Human Error'); a homosexual who
falls in love with his robot butler (`Love at First Sight'); and a
suffering widow who cannot marry again because her detested husband
is waiting in a frozen coffin to return to life when a cure is
found for the disease which killed him (`The Late Lamented').
	   The Ugly Singaporean appears in the title story `The Singapore
Sting' and Ugly Singaporean activities in the powerful but sick
`Share and Bear', in which a group of desperate game-show
contestants compete to die in front of the television cameras.
	   The results of world pollution are memorably described in
`Veteran Citizen', and it is only in `Trial Run', about a man in
his fourth body after scientists have discovered how humans, like
cats, can have multiple lives, that fantasy runs riot without any
social implications.
	   All these stories rightly centre on future Singaporeans rather
than their futuristic inventions. For people are always more
important and interesting than things. And Gay's nasty, abnormal
and decent, suffering characters are convincingly depicted. In each
case she seems to have got under their skin, more important, found
the right voice for them.
	   Consequently, if no story is a masterpiece, each sustains the
interest to the end.
	   Nevertheless, for science fiction and even fantasy to succeed
totally the new machines and other inventions must be credible, or
rather a possibility accepted by the reader. Best of all would be a
present reality carried to its extreme, like pollution - for me,
the book's finest moment is when the grandmother tells her
granddaughter in 2029 about her childhood rolling on the grass
which has for decades disappeared from the world.
	   I can easily accept too the tyrannical telephone and the frozen
husband, for the sake of the story even conception without sexual
intercourse and sex with a robot. But, nine lives? A game-show in
which you get the screen to reveal a secret from your wife's past?
Here, for me, the possible impossible becomes the lunatic
incredible. Frankenstein's Monster is the former, the hero of
`Trial Run' the latter. But I think it an insult to the
intelligence to ever pretend you can go backwards in time. A pity
though, for `Share and Bear' promised to be the finest story in the
book.
	   I have deliberately left `A Controlled Experiment', the most
different of the stories, to the end. Here the Third World War has
just ended.
	   Europe and the United States have, surprisingly, succumbed to an
unseen enemy. ``So much for our childish faith in the
invulnerability of the Western World!'' Now Singapore is suddenly
assailed. Everyone dies, first the older generation (including the
Prime Minister) and the babies, then the middle-aged followed by
the youth, till no one is left on the island.
	   A group of American soldiers visits the deserted city. Soon two
of them die suddenly.
	   A dying Singaporean writes to the outside world, ``We
Singaporeans are dying so fast that whatever the ultimate goal for
our future is few of us can live long enough to see it ... Either
the island will be devoid of real Singaporeans and the Sponsor (the
unseen enemy) will have repopulated our island to the extermination
of its true inhabitants ... or we will have become a nation of
slaves, not only physically but also mentally ...
	   I want you to know that we did not easily and knowingly succumb
to our fate but rather that it was imposed upon us by a power that
considered us sub-human, beneath all respect due to fellow beings.
	   ``If you read this you will finally have overcome the enemy, I
beg of you, have no mercy, even as we were shown no mercy ... On
behalf of all the Singaporeans who like me have suffered and died I
beg of you. Do not fail us!''
	   What is really happening here? What unseen enemy (is it even
human?) has only temporarily defeated the Western world but
completely wiped out Singapore, or turned it ``physically but also
mentally'' into ``a nation of slaves''? But why Singapore?
``Someone ... maybe knew the geographical and political advantages
of selecting an island? Someone used to making tough decisions that
would forever rob `lesser' men of their sleep? Maybe even someone
of intelligence? But surely someone with a vital organ missing -
his heart?''
	   Why did the dying (or slavery) begin with the Prime Minister's
generation and the newly born and then spread down to the youth?
Who might the fake, replacement Singaporeans be? And what exactly
is to be fought till it is totally destroyed?
	   Is this story fantasy? It clearly isn't science fiction. Is it a
parable or an allegory, the physical standing for the mental, even
spiritual? Are we in the mad dean's lands unmarked in any known map
but which are all effectively his own Britain in the opening
decades of the 18th century? Is this then a history of what has
been and is, disguised as what will be?
	   If so, then not only are 10 of Gay's stories sensible forecasts
of Singapore life based on today's reality but this 11th and most
important story also set in the century to come is what all great
literature, whether of times past, actual, or ahead, is really
about - what has happened to make our world (here, Singapore) what
it is, today, now.
	   For this story alone, buy The Singapore Sting.

	   MERSING, Tues. - The third Johor Umno Convention which ended
today has adopted just one resolution. It gave its full support to
the State infrastructure arm, Kumpulan Prasarana Rakyat Johor.
	   The resolution reads that the convention fully supports the
existence of KPRJ towards fulfilling the demand for justice and
balanced development and State Government's social responsibility
to the people.
	   It was read to the Press by the State Umno liaison secretary
Datuk Mohd Ali Hassan at the end of the convention.
	   Menteri Besar Datuk Abdul Ghani Othman, during a Press
conference later, said that the convention supported the activities
of KPRJ because these were aimed at improving and upgrading
infrastructure in the rural areas.
	   KPRJ, which was established in 1995 to implement projects like
village roads and building and refurbishing mosques and surau, has
come under heavy flak from certain quarters.
	   Some parties have alleged that KPRJ has been competing with
Bumiputera contractors in its undertaking of rural projects, while
others have questioned KPRJ's lack of transparency.

	   KOTA KINABALU, Tues. - The State Umno youth movement today
expressed full confidence in the leadership of newly-appointed
Chief Minister Tan Sri Bernard Dompok to revitalise the State
economy.
	   Its head Jema Khan Datuk Majid said Dompok's appointment as
Chief Minister under a system to rotate the post among the Muslim
Bumiputera, non-Muslim Bumiputera and Chinese was proof that the
Barisan Nasional was sensitive to the aspirations of the people.
	   Jema, who led a 15-member delegation in a courtesy call on
Dompok at his office at the Sabah Foundation, said Dompok has the
capability and experience to effectively lead the State Government.
	   He said the movement would give its full support to Dompok, who
is also State BN chairman, in dealing with the effects of the
current economic downturn.
	   Earlier, Dompok told a delegation from the Taiwan-based
TransAsia Airways that the State Government would like to see more
airlines flying to Sabah.
	   TransAsia Airways operates flights twice a week from Kaohsiung
to Kota Kinabalu via Taipeh.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ With the Serb-led Yugoslav army beefing
up forces in separatist Kosovo province, NATO defense ministers
face the growing belief that direct military intervention may be
the only way to stop the violence.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen and his 15 NATO colleagues,
meeting at alliance headquarters here Thursday and Friday, were
expected to order military planners to take a hard look at the
intervention option, such as sending in troops, conducting air
strikes or enforcing a no-fly zone.
	   ``The worsening of the situation makes it more than advisable to
work out credible options for military action, to have them ready
for a political decision at any time,'' German Defense Minister
Volker Ruehe said.
	   Cohen acknowledged ``a general consensus there should be
accelerated planning'' and that ``all NATO members feel an
increased sense of urgency.''
	   ``There is a genuine concern throughout the region that if this
goes unchecked, it could have much wider implications than just
Kosovo,'' he said.
	   NATO ambassadors worked late Wednesday on detailed instructions
for the military, including a clear statement of the objective of
any intervention.
	   Also under debate was a series of immediate measures, including
air maneuvers in the next few days over neighboring Albania and
Macedonia as a show of strength, moves to military establish
training and exercise centers and using NATO transport to help cope
with refugee flows.
	   Outside NATO headquarters Wednesday, hundreds of Albanians
protested, demanding that the Western alliance intervene in Kosovo.
	   ``If NATO doesn't take the decision to intervene as fast as
possible, we fear that the number of victims will increase,''
organizer Ramadan Gashi told Associated Press Television.
	   In Kosovo, more than 250 people have died in clashes between
government forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, armed wing of the
Albanian independence movement. Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90
percent of the population in the southern province, demand
independence from Serbia, the larger of two republics in
Yugoslavia.
	   The United States and its allies support autonomy for Kosovo but
oppose demands for independence and condemn violence on both sides.
	   In recent days, entire villages in Kosovo have been flattened
and thousands of people driven from their homes.
	   ``Kosovo is in grave danger of becoming another Bosnia,'' said
Carlos Westendorp, the High Representative in Bosnia responsible
for enforcing the civilian aspects of the Dayton peace accords.
	   ``It is as if we repair one house, only to discover the one next
door is burning down,'' he said. ``This is supposed to be the year
of returns to Bosnia, but it is rapidly becoming the year of the
exodus from Kosovo.''
	   The United States and the European Union have imposed economic
sanctions on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, but few believe
that will result in a government pullback.
	   NATO military planners have for the past two weeks been
following out earlier instructions to study indirect options for
pressuring Milosevic. Those include dispatching up to 20,000 troops
to Albania and Macedonia, reinforcing the existing 750-man U.N.
force in Macedonia and helping both countries secure their borders
while dealing with refugees and arms smuggling.
	   However, ``with the events of the last week, shoring up the
periphery seems of secondary value,'' another NATO official said.
	   Intervening in Kosovo would require a sound legal basis.
	   The United States is backing a British effort to win U.N.
Security Council approval for a resolution authorizing ``all
necessary measures,'' including direct military intervention.
	   President Boris Yeltsin says he will try to use his influence
with Milosevic, but remains firmly against intervention.
	   ``Urgent measures are needed there,'' Russian Defense Minister
Igor Sergeyev said after a meeting with Belgian officials. However,
``I think we haven't explored all the peaceful measures that we can
use.''

Mandela was target for chemical disabling, scientist alleges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with ANC reax; EDITS to conform; MINOR editing

 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's apartheid-era
government plotted to poison Nelson Mandela in an attempt to
inflict brain damage, a scientist testified Wednesday.
	   Testifying before a panel probing apartheid crimes, Schalk van
Rensburg described how his superior, Andre Immelman, told him soon
after Mandela's release there were plans to poison him with
thallium, which attacks the nervous system.
	   ``The intention, I understood, was to reduce his level of
intellectuality and effectiveness by inducing brain damage,'' van
Rensburg said.
	   In earlier testimony before the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, scientists described working in a poison factory that
churned out chocolates, drinks and cigarettes spiked with lethal
chemicals that were passed to government hit squads.
	   Scientists also developed large supplies of lethal
micro-organisms such as anthrax and cholera that could have been
used to cause epidemics.
	   Mandela's ruling African National Congress compared the former
apartheid government with Adolf Hitler's Third Reich, which used
scientists to devise ways of exterminating millions of Jews,
Gypsies and others.
	   ``What is clear is that leading scientists (were) engaged in
these inhuman experiments in the same way as those who served the
Nazi regime in Germany,'' the ANC said in a statement late
Wednesday. ``If ever there was a program that truly typified the
genocidal programmes of the apartheid regime, this was it.''
	   Van Rensburg said the aim was not to kill Mandela, but to
disable him. The plot was considered in the final years of
Mandela's imprisonment and at least for a short time afterward,
according to the scientist.
	   There was no suggestion that the plan was ever carried out.
After his release from prison in 1990, Mandela led the ANC to
victory in the nation's first all-race elections in 1994 and became
president.
	   The white-run government started preparing Mandela for his
release as early as 1989, and began talks with him on ending
apartheid shortly after his release.
	   But the apartheid government apparently did not want him to be a
viable political opponent. A 1986 report from the State Security
Council, which coordinated the crackdown on anti-apartheid
activists, suggested Mandela could be released only when he was in
such a poor state of health that he could not continue to lead the
ANC.
	   Van Rensburg said he had never seen the document.
	   The Truth Commission is investigating the former apartheid
army's chemical and biological weapons projects, headed by Wouter
Basson, who ran the scheme through an elaborate network of front
companies.
	   Jaap Celliers, a lawyer representing Basson and other top
scientists in the program, denied the 1986 document indicated a
plot to actively poison Mandela. He said the minutes could have
just meant that Mandela should be kept in jail long enough to
damage his health.
	   ``It was the longer detention, not active conduct,'' he said.
	   Basson, who has been called to testify later this week, was
forced to resign from the army in 1993 after a government report
fingered him in making poisons and chemical bombs. He is currently
being investigated on charges of making and possessing ecstasy and
mandrax drugs.

Officials say fighting has not affected production, exports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA (AP) _ The production and price of coffee,
Ethiopia's principal export, have remained stable despite fighting
along the country's disputed northern border with Eritrea, coffee
officials said Wednesday.
	   They said most of the country's coffee production, which rose to
118,000 tons in 1997 and represents 56 percent of Ethiopia's gross
domestic product, comes from the south and southwestern regions,
far from the conflicts in northern Tigray region.
	   ``There is very minimal production from Tigray,'' said Tsegaye
Berahane, general manager of Ethiopia's Coffee and Tea Authority.
``There has been no impact, no consequences'' from the fighting.
	   Since the first border incident May 6, landlocked Ethiopia has
gradually moved all its exports from Eritrea's Red Sea ports of
Massawa and Assab south the Djibouti on the Gulf of Aden.
	   No figures were available on the cost of moving the coffee
through another port, but Tsegaye said exports had not been
disrupted.
	   In 1995, the last year for which figures are available, Ethiopia
exported coffee worth dlrs 269 million.
	   Tsegaye said the port of Djibouti offered better parking and
storage facilities than Assab.
	   ``The only problem is that coffee must now be exported in
containers, and there are not enough trucks to carry the containers
to Djibouti,'' said Aschenaki Gebrehiwot, general secretary of the
Coffee Exporters Association.
	   Coffee prices remained relatively constant in the daily central
market auction in Addis Ababa from last Thursday, ranging on an
average between 4,500 and 6,000 Ethiopian birr (dlrs 642 to 857)
per ton of washed coffee and between 2,400 and 2,900 birr (dlrs 343
to 414) per ton for sun-dried coffee, according to the government
Coffee Trading Control Office.
	   Supply fluctuated from 47 tons of washed coffee and 378 tons of
sun-dried coffee on Thursday to 80 tons of washed and 556 tons of
sun-dried coffee on Friday to 35 tons of washed and 221 tons of
sun-dried on Tuesday.
	   Aschenaki said the fluctuations were in keeping with the normal,
erratic day-to-day supplies and did not reflect any decline in
production or delivery.
	   It is estimated that the total 1997/98 coffee production will be
as much as 20 percent lower than the 1996/97 harvest of 420,000
tons, due mainly to heavy rains and high winds that damaged ripe
beans awaiting harvest and that the export target of 128,000 tons
will not be met.

Servants: Gucci ex-wife asked for help killing him
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The ex-wife of fashion heir Maurizio Gucci
asked a servant to arrange his death, and when Gucci was fatally
shot, admitted her responsibility, the servant testified Wednesday.
	   ```So ma'am, you did it,' I told her, and she answered, `Yes,
but it's left us in a mess, '' '' Luciano Punta said at the murder
trial of Patrizia Reggiani Martinelli, according to the ANSA news
agency.
	   Punta said he was recounting a phone conversation he had with
Reggiani Martinelli some months after Gucci's killing in 1995.
	   Gucci's ex-wife is on trial for arranging the murder. Four other
people, including the alleged hit-man, also are defendants.
	   Punta, who worked at Gucci's villa in St. Moritz, acknowledged
on cross-examination that he did not like Reggiani Martinelli.
	   ``She used people and threw them away after using them,'' ANSA
quoted him as saying. When pressed by defense attorneys about why
he didn't go to police when the woman first asked him to help find
a killer, he said, ``I knew they would have reached us sooner or
later.''
	   Before he took the stand, Punta's wife, Alda Rizzi, testified
that Reggiani Martinelli told her several times that she wanted her
husband dead. She resented his relationship with another woman,
said Rizzi, who was housekeeper at the villa.
	   `` `I want to see him dead if it's the last thing I do,' '' she
quoted Gucci's ex-wife as saying.
	   The prosecution says Reggiani Martinelli was obsessed with
Gucci's estate, and enraged about an alimony cut, so she allegedly
paid her co-defendants dlrs 300,000 to arrange and carry out his
killing.
	   In morning testimony, a businessman who said he had a love
affair with Reggiani Martinelli testified she never could have
arranged Gucci's killing.
	   Renato Verona said he had a ``sentimental affair'' with Reggiani
Martinelli in 1994, after the couple divorced, ANSA said.
	   Also coming to her defense was a dentist, Andrea Stramezzi, who
said he was a close friend.
	   The two men said Reggiani Martinelli was afraid Gucci would
dissipate the family wealth to the harm of the couple's two
children, ANSA reported.

	   THE judge presiding over the retrial of the Sangchai Sunthornvut
murder case Tuesday postponed the trial for two weeks and ordered
the public prosecutor to turn over all evidence to the defendant's
lawyer as earlier requested.
	   The order was given in compliance with a request by Kriang
Wisitsora-at, who had complained that the information provided by
119 witnesses questioned by police did not constitute new evidence,
thus the retrial was unlawful.
	   Kriang, who represents Ubol Boonyachalothorn, also said his
request was based on constitutional Article 241, which contradicted
the reasoning of the public prosecutor, Amphol Hemakhom, who said a
lawful request must ask for only suspects' information -- not that
of all witnesses.
	   Before ordering that the evidence be turned over to the
defendant's lawyer, Judge Khaimuk Phasanayongphinyo spend almost
two hours going through the information given by the 119 witnesses
and asked Kriang to check on whether any of the new witnesses to be
presented by the prosecutors were the same as the original 119.
	   On Monday, Kriang claimed that the evidence he had requested
could prove that the former director of the Mass Communications
Organisation of Thailand had conflicts with two of the agency's
executive board members before he was shot dead in April 1996.
	   The lawyer named a retired Army general and a businessman as the
board members and claimed that Sangchai's conflicts with the men
were the actual cause behind his killing -- not anything done by
Ubol, who has been accused of masterminding the murder.

	   PRIME Minister Chuan Leekpai Tuesday banned Cabinet members from
talking to reporters about the Cabinet meeting for one week, a
government house source said Tuesday.
	   Chuan reportedly sounded out the Cabinet members at a meeting
called Tuesday to discuss the privatisation of the state
enterprises and THAI, the budget bill for fiscal 1999 and the
budget allocation for fiscal 1998.
	   After the ministers returned from their luncheon, Chuan
surprised them with the media ban.
	   ''Lately, the state's confidential information and security
issues discussed at Cabinet meetings have always appeared in
newspapers. To help smoothen the government's administration, I
would like to ask friends, ministers, spokesmen and those attend
the meeting to refrain from telling reporters what was said at the
meeting for one week,'' Chuan reportedly said.
	   Chuan's reason for the ban was believed to stem from the
coalition's wrangling over budget allocation. The Social Action
Party was upset two weeks ago after the budget for the ministries
it oversees were cut by more than Bt500 million.
	   The SAP retaliated by proposing that the plan to construct the
airport at Chanthaburi be suspended reasoning that the project was
not essential. Democrat leaders, including Chuan and Suthep
Thaugsuban, strongly defended the project, vowing to go ahead with
the plan.
	   The party, however, bowed to public and media pressure last week
and postponed the construction on grounds that the money should be
saved for other more necessary projects.
	   Meanwhile, Chuan played down the National Statistics Office's
report that the total number of unemployed has reached 2,800,000.
	   Chuan said according to Interior, Labour Ministry and the
National Economic Social Development Board, only about two million
people were unemployed; which break down to 1.3 million in the
agriculture sector which are seasonal employees, 200,000 laid-off
workers and 500,000 new graduates who enter the workforce but
cannot find jobs.

	   THE 12 rebel Prachakorn Thai MPs Tuesday ruled out joining the
Democrat Party after their expulsion from the Prachakorn Thai,
saying they would form a new party of their own to be called
Rassadorn.
	   The group also proposed that the Democrats go ahead with plans
to bring in the Chat Pattana to bolster the coalition's stability
and remove the 12 Prachakorn Thai MPs from the coalition.
	   However, Democrat Party secretary-general Sanan Kachornprasart
said Tuesday that the situation had not yet warranted bringing in
the Chat Pattana and the coalition had not yet discussed the issue.
	   Speaking after meeting Sanan at Parliament, Nonthaburi MP
Chalong Riewraeng, one of the 12 rebel Prachakorn Thai MPs, said he
informed Sanan about the group's decision not to join the
Democrats.
	   The Prachakorn Thai is set to expel the 12 MPs, dubbed cobras by
party chief Samak Sundaravej, from the party once the Election
Commission approves the appointment of new members to the party's
executive board.
	   The 12 MPs will not lose their parliamentary status if the
Constitutional Court rules that the expulsion is not justified.
	   Earlier, Sanan said the 12 MPs could join the Democrats after
the Prachakorn Thai expelled them. But several other Democrat
executives were reported to be reluctant to accept the 12 MPs.
	   ''We decided not to join the Democrats because several Democrat
executives don't seem to welcome us. We don't want rifts to occur
within the Democrats because of us,'' Chalong said.
	   He said the 12 MPs would revive the name of Rassadorn Party,
which has been defunct.
	   ''It won't be difficult for us to recruit 5,000 members to
register a new party. We could do it in one day,'' Chalong added.
	   Chalong said he also informed Sanan about the group's decision
to allow the Democrats to bring in the Chat Pattana right away
without having to wait for the group's expulsion.
	   ''For the sake of the country, the Democrats should do it right
away,'' Chalong said.
	   The Chat Pattana has already offered itself as an option for the
Democrats to bolster their coalition's stability.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Pichet Phanvichartkul said Tuesday that
no one in the Democrat Party would mind accepting the 12 Prachakorn
Thai MPs to the Democrat's fold.
	   ''We have worked together for over six months now and we are now
very close,'' Pichet said.
	   Asked to confirm whether the Democrats would bring in the Chat
Pattana, Sanan said Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai had not made any
move over the matter yet.
	   ''Although it could happen, we have to first discuss the issue
with the coalition partners. So far, no discussion has taken
place,'' Sanan said.
	   ''Please note in your report that I am answering a question and
do not want to reshuffle the Cabinet, or else the prime minister
will kick me,'' Sanan quickly added.
	   Also Tuesday, Deputy Interior Minister Vatana Assavahame, one of
the 12 rebel MPs, said his group would file a suit with the Civil
Court Wednesday against the appointment of the new Prachakorn Thai
executives.
	   Vatana said the new appointment was not legal because his group
had earlier filed a suit against an earlier appointment of 11
executives, who took part in the board's decision to appoint the
new executives. Vatana said the court has not yet ruled on the
earlier suit yet.

	   UNDER new regulations likely to be accepted and put into effect,
monks seeking promotion will have to focus more on developing local
communities, education and environmental surroundings, rather than
merely building monastic installations.
	   Deputy Education Minister Arkom Engchuan, who initiated the new
idea, said Tuesday he would push for a proposal to make amendments
to the existing regulations at a meeting between the Sangha Supreme
Council and the Religious Affairs Department's meeting next Monday.
	   He said the new regulations will encourage greater transparency
and eliminate loopholes, as well as prevent possible corruption, in
ecclesiastical promotion of senior Buddhist monks.
	   Arkom, who oversees the department, explained that current
requirements which impart huge importance to construction work,
distracts monks from performing their basic duties like providing
sermons or propagating Buddhism.
	   Examples of other activities which may be carried out in place
of the construction of monastic installations cited by Arkom
included the building of schools, development work on temple
personnel and providing assistance to help solve social problems in
nearby communities.
	   ''These will result in a greater magnitude of monks'
participation in the society,'' he said.

	   THE Justice Ministry has suggested that a ''special
investigation office'' be established to probe cases that
compromise the economy and national security.
	   The ministry is drafting a bill to establish a ''new Justice
Ministry'' which would give it 12 law-enforcing agencies, including
the Office of the Attorney General, which is now an independent
agency.
	   A subcommittee responsible for drafting guidelines for a new
structure and the authorities of the reformed ministry met Tuesday.
The meeting was chaired by Kramol Thongthammachat and also involved
representatives from related agencies.
	   At the meeting, the ministry proposed the formation of a special
investigation office under it which would oversee cases which
required cooperation between several agencies, sources said.
	   Such cases include crimes that could severely affect the
economy, national security and those committed by government
officials.
	   The ministry claimed such an office would provide greater
justice for the public and reduce damage resulting from the crimes.
It would also enhance the effectiveness of measures taken against
government officials who abuse their authority, the sources said.
	   However, the move was opposed to by the Police Department, which
said the new office would duplicate the duties of the police.

Russian markets hit by Asia and concerns about lack of aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian stocks took a double beating Wednesday,
dropping because of market falls in Asia and fears that Western
governments won't bail Moscow out of its financial mess, traders
said.
	   The Russia Trading System closed 6.2 percent lower Tuesday.
Volume was light, but traders said Russian financial institutions
were selling aggressively.
	   Stocks fell from the beginning of trading, bounced back slightly
in early afternoon, and then continued lower until the close.
	   The Russian economy is stagnating, with little or no growth in
most areas. The government has promised deep cuts in public
spending and improved tax collection to try to improve the
situation.
	   There were also concerns that the drop in the market could
revive pressure on the ruble. The government has ruled out
devaluation, but the Russian Central Bank has limited resources
with which to defend the currency.
	   The Group of Seven industrialized nations were to discuss
Russia's financial problems at a meeting Wednesday in Paris, but
people close to the talks said that a full-fledged aid package was
unlikely.
	   The Russian stock market has already fallen more than 50 percent
since the beginning of the year. Few big investors are ready to
risk any more money in Russia until emerging markets settle down
around the world, dealers said.

Servants: Gucci ex-wife asked for help killing him
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES that witness refused request, minor editing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The ex-wife of fashion heir Maurizio Gucci
asked a servant to arrange his death, and when Gucci was fatally
shot, admitted her responsibility, the servant testified Wednesday.
	   ```So ma'am, you did it,' I told her, and she answered, `Yes,
but it's left us in a mess, ''' Luciano Punta said at the murder
trial of Patrizia Reggiani Martinelli, according to the ANSA news
agency.
	   Punta said he was recounting a phone conversation he had with
Reggiani Martinelli some months after Gucci's killing in 1995.
Punta testified he had refused her request in the past.
	   Gucci's ex-wife is on trial for arranging the murder. Four other
people, including the alleged hit-man, also are defendants.
	   Punta, who worked at Gucci's villa in St. Moritz, Switzerland,
acknowledged on cross-examination that he did not like Reggiani
Martinelli.
	   ``She used people and threw them away after using them,'' ANSA
quoted him as saying. When pressed by defense attorneys about why
he didn't go to police when the woman first asked him to help find
a killer, he said, ``I knew they would have reached us sooner or
later.''
	   Before he took the stand, Punta's wife, Alda Rizzi, testified
that Reggiani Martinelli told her several times that she wanted her
husband dead. She resented his relationship with another woman,
said Rizzi, who was housekeeper at the villa.
	   ```I want to see him dead if it's the last thing I do,''' she
quoted Gucci's ex-wife as saying.
	   The prosecution says Reggiani Martinelli was obsessed with
Gucci's estate, and enraged about an alimony cut, so she allegedly
paid her co-defendants dlrs 300,000 to arrange and carry out his
killing.
	   In morning testimony, a businessman who said he had a love
affair with Reggiani Martinelli testified she never could have
arranged Gucci's killing.
	   Renato Verona said he had a ``sentimental affair'' with Reggiani
Martinelli in 1994, after the couple divorced, ANSA said.
	   Also coming to her defense was a dentist, Andrea Stramezzi, who
said he was a close friend.
	   The two men said Reggiani Martinelli was afraid Gucci would
dissipate the family wealth to the harm of the couple's two
children, ANSA reported.

	   SOCIAL Action leader Montree Pongpanit Tuesday denied news
reports he planned to quit politics, saying he would run in the
next general election and keep the SAP as a political party, senior
party members said.
	   Montree's denial came at an SAP meeting he chaired, said the
sources.
	   Many dailies reported Tuesday the SAP was disintegrating because
Montree was washing his hands of politics. Many SAP MPs were
reported to be pondering a move to the Democrat Party.
	   Montree Tuesday held a meeting with SAP ministers who were told
the leader ''will absolutely not quit politics nor dissolve the
SAP, and will certainly run in the next election'', according to
Theerawat Siriwannasarn, deputy public health minister.
	   He said the participants at the meeting believed ''a third
party'' was trying to destroy the SAP by creating rumours about
Montree wishing to leave the political arena.
	   Montree will call a press conference Wednesday to deny the
rumours, he said.
	   Meanwhile, the Democrat Party's Communications Minister Suthep
Thaugsuban admitted he recently had a private meeting with Public
Health Minister Rakkiat Sukthana but denied they discussed
Rakkiat's intention to move to the Democrat Party.
	   Rakkiat told reporters senior SAP members wanted to keep the
party ''as long as possible. If I have to choose a new party, I
will choose the Democrat Party,'' he said.

Annan hopes for sustained dialogue on East Timor issue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed an
Indonesian move to free 15 East Timorese political prisoners and
said Wednesday he hoped this would develop into a ``sustained
dialogue'' on the future of the former Portuguese territory.
	   Annan was commenting on an announcement in Jakarta that
President B.J. Habibie had signed a decree to release 15 East
Timorese political prisoners ``as soon as possible.''
	   The list does not include jailed rebel chief Xanana Gusmao, a
symbol of the 23-year independence struggle. Indonesia regards
Gusmao as a criminal who committed violent acts in his fight
against Indonesian rule. He is currently serving a 20-year prison
term in Jakarta's Cipinang Prison.
	   ``The secretary-general welcomes the news that President Habibie
has signed a decree for the release of 15 East Timorese prisoners
and hopes that this will lead to the freedom of all other East
Timorese political prisoners,'' the United Nations said in a
statement.
	   ``He is also encouraged by the beginning of what he hopes will
be a sustained dialogue towards the resolution of the question of
East Timor ... based on a just, comprehensive and internationally
acceptable formula,'' the statement added.
	   In the East Timorese capital Dili, more than 3,000 East Timorese
protested Wednesday against Indonesian control of their homeland.
The demonstrations were an emphatic rejection of a proposal by
Habibie to grant special status to East Timor.
	   Indonesia took over East Timor in 1975 after Portugal withdrew,
ending four centuries of colonial rule. Indonesia annexed the
territory in 1976 in a move the United Nations never recognized.
	   For years, the United Nations has been sponsoring periodic talks
between Indonesia and Portugal under various formulas and echelons
to try to break the impasse.
	   The most recent session _ a working level meeting chaired by
U.N. special representative Jamsheed Markur of Pakistan _ achieved
no breakthrough.
	   During the rule of former President Suharto, who annexed the
former colony, Indonesia stuck by its position that East Timor is
an integral part of its national territory.
	   Portugal has been urging a referendum so East Timorese can
decide the territory's status.
	   Following Suharto's resignation, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas said the change in the presidency has provided an
opportunity for Portugal, East Timorese separatists and Indonesia
to resolve the issue.

	   PROVINCIAL residents must pay more for water starting this month
and shoulder a rate hike of more than 100 per cent next January as
the Cabinet approved the Provincial Waterworks Authority's proposal
Tuesday.
	   Under the plan, the rates will be adjusted by 30 per cent on
average, from Bt8.17 per cubic metre to Bt11.22 per cubic metre.
	   The residents will be charged Bt0.5 more per cubic metre per
month until the rates, now at Bt3.75 per cubic metre, reaches
Bt7.75 per cubic metre in January of next year.
	   Government agencies, state enterprises, small factories and big
factories will not face a 100 per cent increase even though they
will be subject to the same hike. The government agencies and small
factories which use 27.8 per cent of the total tap water, are
currently charged a minimum of Bt5 per cubic metre. Large factories
which use 14.7 per cent of the total tap water are now charged a
minimum of Bt6 per cubic metre.
	   Of the residents which use 57.3 per cent of total tap water, 63
per cent use less than 20 cubic metres per month, amounting to 19.6
per cent of the total. Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said the reason
the PWA wishes to increase the rate is acceptable because it has
not increased rates for five years and has operated at a loss. The
agency also requires more money to expand its water production
investments in other areas. More than 18 million people are still
in need of the service.
	   Chuan said the rate hike is inevitable because the government
has no funds to support PWA's investment.
	   He said the PWA has also greatly improved its efficiency by
reducing the number of staff per water user from 17:1000 to 4:1000.
	   Chuan, however, ordered the PWA to reduce the amount of leakage
which has reached 30 per cent. ''This is a problem PWA must
seriously tackle,'' he said.

Graf wins first match of comeback

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Steffi Graf, playing her first match
in four months, rallied to beat Rennae Stubbs in three sets
Wednesday at the DFS Classic grass-court tournament.
	   The former world's No. 1 player recovered after losing the first
set and downed the Australian 5-7, 6-2, 6-4 in 1 hour, 51 minutes.
	   The two players, who are close friends, hugged at the net after
the match.
	   Graf, who received a first-round bye, advanced to a third-round
meeting against either Kristie Boogert or Miriam Oremans.
	   Graf, the winner of 21 Grand Slam singles titles, had played
only two tournaments since undergoing reconstructive surgery on her
left knee a year ago.
	   In February, she won a match at Hanover before losing a
quarterfinal clash with Sabine Applemans of Belgium 6-3, 7-6.
	   The next month, she won three matches at Indian Wells but had to
retire in the third set of the semifinals against Lindsay
Davenport.
	   Recent planned comebacks were postponed due to various injuries.
	   The start of Wednesday's match was held up by rain, which has
disrupted the first three days of the tournament.
	   Graf started the match with a brace on her left knee but she
removed it early in the first set.
	   Stubbs broke Graf twice in winning the first set. But the German
took control in the second, and her break of serve in the first
game of the third set held up the rest of the way.
	   Graf squandered two match points before closing out the match
with a trademark forehand winner.
	   Graf struggled with her serve, hitting 12 double faults to go
with her five aces.
	   Graf also plans to play next week at Eastbourne before starting
the challenge for her eighth Wimbledon singles title.

President proud of new Kazak capital, many Kazaks object to costs

	   ASTANA, Kazakstan (AP) _ The president beamed. The people danced
in the streets. But behind the daylong celebrations dedicating
Kazakstan's new capital were questions about its cost and doubts
about its future.
	   Astana, a city of 300,000 people in northern Kazakstan, became
the capital of this former Soviet republic in December. On
Wednesday, President Nursultan Nazarbayev threw its coming out
party.
	   ``The new country brings new challenges for us,'' Nazarbayev
told foreign guests. ``We have to build a new state and we need a
new starting ground to ensure our lofty flight.''
	   The party included a free concert, folk-dancing, games on
horseback and a street parade with floats decorated like circular
tents known as yurts. Guests include the presidents of several
other former Soviet republics, the Chinese communications minister
and foreign diplomats.
	   But in spite of the celebration and large turnout, few people in
Kazakstan are enthusiastic about the move.
	   ``This is complete stupidity,'' said Alexander Kubasov, a
65-year-old pensioner. ``I don't see how this improves our lives
one bit.''
	   Many Kazaks believe the cost of the move, which has never been
fully made public, is money that could have been spent on overdue
wages and pensions.
	   The government says Astana was selected as the new capital
because of its central location, and because Almaty is overcrowded,
polluted and prone to earthquakes.
	   Astana has room to expand, is further away from conflicts in
Tajikistan and Afghanistan, and is slated to be the center for the
economic development of northern Kazakstan.
	   However, the chronic shortage of gas and electricity, harsh
winter climate and vicious mosquitoes have made the idea of moving
from comfortable Almaty to Astana unpopular with foreign businesses
and diplomats.
	   ``We have no plans to move until we feel Astana is ready to
support an international operation,'' said Canadian Ambassador
Richard Mann. ``I think we still have some problems with the
infrastructure.''
	   The high cost of setting up new offices and moving personnel are
other factors.
	   ``We did not get money from Congress to build the embassy in
Berlin, so we are not getting the money from Congress to build an
embassy in Astana,'' said U.S. Ambassador Elizabeth Jones.
	   Despite a two-year refurbishment of Astana's Soviet-style
buildings, nothing has been done to remove or hide the thick silver
heating pipes that run above ground along the sidewalk, be it for
lack of money or lack of time.
	   Many houses in the center of Astana were only renovated on the
side that faces the main street where Nazarbayev and his ministers
frequently travel.
	   In an effort to improve the image of the new capital, it was
renamed last month from Akmola _ which means ``white grave'' in
Kazak _ to Astana, which just means capital.
	   Unofficially, the move to Astana is expected to unite the
Russian-dominated north with the south, which is mainly populated
by ethnic Kazaks, and to counter separatist tendencies in the
region that borders Russia.

Kinkel says hard drug use up 20 percent in Germany last year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Russian comment, remarks by drug spokesman,  &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Hard drug use in Germany rose 20 percent
last year and the damage ``must not be minimized,'' the German
foreign minister said Wednesday on the final day of the U.N.
special session on drugs.
	   Delegates from about 150 countries are expected to wrap up the
three-day conference Wednesday night by adopting a plan to curb
trafficking, money-laundering and narcotic cultivation by 2008.
	   A U.N. spokesman, Sandro Tucci, said one of the major
achievements of the conference was an acknowledgement that the
blame does not rest entirely with drug producing countries and that
consumers like the United States and Western Europe must do more to
reduce demand.
	   During his speech to the conference, German Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel said drug users were ``getting younger all the time''
and the ``the range of drugs supplied ever wider.''
	   ``In Germany we have unfortunately since 1995 seen a steady
increase in the number of users of hard drugs, a rise of 20 percent
last year alone,'' Kinkel said without giving figures.
	   Kinkel urged greater international cooperation to curb
trafficking and applauded a recent declaration by China and
Southeast Asian nations to increase their own regional efforts to
combat drugs.
	   Kinkel indicated that Germany would not follow the example of
neighboring Netherlands and relax laws against ``soft'' drugs.
	   ``Drugs and the harm they do must not be minimized,'' he said.
``They are no token of the modern lifestyle.''
	   Russia's deputy foreign minister, Yury Ushakov, also said his
country opposes ``any attempts to legalize the non-medicinal use of
drugs _ be it the so-called `soft' drugs or `hard' substances.''
	   Ushakov said Russia had seen a significant increase in drug
addiction since the collapse of the Soviet Union. In the early
1990s, he said, the number of Russian addicts was growing annually
about 10 to 15 percent.
	   Last year the figure soared by 60 percent, he added.

Leaking tunnel forces delay in opening rail connection to new
</HEADLINE>
airport &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A troublesome tunnel that is draining nearby
lakes forced Norway's state railroad on Wednesday to postpone the
start of high-speed rail service to a new national airport opening
north of Oslo in October.
	   The 12-kilometer (8 mile) long tunnel was billed as one of
Norway's most important environmental projects when work started
three years ago. Then water from lakes in popular recreation areas
began leaking into the tunnel, leaving what looks like giant mud
puddles in the forests above.
	   The NSB railroad announced that the tunnel would not be done in
time for the Oct. 8 opening of the Gardermoen Airport. It said an
emergency plan for transporting thousands of passengers a day the
45 kilometers (28 miles) from Oslo to the airport would put into
operation.
	   The plan includes extra buses, local trains and road
improvements.
	   Despite efforts to plug leaks that had drained up 4,000 liters
(1,000 gallons) a minute of lake water, the national water
management board said the tunnel was still leaking too fast.
	   The NSB railroad board on Wednesday announced that the tunnel
would not be opened until the problem was controlled. It was not
clear how long that would take.
	   ``I am very glad that the board of NSB has made protecting the
water balance and environment ... job No.1,'' said Minister of
Transport Odd Einar Dorum in a news release.
	   High-speed electric trains leaving the capital every 20 minutes
had been a key element in planning the new airport, which is to
replace the current Fornebu Airport near the heart of Oslo.
Officials fear that a delay beginning train service could lead to
major traffic jams.

Boyd's own goal gives Brazil 2-1 victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Scottish defender Tommy Boyd knocked
a rebound past his own goalkeeper in the 73rd minute and gave
defending champion Brazil a 2-1 victory to open the 16th World Cup
on Tuesday.
	   Cafu fought off Gordon Durie in the penalty area to beat him to
a long ball from Dunga and touched it into goalkeeper Jim Leighton
with the outside of his left foot.
	   Leighton was able to block the shot with his face, but the
rebound caromed off the chest of a backtracking Boyd and dropped
into the net.
	   The goal deflated the Scots hopes of a surprising draw, but
Brazil was clearly the dominant team throughout the game, creating
repeated chances while Scotland was forced to defend.
	   Scotland only managed to stay in the game due to John Collins'
penalty kick in the 38th minute.
	   Collins' penalty came after Cesar Sampaio, who gave Brazil the
lead on a near-post header in the fourth minute, was called for
running over the back of Kevin Gallacher as the Scot tried to get
to the headed cross from Christian Dailly.
	   Collins, who plays for AS Monaco and has a legion of fans in
France, drilled the penalty to the lower left corner and gave no
chance to Brazilian keeper Taffarel.
	   Sampaio was yellow-carded for his foul on Gallacher, wiping out
his effort that put Brazil in the lead.
	   Cesar Sampaio deflected a corner kick from Bebeto, beating not
only Leighton, but Craig Burley and Collins, who were marking the
Japanese-based midfielder.
	   The Scots chased from the opening minutes, taking nearly half a
minute to get the opening kickoff beyond the midfield stripe and
rarely looking threatening. It gained more of the possession as the
game wore on, but failed to maintain it for any extended period.
	   Twice the 39-year-old Leighton, the oldest player in the
tournament, was forced into dramatic saves in the first half. In
the 16th minute he had to parry a blast from Roberto Carlos on the
left side of the penalty area, and again in the 20th he knocked
away a close-range shot from Ronaldo, who twisted three defenders
around before getting off his attempt from near the goal box.
	   The new ban on the tackle-from-behind was tested twice in the
first half.
	   Darren Jackson took a swipe in the 17th minute at Junior Baiano
as the Brazilian went forward with the ball from midfield. Both
players stayed on their feet and Spanish referee Jose Garcia Aranda
only whistled Jackson for the foul.
	   He issued no card to Jackson, but did summon him over for a
verbal warning.
	   Brazilian defender Aldair was issued a card in the third minute
of injury time, bringing down Gallacher and apparently lucky not to
be ejected.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Lineups &QC; 
	   Brazil: Taffarel; Cafu, Aldair, Junior Baiano; Cesar Sampaio,
Giovanni (Leonardo, 46th minute), Dunga, Rivaldo, Roberto Carlos;
Ronaldo, Bebeto (Denilson, 70th).
	   Scotland: Jim Leighton; Colin Calderwood, Colin Hendry, Tommy
Boyd; Craig Burley, Christian Dailly (Tosh McKinlay, 84th), Paul
Lambert, John Collins; Kevin Gallacher, Gordon Durie, Darren
Jackson (Billy McKinlay, 78th).

Proposed talks to end coup attempt in Guinea-Bissau collapse

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Talks between renegade soldiers and a
parliamentary delegation collapsed Wednesday just before they were
due to begin, diminishing the chances of a peaceful end to the coup
attempt in the West African Nation of Guinea Bissau.
	   ``The (planned) negotiations fell apart because the president
said he couldn't vouch for the delegation's safety (in the rebel
held areas),'' opposition politician Helder Vaz said on Portuguese
state radio RDP-Africa.
	   The four-member delegation was hoping to mediate a peaceful
solution to the standoff between the rebels and government troops
surrounding them, but President Joao Bernardo Viera said he did not
agree with the talks proposal because he could not guarantee the
deputies' well-being.
	   Vaz said the soldiers who launched the coup attempt on Sunday
feared a major offensive against their positions after learning
that foreign troops were disembarking at Bissau port.
	   He accused the international community of standing by while the
government prepared a ``bloodbath''.
	   An unknown number of rebels, led by former armed forces chief
Brig. Gen. Ansumane Mane, are holed up at a military complex, in
the suburb of Bra, 15 kilometers (10 miles) outside the capital.
	   Miguel Amado, the European Union representative in Bissau, said
in a telephone interview that the planned talks had not been
rescheduled. ``We are trying to convince the government not to
attack the rebels,'' Amado told the Lisbon bureau of the Associated
Press.
	   A ceasefire was in place in preparation for the talks, according
to Amado, but he was not sure whether it would hold.
	   The armed forces installed the headquarters of their anti-coup
operation in the neighborhood of Missara within the Bra suburb, the
Portuguese news agency Lusa reported later Wednesday.
	   Troops from neighboring Senegal and the Republic of Guinea, that
arrived in the country on Tuesday to support the government forces,
had taken up positions with heavy artillery near the capital's main
cemetery, Lusa said.
	   The spokesman for the United Nations Secretary-general Kofi
Annan said in New York ``The secretary-general welcomes the
announcement of a cease-fire and calls for the early restoration of
normal and constitutional political dialogue within the country.''
	   Fred Eckhard also said Annan ``strongly deplores this military
confrontation.''
	   A spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Bissau said the capital was
quiet Tuesday night.
	   ``There was some sporadic mortar fire overnight, but it was a
whole lot quieter than it has been,'' Bryan Hunt said in a
telephone interview. ``It's a stalemate situation.''
	   Mane, describing himself as head of the self-proclaimed Military
Junta for the Consolidation of Democracy, Peace and Justice, said
in a statement Tuesday that he had no intention of seizing power
himself. The statement called on the President and the government
to step down.
	   Foreign Minister Fernando Delfim da Silva rejected the call for
an early ballot, saying legislative elections were scheduled for
this year and a presidential election was due in 1999.

Complicating deal, Amal says it will not return Israeli remains
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ZEINA KARAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A Lebanese guerrilla group declared
Wednesday that it would not return the remains of an Israeli
soldier killed in southern Lebanon, a move that could stop a
reported deal with Israel to release Lebanese prisoners.
	   The declaration is the latest snag in attempts by the
International Committee for the Red Cross to trade Lebanese
prisoners held by Israel for the remains of as many as two Israeli
soldiers killed in September in southern Lebanon.
	   Officials of Hezbollah, the main Shiite Muslim group fighting
Israel in the south, have been saying for more than a week that an
exchange was imminent, with only ``final touches'' remaining.
	   On Wednesday, Sheik Nabil Kaouk, commander of Hezbollah
guerrillas in the south, said a deal has been reached to swap the
remains of the Israeli soldiers in return for ``more than a
hundred'' Lebanese prisoners and dead guerrillas held by Israel.
	   ``There are still a few details regarding the names of the
prisoners,'' Kaouk said.
	   But Amal, another Shiite Muslim group that is Hezbollah's bitter
rival, said it would not take part in the swap _ which it
apparently fears would bolster Hezbollah's popularity.
	   ``We will not return the remains of the Israeli soldier as long
as we are not in on negotiations regarding the exchange with
Israel,'' an Amal spokesman said Wednesday.
	   Hezbollah declined to comment on the statement.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah says it holds most of the remains
from at least two Israeli soldiers left behind after the botched
commando raid Sept. 5. Twelve Israeli soldiers were killed in the
clash near the coastal village of Insariyeh.
	   But Amal, which also took part in the clash, is believed to have
the scalp of a soldier. Israel says the guerrillas hold the remains
of only one soldier, Itamar Ilya.
	   Hezbollah and, to a lesser extent, Amal are fighting to drive
Israeli troops from a strip of land they occupy in the south.
	   But the two groups have been locked in a power struggle for
control over the 1.2 million Shiites, Lebanon's largest sect. The
rivalry climaxed in a showdown in municipal elections in
predominantly Shiite southern Lebanon on Sunday.

Boyd's own goal gives Brazil 2-1 victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS day of week in lead. &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Scottish defender Tommy Boyd knocked
a rebound past his own goalkeeper in the 73rd minute and gave
defending champion Brazil a 2-1 victory to open the 16th World Cup
on Wednesday.
	   Cafu fought off Gordon Durie in the penalty area to beat him to
a long ball from Dunga and touched it into goalkeeper Jim Leighton
with the outside of his left foot.
	   Leighton was able to block the shot with his face, but the
rebound caromed off the chest of a backtracking Boyd and dropped
into the net.
	   The goal deflated the Scots hopes of a surprising draw, but
Brazil was clearly the dominant team throughout the game, creating
repeated chances while Scotland was forced to defend.
	   Scotland only managed to stay in the game due to John Collins'
penalty kick in the 38th minute.
	   Collins' penalty came after Cesar Sampaio, who gave Brazil the
lead on a near-post header in the fourth minute, was called for
running over the back of Kevin Gallacher as the Scot tried to get
to the headed cross from Christian Dailly.
	   Collins, who plays for AS Monaco and has a legion of fans in
France, drilled the penalty to the lower left corner and gave no
chance to Brazilian keeper Taffarel.
	   Sampaio was yellow-carded for his foul on Gallacher, wiping out
his effort that put Brazil in the lead.
	   Cesar Sampaio deflected a corner kick from Bebeto, beating not
only Leighton, but Craig Burley and Collins, who were marking the
Japanese-based midfielder.
	   The Scots chased from the opening minutes, taking nearly half a
minute to get the opening kickoff beyond the midfield stripe and
rarely looking threatening. It gained more of the possession as the
game wore on, but failed to maintain it for any extended period.
	   Twice the 39-year-old Leighton, the oldest player in the
tournament, was forced into dramatic saves in the first half. In
the 16th minute he had to parry a blast from Roberto Carlos on the
left side of the penalty area, and again in the 20th he knocked
away a close-range shot from Ronaldo, who twisted three defenders
around before getting off his attempt from near the goal box.
	   The new ban on the tackle-from-behind was tested twice in the
first half.
	   Darren Jackson took a swipe in the 17th minute at Junior Baiano
as the Brazilian went forward with the ball from midfield. Both
players stayed on their feet and Spanish referee Jose Garcia Aranda
only whistled Jackson for the foul.
	   He issued no card to Jackson, but did summon him over for a
verbal warning.
	   Brazilian defender Aldair was issued a card in the third minute
of injury time, bringing down Gallacher and apparently lucky not to
be ejected.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Lineups &QC; 
	   Brazil: Taffarel; Cafu, Aldair, Junior Baiano; Cesar Sampaio,
Giovanni (Leonardo, 46th minute), Dunga, Rivaldo, Roberto Carlos;

	   PARIS (AP) _ On a day when the Air France strike ended, the
first hooligan was arrested and bugs walked on stilts, it should
have been expected that a bizarre goal would decide the first game
of the 16th World Cup.
	   Scottish defender Tommy Boyd knocked the ball into his own goal
with his chest after a save by goalkeeper Jim Leighton in the 73rd
minute to give defending champion Brazil a 2-1 victory Wednesday
before 80,000 people at the new Stade de France.
	   The goal ended a surprising threat from Scotland, for whom even
a draw would have been a stunning upset in the Group A match.
	   Early on, it appeared Brazil would produce the expected rout.
Cesar Sampaio scored on a header off a corner kick just four
minutes into the game, but Sampaio's foul on Kevin Gallacher led to
John Collins' penalty equalizer in the 38th minute.
	   Until Collins' goal, the Scots were kept in the game by the
39-year-old Leighton, the oldest player in the tournament, who made
superb saves against Roberto Carlos and Ronaldo.
	   Later Wednesday, Norway played Morocco in Montpellier in another
Group A match. Group B action begins Thursday when Cameroon faces
Austria in Toulouse and Italy plays Chile in Bordeaux.
	   The Brazil-Scotland game was preceded by a colorful ceremony
featuring 600 acrobats and volunteers _ including stiltwalkers
dressed as striped insects and trumpeting bungee jumpers _ all
acting out the planting of a ``magic garden'' on the field.
	   Away from the field, police identified a known soccer hooligan
from Scotland as one of 15 people still in custody late Wednesday
as a result of overnight clashes between drunken fans and police.
	   The confrontations followed Tuesday's pre-tournament parade
through the streets of Paris.
	   Thirty-four police were injured in the violence, with one in
critical condition after being hit in the head with a beer bottle.
	   Several hours later, after the sun had risen, there was good
news on another front when Air France and its pilots resolved a
10-day strike that had severely embarrassed the country in the days
leading up to the World Cup.
	   The company called for an immediate return to work. But the
airline has said it could take three days for service to return to
normal once the strike ended.
	   The kickoff of the Brazil-Scotland game not only marked the
start of competition, but it was also the deadline for teams to
petition FIFA to replace injured or sick players on their rosters.
	   Italy replaced striker Fabrizio Ravanelli, suffering from an
infection in his right lung, with Parma forward Enrico Chiesa.
Nigeria called up Mobi Oparaku to fill the spot vacated by defender
Jero Shakpoke, who was diagnosed with a broken left collarbone
suffered in the 5-1 loss to the Netherlands last week.

Nearly 150,000 Afghan refugees in Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Nearly 150,000 Afghans live in Russia illegally,
one-third of them in Moscow and the surrounding region, the
Interfax news agency said Wednesday.
	   Most of the Afghans are linked in some way to the pro-Moscow
government of former President Najibullah and who fled when that
government collapsed in 1992, Interfax said, quoting a U.N.
official.
	   ``They have nowhere to stay,'' said Viktor Andreyev, acting
regional representative for the U.N. High Commission for refugees.
``They cannot work, study or receive medical care, even though
Russia is to blame for what happened to them.''
	   Gulam Muhamed, president of the Afghan Business Center in
Moscow, said the refugees cannot go home.
	   ``People linked to the Najibullah government or Soviet troops
are killed without a trial in Afghanistan,'' he said.

	   ZALA AMBASSA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Frightened Ethiopians on Wednesday
loaded their belongings in donkey carts and fled their village now
occupied by Eritrean forces. A handful remained, saying the
invaders have been kind.
	   While booming mortars have fallen silent in this nearly empty
border village 105 kilometers (65 miles) southeast of the Eritrean
capital Asmara, fighting broke out to the west at another post
which both sides claim as their territory.
	   Troops fought with artillery and guns on the Badme-Shiraro front
at Erde Mattios, both governments confirmed. No details or casualty
reports were provided.
	   The two Horn of African nations, which earlier less than a
decade ago were part of the same country, are battling over several
stretches of border land. Tensions were fanned late last year when
Eritrea suddenly declared its own currency.
	   The Eritrean government has welcomed a plan approved by
diplomats at an Organization of African Unity summit Wednesday to
send a six-president delegation to mediate the dispute that
threatens to explode into a full-scale war.
	   Zala Ambessa, 2 kilometers (just over a mile) inside Ethiopia,
is not among the disputed areas. But it became a battleground last
week largely because a road linking the port of Massawa to
Ethiopia's Tigray Region passes through the border post. And many
Eritreans blame the Tigrayans for the border conflict.
	   The road that winds through craggy mountains was empty of the
trucks that usually thunder south to the Tigray capital Mekele. In
their place, buses and trucks caked with mud for camouflage ferried
troops and munitions to the front.
	   They drove past Zala Ambessa's short stretch of pastel-painted
shops and houses pockmarked by bullets and gouged by artillery
shells.
	   The lingering civilians among an original population of 15,000
covered their mouths and noses with scarves as they walked past the
stinking, contorted corpses of Ethiopian soldiers killed last week
but left unburied.
	   Eritrean troops rested a day after a fierce battle in which they
pushed at least 10 kilometers (6 miles) into Ethiopia. Some burned
fragrant eucalyptus wood to make steamy cups of sweet tea. One
slept in the shade of a broken down Ethiopian tank being repaired
by Eritreans.
	   Lema, a member of the Eritrean Defense Forces, said the
occupying army's relationship with the Ethiopians remaining in Zala
Ambessa was cordial.
	   ``They are living in peace with us. They are living their
lives,'' he said. Lema, who gave just one name, wore a gauze
bandage around his wounded ankle and a green beret.
	   Just down the paved road, Tsega Teame said now that she's
survived a week of fighting by hiding in her stone-walled house,
she's going to stay.
	   ``The Eritrean soldiers didn't hurt us, so why should I be
afraid,'' the 22-year-old said as she picked small stones from
freshly harvested wheat.
	   Medhin Berhe, stooped and shriveled at 68, said she had no
choice but to stay in the hovel she calls home. ``Where can I go?
Those who can afford it have gone to Mekele. But those of us who
are left, we are poor.''
	   Letebrhan Gebraslasie, 60, and her husband Redae Gebre, 66,
carried their meager belongings _ a small table, and washing basin
and clothes _ on their heads on the long walk to a remote village
where they hope they'll be safer.
	   ``Had it been peaceful, we would be sowing seeds now. If this
war continues, we'll have famine,'' Redae said, recalling hardships
in the border area during Eritrea's 30-year war for independence
from Ethiopia, which ended in 1991.

Renewed fighting Eritrea-Ethiopia conflict; U.S. facilitators to

 &UR; Eds: ADDS OAU saying it will send a peace mission, reaction from
Eritrea. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Fighting broke out Wednesday
between Eritrean and Ethiopian troops in or near a contested border
area in northwestern Ethiopia, and both sides once again accused
the other of striking first.
	   The conflict has sparked an array of mediation attempts, so many
that they risk futher complicating the situation in volatile Horn
of Africa.
	   On Wednesday, the Organization of African Unity said a
delegation of African leaders would visit Ethiopia and Eritrea on a
peace mission. Eritrea meanwhile proposed that Egypt join the
United States and Rwanda in attempts at mediation.
	   ``Eritrean forces attacked our biggest post on the Badme-Shiraro
front at Erde Mattios, and fighting is continuing,'' Ethiopian
government spokeswoman Salome Tadesse said.
	   She said Erde Mattios lies south of the Tekeze River, outside
the so-called Yirga triangle, a 400-square-kilometer
(160-square-mile) contested slice of northwestern Tigray province.
	   The Eritrean News Agency, however, said Ethiopian forces
attacked Eritrean troops ``in the Badme area inside Eritrean
territory.''
	   Meanwhile, a U.S. team trying to facilitate a peaceful
settlement to the hostilities was expected back in Addis Ababa
later Wednesday, diplomatic sources said. It would be the third
time U.S. facilitators had travelled to the Ethiopian capital since
the simmering border dispute erupted into fighting on May 6.
	   The United States and Rwanda have put forth a four-point
proposal to stop the fighting and start talks. Ethiopia accepted,
but Eritrea demurred, claiming the plan, which suggests that
Eritrea withdraw to positions it held before May 6, needed more
work.
	   ``The proposal as it exists is still on the table and is still
valid,'' said a Western diplomat, on condition of not being further
identified. He added, however, that the plan could be ``worked on
around the edges.''
	   Regional military sources say that under the plan, Rwanda would
supply the peacekeeping forces to enforce demilitarization of
disputed border regions.
	   The 53-nation OAU said its delegation will try to persuade both
parties to agree to a cease-fire and peace talks. Eritrean Foreign
Minister Haile Woldetensae welcomed the proposal and said his
country was willing to immediately withdraw from disputed
territory. There was no immdiate comment fom his Ethiopian
counterpart.
	   In Cairo Wednesday, Eritrean officials said they wanted Egypt to
mediate the conflict as well.
	   ``Both Eritrea and Ethiopia have good relations with Egypt,''
which should facilitate Egyptian mediation between the two
neighbors, Abdullah Mahmoud Jaber, an adviser to Eritrean President
Isaias Afwerki, told reporters after meeting with President Hosni
Mubarak.
	   But Egypt and Ethiopia do not always see eye-to-eye on issues in
the Horn of Africa. Egypt has been backing one set of faction
leaders in an attempt to secure peace and set up a national
administration in war-ravaged Somalia; Ethiopia backs their rivals.
	   Asked why the Eritreans would be pushing into territory they
hadn't previously claimed belonged to them according to the Italian
colonial boundary drawn up in the 19th century, the Ethiopian
spokeswoman replied:
	   ``It is a difficult question to answer from here. They are
insane.''
	   Italy colonized Eritrea in 1885 but was defeated in its attempt
to conquer Ethiopia as well. Britain assumed control of Eritrea in
1941, and the territory later came under a U.N. mandate until 1962,
when it was absorbed into Ethiopia.
	   Rebels under Isaias' command fought Ethiopia for 30 years to
gain independence. They succeeded in 1993, after helping Ethiopian
rebels under now Prime Minister Meles Zenawi oust a 17-year
military dictatorship in 1991.
	   Ethiopia has not offered any figures on its own military
casualties but says Eritrea has suffered heavy losses at Erde
Mattios, some 600 kilometers (372 miles) north of Addis Ababa and
Zala Ambessa, 600 kilometers (372 miles) to the northeast.
	   The Western diplomat expressed concern that both Ethiopia and
Eritrea had pulled troops off their borders with Sudan to bolster
other fronts, thus weakening their western defenses. Both countries
support Sudanese rebel organizations fighting the National Islamic
Front government in Sudan.

Nigerian opposition angrily dismisses new leader's promises

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Angrily dismissing vague promises of a
transition to civilian rule, Nigeria's opposition movement
Wednesday lashed out at the country's new ruler and called for
Nigerians not to recognize his government.
	   ``Nigerians must intensify their struggle to end military
rule,'' said Gani Fawehinmi, a Lagos attorney and one of the
country's best-known opposition activists. ``Nigerians should
expect nothing but a continuation of economic persecution and
political oppression.''
	   The denunciations followed a televised speech Tuesday by Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar, who took the helm of Africa's most populous
nation after the death Monday of Gen. Sani Abacha, a close ally who
had run Nigeria as a dictatorship for five years. Abubakar promised
to proceed with a transition to civilian rule that Abacha began,
though he gave no details on how it would happen.
	   To the contrary, he appeared to be consolidating his own power
base.
	   Two members of his inner circle were placed under house arrest
in the capital, Abuja, two independent sources confirmed Wednesday,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   ``The empty maiden address of Gen. Abubakar has confirmed that
there is no hope for Nigeria in Abacha's successor,'' said
Fawehinmi, speaking at a press conference on behalf of the umbrella
opposition group, the Joint Action Committee for Nigeria.
	   He said the group would go ahead with demonstrations in Lagos
planned for Friday, the fifth anniversary of annulled presidential
elections that were apparently going to be won by Moshood Abiola, a
billionaire businessman now in prison.
	   The group called on people to observe a nationwide 24-hour
strike, staying away from their jobs and keeping off the roads. It
also urged them not to recognize Abubakar's government.
	   However, it was not clear just how many people would follow the
calls for a strike. Similar calls for demonstrations have sometimes
resulted in only a few hundred people turning out.
	   Their derision of Abubakar's statements echoed the views of many
in Nigeria's opposition.
	   ``I don't see it getting better for now,'' said Clement Nwankwo,
head of the Constitutional Rights Project. He did add, though, that
pressure on Nigeria's opposition groups, which has been increasing
in recent months, may ease for a while.
	   ``They're not going to make any arrests this week because it
would send out too many signals of where they are headed,'' he
said.
	   Abubakar's vow to continue with a transition to civilian rule
has raised many opposition eyebrows.
	   Abacha had blatantly manipulated the system to ensure he would
be the only candidate in Aug. 1 presidential elections. The
transition was to be completed by Oct. 1.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called Abubakar to
congratulate him and encourage him ``to proceed with a peaceful and
democratic transition to civilian rule,'' Annan spokesman Fred
Eckhard said Wednesday.
	   The problem, many government opponents say, is that little
appears to have changed around the fortified compound in Nigerian
capital where Abacha spent most of his time in recent years,
surrounded by a small circle of advisers.
	   Those advisers selected Abubakar a few hours after Abacha's
death to, the opposition contends, try to keep the country on the
same course. But whether his selection will sit well with others in
the inner circle who also may have wanted the job is still far from
clear.
	   ``I don't know how long this is going to hold,'' said one
political analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``I don't
know if he's been accepted by everyone.''
	   Abacha, who himself came to power in a 1993 coup, apparently
feared losing his authority. It was widely believed that he holed
up not only because of his health problems, but also because he
feared a coup by his fellow soldiers.
	   The compound was selected with defense in mind. Abacha's loyal
secret police are based just across the street and it is two hours
from the nearest major military garrison.
	   The secret police plagued Nigeria's opposition during Abacha's
years in power, tapping their phones, following them and always
leaving them fearing arrest.
	   Abacha also left Nigeria with a legacy of corruption that
crushed a thriving economy _ and left it nearly ruined.
	   Little in Nigeria functions these days, from the water supply to
the telephones. The only people who manage to live easily are those
who can afford to buy generators, truck in their own water and hire
security guards to fend off the rampant crime.
	   Even gasoline is nearly impossible to find in Nigeria, the
world's sixth largest oil producing country, since most of the
nation's refineries don't work and gasoline must be imported.

Crackdown on poachers would have caught more but lacked fuel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A crackdown on poachers in Russia's Pacific waters
would have been more effective if patrol ships and planes had had
more fuel, the ITAR-Tass news agency said Wednesday.
	   The eight-week crackdown by border guards and fish inspectors
resulted in 50 foreign ships being searched, said Maj.-Gen. Vasily
Neishchenko, acting commander of the North Eastern Border Guard
District.
	   Crews of seven foreign ships and nine Russian ships were charged
with violating fishing regulations, he said.
	   Russian border guards shot and killed two suspected Chinese
poachers after they allegedly resisted arrest and attacked the
Russians.
	   ITAR-Tass said an estimated 30.5 million rubles (dlrs 6 million)
was lost because of poaching. Only 6,000 rubles (dlrs 1,000) and
dlrs 15,000 U.S. were collected in fines.

Proposed talks to end coup attempt in Guinea-Bissau collapse

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Talks between renegade soldiers and a
parliamentary delegation collapsed Wednesday just before they were
due to begin, diminishing the chances of a peaceful end to the coup
attempt in the West African Nation of Guinea Bissau.
	   ``The (planned) negotiations fell apart because the president
said he couldn't vouch for the delegation's safety (in the rebel
held areas),'' opposition politician Helder Vaz said on Portuguese
state radio RDP-Africa.
	   The four-member delegation was hoping to mediate a peaceful
solution to the standoff between the rebels and government troops
surrounding them, but President Joao Bernardo Viera said he did not
agree with the talks proposal because he could not guarantee the
deputies' well-being.
	   Vaz said the soldiers who launched the coup attempt on Sunday
feared a major offensive against their positions after learning
that foreign troops had disembarked at Bissau port to support the
government.
	   He accused the international community of standing by while the
government prepared a ``bloodbath''.
	   An unknown number of rebels, led by former armed forces chief
Brig. Gen. Ansumane Mane, are holed up at a military complex, in
the suburb of Bra, 6 kilometers (4 miles) outside the capital.
	   Miguel Amado, the European Union representative in Bissau, said
in a telephone interview that the planned talks had not been
rescheduled. ``We are trying to convince the government not to
attack the rebels,'' Amado told the Lisbon bureau of the Associated
Press.
	   A ceasefire was in place in preparation for the talks, according
to Amado, but he was not sure whether it would hold.
	   The armed forces installed the headquarters of their anti-coup
operation in the neighborhood of Missira near the Bra suburb, and a
ban on the movement of unauthorized vehicles through the capital
was also in place, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported later
Wednesday.
	   Troops from neighboring Senegal and the Republic of Guinea, that
arrived in the country on Tuesday to support the government forces,
had taken up positions near Bra, Lusa said.
	   The spokesman for the United Nations Secretary-general Kofi
Annan said in New York ``The secretary-general welcomes the
announcement of a cease-fire and calls for the early restoration of
normal and constitutional political dialogue within the country.''
	   Fred Eckhard also said Annan ``strongly deplores this military
confrontation.''
	   A spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Bissau said the capital was
quiet Tuesday night.
	   ``There was some sporadic mortar fire overnight, but it was a
whole lot quieter than it has been,'' Bryan Hunt said in a
telephone interview. ``It's a stalemate situation.''
	   Mane, describing himself as head of the self-proclaimed Military
Junta for the Consolidation of Democracy, Peace and Justice, said
in a statement Tuesday that he had no intention of seizing power
himself. The statement called on the President and the government
to step down.
	   Foreign Minister Fernando Delfim da Silva rejected the call for
an early ballot, saying legislative elections were scheduled for
this year and a presidential election was due in 1999.
	   Speaking from Lisbon Wednesday where he remained stranded
because of the coup attempt, Delfim da Silva said ``Everything
depends on the general...If the Brigadier puts down his weapons he
can obviously avoid a military confrontation.''

Korda beaten, Krajicek advances at Gerry Weber Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HALLE, Germany (AP) _ Top-seeded Petr Korda was beaten in
straight sets Wednesday at the Gerry Weber Open, while No.3 Richard
Krajicek sailed into the quarterfinals behind his big serve.
	   Paul Haarhuis of the Netherlands upset the Czech world No. 3,
7-6 (7-4), 6-4 at the dlrs 875,000 grass tuneup for Wimbledon,
while Krajicek downed German Davis Cup player Tommy Haas, 3-6, 6-4,
6-1.
	   Haas, a 20-year-old German Davis Cup player, twice failed to
break Krajicek's early in the second set, then was worn down by the
Dutch player's powerful serves and greater experience on grass.
	   Krajicek, a 1996 Wimbledon winner who blasted 987 aces last
year, closed out the match in just one hour, 27 minutes.
	   The field has five top 10 players, with French Open champion
Carlos Moya of Spain and defending champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov of
Russia scheduled to play Thursday.

Police: Report indicating left-wing involvement in arms thefts was

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela's
office on Wednesday dismissed a police report that former black
liberation guerrillas were stealing weapons from military bases,
saying it was outrageous and shouldn't be taken seriouly.
	   National police Commissioner George Fivaz acknowledged the
report was outdated and contained ``preliminary investigative
assumptions.''
	   ``This report _ as can be expected during running police
investigations _ was overtaken by unforeseen developments,'' Fivaz
said.
	   Those developments apparently included the arrests in recent
days of three men with alleged right-wing connections in connection
with the thefts of 117 weapons _ including mortars and rocket
launchers _ and 200,000 rounds of ammunition.
	   SABC radio said an initial police intelligence report named a
group behind the thefts as MKAPLA _ an acronym connecting the
ruling African National Congress' former armed wing to the Azanian
People's Liberation Army, another former anti-apartheid military
group.
	   Mandela spokesman Parks Mankahlana said the report was not
presented up the chain of command because ``the government
discourages ... questionable reports.''
	   Mankahlana dismissed the report as ``outrageous,'' adding: ``No
one wants to waste time discussing these things.''
	   Fivaz said the police had no intention of misleading the
government about the arms thefts.
	   Earlier this year, South Africa's military chief Georg Meiring
resigned amid a controversy stirred up by a report about a coup
plot that the government says never existed. Meiring had given the
report to Mandela. A panel of judges said the report was unfounded
and never taken seriously by military personnel.
	   Last week, a group calling itself the Boere Weerstandsbewging,
or Boer's Resistance Movement, claimed the thefts of military
weapons and ammunition were carried out by Boers, the white
descendants of Dutch settlers.

World Cup: South Koreans benefit from homegrown cuisine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: DELETES chef from graf 8, CORRECTS grammar in graf 9 &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo WCP101 &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ South Korea's recipe for success at the 1998 World
Cup starts in the kitchen, and a chef from the homeland is
overseeing the ingredients.
	   The cook is Chung Seung-chan, flown in by their hotel to serve
up the same dishes players are accustomed to eating back home.
	   ``The players say they're happy to have Korean cooking 1,000
miles from home,'' said Park Sun-hu, who translates between Chung
and the hotel's French chef in the kitchens.
	   ``The French must have their baguette (bread) and fromage
(cheese) every day. For Koreans it's essential to eat rice and
kimchi'' _ a spicy vegetable salad.
	   It is precisely those French cheeses that got the South Koreans
into trouble when they came to France last April for matches
against the Paris club St. Denis and France's first division club
Metz.
	   Suffering from a variety of digestive problems, the South
Koreans lost to 2-1 to Metz before scraping by St. Denis 2-1.
	   ``They had a lot of problems with the food,'' recalls team
vice-manager Chun Hanjin. ``Many had diarrhea, which weakened
them.''
	   ``The problem was all the milk products,'' Chun explained.
``They are too rich here and difficult for the players to digest.
In Korea we only consume two percent and skim milk products.''
	   It is often said the way to a man's heart is through his
stomach, and the South Koreans will need all the heart they can get
in their bid to win their first match in five World Cup
appearances.
	   Doing his share, Chung prepares a selection of two or three
Korean dishes each day, including the traditional staple kimchi.
Chung also makes bulgogi, a marinated beef and vegetable dish, and
fried chicken. And plenty of rice.
	   While millions of people come to France each year to sample some
of the world's most famous Michelin restaurants, the country's
haute cuisine has failed to impress the South Korean squad. The
players do, however, appreciate Italian food.
	   ``The hotel chef's spaghetti bolognese is very popular among the
players, for some reason,'' said Park, who like Chung works for a
hotel chain (Accor) back home.
	   Despite the honor and excitement of cooking for the national
team, life in the French hotel's kitchens isn't exactly a piece of
cake.
	   Communication is difficult and Chung does most of the cooking
himself for the 23 players and the rest of the South Korean
delegation. He does, however, receive help from the hotel's second
chef, Richard Donio.
	   ``Many things are different in a French kitchen,'' said Park.
``And there are many communication problems. But Monsieur Donio is
a great help even if he understands nothing about Korean cooking.''
	   Chung and Park will follow the team to Lyon and Marseille for
its first-round matches against Mexico and the Netherlands.
	   ``I'm very excited about cooking for the World Cup team,'' said
Chung, speaking through Park. ``I get to meet famous players and
it's my first time in France.''

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Talks between renegade soldiers and a
parliamentary delegation collapsed just before they were due to
begin Wednesday, diminishing the chances of a solution to the coup
attempt in the West African Nation of Guinea Bissau.
	   ``The (planned) negotiations fell apart because the president
said he couldn't vouch for the delegation's safety (in the rebel
held areas),'' opposition politician Helder Vaz said on Portuguese
state radio RDP-Africa.
	   The four-member delegation had hoped to mediate a peaceful
solution to the standoff between the government and the unknown
number of rebels led by former armed forces chief Brig. Gen.
Ansumane Mane.
	   The rebels were holed up at a military complex in the suburb of
Bra, six kilometers (four miles) outside the capital.
	   Mane, describing himself as head of the self-proclaimed Military
Junta for the Consolidation of Democracy, Peace and Justice, issued
a statement Tuesday calling on President Joao Bernardo Viera to
step down and urged that early elections be held in July to choose
a new government. Mane has said he has no intention of seizing
power for himself.
	   Viera said, however, that he did not agree with the talks
proposal because he could not guarantee the deputies' well-being.
	   Vaz said the soldiers who launched the coup attempt on Sunday
feared a major offensive after learning that foreign troops were
disembarking at Bissau port. Troops from neighboring Senegal and
the Republic of Guinea arrived Tuesday to support the government
forces.
	   The armed forces installed the headquarters of their anti-coup
operation in the neighborhood of Missira within the Bra suburb, and
a ban on the movement of unauthorized vehicles through the capital
was in place, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported late
Wednesday.
	   The troops from Senegal and the Republic of Guinea took up
positions with heavy artillery near the capital's main cemetery,
Lusa said.
	   Vaz accused the international community of standing by while the
government prepared a ``bloodbath''.
	   Miguel Amado, the European Union representative in Bissau, said
in a telephone interview that the talks had not been rescheduled.
	   ``We are trying to convince the government not to attack the
rebels,'' he said.
	   A cease-fire had been in place in preparation for the talks,
according to Amado, but he was unsure whether it would hold.
	   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Wednesday
that he strongly opposed the use of force for ``non-constitutional
purposes,'' according to a spokesman, Fred Eckhard.
	   ``He strongly deplores this military confrontation, which has
already resulted in the loss of many lives,'' Eckhard said. ``The
secretary-general welcomes the announcement of a cease-fire and
calls for the early restoration of normal and constitutional
political dialogue within the country.''
	   Annan also asked ``all sides to ensure the safety of United
Nations staff working in Guinea-Bissau and to refrain from all
actions which may endanger the lives of the civilian population,''
Eckhard said.
	   Foreign Minister Fernando Delfim da Silva rejected Mane's call
for an early ballot, saying legislative elections were scheduled
for this year and a presidential election was due in 1999.
	   Speaking Wednesday from Lisbon, where he remained stranded
because of the coup attempt, Delfim da Silva said ``Everything
depends on the general ... If the Brigadier puts down his weapons
he can obviously avoid a military confrontation.''

Sanctions ineffective, Contact Group prepares options
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Ignoring economic sanctions, the Serbian army has
carried out ethnic cleansing by bombing homes in Kosovo to crush a
rebellion in the restive province, a senior U.S. official said
Wednesday.
	   The growing conflict threatens regional stability, and
Washington feels ``all options are open'' to pressure Serbian-led
Yugoslavia, the official said after meeting of the Contact Group of
nations concerned with the Balkans.
	   In addition to possible military options NATO defense ministers
are to discuss in Brussels on Thursday, Washington was urging the
U.N. war crimes tribunal in the Hague, the Netherlands, to
investigate the ethnic cleansing, the official said.
	   So far, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ``has not been
responsive to sanctions'' warranting other international measures,
the official said. On the other hand, the Albanian Kosovo
delegation, he said, ``has acted in good faith.''
	   The conflict in Kosovo, where the ethnic Albanian majority seeks
independence, has killed 250-300 people and created as many as
100,000 refugees, the official said. Among them are up to 85,000
displaced people in Kosovo, 10,000 in Albania and thousands of
others who have fled to other countries.
	   Witnesses said Serbian MiG-21 jets have bombed homes, and U.S.
officials have seen heavy artillery damage to homes.
	   The Serbian ethnic cleansing efforts were aimed to create a
cordon sanitaire at the Albanian border to head off arms shipments
to Kosovo Albanians, he said.
	   The bombing and shelling meant ``a landmark has been achieved
because armed conflict exists.'' As a result, Washington was urging
that the war crimes tribunal consider sending investigators, he
said.
	   A G-8 meeting of Western and Russian officials in London on
Friday is to issue a joint statement, which the Contact Group of
political advisers was working on in their Paris meeting Wednesday,
the official said on condition of anonymity.
	   The official said that during the meeting, there was ``a
complete sense of unanimity on where the Contact Group was
heading,'' the official said. He declined to elaborate but said not
to expect any new economic sanctions.
	   The U.S. official declined to say if Russia backed military
action. He said he welcomed Russian efforts to help bring both
sides in the conflict to the table.

	   THE legal advisory team of the interior minister Tuesday agreed
with a proposal to cancel cash reward for informers leading to
arrests and fines of traffic violators.
	   Thawil Praisont, head of the team, said the fines should be
equally shared between police and the state, instead of giving a
part to informers.
	   Under the current practice, the informer and police each receive
35 per cent of the fine while the remaining 30 per cent is sent to
the government coffers.
	   Earlier, it was alleged that police were corrupt in handing out
the informers' share because only a select few people had collected
the share for informers for almost all traffic fines collected in
Bangkok.
	   Thawil said the advisory team asked the Police Department to
find out how to systematically use or share the 50 per cent of the
fines among the policemen themselves.
	   The Police Department will have to seek approval for the
measures and the Finance Ministry will be kept informed on the
issue, Thawil said.
	   Meanwhile, a highway police sergeant in Phetchaburi complained
to Central Investigation Bureau Commissioner Pol Lt Gen Seri
Temiyavej that he had been harassed by his superiors and fellow
policemen after he exposed how highway police had been receiving
bribes.
	   Earlier, Sgt Chit Thongchit sent a letter to Seri, detailing
system in which truck operators sent bribes to highway and local
police.
	   Chit said he had been harassed in several ways, including being
ordered to do guard duty for more than 10 hours a day.

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with WFP statement, quotes &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Armed assailants have opened fire at a
United Nations relief convoy in Sudan, killing three aid workers
and wounding four others.
	   The World Food Program said gunmen opened fire Tuesday morning,
killing field officer El Haj Ali Hammad and Sumain Samson Ohiri, a
driver.
	   Maggboul Mamoun, a staffer for the Sudan Red Crescent, was also
killed and three other Sudan Red Crescent workers and an escort
were injured, the Rome-based agency said.
	   All victims were Sudanese, sources in Sudan told The Associated
Press.
	   ``WFP condemns these brutal murders and we are seeking an
investigation into the tragic killings,'' the agency's executive
director, Catherine Bertini, said in Rome.
	   A government soldier was among those injured, the official
Sudanese News Agency reported.
	   A Sudanese government minister, Gen. Hassan Dahawi, accused the
rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army of carrying out the attack on
the three-car convoy in Southern Kordofan province, about 500
kilometers (310 miles) southwest of the capital Khartoum.
	   ``We call upon all U.N. organizations and the voluntary
organizations to continue their humanitarian mission without paying
attention to such ugly provocations that target humanity and
peace,'' Dahawi was quoted as saying by SUNA.
	   SPLA rebels have been fighting since 1983 for autonomy and
development in the predominantly Christian, African and animist
south, which has traditionally been dominated by the Muslim and
Arabized north.
	   An estimated 1.5 million people have died in the fighting and
related famines. The WFP runs a major program in the south to bring
food to refugees and starving people.

Insurance officials discuss Holocaust victim policies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Insurance officials from several countries,
including Switzerland the United States, met Wednesday in London to
discuss the problem of dormant insurance policies that belonged to
Holocaust victims.
	   The meeting was intended primarily as an ``exchange of
information,'' said Peter Streit, deputy director of the Swiss
Federal Office for Private Insurance.
	   He declined to give any further details of the closed-door
meeting, which was also attended by officials from France and
Austria, or to say what the next steps might be.
	   Heirs of Holocaust victims have filed a federal class-action
lawsuit in the United States seeking dlrs 1 billion from each of 16
European insurance companies. The heirs allege the companies
refused to honor the victims' insurance policies. The state of
California has filed to join the suit.
	   The insurance claims were filed after the heirs of Holocaust
victims lodged multibillion-dollar class-action suits in the United
States against Swiss banks. Swiss commercial banks, Jewish
organizations and lawyers for class-action claimants are currently
involved in negotiations on a global settlement of these claims.

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ On a day when the Air France strike ended, the
first hooligan was arrested and bugs walked on stilts, it should
have been expected that a bizarre goal would decide the first game
of the 16th World Cup.
	   Scottish defender Tommy Boyd knocked the ball into his own goal
with his chest after a save by goalkeeper Jim Leighton in the 73rd
minute to give defending champion Brazil a 2-1 victory Wednesday
before 80,000 people at the new Stade de France.
	   The goal ended a surprising threat from Scotland, for whom even
a draw would have been a stunning upset in the Group A match.
	   Early on, it appeared Brazil would produce the expected rout.
Cesar Sampaio scored on a header off a corner kick just four
minutes into the game, but Sampaio's foul on Kevin Gallacher led to
John Collins' penalty equalizer in the 38th minute.
	   Until Collins' goal, the Scots were kept in the game by the
39-year-old Leighton, the oldest player in the tournament, who made
superb saves against Roberto Carlos and Ronaldo.
	   Later Wednesday, Norway played Morocco in Montpellier in another
Group A match. Group B action begins Thursday when Cameroon faces
Austria in Toulouse and Italy plays Chile in Bordeaux.
	   The Brazil-Scotland game was preceded by a colorful ceremony
featuring 600 acrobats and volunteers _ including stiltwalkers
dressed as striped insects and trumpeting bungee jumpers _ all
acting out the planting of a ``magic garden'' on the field.
	   Away from the field, police identified a known soccer hooligan
from Scotland as one of 15 people still in custody late Wednesday
as a result of overnight clashes between drunken fans and police.
	   The confrontations followed Tuesday's pre-tournament parade
through the streets of Paris.
	   Thirty-four police were injured in the violence, with one in
critical condition after being hit in the head with a beer bottle.
	   There were other World Cup-related arrests in Bologna, Italy.
Italian police detained 23 people suspected of belonging to a
militant Algerian Islamic group accused of plotting terror attacks
during the tournament.
	   The new roundup brings to nearly 100 the number of people who
have been arrested on such suspicions over the past several weeks.
Arrests also have occurred in France, Germany, Belgium and
Switzerland.
	   There was also good news Wednesday morning. Air France and its
pilots resolved a 10-day strike that had severely embarrassed the
country in the days leading up to the World Cup.
	   The company called for an immediate return to work. But the
airline has said it could take three days for service to return to
normal once the strike ended.
	   The kickoff of the Brazil-Scotland game not only marked the
start of competition, but it was also the deadline for teams to
petition FIFA to replace injured or sick players on their rosters.
	   Italy replaced striker Fabrizio Ravanelli, suffering from an
infection in his right lung, with Parma forward Enrico Chiesa.
Nigeria called up Mobi Oparaku to fill the spot vacated by defender
Jero Shakpoke, who was diagnosed with a broken left collarbone
suffered in the 5-1 loss to the Netherlands last week.

	   ARE you fit enough to watch World Cup matches for several
consecutive weeks starting from Wednesday? If not, health
authorities have some advice for you.
	   Eat more food, drink more water and exercise regularly, and that
will help make watching the event more enjoyable.
	   They are not kidding because watching the World Cup, which
begins Wednesday and ends on July 12, needs not only good planning
and a proper understanding -- it also needs a fit body.
	   Football fans who follow the tips will not only be able to enjoy
the matches more, but they will also not ruin their health, nor
have their work affected or risk a fatal accident because of lack
of sleep, the experts said.
	   Dr Somchai Lithongin, an official at the Public Health
Department, said regular exercise at least three times a week for
20 minutes is enough to help keep the body fit.
	   To prevent viewers from getting too exhausted, it is suggested
that they skip some matches and watch only the ones they are really
interested in.
	   ''People need six to eight hours sleep. But if they cannot make
that long sleep in one go, they should take frequent naps during
the day such as at noon and in the evening before the matches start
and go long into the night. Lack of sleep will lead to catching a
cold,'' he said.
	   The most suitable posture for watching the games is sitting with
the legs hanging down. Wrong posture could lead to body aches and
ruined eyesight.
	   ''Lying down is not good for you because it will hurt your back
and your neck because your head will be elevated,'' Somchai said.
	   More food and water are needed to compensate for the loss of
sleep, but it is not necessary to buy vitamins or supplements.
''Just a sweet or food to fill the stomach will prevent you from
being too tired,'' he said.
	   Sakchai Sakkulwong, director-general of the Welfare and Labour
Protection Department, said the department has issued warnings to
workers who watch the matches to exercise caution when controling
machinery.
	   ''Watching too much football at night could reduce their
efficiency and lead to accidents when using machines,'' he said.
	   The department will keep a record of accidents at work during
the Word Cup to map out preventive measures for the next World Cup
in four years time.
	   Meanwhile, many people who pawned their television sets to pay
school fees and other bills have descended on the pawn shops in
droves to get them back for the World Cup. There has also been a
sharp drop in the number of people turning up with television sets
to pawn, according to one shop in Min Buri.
	   Suriporn Dowudom, a manager at Min Buri Pawn Shop said since the
beginning of the month about 10 people a day had turned up to
reclaim their television sets. Conversely, only two people a day
were pawning their sets compared to an average of 10.

	   SUDA Pratyapat, mother of murder victim Jenjira Ploy-angunsri,
Tuesday told the presiding judge that defendant Serm Sakhonrat
confessed to killing her daughter because he could not stand losing
his sweetheart to another man.
	   At the sensational trial where the confessed killer retracted
his statement about the grisly killing of the fifth-year medical
student, Suda took the witness stand to shed some light on the
defendant, a computer science graduate and second-year medical
student.
	   After the Jan 26 disappearance of Jenjira and persistent
inquiries by her family, Serm finally requested a meeting three
days later with the mother in his Chon Buri home town, the witness
said.
	   During the meeting, she recounted, the defendant expressed
regret for failing to escort Jenjira home. He also confided he had
a sexual relationship with the victim and could not bear the
break-up of their love affair.
	   Two days before her death, Jenjira informed her mother she had
broken up with Serm and had started dating another boy.
	   The witness added that although she suspected Serm was not
speaking the whole truth, she thought he was only holding Jenjira
against her will somewhere in order to reason with her.
	   The family posted a public missing person announcement the month
after Serm and his mother refused to reveal the whereabouts of
Jenjira.
	   Following his arrest and confession of how he killed her and
covered up the evidence, Serm admitted to Suda that he had killed
his sweetheart because he had been in a rage due to his broken
heart. He also informed her that the sliced-up body parts
discovered in his apartment toilet were Jenjira's remains, saying
there was no reason to lie because ''the game was over''.
	   The Criminal Court has set a June 23 date for the trial to
continue.

Air force jets kill 20 civilians, guerrillas say

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Sri Lankan air force jets bombed targets
in rebel-held territory Wednesday, killing 20 civilians and
wounding about 50, the rebels claimed Wednesday.
	   In a statement faxed to news agencies in India, the rebels said
the jets, supported by artillery, set fire to buildings in the town
of Suthanthirapuram, 250 kilometers (155 miles) northeast of
Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital.
	   Sri Lankan military officials could not be reached for comment
from New Delhi. Sri Lankan journalists were under military
censorship regulations imposed last week. The rebels frequently
accuse the Sri Lankan military of targeting civilians.
	   While there was no way to verfiy the statement, they are
believed to exaggerate casualties.
	   The statement, released from the London office of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, claimed most of the town was destroyed and
survivors were evacuating the area.

World Cup: Italy asks FIFA to replace sick striker
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with Maldini quotes, player returning to
Italy, Chiesa getting credentials &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ With striker Fabrizio Ravanelli suffering
from an infection in his right lung, Italy on Wednesday obtained
from FIFA a last-minute authorization to replace him on the team
roster with Parma forward Enrico Chiesa.
	   Team officials said Chiesa, 27, got the credentials to become
Italy's 22nd player as the team arrived in Bordeaux to play its
first World Cup match against Chile.
	   The documentation for Ravanelli's substitution was filed by
Italian officials shortly before the expiration of the deadline for
replacing sick or injured players _ the start of the
Brazil-Scotland inaugural World Cup match.
	   Ravanelli, a 29-year-old striker of Olympique Marseille, had
developed a sudden illness after Monday's training. Suffering from
cough and fever he underwent X-ray examinations on Tuesday and was
dropped from the team the next day.
	   ``The fever had reached as high as 40 degrees,'' (104 degrees
Fahrenheit) team doctor Andrea Ferretti said Wednesday.
	   Ferretti added that Ravanelli was responding well to antibiotics
treatment, but will require a rest period of at least a week to
avoid the danger of developing full-blown pneumonia.
	   ``It was a terrible decision to take,'' coach Cesare Maldini
said. ``The medical report left me no other choice. But it cost me
a lot to tell Fabrizio to return home. He understood my decision.''
	   Ravanelli was expected to fly home from Paris Thursday.
	   Chiesa was already in the Italian camp on standby.
	   He had been put on alert as a substitute for forward Alessandro
Del Piero, who has just recovered from a right thigh strain, and
then for Moreno Torricelli, who bruised his foot last week but
resumed practicing Tuesday.
	   Chiesa got a berth on the Italian roster on his third chance.

	   A GROUP of about 60 Cambodians working at a Phnom Penh-based
Thai garment company in Phnom Penh Tuesday surrounded the Thai
Embassy there demanding better welfare from the company, the
Foreign Ministry announced Tuesday.
	   The Cambodians started gathering at about 9.30 am and handed
over a demand that the embassy be a broker in negotiating with the
company's owners.
	   A first secretary accepted a 10-point letter from the group.
	   However, they refused the official's request to disperse, saying
they would continue the demonstration until they got satisfactory
results from the company.
	   Later in the day, Chalermchart Thasukhon, a counsellor, met
owners of the company to seek a compromise between the two sides.
	   The ministry said the gathering had been peaceful and that
Cambodian police were deployed to guard the area.
	   The workers demanded that the company provide better medical
care for its workers, stop forcing them to work on weekends and
appoint representatives to coordinate with the workers.
	   The workers also demanded that the company stop paying them with
fake banknotes.

	   VETERAN politician Narong Wongwan confirmed Tuesday he has been
approached to become the chief adviser of the new political party
that communications tycoon Thaksin Shinawatra plans to set up.
	   ''They have made the offer to me but no details have been
discussed yet,'' he said in a telephone interview from his home in
Chiang Rai province.
	   Narong, one of Thailand's senior politicians from the generation
that spawned veterans like Banharn Silapa-archa, Pramarn Adireksarn
and Bhichai Rattakul, was elected several times as the
representative of Phrae province and long commanded staunch voter
support for MPs in his fold in the northern constituencies before
he washed his hands of politics in 1995.
	   During the heyday of his political career, he was the leader of
Ruam Thai Party and later the Samakkhitham Party, which supported
non-elected Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon in the premiership before the
popular uprising that forced the general out in May 1992. Narong
missed the opportunity to be nominated as prime minister after the
election in March 1992 when the US government rejected his visa
application, citing information about his questionable business
background.
	   One thing Narong and Thaksin have in common is that they are
both northerners. Narong said Tuesday he might be able to help
Thaksin's party win at least 35 of 70 parliamentary seats in the
north if he decides to join it as chief adviser.
	   ''I can support them by assuming an advisory role if they will
really need me,'' he said.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In the West Bank town of Hebron, a middle aged
man carried a TV across the city's dusty streets to the Al Quds
Cafe Wednesday so Palestinian patrons, some in Arab robes, could
enjoy the opening game of the World Cup soccer tournament.
	   In the executive dining room of Israel's parliament, the
Knesset, TVs were ordered to remain switched on to the World Cup
all month long so lawmakers could pop-in for updates in between
sessions.
	   All across Israel and the Palestinian territories Wednesday,
streets were deserted, sunflower seeds _ a favorite Israeli
accompaniment to sporting events _ were hard to come by and pizza
parlors hired extra delivery staff.
	   In Ramallah, West Bank, Palestinian men and women broke with
religious tradition and sat together at the Kanbata cafe drinking
beer and munching pretzels in front of a large screen TV. The cafe
strung soccer balls and French and Brazilian flags from the
ceiling.
	   In Jerusalem, Scottish soccer fans shared drinks with Israeli
soldiers at the Underground English Pub where a pint of beer sold
for the special World Cup price of five shekels (dlrs 1.75).
	   ``Everybody will make time to come watch this, it's a universal
unifier,'' said Banan Hazir, a 28 year-old Palestinian student of
international relations. ``If you look all around the world, the
rich, the poor, the education and uneducated are all watching and
here the occupier and the occupied are watching,'' Hazir said
during half-time in the Brazil-Scotland opener.
	   Anwa Mikhel, who owns a magazine stand in downtown Jerusalem had
a television set up at the stand and said sunflower seed sales had
shot up 50 percent during the day.
	   ``I'm crazy about soccer, this game means a lot to me. Even if
there was a wedding or I had to be with my girlfriend, I would
choose to be here,''he said.
	   At the Al Quds cafe in Hebron, Mohammed Netzeb smoked from the
traditional Arab water pipe and watched the World Cup on the cafe's
new TV. ``I plan to leave work for any important matches,'' he said
adding that he hopes Arab teams do well in the tournament.
	   The month-long World Cup, which opened Wednesday, is to be
played in 10 French cities.

	   BANK of Ayudhya (BAY) is expected to finalise its Bt15-billion
recapitalisation plan Wednesday after which it will make an offer
of new shares to foreign investors, including Brunei's investment
agency.
	   BAY is planning to increase its registered capital from Bt5
billion to Bt20 billion by issuing 1.5 billion new shares at Bt10
par.
	   A senior executive source at BAY said top management of the bank
went to persuade the oil-rich Asean member country to invest in the
bank last weekend. ''There was a conclusion during the talk, but no
details can be disclosed [at this stage],'' he said.
	   BAY will finalise the distribution of 500 million new shares
before deciding to make an offer to the Sultan of Brunei, one of
the world's richest men. If the 500 million shares are not fully
subscribed, the bank plans to offer the remainder to foreign
investors.
	   BAY will also sell 600 million shares, about 30 per cent of the
total 20 billion shares, in private placement to foreign
shareholders and offer another 500 million shares in a rights issue
to local shareholders.
	   BAY closed up Bt0.25 at Bt11.25 per share Tuesday.

Annan hopes for sustained dialogue on East Timor issue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed an
Indonesian move to free 15 East Timorese political prisoners and
said Wednesday he hoped this would develop into a ``sustained
dialogue'' on the future of the former Portuguese territory.
	   Annan was commenting on an announcement in Jakarta that
President B.J. Habibie had signed a decree to release 15 East
Timorese political prisoners ``as soon as possible.''
	   The list does not include jailed rebel chief Xanana Gusmao, a
symbol of the 23-year independence struggle. Indonesia regards
Gusmao as a criminal who committed violent acts in his fight
against Indonesian rule.
	   He is currently serving a 20-year prison term in Jakarta's
Cipinang Prison. South African President Nelson Mandela met Gusmao
during a visit to Indonesia in July and called for his release.
	   ``The secretary-general welcomes the news that President Habibie
has signed a decree for the release of 15 East Timorese prisoners
and hopes that this will lead to the freedom of all other East
Timorese political prisoners,'' the United Nations said in a
statement.
	   ``He is also encouraged by the beginning of what he hopes will
be a sustained dialogue towards the resolution of the question of
East Timor ... based on a just, comprehensive and internationally
acceptable formula,'' the statement added.
	   In the East Timorese capital Dili, more than 3,000 East Timorese
protested Wednesday against Indonesian control of their homeland.
The demonstrations were an emphatic rejection of a proposal by
Habibie to grant special status to East Timor.
	   Indonesia took over East Timor in 1975 after Portugal withdrew,
ending four centuries of colonial rule. Indonesia annexed the
territory in 1976 in a move the United Nations never recognized.
	   For years, the United Nations has been sponsoring periodic talks
between Indonesia and Portugal under various formulas and echelons
to try to break the impasse.
	   The most recent session _ a working level meeting chaired by
U.N. special representative Jamsheed Markur of Pakistan _ achieved
no breakthrough.
	   During the rule of former President Suharto, who annexed the
former colony, Indonesia stuck by its position that East Timor is
an integral part of its national territory.
	   Portugal has been urging a referendum so East Timorese can
decide the territory's status.
	   Following Suharto's resignation, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas said the change in the presidency has provided an
opportunity for Portugal, East Timorese separatists and Indonesia
to resolve the issue.

Three aid workers killed in ambush in southern Sudan

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Armed assailants have opened fire at a
United Nations relief convoy in Sudan, killing three aid workers
and wounding four others.
	   The World Food Program said gunmen opened fire Tuesday morning,
killing field officer El Haj Ali Hammad and Sumain Samson Ohiri, a
driver.
	   Maggboul Mamoun, a staffer for the Sudan Red Crescent, was also
killed and three other Sudan Red Crescent workers and an escort
were injured, the Rome-based agency said.
	   All victims were Sudanese, sources in Sudan told The Associated
Press.
	   ``WFP condemns these brutal murders and we are seeking an
investigation into the tragic killings,'' the agency's executive
director, Catherine Bertini, said in Rome.
	   A government soldier was among those injured, the official
Sudanese News Agency reported.
	   A Sudanese government minister, Gen. Hassan Dahawi, accused the
rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army of carrying out the attack on
the three-car convoy in Southern Kordofan province, about 500
kilometers (310 miles) southwest of the capital Khartoum.
	   ``We call upon all U.N. organizations and the voluntary
organizations to continue their humanitarian mission without paying
attention to such ugly provocations that target humanity and
peace,'' Dahawi was quoted as saying by SUNA.
	   SPLA rebels have been fighting since 1983 for autonomy and
development in the predominantly Christian, African and animist
south, which has traditionally been dominated by the Muslim and
Arabized north.
	   An estimated 1.5 million people have died in the fighting and
related famines. The WFP runs a major program in the south to bring
food to refugees and starving people.

	   WHILE the Education Ministry does not want students and teachers
to watch World Cup matches live late in the night or early in the
morning, soldiers will be allowed to see the games.
	   Army Commander Chettha Thanajaro said Tuesday soldiers, in
particular conscripts, should be given a chance to watch France '98
which begins Wednesday because the World Cup is ''one of the
wonderful things on earth''.
	   Training programmes will be adjusted so that soldiers have time
to watch late night or early morning matches, he said.
	   ''Soldiers should have a chance to watch the World Cup because
it comes only once in four years,'' he added.

	   PARLIAMENT President Wan Mohammad Noor Matha Tuesday said he
would fight back in the second round of a war of words if
challenged by Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai.
	   His defiance came after Premier Chuan confirmed on Monday he
would allow his Democrat Party MPs to retaliate against any attacks
from the New Aspiration Party where Wan Noor is a deputy leader,
and after reports that the premier had allowed his deputy secretary
general Nipon Boonyapattharo to send a letter of protest to Wan
Noor for attacking Chuan.
	   Wan Noor said he challenged the premier because he could not
tolerate his public comments on the NAP's attempts to expand its
base in the Democrat Party's traditional stronghold in the South by
giving a false impression that the NAP was trying to buy votes.
	   Wan Noor, a Yala MP, said when he received Nipon's letter of
protest he would have his secretary reply in an open letter so the
public would know what was going on.
	   He said Chuan, the Democrat Party leader, was making unkind
comments on the activities of his party in the South.
	   Responding to criticism on Monday by MP Surachet Wae-asae
(Dem-Narathiwat) that Wan Noor should have resigned as Parliament
president before attacking the premier, he said Chuan should as
well had stepped down as prime minister before flying in public
such false impressions about the NAP.
	   Meanwhile, Deputy Commerce Minister Paitoon Kaewthong, one of
Wan Noor's targets of veiled attacks of vote buying in the last
election, said: ''I can't understand why people of Parliament
President Wan Noor's calibre could recourse to a smear campaign in
the manner of an old style politician. But I've not met him yet.
What he said was not productive.'' He said he defected from the NAP
to the Democrat Party before the last election because the NAP had
become an ''election gang'' and not a political party.
	   Interior Minister and Democrat secretary-general Sanan
Kachornprasart said he did not plan to sue Wan Noor for defamation
because he had not been named in the Wan Noor's accusation of vote
buying.

	   THE Thai government Tuesday approved the issue of Bt50 billion,
or US$1.16 billion, of domestic bonds as part of the planned Bt500
billion aimed at easing the debt burden of the Financial
Institutions Development Fund (FIDF).
	   The baht-denominated bonds, for domestic sale, would be issued
by the Finance Ministry and have a one-year maturity with a yield
of 12.75 per cent, according to Akapol Sorasuchart, the government
spokesman.
	   The 12.75 per cent interest rate is calculated from the average
fixed deposit rate of the five large-sized Thai commercial banks
minus 0.25 per cent, he said.
	   The issue of the Bt50 billion in bonds is in accordance with the
royal decree which allowed the Finance Ministry to issue bonds
worth Bt500 billion.
	   Akapol said the bonds will be sold by the Bank of Thailand to
financial institutions which are the creditors of the FIDF. The
proceeds from the sale will be given to the FIDF and the FIDF will
spend the money to redeem the bonds earlier sold to the BOT.
	   According to Akapol, the government decided to issue only Bt50
billion in its first tranche of bonds because the interest rate
currently is quite high.
	   The first tranche of bonds are also to test the current market,
he said.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Pisit Lee-ahtam said the remaining Bt450
billion in bonds will be issued within this year.
	   He said the BOT would certainly be able to accomodate the bond
sale with its current daily cashflow of about Bt80 billion.
	   The bonds in the first tranche will be sold only to the
institutions which are indebted to the FIDF, and the later tranches
will be offered to other parties.
	   As of June 5, the FIDF is having total liabilities of Bt1.187
trillion; Bt733.68 billion it borrowed from the repurchase market
and Bt393.42 billion which have been converted to negotiable
certificate of deposit of Krung Thai Bank and Krungthai Thanakit
Plc.
	   With the interest rate of 17-20 per cent per annum in the
repurchase market, the FIDF has to pay for the monthly interest of
Bt12 billion.

	   THE name ''Damask'' will soon disappear from the local
advertising industry after its founder, Vinit Suraphongchai, sold
his remaining stake of 20 per cent to BBDO Worldwide early this
year, marking the end of his control in the agency he founded 11
years ago.
	   Vinit told The Nation in an exclusive interview that BBDO
decided to delete ''Damask'' from the agency's name and Damask/BBDO
will soon be renamed BBDO Thailand. The agency will be part of the
international BBDO network which now owns 100 per cent the firm.
	   ''It was the beginning and the end that I witnessed during my
era. Just like a boxer, I've tried my best to fight and now it's
over. I want to pass the job on to the next generation,'' he said.
	   However, advertising veteran Vinit remains the company's
chairman, while the chief executive officer post goes to Decha
Tangpanitansook, a former executive at Results Advertising Co, a
subsidiary of Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Thailand. BBDO recently recruited two
top executives -- Decha and Suthisak Sucharittanonta from Results
Advertising Co. Suthisak, who is an international award-winning
creative staff member, has been named BBDO Thailand's executive
creative director.
	   Vinit will act as a supervisor for BBDO Thailand and will not be
involved in routine work and policy-making. The new policy will see
Decha bringing Results' working style to BBDO by grouping account
management and creative people in one team to better serve clients.
	   ''I am old enough to retire and should spend the rest of my life
on contributing to the industry or becoming a lecturer. I will also
spend time playing my favourite sport, golf,'' he said.
	   A rising star in the advertising industry more than a decade
ago, Vinit left Lintas Thailand as the agency's managing director
and founded Damask in 1987, grooming it from a small boutique to
one of the country's top 20 advertising agencies. The agency
recorded Bt610 million in billings last year.
	   When Damask was first established, Vinit acquired a 50-per cent
share with Saravut Krykad, a leading creative man, holding a 40-per
cent stake. Saravut no longer holds any stake in Damask/BBDO. Vinit
gradually sold 30 per cent during the past four years. BBDO started
investing in Damask in 1994 and became a major shareholder in 1996.
It was early this year that Vinit decided to let the last stake go
to BBDO.
	   ''I understand the situation, as it's common for any
multinational agency to expand its business empire by either
starting from scratch or taking over local firms. Never mind that
the name Damask is no longer there, the Thai staff are still
working at the agency and they should benefit as part of an
international network,'' he said.
	   Vinit now prefers to position himself as a ''senior'' of the
advertising community, focusing on the social contributions he can
make. He was president of the Advertising Association of Thailand
during 1984-1986 and was also the chairman of the organising
committee of the 15th Adasia in Bangkok in 1986. Vinit is now
chairman of the Asian Federation of Advertising Associations. His
most recent work for the advertising industry was the first Asia
Pacific Advertising Festival held in March this year. He will also
be a key person in hosting Adasia in Thailand next year.

	   ALTHOUGH sales of Pioneer Electronics in Asean countries are
expected to plunge by 20 to 30 per cent this year, the company
hopes its operations in Thailand will enjoy a growing market share
due to low costs.
	   Pioneer Electronics Marketing (Asia) Co president Naoki Saito
said the regional economic turmoil will substantially bring down
the company's sales in Asean by 20 to 30 per cent year-on-year.
	   Pioneer's Asean operations in 1997 recorded sales of around YEN
18.15 billion, accounting for around 5 per cent of the
manufacturer's total sales last year worth YEN 363 billion. The
markets in Indonesia and the Philippines have been the worst
affected by the economic turmoil, yet the firm's share of the
shrinking audiovisual market in Thailand is increasing.
	   ''Thailand is our most important market in Asean, next to
Singapore. During the past couple of years, our market share has
been increasing to over 10 per cent because of new product
launches,'' Saito said. To offset the contracting domestic market,
Pioneer is emphasising increasing its market coverage to benefit
from share losses by competitors. In low purchasing markets like
Indonesia and the Philippines, the company plans to limit its
production capacity to suit market demand as well as choose
suitable products for launch in those markets, he added.
	   The parent company has supported its Thai operations through the
promotion of digital video disc (DVD) and mini-system audio
products, Saito said.
	   Masahiro Kawamura, managing director of Pioneer Electronics
(Thailand) Co Ltd, said the company expects to increase its share
this year despite the market sluggishness. At present, the
company's share of the DVD market is 40 per cent, and 30 per cent
for car stereo systems.
	   ''We expect to gain a much greater market share this year due to
price competitiveness,'' he said. The company's production facility
in Ayutthaya province has helped it reduce operating costs by 10
per cent and has slashed 30 per cent from its import duty bill. The
lower production costs have allowed more marketing activities.
	   Pioneer Tuesday unveiled its Pioneer Plasma Display, a 40-inch
viewing screen which can be connected to several sources such as
computers, DVD, laser disc and video players as well as television
tuners. The product, priced at Bt600,000 a set, targets businesses
that need to publicise information, such as the stock exchange,
airports, hotels and advertising companies.
	   The company has approached the Airports Authority of Thailand,
the State Railway of Thailand, the Communications Authority of
Thailand, the Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand
and the Stock Exchange of Thailand to market its product. It
expects sales to reach Bt100 million in the first year.

Sugar production from six Caribbean countries reaches 472,000 tons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ The six member countries of Sugar
Association of the Caribbean together produced about 472,000 tons
(42,800 metric tons) of sugar between November and May 31, the
group reported Wednesday.
	   Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, Belize, St. Kitts and Nevis,
Guyana and Jamaica exported about 253,000 tons (230,000 metric
tons) to Europe under treaty arrangements giving preference to
Caribbean sugar, and 35,400 tons (320,000 metric tons) under other
arrangements, the group said.
	   Sugar exports to the United States totaled 31,000 tons (28,200
metric tons), and 13,788 tons (12,500 metric tons) went to other
markets.
	   Barbados produced 47,900 tons (43,500 metric tons), Belize,
92,000 tons (83,600 metric tons), and Jamaica produced 141,300 tons
(128,000 metric tons). St. Kitts produced 21,500 tons (19,500
metric tons), Guyana 90,000 tons (81,700 metric tons) and Trinidad
and Tobago, 78,800 tons (71,500 metric tons), the association said.
	   The sugar harvest began in November in Jamaica, December in
Belize, and January in Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados and St. Kitts
and Nevis. The harvest started in February in Guyana.
	   In April, the association lowered its projections for the
1997-1998 crop from 732,000 (664,000 metric tons) tons to 725,000
tons (657,700 metric tons) because of drought in some islands
caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon.

	   NOW that thousands of ethnic Albanians are fleeing Kosovo amid
fierce attacks from Serb forces, we are once again seeing Slobodan
Milosevic, President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,
destroying what little is left of the land of the southern Slavs.
	   At the height of the Bosnian holocaust four years ago, I had
warned against shaking hands with Slobodan Milosevic because he was
the mastermind behind the genocide there. As a bigger war criminal
than Radovan Karadzic, Milosevic should have been indicted.
Subsequent events have given credence to this contention.
	   Elections just a few days ago have shown that the people in the
constituent republic of Montenegro are sick and tired of Milosevic.
	   As for the people of Kosovo, they have been oppressed by the
Serbs for a long time now. As the tragedies in Bosnia and Rwanda
have taught us, the world cannot wring its hands in despair,
confusion, procrastination and indecision again, and hope that more
meetings and more appeals will solve the problem.
	   The time for action is now, not after hundreds or thousands of
innocent people including women, children, the elderly and the sick
have been slaughtered or raped or tortured.
	   The United Nations, Nato and the European Union should send
peacekeeping forces into Kosovo immediately, not next week or next
month when it will be too late. The talks can come later after the
lives have been saved.

Jamaicans carry TVs to work for first World Cup matches

	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Office employees carried televisions to
work and bank customers stood transfixed before sets in bank
lobbies as Jamaica turned its attention to the World Cup on
Wednesday.
	   Few telephones rang and traffic on Kingston's streets dropped
off as the first round of matches began. Most televisions were
tuned to the face-off between Brazil, the defending champion, and
Scotland.
	   Interest in the World Cup on this Caribbean island has been
intense since Jamaica won its first-ever berth in the championship
playoffs.
	   It will be the first chance a Caribbean country has had at the
World Cup since Haiti played in 1974.
	   Jamaica has its first match against Croatia on June 14 and plays
Argentina on June 21. Both of those games will be on Sundays.
	   Business owners said they are bracing for large-scale absences
on Jamaica's first weekday match, a game against Japan at Gerland
Stadium in Lyon.

	   PARIS (AP) _ On a day when the Air France strike ended, the
first hooligan was arrested and bugs walked on stilts, it should
have been expected that a bizarre goal would decide the first game
of the 16th World Cup.
	   Scottish defender Tommy Boyd knocked the ball into his own goal
with his chest after a save by goalkeeper Jim Leighton in the 73rd
minute to give defending champion Brazil a 2-1 victory Wednesday
before 80,000 people at the new Stade de France.
	   The goal ended a surprising threat from Scotland, for whom even
a draw would have been a stunning upset in the Group A match.
	   ``Jim made a great save but it hit me on the chest and I
couldn't get out of the way,'' Boyd said. ``It was probably the
worst feeling I have ever had to lose a game like that.''
	   Early on, it appeared Brazil would produce the expected rout.
Cesar Sampaio scored on a header off a corner kick just four
minutes into the game.
	   ``Scoring like that, the first goal, makes me unbelievably
happy,'' Sampaio said. ``During those first five seconds one
forgets about everything else, it's like a dream.''
	   But Sampaio's foul on Kevin Gallacher led to John Collins'
penalty equalizer in the 38th minute.
	   ``There's no denying that the better team won the game,''
Scotland manager Craig Brown said. ``But we had a great chance not
to lose.''
	   Later Wednesday, Norway played Morocco in Montpellier in another
Group A match. Group B action begins Thursday when Cameroon faces
Austria in Toulouse and Italy plays Chile in Bordeaux.
	   The Brazil-Scotland game was preceded by a colorful ceremony
featuring 600 acrobats and volunteers _ including stiltwalkers
dressed as striped insects and trumpeting bungee jumpers _ all
acting out the planting of a ``magic garden'' on the field.
	   Away from the field, police identified a known soccer hooligan
from Scotland as one of 15 people still in custody late Wednesday
as a result of overnight clashes between drunken fans and police.
	   The confrontations followed Tuesday's pre-tournament parade
through the streets of Paris.
	   Thirty-four police were injured in the violence, with one in
critical condition after being hit in the head with a beer bottle.
	   There were other World Cup-related arrests in Bologna, Italy.
Italian police detained 23 people suspected of belonging to a
militant Algerian Islamic group accused of plotting terror attacks
during the tournament.
	   The new roundup brings to nearly 100 the number of people who
have been arrested on such suspicions over the past several weeks.
Arrests also have occurred in France, Germany, Belgium and
Switzerland.
	   There was also good news Wednesday morning. Air France and its
pilots resolved a 10-day strike that had severely embarrassed the
country in the days leading up to the World Cup.
	   The company called for an immediate return to work. But the
airline has said it could take three days for service to return to
normal once the strike ended.
	   The kickoff of the Brazil-Scotland game not only marked the
start of competition, but it was also the deadline for teams to
petition FIFA to replace injured or sick players on their rosters.
	   Italy replaced striker Fabrizio Ravanelli, suffering from an
infection in his right lung, with Parma forward Enrico Chiesa.
Nigeria called up Mobi Oparaku to fill the spot vacated by defender
Jero Shakpoke, who was diagnosed with a broken left collarbone
suffered in the 5-1 loss to the Netherlands last week.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Declaring British beef safe once more,
the European Commission on Wednesday proposed ending a worldwide
export ban slapped on the country's cattle raisers at the height of
the ``mad cow'' scare.
	   European regulators did not immediately repeal the 2-year-old
ban, however, so the optimism that surged through Britain's cattle
country was tempered by recognition that the battered market has no
chance of bouncing back right away.
	   ``There's no real reason to throw your hat in the air,'' said
Paul Gentry, who auctions cattle in Newark, about 200 kilometers
(120 miles) north of London. ``This is good news, but whether it
materializes, your guess is as good as mine.''
	   Prices for live cattle at Gentry's lot are as much as 50 percent
lower than before the European Union banned all exports of British
beef.
	   The ban was imposed in March 1996 when Britain acknowledged a
link between cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE,
and the fatal human brain ailment Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.
	   Reports on the disease and the ban touched off a public health
scare, causing a slump in demand for beef across Europe. The EU
spent billions of dollars to buy up beef to support farmers.
	   Britain's beef exports were worth dlrs 8.1 billion a year when
the ban was imposed _ and the farmers face many more hurdles before
they can hope for a decent recovery.
	   Germany, in particular, is wary about resuming British beef
sales, fearing a consumer backlash. Chancellor Helmut Kohl may not
be in the mood for concessions in the runup to September elections.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair seemed wary of the issues
ahead.
	   ``There's still a long way to go,'' he said. ``I counsel caution
until we are through all the various stages of the European
negotiation.''
	   Still, the prospect of an end to the crisis was just what
everybody in the British beef industry has been waiting for.
	   ``It'll take the gloom out of the market,'' said David Williams,
who runs the Williams Wholesale slaughterhouse in tiny Woebley,
western England. ``It'll be a great morale booster for the whole
industry.''
	   Williams' wife, Sheila, alluded to other blows the beef dealers
have suffered _ including the Labor government's ban of all beef on
the bone in Britain, based on the minuscule possibility that
T-bones or prime rib could give humans the incurable brain ailment.
	   ``Is that bone-in, or bone-out?'' Mrs. Williams asked of the
European Commission recommendation that British farmers be allowed
to export beef and most beef products from animals older than six
months and younger than 30 months. But the bones will have to
remain out.
	   The British farmers have bitterly complained that they make some
of the world's best beef, but it has been unfairly tarnished by
British government bumbling and European politics.
	   Many farmers also argue their competitors in continental Europe
have benefited from the ban, which allowed them to sell more beef
on global markets and even within Britain, and gave them little
incentive to end the EU ban.
	   Some consumers remain scared to eat British beef, and many
restaurants in Britain advertise non-British beef on their menus.
	   European Union veterinary experts still must study Wednesday's
recommendation on lifting the export ban, and it could be put to a
vote of agriculture commissioners from the 15 EU nations.
	   ``We've now turned the corner and we're in the home straight,''
said Ben Gill, president of the National Farmers Union. ``The
momentum must not be lost. We are confident that the huge weight
which has burdened the farming community for more than two years
will soon be removed.''

Belarusian government bent on evicting U.S., other ambassadors

	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Belarus said Wednesday that it had
postponed a deadline for foreign diplomats to leave their
residences, but continued to insist that the diplomats would be
evicted to permit urgent repairs.
	   The United States, Russia, France, Germany and Lithuania have
formally protested the planned eviction, which they say is in
violation of international law.
	   France and Lithuania said they will recall their ambassadors for
consultations if Belarus persists, and Washington has said it will
also take some action in response.
	   Belarusian officials reluctantly agreed to extend Wednesday's
deadline for the diplomats to leave until next week.
	   Oleg Novikov, deputy head of the Dipservice state agency in
charge of maintaining the diplomatic residences, told reporters on
Wednesday that his workers hadn't yet cut power and water supply to
the Drozdy complex but would do that next week.
	   ``I think they should use the time left to remove the
furniture,'' he said.
	   Novikov said that ambassadors from Bulgaria and several
ex-Soviet republics had left the complex in pine woods on the
western outskirts of the capital, Minsk, before Wednesday's
deadline and workers have already started on repairs which will
take 14 months.
	   The ambassadors say that under international law, their
residences are considered sovereign territory and governments have
no right to enter without permission or insist that diplomats
leave.
	   U.S. Ambassador Daniel Speckhard said that envoys would prefer
to make arrangements to remain in the complex during the repairs.
He noted that the government's decision appeared to have been
sudden, and that some embassies had signed new multi-year leases
the month before.
	   ``The issue is it's unprecedented in recent times for any
countries in peacetime to evict all of the ambassadors through
ultimatums, deadlines, threats, from what, under the Vienna
Convention is inviolable territory,'' Speckhard said in an
interview with The Associated Press.
	   Officials in the former Soviet republic expressed regret for the
``inconvenience,'' but insisted the diplomats leave, saying the
complex's water supply is no longer safe and the sewage system is
polluting the environment.
	   ``There is a danger that Drozdy will float in its own sewage,''
Foreign Minister Ivan Antonovich said Tuesday on Belarusian state
radio. ``We can't endanger diplomats' lives''
	   Speckhard said he has had no problems with either his water or
sewage systems in the year he has lived in the complex.
	   ``To the contrary, we have excellent water and sewer service,''
he said.
	   The Foreign Ministry has offered the ambassadors apartments in
downtown Minsk, cottages 30 kilometers (18 miles) outside Minsk or
plots on which to build new residences.
	   ``All of these options are very weak,'' Speckhard said, noting
that several countries, including the United States, have spent
considerable sums renovating their residences.
	   The dispute began in April when the government served notice
that the ambassadors would have to vacate their homes in the
rambling, wooded housing compound by Wednesday.

	   THERE is no hitch in Cambodia's preparations for admission into
Asean.
	   Cambodian Economy and Finance Ministry's senior economic
official Dr Aun Porn Moniroth said he was ``instructed by my Prime
Minister to continue preparing, at the technical level, Cambodia's
entry into Asean''.
	   ``People have asked us to reconsider joining Asean ... but I
think there is politics behind this,'' Moniroth said during a
regional seminar ``New Members of Asean: Dismantling Barriers and
Facing Economic Challenges'' in Vientiane, Laos.
	   He was responding to suggestions that Cambodia continue to
consider its entry into Asean following the recent developments in
the region especially the unrest in Indonesia.
	   Moniroth said it was imperative for Cambodia to join Asean if it
wanted to build its economy.
	   ``Asean will provide new opportunity for growth ... looking
ahead, our natural endowments, low-cost labour force and strategic
location position ... we want to take advantage of access to this
high growth regional market of 500 million people.''
	   Meanwhile, in his presentation, Moniroth said that while it
lacked experience and economic strength, the country nevertheless
had strong vision for its future as a full-fledged and equal
partner of Asean.
	   ``We also have strong commitment to proceed along our chosen
democratic and market-oriented path,'' he said in his paper titled
``Opening Doors: Promoting Market Economy from Cambodia's
Perspective''.
	   He said emerging as an independent nation from colonial rule in
1953, the new Government's first task was to create a consensus on
the national vision, policies and strategies to rehabilitate and
develop the country.
	   ``Guided by strong vision, determination and a strict
discipline, we have brought macro-economic stability to our country
for the first time in several decades.
	   ``The market-oriented shift of our economy started in 1989, and
has been greatly accelerated both qualitatively and quantitatively
by the Government.''
	   He added that trade had been liberalised since 1993 with the
removal of restrictions on trading activities.
	   The country's real gross domestic product growth has reached a
healthy six to seven per cent over the past four years, he stated.
	   Per capita GDP, although still very low, jumped from US$183 in
1991 to US$382 in 1996, despite a 21 per cent increase in
population during that period.
	   Moniroth said to sustain its growth momentum, Cambodia needed to
consolidate past gains as well as ensure stability and put in place
new mechanisms and processes.
	   For example, the country has taken serious measures to encourage
the private sector and foreign investors.
	   The country is also planning to establish internal capital
markets to tap domestic savings and to secure additional outside
capital.
	   ``We encourage investments in infrastructure and BOT
(build-own-transfer) agreement as well as by IPPs (independent
power producers) for power generation,'' he added.

World Cup: Boyd own goal gives defending champs 2-1 victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Optional; ADDS quotes; WILL be UPDATED with more quotes. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Brazil usually doesn't need help.
This time they took it.
	   In a sloppy match that kept with the tradition of World Cup
openers, defending champion Brazil needed an own goal from Tommy
Boyd in the 73rd minute to beat Scotland 2-1 Wednesday, but showed
little sign that its ready to win a fifth title.
	   Ronaldo, the two-time FIFA Player of the Year, lived up to
expectations with a dazzling repertoire of stutter-step dribbles,
explosive charges and artillery. But he got little help from the
rest of the Brazilian team _ especially a defense that looked slow
and confused.
	   ``The only defect, if you can call it that, was that we stayed
behind too much and we left too many open spaces in between,''
Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo said.
	   The afternoon began as a party for the defending world
champions. The Stade de France stadium was a sea of Brazilian
green-and-yellow jerseys, flags and body paint. Some bipartisan
fans wore kilts with Ronaldo's No. 9 shirt.
	   And before the players had time to break a sweat, Brazil was on
the board.
	   In the fourth minute, Dunga blasted a long shot from straight on
that Colin Hendry headed wide. Bebeto took the corner kick and
curled the ball into the near post, where Cesar Sampaio beat Craig
Burley and John Collins to a header that made it 1-0.
	   ``Things started well for me, scoring the first goal. And this
is a great start for the team, too,'' Cesar Sampaio said. ``Scoring
like that, the first goal, makes me unbelievably happy. During
those first five seconds one forgets about everything else. It's
like a dream''.
	   Meanwhile, Ronaldo troubled the Scot defense with runs from the
left and right.
	   In the 13th minute, the 21-year-old striker broke into the area,
and Colin Hendry nearly headed the ball into his own net trying to
clear.
	   Three minutes later, Rivaldo found Ronaldo open on the left
side, but his booming shot was tipped wide by goalkeeper Jim
Leighton. Ronaldo struck again in the 20th minute, twisting Hendry
around and racing through the defense to test Leighton once more.
	   But if the crowd sensed a blowout, the Scots had other ideas.
Slowly the Europeans settled and were able to gain more of the
possession, but were never able to control the game.
	   ``I think we were brave, but perhaps not good enough,'' Scotland
coach Craig Brown. ``They deserved to win, but we shouldn't have
lost, that's the way we're looking at it.''
	   Striker Gordon Durie created the Scots first real chance,
slipping behind the defense and caught a high pass in mid-flight,
but his deflection lofted just over the crossbar.
	   The left side of the Brazilian defense was an avenue for the
Scots, with Roberto Carlos charging upfield and 32-year-old
fullback Aldair, who was cleared by doctors only on Tuesday to
play, nearly always late on coverage.
	   In the 29th minute, the Scots blew in with a dangerous cross,
twisting around fullback Junior Baiano and forcing him to clear the
ball with the outside of his left heal.
	   Seven minutes later, Cesar Sampaio ran over the back of Kevin
Gallacher in the penalty area on another Scot counterattack.
Collins converted into the lower right corner to make it 1-1.
	   Then it was Brazil's turn to get nervous, flubbing passes and
losing the ball unchallenged. In the final minute of the half,
Aldair was yellow-carded for a rough tackle.
	   Leonardo came in for Giovanni at the start of the second half to
improve coverage in the midfield, and Brazil came out pressing.
Rivaldo put a scare in the Scots with a series of three tight
dribbles and bullet past the right post.
	   But the defense seemed bent on complicating simple plays.
	   In the 49th minute, Sampaio kicked a ball out of keeper
Taffarel's arms. Six minutes later, the Scots wove in again up the
right, and Taffarel took a cleat in the head from Sampaio as they
collided, and Cafu sent the ball to a corner.
	   Meanwhile, Scotland grew more confident, controlling the ball
and the tempo as the Tartan Army was heard over the silent
Brazilian fans.
	   Rivaldo and Ronaldo were the sole sparks for Brazil, until a
fluke play decided the game.
	   In the 73rd minute, Dunga found Cafu with a long pass up the
right side. The Brazilian defender tapped a shot that bounced off
Leighton, again off a backtracking Boyd and into the net.
	   Denilson replaced Bebeto on Brazil, and Scotland sent in Billy
McKinlay for Darren Jackson and Tosh McKinlay for Christian Dailly.
	   Durie and Kevin Gallagher tested Taffarel in the final minutes,
but the afternoon was Brazil's.

	   DMIB Bhd has launched an air-steriliser product that claims to
virtually eliminate all presence of germs in the air. ``The
Germitol Air Steriliser works by purifying and sterilising the air
to give you a 99.91 per cent germ-free environment, as proven in
independent studies conducted by reputable microbiology
laboratories,'' said DMIB, the marketing agent, in a statement. The
Singapore-manufactured steriliser is useful for those suffering
from breathing and respiratory problems like continuous wheezing, a
stuffed nose, chronic coughing and asthma. It can also be used by
those recuperating from surgery to reduce the risk of infection.
The purification and sterilising process involves using UV-C light
and Germitrol's patented UV system which emits low level of
radiation. The Sirim-tested product is available in three models,
and comes in a compact and portable unit. It is available at Apex
Pharmacy, Handi-Mart, Carrefour or other selected pharmacies. Those
interested can also contact DMIB at 03-791-8833 ext 814/843.

Graf wins first match of comeback

 &UR; Eds: updated with Steffi quotes in 6th graf, other results

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Steffi Graf, playing her first match
in four months, rallied to beat Rennae Stubbs in three sets
Wednesday at the DFS Classic grass-court tournament.
	   The former world's No. 1 player recovered after losing the first
set and downed the Australian 5-7, 6-2, 6-4 in 1 hour, 51 minutes.
	   The two players, who are close friends, hugged at the net after
the match.
	   Graf, who received a first-round bye, advanced to a third-round
meeting against either Kristie Boogert or Miriam Oremans.
	   After Wednesday's match she declared herself ``physically fit''.
	   ``I've been feeling good for the last few weeks _ now I need
matches and to play points, which I've not really done,'' she said.
	   ``With another 10 or 11 days I'll get better and better and
physically stronger.''
	   Graf, the winner of 21 Grand Slam singles titles, had played
only two tournaments since undergoing reconstructive surgery on her
left knee a year ago.
	   In February, she won a match at Hanover before losing a
quarterfinal clash with Sabine Applemans of Belgium 6-3, 7-6.
	   The next month, she won three matches at Indian Wells but had to
retire in the third set of the semifinals against Lindsay
Davenport.
	   Recent planned comebacks were postponed due to various injuries.
	   The start of Wednesday's match was held up by rain, which has
disrupted the first three days of the tournament.
	   Graf started the match with a brace on her left knee but she
removed it early in the first set.
	   Stubbs broke Graf twice in winning the first set. But the German
took control in the second, and her break of serve in the first
game of the third set held up the rest of the way.
	   Graf squandered two match points before closing out the match
with a trademark forehand winner.
	   Graf struggled with her serve, hitting 12 double faults to go
with her five aces.
	   Graf also plans to play next week at Eastbourne before starting
the challenge for her eighth Wimbledon singles title.
	   Three other seeds bowed out of the tournament after losing to
qualifyers Wednesday. Among them was 10th seed Tamarine Tanasugarn,
of Thailand, who won the first set before losing to Italian Laura
Golarsa 6-4, 5-7, 0-6.

	   CARLOVERS Carwash Ltd, of which the Berjaya Group is a major
shareholder, has postponed a general meeting which was to decide on
a proposed salvage plan after shareholders sought more information
on the company's share valuation. According to Financial Review,
Carlovers had planned to cut debt and fund a restructure of its
operations and new ventures. ``Carlovers has signalled an operating
loss for the full year and in April said it would write down
intangibles and development costs as abnormals totalling A$7
million (RM16.8 million). Its shares have fallen from about A$0.40
last June to 10.5 cents this week,'' the newspaper said. Managing
director Ken Millard is quoted as saying that one or two
shareholders had complained to the Australian Securities Commission
that a report commissioned by the company did not provide
information on a share valuation. Millard said the additional
information would be sent to shareholders today.

African summit approves continental rights court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ African heads of state meeting
at a summit here have approved a plan to create a continent-wide
human rights court, officials announced Wednesday.
	   The African Court on Human and Peoples Rights was approved by 29
state and government leaders attending the three-day Organization
of African Unity summit which ended Wednesday, the OAU said in a
statement.
	   The court will aim to strengthen and improve legal systems in
African countries and help ``protect and promote human rights in
Africa.''
	   Before the court will be created, 15 member states must ratify
the plan.
	   The court is intended to allow member states and individuals
claiming to be victim of human rights abuses to lodge complaints
against other individuals or member governments.
	   Officials have not said what decisions or judgments can be made
by the judicial body. OAU members are to submit nominations for the
eight judges on the court.
	   The court will be based on the Charter of African and Peoples
Human Rights.

Yugoslav Zoran Njegus signs for Atletico de Madrid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Yugoslav midfielder Zoran Njegus on
Wednesday became the first new player to sign for Atletico de
Madrid since Italian Arrigo Sacchi took over as the Spanish team's
new coach.
	   At a special presentation press conference the 24-year-old
former Red Star Belgrade player said he already knew Atletico's
style because the first division club was very popular in
Yugoslavia.
	   Njegus was born in the same town as the club's ex-coach, Serb
Radomir Antic, who was sacked last month after four seasons at
Atletico and replaced by the Italian Sacchi.
	   The player refused to comment on the irony that it was the new
coach who had brought him to the team.
	   Njegus five-year signing cost about one billion pesetas (dlrs
6.5 million), the national news agency EFE reported.

	   FOREIGN investors are still keen on Asia, but any major fund
inflows into the region will largely be in the form of buying into
company equities instead of subscribing to debt.
	   This prognosis was made by Arthur Andersen Business Consulting
managing partner for Asia Pacific Thomas P. Vance during an
interview in Kuala Lumpur on Friday.
	   He said foreign investors were more keen on a company's
performance instead of simply investing in the region.
	   ``The recent performance of red chips in Hong Kong is one good
example of how they did well initially but later lost their lustre
as their fundamental operations did not justify their share prices.
	   ``In our global consulting business, we have always emphasised
the need for a company to have a good cashflow to attract
investment and funds, and this advice still holds true.''
	   Vance said most investors around the world still kept a close
watch on developments in Asia as the region continued to represent
potential for strong economic growths which could translate into
solid returns on investments.
	   ``As long as there is a good idea that is implemented well,
there will always be money attracted to such operations, despite
the overall gloom that has been cast over this region.''
	   He also said the region's economic problems had led many top
executives to take another long look at their operations to
maximise their investments so as to ensure strong cashflow
positions.
	   ``Cashflow is perhaps the most important aspect of any business.
For every unit of cashflow, you are usually able to raise between
three and five units of loans from the banks.
	   ``That is the basis on which we advise many of our clients when
they ask us for help to streamline their operations to expand their
businesses. So, getting bank loans is still possible during these
trying times.''
	   Vance, who will be based in Tokyo from August, said the major
emerging markets that many American investors were still keen on
were in Asia and Latin America.
	   ``The Europeans are the ones mostly investing in Eastern Europe
and a bit in Africa.''
	   But he cautioned against raising expectations that American
funds would pour in large amounts into Asia soon as the current
economic outlook in the US was very positive.

	   FOR the first time in two months, attention of Russian public is
not focused on the governor's elections in Siberian Krasnoyarsk
region. People relaxed for a while after the contenders' impressive
statements over national television.
	   Anyway, a new event appeared the day after this Kraynosarsk
elections was over, and at that time almost half of Russia's 89
regions seemed to get involved in it.
	   It was the biggest miner's strike that Russia witnessed in
recent years.
	   The explosion of protest started in distant mining regions, but
very quickly embraced other areas, posing a serious challenge to
the government.
	   The miners protested for not being paid for several months for
their coal, and blocked main railroads in Siberia and other parts
of Russia.
	   Nickolai, 26, a miner from the Kemerovo region in Western
Siberia, who happened to be in Moscow last Sunday, told me that he
and his friends blocked the vital Trans-Siberian Railroads with
huge logs, thus preventing the scheduled movement of more than 600
trains.
	   Miners in the Vorkuta region in the north blocked the rails and
held about 100 trains.
	   Miners protests were quite widespread in the southern Bostov
region and in other regions and, according to the Railways
Ministry, direct damage as a result of the strike was US$70 million
(RM273 million).
	   However, the problem was only ``damped down'', and the flame of
passion might restart any time in the near future.
	   According to the report of the Ministry of Economics, at the
beginning of last month, the overall wage arrears in 10 main
sectors of national economy were about US$10 billion, three per
cent more than the previous month.
	   The government's share of the arrears was about US$1.5 billion.
The government also acknowledged that unprofitable mines,
especially those in distant areas, should be closed, and new jobs
for the miners should be created (though this is easier said than
done).
	   It appears that such a situation posed a threat to political
stability in the country, and several high-ranking officials,
deputy prime-ministers Nemstov and Sysuyev among them, were sent
into mining regions in order to appease strikers.
	   They succeeded in this task - probably, because they acted not
with their words, but more with deeds, bringing to miners more than
US$47 million cash for immediate back payment of some of their
wages.
	   A government commission has been formed to look into the matter
and punish managers who have misappropriated wage funds.
	   Of course, it was not this partial payment of miners' wages that
dealt a heavy blow to the country's financial system. Anyway, it
took place almost immediately after the crisis over payment of
these wages ended.
	   According to some reports, it was the worst financial crisis in
years at the Russian financial market, with share prices plummeting
about 40 per cent last month and yields on government bonds soaring
to more than 90 per cent at their peak.
	   This turmoil increased concern about country's dwindling public
finances and made the central bank triple interest rates to 150 per
cent.
	   Besides, the central bank was reported spending about US$1.5
billion in several days, thus helping to keep the nominal value of
ruble (Russian national currency) steady at the level of about 6.18
per US dollar, before the crisis.
	   International Monetary Fund is widely expected to issue an
emergency stabilisation package, though Russian officials believe
that it could only help to remove uncertainty in the market.
	   As Vyugin, Russian deputy finance minister, put it, ``such a
credit would play only a psychological role, and stressed that the
market was rocked by a small circle of players.''
	   Meanwhile the central bank chairman Dubinin said that defence of
national currency remained a top priority.
	   The above and similar explanations are good as they managed to
calm the people down a bit.
	   At the same time the steps taken by the authorities in this
situation can be compared to actions of fireman during a fire. Of
course it is important to extinguish the fire, but perhaps, it is
even more important not to let it start again.
	   An old lady that lives not far from my house, Anna, who was
known for many years as a protector of pets (she feeds homeless
cats and dogs in the streets, and is always surrounded by them) I
am sure has never heard these explanations of top financial
officials.
	   When I last saw her, she was explaining to passers-by that she
had saved some 700 rubles (RM440), of her pension, and wanted to
get advice whether to change them into foreign currency or to keep
until the ruble was strong.
	   Naturally people refused or failed to give her any concrete
answer, and I remembered what Alexander Livshits, one of the top
economic advisers to President Yeltsin, had several days before
said about this current situation.
	   He pointed out that the main reason for the financial crisis was
the crisis of people's confidence in the authorities.
	   Dramatic, though, probably, a true explanation. At the moment
the financial crisis as well as that of the miners at least seems
under control, but the future still seems obscure.
	   Now it's the time for final exams in Russian schools, so, what
if school teachers, who also haven't seen their salaries for many
months, decide to postpone final examinations of thousands of
school graduates for an indefinite period?
	   I wonder whether Russian authorities remember that stormy events
in 1968 in France were started by very young people and for far
less vital reasons.

Own goal thwarts big surprise as Scotland loses to Brazil

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ For 37 minutes, the kilts swirled and
Scottish voices were on song as Scotland was holding mighty Brazil
in the opening game of the World Cup.
	   Tommy Boyd's own goal under a spell of Brazilian pressure ended
all that.
	   Defending champion Brazil won the opening game 2-1 at the Stade
de France on Wednesday when Boyd, facing his own goal, accidentally
shouldered a rebound he couldn't avoid into the net in the 73rd
minute.
	   Brazil's Cafu got around the back of the Scottish defense and
prodded the ball goalward with goalkeeper Jim Leighton off his
line. Leighton blocked the shot, but the ball bounced off the chest
of Boyd and back into the net.
	   While Cafu ran away and did a celebratory somersault, the
Scottish players looked deflated.
	   ``Jim made a great save, but it hit me on the chest and I
couldn't get out of the way,'' said the 33-year-old Celtic
defender.
	   ``It was probably the worst feeling I have ever had to lose a
game like that.''
	   The Scots, who have never been past the first round in seven
previous World Cups, were given little hope of beating the
star-studded Brazilians. But it looked a strong possibility when
John Collins canceled out Cesar Sampaio's early goal.
	   After Sampaio had headed the Brazilians in front in the fourth
minute, he handed the Scots an equalizer by pushing Kevin Gallacher
in the penalty box. Although goalkeeper Taffarel dived the right
way, Collins, who plays in France for Monaco, expertly slotted the
penalty past him with a left-footed shot low into the corner.
	   It was no more than the Scots deserved. Threatened by the
embarrassment of a heavy loss in the opening game before 80,000
fans and a worldwide TV audience, they survived a battering in
which 39-year-old Leighton _ the oldest player in the championship
_ stopped shots from Roberto Carlos and Ronaldo.
	   Then the Scots, roared on by their noisy fans, silenced the
massed ranks of the Brazilian supporters by taking the game to the
mighty four-time champions.
	   They produced a short but productive spell of pressure to earn
an equalizer and scare Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo, who was
frequently out of his seat on the bench and shouting in despair at
his defenders and midfielders.
	   ``Can you the champions sing? No, no'' sang the Scottish fans as
the Brazilians showed more signs of cracking under the pressure.
	   The equalizer came eight minutes later and the first half wound
up even. Although Brazil turned up the pressure again, it was a
little ironic that Scotland had the last two touches to Boyd's own
goal.
	   ``I think the reaction of the Brazilian team on their winning
goal reflected the credit for Scotland,'' said Scottish coach Craig
Brown. ``They realized they were fortunate to win the game.
	   ``There's no denying that the better team won the game, but we
had a great chance not to lose.''

OAU backs Senegalese, Guinean troops in strife-torn Guinea-Bissau
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ The Organization of African
Unity on Wednesday supported the intervention of Senegalese and
Guinean troops to help Guinea-Bissau government troops quash a
rebellion in the West African country.
	   ``All of the facts are not known, but we support any effort to
defend the just, legitimate representative order in that country,''
said the new OAU chairman, Burkina Faso President Blaise Campaore.
``What underpins that initiative is good.''
	   He was speaking to journalists at the end of a three-day summit
of African heads of state in Burkina Faso.
	   ``Bilateral military accords and military assistance between
countries is allowed and normal,'' Campaore said.
	   A Guinea-Bissau parliamentary delegation scheduled a meeting
Wednesday with renegade soldiers holed up in a military
installation since launching a coup attempt four days ago.
	   The rebels had demanded that President Joao Bernardo Vieira and
his government step down and that a transition government be set up
ahead of elections in July.

	   President B.J. Habibie said here yesterday he was pushing
Indonesia's electoral reform programs as fast as possible despite
calls by critics for even speedier elections.
	   He also told Reuters Television in an interview he had no plans
to continue as head of state after the next presidential poll.
	   Asked if he planned to be president in January 2000 after the
next election, he responded: ``Oh no, no, no, I'm not planning for
that.''
	   He added: ``I did not even plan that I would be the president
right now,'' he said, in reference to his assumption of office
three weeks ago.
	   Habibie took over on May 21 from Soeharto, who resigned amid
economic collapse and mounting demands for political and economic
reforms.
	   Asked about criticism that the electoral reform process he had
proposed was too slow, Habibie replied: ``I could not go faster...
it's not that I don't want to be fair, but they have to be fair to
me.''
	   He said a new electoral law would be drafted over the next two
months and then the public would have one month in which to
scrutinize it and suggest amendments.
	   Draft laws would be submitted to parliament for ratification by
the end of the year. General elections would be organized across
the archipelago of 202 million people and held in May.
	   A meeting of the nation's top constitutional body would come at
the end of 1999 to elect a new president and vice president.
	   ``I'm not a genie who says 'Zingaboom' and everything is
there,'' said Habibie. ``I have to take care that everybody is
happy, and that everybody says the election is correct, based on
the law, it's legal.''
	   Asked about the status of the Armed Forces, the most cohesive
organization in Indonesia and a power behind the presidency,
Habibie said it would retain its dual function role of defending
the nation and involvement in politics and social development.
	   He said the military should adapt to changing times, but that it
should also be kept outside the election process and be allotted 50
seats in parliament to give it a voice in the House of
Representatives. The Armed Forces currently has 75 seats allotted
but there have been suggestions this should be ended.
	   Habibie added that members of the military should no longer
involve themselves in the business world, necessary at one time to
finance operations for lack of adequate budget allocations.
	   The President said other reforms had been pushed through over
the past 20 days.
	   Political prisoners were being released, and he said he had set
up criteria for amnesties. Those who did not qualify for amnesty
included members of ``illegal'' organizations working against the
Constitution, people seeking to undermine the Constitution and
common criminals.
	   On the thorny issue of East Timor, which has bedeviled the
country's international relations since it was incorporated as part
of the republic in 1976, Habibie said he was ready to consider
granting ``special status'' to the territory.
	   But he insisted the territory would remain an integral part of
the country.

	   DELL Computer Corp, a direct marketer of computer systems, is
confident of making further inroads into the local and regional
personal workstation market space, which it claims present largely
untapped opportunities.
	   Dell's Precision Workstations' vice president Jeff Clarke said
the opportunities are driven by the rapid pace in the development
of software applications. ``Applications are really driving the
workstation market - that piece of software is what drives the need
for the hardware - and will continue to do so.''
	   ``Hence, we want to grow our enterprise sales which is
essentially in the area of servers and workstations. It's a matter
of how to tap and understand the markets and to make our presence
successful,'' he told Computimes.
	   Dell, Clarke said, is very much focused on such
application-driven workstation markets such as software
development, computer-aided design (CAD), financial and content
creation. As such, he added, Dell recognises that the Multimedia
Super Corridor (MSC) holds large opportunities for the company's
workstation business.
	   ``While we have yet to firm up any plans for the MSC, the
initiative is definitely within our radar and we believe we will be
able to leverage on the strong relationships we have with large
information technology (IT) multinational companies.''
	   Advancements in technology and lower costs, he added, have
caused the worldwide Windows NT-based workstation market to
``explode'', while the Unix-based workstation market ``stays
roughly flat''.
	   ``We see growth in three distinct areas: people who used to buy
PCs but can now buy personal workstations because they are more
affordable; those who are moving from the Unix environment to
Windows as Intel processors become more reduced instruction set
computing (RISC)-capable; and entirely new markets or users who can
now afford the workstations and have access to technology.''
	   He added that apart from the technological developments in the
Intel microprocessor, another factor that has led to the growth in
the personal workstation space is the Windows NT operating system
(OS) which has become more robust and a good platform to work on
within the enterprise.
	   ``Couple this with the fact that the application base has
migrated from being created solely for the Unix marketplace, to
also being available on the NT platform,'' Clarke said.
	   Dell, better known for its direct-selling of PCs, made its first
entry into the personal workstation market around August last year
with the release of its Workstation 400.
	   It recently introduced the Precision Workstation 410 which
houses a dual processor-capable system powered by Intel 350
megahertz and 400MHz Pentium II processors.

	   A group of senior government critics is urging President B.J.
Habibie's government to restore the good name of the late Hartono
Rekso Dharsono, a soldier and diplomat whom former president
Soeharto's regime jailed for subversion.
	   Members of Petisi 50, speaking to the media yesterday during a
gathering at the Central Jakarta residence of its leader, Lt. Gen.
(ret.) Ali Sadikin, were united in saying that Dharsono -- a
lieutenant general when he retired from the Army -- was innocent.
	   Ali said Gen. (ret.) A.H. Nasution and Lt. Gen. (ret.) Kemal
Idris, both respected Army veterans, had earlier made the call on
the present government to restore the good name of Dharsono. The
Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation (YLBHI) will lead the campaign, Ali
added.
	   ``It was no sin of Dharsono that he was arrested, tried and
jailed for 10 years for a crime he did not commit,'' Ali said at
the gathering, which was to celebrate the release of several
high-profile political prisoners, including political activists Sri
Bintang Pamungkas and Nuku Suleiman.
	   Also attending were other Petisi 50 members including
76-year-old former National Police chief Gen. (ret.) Hoegeng Iman
Santoso, former manpower minister S.K. Trimurti, 86, former mines
and energy minister H.M. Sanusi and former Atma Jaya University
lecturer Chris Siner Key Timu.
	   Ali, 72, is a former governor of Jakarta.
	   After taking part in the independence struggle of the 1940s,
Dharsono's military career peaked when he became chief of the
Bandung-based Siliwangi Regional Command in 1966-1969, during which
time he helped establish Soeharto's New Order government.
	   He served as ambassador to Thailand (1969-1972) and Cambodia
(1972-1975) and was once a secretary-general of the Association of
Southeast Asia Nations (1976-1978).
	   After retiring from public life, he became one of Soeharto's
staunchest critics. He was sent to jail in 1985 after he was
declared guilty of attempting to undermine the government, inciting
and causing unrest by taking part in the drafting of a White Paper
on the Sept. 12, 1984, Tanjung Priok riot.
	   He was freed for good behavior in 1990 after serving five years
of his jail term.
	   Dharsono died of cancer in June 1996.
	   A former student leader, Erlangga, who was convicted along with
Dharsono and jailed for six years in 1985, also testified during
the gathering yesterday that Dharsono was innocent.
	   ``In the name of Allah, I testify that Pak Ton was innocent...
and I urge the present reform government to rehabilitate his
honor.''
	   Erlangga said an ``engineered trial'' followed the Soeharto
military crackdown at the Tanjung Priok port. In the bloody
incident that ensued on Sept. 12, 1984, the government said 30
people died, but witnesses have claimed about 400 were killed.
	   Yesterday, Petisi 50 urged the government to reopen the
investigation into the Tanjung Priok incident.

	   KUCHING, Sun. - The people should adopt a new mindset to take
advantage of Sarawak's vast reserves of natural resources, Parti
Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu vice-president Datuk Abang Johari Tun
Abang Openg said.
	   He said one only had to look at the food industry to understand
the situation.
	   Despite having vast tracts of agricultural land, Sarawak, like
other States, imported billions of ringgit worth of food every
year, he said.
	   ``Take, for instance, orchid growing. Singapore, which hardly
has any land left, can still grow orchids for export to Europe.
	   ``If they can do it, why can't we when we have so much land?''
	   Abang Johari, who is also State Industrial Development Minister,
said this when opening the PBB Batu Kawa branch's delegates
conference at Kampung Sebuak Landeh, 27km from here, this morning.
	   Also present were Assistant Housing Minister Dr Abang Abdul Rauf
Abang Zen and Assistant Minister in the Chief Minister's Office
Datuk Sharifah Mordiah Tuanku Fauzi.
	   Abang Johari also said that for the State and country to become
competitive and respected members of the world community, the
people must give top priority to education.
	   On the party, he said members must always put it before self so
that it could serve the people better.
	   ``Leaders like myself, Abang Rauf and Sharifah Mordiah are not
important because we come and go.
	   ``What is important is that the party continues to remain strong
and the direction it is heading is correct.''
	   Abang Johari also stressed the need for party leaders to be
sincere.
	   PBB is the backbone of the State Barisan Nasional and will hold
its triennial general assembly from Aug 27 to 30.
	   The State BN is also made up of the Sarawak United People's
Party, Sarawak National Party and Parti Bansa Dayak Sarawak.

	   TEGAL, Central Java: At least three people died and several
houses were burned down by a fire when a train loaded with fuel oil
crashed into a steamroller crossing the railroad tracks near
Kebasen village, on the outskirts of Tegal, yesterday.
	   The bodies of the three victims, the train's driver and
assistant, and the steamroller's operator, have yet to be found, an
employee of the state-owned railway company PT Perumka said.
	   An eyewitness said two of the train's six cars blew up and burst
into flames when the train hit the steamroller.
	   Fire quickly spread to nearby buildings, a shop and several
houses, witnesses said.
	   The authorities mobilized fire trucks from the districts of
Tegal, Pekalongan and Brebes but strong winds initially made it
difficult for the fire to be extinguished, the Perumka employee
said.

Bear attacks boy trying to give him candy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A bear in a zoo attacked a 5-year-old boy who
threw the animal some candy, a news agency reported Wednesday.
	   The attack occurred at a miniature zoo in the Black Sea resort
of Gelendzhik, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The boy's mother turned away for a moment, and he threw the
candy into a cage containing two bears. When the boy tried to push
the candy closer to the animals with his foot, one of the bears
attacked him and ``snapped off his leg,'' the news agency said.

	   PENANG, Sun. - Members of the Indian community were today urged
to close ranks and contribute towards speeding up economic
recovery.
	   State MIC chairman Dr K. Rajapathy said the community needed to
be far- sighted.
	   Opening the All Malaysia Malayalee Association's 23rd annual
delegates' conference at Mar Vista Resort, he said: ``While we may
be of different faiths, we should work together.''
	   He said education was a process of which valuable elements in
the Indian culture could be retained.
	   Amma president Dr Joy Varughese, in his speech, urged Malayalees
to preserve their culture, tradition and language.
	   He suggested that Amma work with the Culture, Arts and Tourism
Ministry to promote the Malayalee culture.
	   During a pre-conference dinner yesterday, 69 Malayalees pledged
their organs in the Organ Pledge Campaign. This figure surpassed
the target of 50.
	   The campaign, one of Amma's programmes to help society, kicked
off at the dinner attended by some 150 people.

	   SUKOHARJO, Central Java: A swarm of scavengers broke down the
walls of House of Representatives Speaker Harmoko's house in Grogol
village, Sukoharjo yesterday, and ``devoured'' whatever they could.
	   The house was burned and looted on May 14 during a riot here in
which dozens of shops and cars were destroyed.
	   ``I did this because I was asked to,'' said Wakijan, one of the
scavengers. He refused to say who had instructed him to do so.
	   The scavengers took most of the metal frames in the house and
whatever valuables were left.
	   Only occasionally used by Harmoko's family, the house had not
been repaired since the riots.
	   Grogol subdistrict head Mulyadi confirmed that someone had
instructed the scavengers to ``devour'' the remains but would not
say who.

	   PALEMBANG, South Sumatra: Nineteen people died and dozens others
were hospitalized when they were trapped in a fire that razed a
shopping center and theater building in the South Sumatran capital
Monday evening.
	   The injured victims are still in intensive care at AK Gani
General Hospital in the city.
	   Two bodies, identified as Abdurachim and Rozali, were found on
Monday. They were asphyxiated after becoming trapped in the gutted
theater building.
	   Rescue workers found the other 17 bodies yesterday. Two out of
the 17 bodies were identified as Dri Kason, 33, and Sutopo, 20.
	   Rescue workers are still going through the wreckage and say that
the number of casualties could very well increase since they
estimate there were about 40 people trapped in the shopping center.
	   Local police said that the fire might have been caused by a
short circuit.
	   The municipal fire brigade deployed 14 fire trucks to extinguish
the fire which was still raging early yesterday morning. Copyright

	   PENANG, Sun. - A 27-year-old housewife today claimed that she
was cheated of RM38,000 by a used-car dealer last year.
	   Tan Swooi Swooi said the dealer, known only as ``Ah Yu'', had
failed to sell a car for her.
	   ``I only found out about it after receiving a court summons for
failing to settle a car loan totalling RM46,000 from a finance
company last month.
	   ``I thought Ah Yu had settled the loan when he had sold the
car,'' she told a Press conference held by the State Gerakan public
complaints bureau yesterday.
	   She also showed copies of her police report to reporters. Also
present was the bureau chairman Looi Swee Cheang.
	   Meanwhile, Looi urged the police and Road Transport Department
to form a joint committee to check such cases.
	   He said they should devise stringent measures for the sale of
used cars to prevent cheating by unscrupulous dealers or agents.
	   At the same Press conference, factory manager Lau Chan On
claimed that a finance company in Air Itam had failed to make
deductions after receiving payments for his car loan for two
months.
	   He said he discovered this when the finance company wanted to
repossess his vehicle for non-payment.
	   ``The finance company later claimed that it was due to human
error,'' he added.

	   KUDUS, Central Java: More than 164,000 employees of cigarette
factories in the city yesterday announced they were withdrawing
from the state social security program PT Jamsostek.
	   Mohammad As'ad, the chairman of the trade union in the tobacco,
cigarette, food and beverage sector, said here yesterday that the
workers would withdraw all the money appropriated from their
salaries for the insurance program and would establish their own
social security program.
	   ``We quit the social security insurance scheme run by PT
Jamsostek because the company's management was not transparent in
managing the workers' money,'' he said, pointing out that funds
from PT Jamsostek were used to finance the deliberations of the
controversial labor law.
	   However Jamsostek's chief representative in the city, Henry,
said that he had yet to receive any statement from the workers on
their exodus from the state insurance company.
	   ``It's their right to quit the social security program,'' he
said, as quoted by Antara.

	   MUAR, Sun. - Malaysia's political stability, abundant natural
resources and low labour cost have prompted many large corporations
in Taiwan to seek investment opportunities here.
	   Health Minister Datuk Chua Jui Meng said he met a delegation of
Taiwanese industrialists in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday. They had come
to explore business ventures.
	   ``They were greatly impressed with our political stability,
racial harmony and unity despite the current economic slowdown.
	   ``The investors toured many Asean, African and Western
countries. But they chose Malaysia.''
	   Chua said the group also explored potential in the tourism
industry here and were impressed with what Malaysia had to offer.
	   Speaking at the opening of the Zhongtian Temple today, Chua said
the Taiwanese would make good their investments.
	   Earlier, he praised the temple committee for raising about
R400,000 to buy the three-storey building within a few months in
spite of the current economic situation.
	   Chua had made a personal donation of RM10,000 to help the temple
organise computer classes for children.

	   Soeharto's half-brother Probosutedjo deplored yesterday baseless
allegations over the former president's wealth, claiming Soeharto
never used his power to enrich himself or his children.
	   The four foundations that Soeharto established were created only
to help needy people and they used legal and open ways to collect
donations from the public, he said.
	   ``The criticism is not objective. It targets only the (former
leader's) family. The results of development are not enjoyed by the
Cendana family only,'' said Probosutedjo in a media briefing held
at Soeharto's residence on Jl. Cendana in Central Jakarta.
	   Soeharto had been scheduled to hold a media briefing to answer
allegations that he had amassed his wealth illegally, but called it
off at his children's request.
	   Probosutedjo made it clear yesterday he was not speaking on
behalf of the family of the fallen leader.
	   ``The establishment of the foundations does not harm people or
the state,'' said Probosutedjo, as quoted by Antara.
	   Probosutedjo, himself a successful businessman, disclosed
Soeharto's six children planned to end their business careers and
also withdraw from politics.
	   Probosutedjo said the children conducted their businesses in
accordance with the country's laws and their wealth was much
smaller than that of other business tycoons.
	   ``If compared with Eka Tjipta Widjaja (Sinar Mas Group) and
Sjamsul Nursalim with his BDNI bank and Gajah Tunggal, they are
nothing,'' Probosutedjo said.
	   Probosutedjo believed his nephews and nieces would not object to
resigning from the People's Consultative Assembly if they were
asked to leave the country's highest legislative institution.
	   ``I think they would not mind, although I have not asked them
directly,'' Probosutedjo hinted.
	   He pointed out that he would also quit the Assembly. Copyright

Hamas denies it was part of U.S. money laundering scheme
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The Islamic militant group Hamas denied
Wednesday that it had any connection to an alleged money laundering
scheme in the United States that aimed to fund Muslim radicals.
	   U.S. authorities seized some dlrs 1.4 million in cash and
property near Chicago that allegedly was part of a money-laundering
plot which provided cash to operatives in Israel and the
Palestinian areas.
	   ``Hamas and I have no knowledge or connection whatsoever to the
money which was seized in the United States,'' said Mousa Abu
Marzook, a political strategist for Hamas.
	   ``Political motives are behind such allegations because the
Zionist lobby is pressuring American authorities to terrorize the
Palestinians and hush all political activists in the United
States,'' he said.
	   The FBI affidavit contends that Mohammed Salah, an
Arab-American, received funds from U.S. accounts controlled by Abu
Marzook, who was extradited to Jordan in 1997 following
imprisonment in the United States for violating immigration laws.
	   Abu Marzook denied that he had channeled hundred of thousands of
dollars to Salah from his U.S. bank account.
	   `These are baseless allegations,'' he said.
	   Mohammed Nazzal, Hamas representative in Jordan, said the money
seized in the United States is ``an astronomical number which
exaggerates the financial capabilities of Hamas.''

	   Indonesia will begin a five-year National Action Plan on Human
Rights later this month in an attempt to better its much maligned
international image on rights issues.
	   President B.J. Habibie will officially launch the program, to
include ratification of several United Nations' conventions, on
June 25 to coincide with the 1993 Vienna Action Plan Declaration.
	   ``We hope that we can strongly impress the world with our
sincere and strong will to move forward and protect human rights,''
Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Alatas told journalists after
meeting with Habibie at Bina Graha presidential office here
yesterday.
	   During the campaign, the government will speed up its efforts to
promote human rights awareness both among citizens and government
officials.
	   ``We will regularly ratify several conventions which we have
already signed but not ratified, including the antitorture one,''
Alatas said.
	   Indonesia has only ratified the 1948 Universal Declaration on
Human Rights. It has signed the UN Convention against Torture and
Other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, but its
ratification is still pending.
	   Two other major conventions still to be signed by Indonesia are
the International Convenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights, and the International Convenant on Civil and Political
Rights.
	   Alatas also hinted that two East Timorese who have sought refuge
at the Austrian Embassy here would not be permitted to leave for
Portugal without first facing a police investigation.
	   Nuno Vicente Pereira Saldanha and Avelino Maria Coelho da Silva
are wanted for questioning and face possible charges in relation to
bomb-making in Demak, Central Java, last year.
	   Along with Avelino's wife and his two small children, the men
entered the Austrian Embassy last September and demanded asylum in
Portugal, the former colonial power in East Timor.
	   ``Avelino and his friend, based on information and evidence we
have, were possibly involved in the manufacturing of bombs,''
Alatas said.
	   The Semarang District Court acquitted four Timorese youths
earlier this month who were facing the same charges because there
was no strong evidence they produced the bombs.
	   Alatas said Avelino and da Silva would be free to travel to
Portugal if the police investigation found them innocent.
	   Riots
	   Separately yesterday, dozens of activists from Volunteers for
Humanity and relatives of last month's riot victims visited the
National Commission on Human Rights here to urge increased pressure
for a probe into accusations the unrest was organized.
	   ``There has not been any effort from the government to reveal
who was really behind the riots,'' Rita Serena Kolibonso said
before rights body members Clementino dos Reis Amaral and B.N.
Marbun.
	   Rita, who is also coordinator of a team of lawyers for justice
(TPHKI) and executive director of women's rights group Mitra
Perempuan, criticized the government for failing to express
sympathy to next of kin of those who died.
	   Most fatalities were people trapped in blazes in shopping
centers.
	   The government has quoted a ``conservative'' figure of about 500
deaths, but the Volunteers of Humanity in a detailed report claims
1,200 people were killed.
	   Rita charged the government had summarily dismissed all those
who died as looters.
	   In a eight-page report, the group stated that many victims were
children who inadvertently became involved in the unrest.
	   ``My little brother was only there to play,'' Bambang Wahyu, 24,
said of his 14-year-old brother who died inside a burning shopping
center in Klender, East Jakarta.
	   Catholic priest Sandyawan Sumardi alleged last week that
different reports supported a common pattern on how the riots
began.
	   He cited witnesses who said they saw gangs of people arrive in
trucks and buses to foment the rioting and looting before moving on
to other areas.
	   ``This is not just an emotional conclusion but results of an
investigation which was based on information from witnesses,'' said
Palupi from the Volunteers for Humanity.

World Cup fever rises in Britain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Even before a ball was kicked Wednesday, the World
Cup was the undisputed No. 1 item on just about every British
agenda from the House of Commons in London to the Loch Ness Pub _
in Brazil.
	   With the World Cup expected to be telecast to 37 billion viewers
over the next month, Britain is clearly gripped with soccer fever.
	   The morning's front-page headlines were dominated by reports of
a riot on the Champs Elysees and a brawl between one-time England
World Cup hopeful Stan Collymore and celebrity girlfriend Ulrika
Jonsson in a Scottish pub in Paris.
	   After the game, Scotland football fans at the William Wallace
pub in London's West End said they were incredibly proud of their
team, despite a narrow 2-1 defeat to Brazil, the world champions.
	   As the final whistle blew in the small pub, jammed to the
rafters with blue-shirted supporters wearing tartan caps and waving
huge Scottish flags, the crowd burst into a deafening chorus of
Flower of Scotland.
	   In Paris a special football park just 500 metres from the main
stadium was fitted with large screen televisions for thousands of
Scottish and Brazilian supporters gathered there to watch the
match.
	   Earlier in the day, the opening World Cup match between Scotland
and Brazil took precedence over matters of state in the Commons.
	   Prime Minster Tony Blair told the chamber he hoped to ``keep an
eye on'' the game.
	   ``I'm sure the whole House joins me in wishing the Scottish and
English teams the best of luck in the World Cup,'' he said to
cheers from members of both parties.
	   The World Cup won an early mention in the Commons as Labor MP
Jim Fitzpatrick managed to squeeze a good luck message for Scotland
into a debate on housing reform.
	   His good cheer prompted a politically incorrect retort by his
colleague, Karen Buck, who suggested that all men in politics would
have only one thing on their minds for the next month.
	   Scots living in London, wearing the blue Scotland football
shirts and draped in national flags, started booking their places
early at the bars and ordering drinks in time for the kick-off.
	   Meanwhile, exiled Scots in Brazil gathered at Rio de Janeiro's
own Loch Ness pub for the long-awaited opening game.
	   The kilt-clad fans felt at home among familiar surroundings of
draped Scottish flags, posters and blue and white soccer balls.
Chef Walbercy Valentim said the menu would include some traditional
fare but definitely no haggis.
	   Back in Britain, even the Salvation Army's newspaper, The War
Cry, got in on the World Cup act, producing the front page headline
``Hod's Squad'' _ referring to England coach Glenn Hoddle's side.
	   The back page remained soccer free but the front page was
devoted to the England team, likening the squad to the final 12
apostles chosen by Jesus.
	   The War Cry editor Captain Charles King said every week he
focused on whatever people were talking about and clearly this week
it was the World Cup.
	   In Glasgow, the World Cup caused a mass exodus from work places
as hordes of people converged on the city center before kick-off.
Others made straight for the nearest pubs to claim a vantage point
in front of TV screens beaming the game from Paris.
	   Chancellor Gordon Brown, a Scotsman, ensured the government was
represented officially at the game, travelling at his own expense
to take advantage of a ticket offered by French Finance Minister
Dominique Strauss-Kahn.
	   Brown joked that Ms. Strauss-Kahn had threatened to hand the
ticket to Brazil's Finance Minister if he did not take it up.
	   Soccer fans who were stuck at Heathrow Airport, away from a more
preferred viewing venue, got a sneak glimpse of the World Cup and
the future of television.
	   In the first public demonstration of digital TV, passengers were
able to watch the tournament kick-off on special wide-screen
televisions at the airport.
	   However, not everybody was happy about the British public's
obsession with the World Cup.
	   Leading economist Maurice Fitzpatrick, of accountancy firm
Chantrey Vellacott, said businesses stood to lose out this month
because of workers leaving their posts to watch soccer.
	   He estimated the World Cup could cost bosses more than 1 billion
pounds (dlrs 1.64 billion), as the economy sacrificed one-third of
day's output over the month.
	   Fitzpatrick said that figure could increase drastically if
England and Scotland go through to the second round.
	   The music industry was also caught up in a World Cup it can't
ignore.
	   World Cup songs could score a hat-trick at the top of the charts
in Europe _ and Three Lions '98 is leading the field.
	   The Baddiel, Skinner and Lightning Seeds song sold 98,000 copies
during the first two days of sales, 20,000 more than its closest
rival Vindaloo by Fat Les.
	   And predictions are that Dario G's Carnaval De Paris _ based on
a European terrace chant _ will enter the charts at No. 3 on
Sunday.

	   MY daughter was accepted into one of the teachers' training
colleges on a B.Ed (TESL) twinning programme which involves
spending two years out of a six-year course in United Kingdom.
	   However, due to the economic downturn she and her friends have
been informed that they will not be going to UK to continue with
their course.
	   My daughter was very disappointed by this news but what made her
more upset was the thought of staying on in her college for the
rest of her course.
	   During a meeting with the college authorities, my daughter and
her coursemates were not able to get any definite answers to their
questions.
	   No one could tell them when they had to return for the next
academic term.
	   They were also not told what curriculum they will be studying.
	   I have high regard for local educational institutions. However,
having been to her college, I can say that it is not fit to be a
campus for a degree programme. The classrooms and other facilities
are worse than some secondary schools.
	   I rang the college many times but no one could confirm when my
daughter should return for her new term.
	   Firstly, I would like to know if she is still getting a UK
degree? If she is, is there any way of allowing her to go even for
six months to UK to experience the immersion of the English
language/culture?
	   Secondly, if she is not getting a UK degree could I then
withdraw her from her college and send her to UK on my own?
	   Will a penalty be imposed by the Education Ministry's
scholarship department? Could the scholarship department clarify
this situation as their offer letter promised my daughter a UK
degree.
	   My daughter and her course mates are totally demoralised. I
think the authorities should clarify the matter.

	   The National Commission on Human Rights recommended yesterday
that the police be separated from the Armed Forces so it could be
independent and be in a better position to serve and protect the
public.
	   The rights body told the House of Representatives' Commission I
for defense and security, foreign affairs, information and legal
affairs, that the police should no longer be the ``political tool''
of the government and the Armed Forces (ABRI).
	   ``People everywhere demand that their police be really
professional in serving and protecting the public, instead of being
a mere security tool of the power holder,'' said commission member
Satjipto Rahardjo.
	   Satjipto was accompanied by his colleagues Marzuki Darusman,
Baharuddin Lopa, Clementino dos Reis Amaral, Koesparmono Irsan,
Albert Hasibuan and B.N. Marbun.
	   Satjipto, who is a law professor at Diponegoro University in
Semarang, Central Java, said the police must now end their
militaryesque way of handling problems.
	   He said out the police should follow a doctrine that is entirely
different from that of the military.
	   ``The military's doctrine is to crush enemies while the police's
should be to protect and serve the public,'' Satjipto said. ``The
police will never become professional unless it follows its own
doctrine.''
	   Satjipto criticized the police academy for not conducting a
``genuine police education,'' saying it stresses military doctrines
more than a police doctrine.
	   Satjipto therefore said the police should be given rights to
design their own education programs.
	   He recounted how he was once told by a police cadet that the
latter was only taught to slap people's faces during the first year
in the academy.
	   The police should now be freed from all interference from the
government and the Armed Forces, he said, and called on both
parties to stop ``meddling'' in police affairs.
	   Koesparmono said the police should develop three basic
principles: fighting crime, keeping people out of jail and loving
humanity.
	   ``Good police must be able to keep people out of jail, not put
as many people as they can into jail,'' Koesparmono, a retired
two-star police general, said.
	   Under the current system, the police are incorporated into ABRI
along with the Army, Navy and Air Force.
	   The police have found themselves on the receiving end of
increasingly strong criticism, particularly over their way of
handling unrest and rioting.
	   Given their position as the first layer of security, police have
often been involved in clashes with civilian demonstrators over
many issues over the past three years.
	   Eighteen members of the Jakarta Police force are currently
facing a court martial for their alleged involvement in the fatal
shootings of four Trisakti University's students on May 12 which
led to widespread riots in Jakarta. Almost 1,200 people were killed
in the unrest that also caused Rp 2.5 trillion (US$216 million) in
material losses.
	   The National Commission on Human Rights, however, said the
police were not using live ammunition during the incident.
	   Lawyers representing the police also believe that the police
have been made a scapegoat by other parties.
	   The commission also told the hearing presided over by Aisyah
Aminy that a rally bill being prepared by the House should be
drafted in the spirit of freedom of expression.
	   ``There must be one clause which stipulates that the police's
role in a rally is only to facilitate the protesters,'' Marzuki
said.
	   Marzuki also called on the House and the government to keep in
their minds that now, in the reform era, laws must be established
in order to limit the power of the government.
	   In the past, he said, ``laws were drafted only to perpetuate the
power of the government

	   The Attorney General's Office and the Development Finance
Comptroller (BPKP) will conduct legal and financial audits of
contracts between the state oil and gas company Pertamina and
companies linked to former president Soeharto's family and cronies.
	   The House of Representatives's Commission V for industry,
mining, trade, manpower, cooperatives and the environment and
Minister of Mines and Energy Kuntoro Mangkusubroto agreed yesterday
on the urgent need for an overall audit of all of Pertamina's
contracts.
	   ``The audit is to ascertain if the contracts were made through
illegal practices,'' the House commission's chief, Marzuki Achmad,
said.
	   Documents produced by the commission show there are at least 149
companies linked to Soeharto's family and cronies which are
involved in Pertamina's operations in the oil and natural gas
industry.
	   The documents disclose that the Soeharto family dominates the
shipping of liquefied natural gas (LNG), crude oil and fuel, gas
pipeline network development, geothermal power and the development
of refineries and many other aspects of the hydrocarbon sector.
	   One of the companies discussed in the hearing was PT Transjava
Pipeline, which is 49 percent owned by Soeharto's son Bambang
Trihatmodjo, 28 percent by PT Tranaco, 10 percent by Pertamina's
pension fund, 10 percent by the pension fund of PT Perusahaan
Listrik Negara (PLN) and 5 percent by PT Adhi Raksa Tama.
	   The company has developed a gas pipeline to channel natural gas
from the gas field in Kangean, Madura to the fertilizer plant and
PLN's power plant in Tuban and Gresik, East Java.
	   Pertamina has been using the pipeline under a 20-year building,
operation and transfer contract at the cost of 72 U.S. cents per
million British thermal units (MMBTU).
	   Golkar Legislator Priyo Budi Santoso estimated that the company
received US$42 million per month in fees.
	   He said the fees were too expensive and alleged that Transjava
had marked up its investment in the pipelines on which the
expensive fees had been based.
	   ``The price of gas for PLN could be reduced if the pipeline
lease fee is cut,'' Priyo said.
	   The hearing also touched on the latest move by state electricity
company PLN to unilaterally annul its power purchase contract with
PT Cikarang Listrindo after the latter refused to renegotiate the
contract.
	   PLN president Djiteng Marsudi earlier indicated that the company
was likely to take a similar move against other independent power
producers (IPPs) which refused to renegotiate their contracts.
	   Marzuki said the House supported PLN's plan to void all
contracts which placed excessive financial burdens on PLN.
	   But, he said, in case an outright annulment was impossible, PLN
should renegotiate with the IPPs on the contractual terms,
including power prices, to alleviate PLN's financial problems due
to the monetary crisis.
	   Kuntoro, however, expressed concern over PLN's unilateral
termination of the contract.
	   But he said he would not intervene because PLN, like most other
state companies, had been put under the supervision of the office
of the State Minister for the Empowerment of State Companies.
	   ``It's up to PLN (how to treat its contracts). As for other
contracts under the Ministry of Mines and Energy, I have stated
that all the contracts will be honored,'' Kuntoro said.
	   The commission and Kuntoro also agreed yesterday to ask the
Attorney General's Office to investigate alleged corruption at
Pertamina's refinery in Balongan, West Java, which has often
stopped operations due to alleged technical problems.
	   Golkar legislator Djusril Djusan said he had complete data
showing that several officials and Pertamina executives had marked
up the price of the construction of the refinery to $2.4 billion
from a normal cost of less than $1.6 billion.
	   ``In comparison, in San Francisco where workers and equipment
are more expensive than in Indonesia, a refinery with the same
capacity of Balongan costs only $1.6 billion,'' Djusril said.
	   The Balongan refinery has a processing capacity of 125,000
barrels per day of crude oil.
	   Djusril said the attorney general should investigate the
officials responsible for overseeing the project, including then
minister of mines and energy Ginandjar Kartasasmita, then minister
of finance J.B. Sumarlin and then Pertamina president Faisal
Abda'oe.
	   The Balongan refinery was constructed by a group of contractors,
including Japan's JGC Corporation, Foster Wheeler of the United
States and the Far East Trading Corp., an affiliate of Pertamina.
The construction of the refinery started in 1990.

	   The second session of the court-martial of two police officers
involved in the Trisakti shooting incident ended in tension
yesterday after prosecutors ignored a defense request to respond to
the prosecutor's statement.
	   The hearing began at 9 a.m. sharp with the prosecutors response
to the call made by the defense team during the first hearing on
Saturday for all charges to be dropped because it was known that
the defendants did not kill the students and were being used to
shield those responsible.
	   For the prosecution, Col. Sardji Purwono and Capt. Bambang Ari
Wibowo said the suggestion was absurd.
	   ``The defense plea is an attempt by their lawyers to discredit
the prosecution. It is not true that we engineered this trial,''
Sardji said.
	   ``What is more important is that we serve justice in the
military high court. It is not true that we want to mislead the
public, fuel student outrage or use innocent officers as
scapegoats,'' he told the court.
	   The significant differences found by lawyers in the indictment
read out by prosecutors and the copies later distributed to defense
lawyers during Saturday's session were merely ``wording mistakes'',
Sardji added.
	   In the version of their case which prosecutors read out to the
court they said that ``the police used tear gas and flame-throwers
to disperse the crowd,'' however, in the version distributed to
defense lawyers flame-throwers had been changed to water cannons.
	   After the prosecutor's statement, presiding judge Col. Sudji
Suradi adjourned the trial of company commander First Lt. Agus Tri
Heryanto, 29, and platoon leader Second Lt. Pariyo, 38, both from
Jakarta Police mobile brigade unit until Friday at 9 a.m.
	   The judges ignored a request by defense lawyers, led by Adnan
Buyung Nasution, to reply to the prosecutor's statement.
	   Sudji said: ``You cannot reply now. You must wait until the next
appeal session after Friday's hearing.''
	   Law No. 31/1997 Article 145 on military high courts states that
the judge can adjourn the trial after both lawyers and prosecutors
have stated their case, he said.
	   ``The defense team stated its position on Saturday. Now the
military prosecutor has responded. It is now therefore time for the
judges to adjourn the hearing,'' Sudji said.
	   Adnan voiced his disappointment at the decision.
	   ``What can we do if the court will not give us a chance to argue
our case. This is against the universal law,'' Adnan told the court
to cheers from the public gallery.
	   After the trial, Adnan told reporters that the trial was unfair.
	   ``This court is in ruin! This trial is no longer objective or
fair. It has been engineered.''
	   He also condemned the intimidation and threats which he has
received since taking the case.
	   ``My family and I have been put under pressure. We have been
threatened over the phone. Even Adi Andojo (dean of the Trisakti
University faculty of law) accused me of being a traitor. But I
tell you this. I'll never give up. Never.''
	   ``This case is not only about setting the defendants free. It is
about creating a better justice of system here. It's time for us to
ditch our rotten system.''
	   Head of the Armed Forces Law Department/General Prosecutor Maj.
Gen. Andi M. Ghalib denied the lawyers claims at a media conference
later yesterday.
	   ``You have to remember that the officers are charged under
Article 103, not Article 338 (for murder). We are putting field
commanders on trial for their failure to control the situation, not
for shooting the students.
	   Adnan rejected Andi's argument and questioned why only the
mobile brigade had put their men or trial, not any of the other
three units on duty at the demonstration that day.
	   Four students were killed and many more injured when security
forces opened fire on demonstrators at Trisakti University in
Grogol, West Jakarta, on May 12. The incident sparked massive riots
and a political chain reaction which eventually lead to the demise
of president Soeharto.
	   The two officers have been charged with indiscipline under
Article 103 of the Military Penal Court. They face a maximum
sentence of two years and four months in prison. There are a total
of 18 suspects in the case.
	   In a related development, Jakarta Military Police Commander Col.
Hendardji told The Jakarta Post yesterday said that the suspects'
superior officers had refused to submit the 21 weapons allegedly
used in the shooting to his office.
	   ``We have to match the bullet taken recently from one of the
victim's bodies with the gun that fired it,'' he said.
	   Hendardji strongly believed that ``at least one of the suspects
fired on the students

	   PENANG, Sun. - All Government hospitals and clinics in the State
have taken to dispensing a maximum of one-month supply of
medication to patients on long-term therapy to cut wastage and
costs.
	   State medical and health services director, Dr Shafie Ooyub
defended the move today, saying that it was not intended to
inconvenience the public.
	   ``Our main objective is to prevent wastage of medicine
particularly in the face of the economic downturn,'' he told the
New Straits Times.
	   He added that as any medicine kept too long would go to waste,
it was pointless to give patients excessive amounts.
	   ``If we continue giving out large quantities of medication like
three months supply for a patient, we would need to buy and keep
more stocks ourselves, and this would raise our costs.''
	   ``We have also come across patients who stop taking medication
given to them after a while, once the symptoms disappear.
	   ``Imagine the wastage if we were to have supplied him with three
month's supply medicine and he stops taking them after just a
month,'' he said.
	   He added that there were also patients who lost or misplaced
their medication and would return to the hospital after a while to
ask for fresh supplies.

Pan-African leaders search for role amid conflict, coups
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GLENN McKENZIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Conceived as a renaissance of
African peace and prosperity, a pan-African heads of state summit
ended Wednesday in the shadow of deadly border fighting, an
attempted coup and political uncertainty in Nigeria.
	   The annual three-day summit of the 54-member Organization of
African Unity, billed by hosts Burkina Faso as a forum for change,
focused instead on averting upheaval on Africa's eastern and
western tips.
	   Measures introduced by the 29 African leaders in a short closing
ceremony in Burkina Faso's dusty capital included sending a peace
mission to conflict-torn Eritrea and Ethiopia, and verbal
condemnation of a rebel uprising in Guinea Bissau.
	   Leaders also pledged to dramatically transform the 34-year-old
pan-African body to prevent it from becoming irrelevant in the
modern age, said Burkina Faso President Blaise Campaore, the OAU's
new chairman.
	   He did not describe the restructuring plan except to say that
the OAU's conflict resolution wing would be strengthened.
	   Salim Salim, secretary general of the continent's largest
political body, conceded the OAU was powerless to prevent its
member states from waging war _ even in Ethiopia, where the OAU is
headquartered.
	   ``We have to be modest,'' Salim said. ``Just because we adopt
resolutions (sending a peace mission to Ethiopia and Eritrea)
doesn't mean the two countries will respect them. It is up to the
parties to end hostilities.''
	   Critics argue that the organization, formed to build alliances
during the height of Cold War tensions and apartheid oppression,
has lost its teeth in an era when friends are found _ and wars
waged _ along nationalist, ethnic and economic lines.
	   OAU leaders delayed responding to Monday's death of Nigeria's
Gen. Sani Abacha, who summarily jailed, killed and tortured
thousands in his own country but helped end oppression in
neighboring West African states.
	   The reason, according to some analysts, is that the Nigerian
dictator accomplished peacekeeping feats that the OAU lacked the
will to initiate or bankroll.
	   Under Abacha's leadership, a West African intervention force was
created to keep peace in Liberia and oust junta forces in
neighboring Sierra Leone, both measures the OAU could neither
afford or agree upon.
	   In the end, muted condolences were proffered by OAU secretary
general Salim to Abacha's family and the Nigerian people. Many
other state leaders remained silent.
	   ``The OAU owes a debt of gratitude to Abacha for solving
problems that they did not,'' said a Western diplomat, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   The pan-African grouping will remain a weak cousin to the
world's other regional bodies as long as it shirks from invoking
harsh measures on its own members, some critics say.
	   Despite threatened sanctions against non-paying member states,
the OAU is saddled with huge arrears equal to its own budget,
according to Salim, who did not give figures.
	   And there are other ironies. Republic of Congo President Denis
Sassou-Nguesso, a former Marxist dictator who overthrew the elected
government of Pascal Lissouba last May in a bloody civil war that
killed 10,000, represented the OAU leaders in issuing a plea for
peace Wednesday in Ethiopia, Eritrea and elsewhere in the
continent.
	   Just a year ago, the OAU condemned Sassou-Nguesso for
overthrowing a legitimate government.

	   The debris around many of the buildings damaged during last
month's riots has been cleaned up and business is slowly
restarting.
	   But for most of the women raped between May 13 and May 15 just
facing up to the fact that they are still alive is an almost
unbearable burden.
	   ``For the victims, death would have been better than anything
else,'' Ita F. Nadia, chairwomen of Kalyanamitra, a women's
organization, told The Jakarta Post on Monday evening.
	   The women, mostly Chinese-Indonesians, have been deeply
traumatized, Ita said.
	   ``Their experiences have cast a shadow over every second of
their lives and tears falling from their mournful eyes are
unstoppable,'' she said.
	   ``They're scared and fear sleep because of the nightmares which
it brings.''
	   Ita believes that the people who raped and sexually abused women
during last month's riots were ``so brutal, inhumane and heartless
that they do not deserve the life which they have been given.''
	   ``They violated not only the victims' human rights, but also
their right to live'' she said tensely.
	   ``Tell me, what kind of human beings are evil enough to rape a
12-year-old girl in front of her helpless parents?,'' Ita asked.
	   ``They're incredibly cruel and brutal,'' she said.
	   Kalyanamitra are trying to persuade the girl's parents to allow
them to help banish the horror of the attack and help the little
girl to slowly rebuild her childhood, Ita said.
	   Some of the attacks even went beyond rape and abuse, she added.
	   ``A man told us that his wife's attackers mutilated her genitals
with a razor blade after first raping her,'' Ita said.
	   Another man visited the organization a few days earlier to tell
them about the tragic death of his two sisters, Ita recounted.
	   He told how his two teenage sisters were raped by at least seven
people. The gang then threw them into the fire which they had
started in their family home, Ita said.
	   He was rescued by his neighbors, who tried to extinguish the
blaze.
	   A housewife, also a Chinese-Indonesian, was brutally harassed
and raped before being left alone by her assailants in her burning
house, her relatives told Kalyanamitra.
	   ``The woman finally decided to commit suicide,'' Ita said.
	   One young woman had a lucky escape after her taxi was stopped by
a mob in the middle of the night of May 14. She was forced out of
her taxi and undressed in front of the crowd, she said.
	   ``Then a man pushed through the crowd, pulled me out and gave me
Moslem clothes to wear,'' the woman recalled.
	   The terror and confusion of the attacks has made it nearly
impossible for the victims and their relatives to accurately
describe their attackers. Investigations have been further hampered
by the state of anarchy which reigned at the time which has made it
almost impossible to confirm the actions and whereabouts of any
suspected rapists.
	   ``But all of the victims are sure that they have never met their
attackers before,'' she said.
	   Ita said the organization had received many more telephone calls
from women recounting horrifying tales of abuse and brutality.
	   Many women had refused to meet staff from the organization
directly, she said.
	   ``We have to be patient and fully understand their feelings, we
are here when they are ready,'' Ita said.
	   The organization is treating all calls and approaches for help
in strict anonymity.

	   HAVING good rapport with both the younger and older
constituents, two-term Lubok Merbau assemblyman Jamal Nasir Rasdi
is able to envision a better future for the people he represents.
	   At 39, he is still considered young in politics but his past and
present involvement in the local and national political arena makes
him a leader with vast experience and a rising star.
	   Being a youth leader, he has strong support from the younger
constituents. The older constituents also seem to approve this
father of four.
	   Apart from commitments to his family, Jamal Nasir always has
time to listen to the problems faced by his constituents. He sees
them at his service centre, located in Kuala Kangsar, his house in
Kampung Kroh Hulu, Padang Renggas and any other possible place.
	   Jamal Nasir has big plans for some 60,000 Lubok Merbau
constituents who are mostly involved in agriculture-related
activities.
	   Several co-operatives are setting up a consortium which will
play a pivotal role in economic activities within the constituency.
	   ``The co-operatives will pool their resources and work together
through the proposed consortium to improve the quality of life of
the people of Lubok Merbau,'' he said.
	   Another major task which Jamal Nasir has been working on is to
ensure the younger constituents are properly educated, up to the
highest possible levels.
	   ``My only hope is to see more young people pursue higher
education so that they are better prepared to face future
challenges,'' he said.
	   He foresees significant progress within the next 10 years for
the area though it is still underdeveloped now.
	   He said plans to open a four hectare site there for small and
medium industries are already taking shape.
	   The industrial estate which is expected to create 10,000 jobs
for the locals will be a catalyst for other development and spur
growth of Lubok Merbau as a new development centre.
	   There will also be more economic activities when the Grik-Kuala
Kangsar highway opens.
	   However, Jamal Nasir noted concerns about the effects of future
physical development on the people.
	   ``We are trying to balance it with human and spiritual
development by setting up a Sekolah Agama Rakyat in every village
to provide religious education,'' he said.

	   About 100 Irianese staged a peaceful demonstration at City Hall
yesterday to protest a statement by Governor Sutiyoso that he would
expel them from their Tanah Abang dormitory in Central Jakarta
because of their repeated clashes with neighboring Betawi (native
Jakartans).
	   One of the protesters, Ones Dom, criticized Sutiyoso's remarks
which he said labeled Irianese living at the dormitory as hoodlums
who had to be driven away.
	   ``The dormitory has a deep historical meaning for us. It was a
gift from former president Sukarno in 1964 after Indonesia
successfully won its struggle over Irian Jaya in 1963,'' he said.
	   Ones said the complex was built in 1962 and was given to the
Irianese people on Sept. 17, 1964 during an official ceremony led
by then minister of agriculture Brig. Gen. Soetjipto.
	   Hundreds of Irianese have lived in the 8,200-square-meter
dormitory complex ever since. At least 200 families currently live
there.
	   He said he was shocked by reports in several local newspapers
and private television news broadcasts that Sutiyoso would force
the Irianese out of the dormitory in order to prevent new clashes
with other local residents.
	   Another protester, Erni Warady, expressed concern over the media
reports.
	   ``The local residents have always portrayed us as bad people and
troublemakers,'' she said.
	   ``Nobody cares about how the Betawi people have insulted us all
the time, how they spread propaganda against us by calling us dogs
and throw stones at our complex from the other side of the wall,''
she added.
	   Erni said her son, Tholon, 15, was injured by several Betawi
youths as he walked home after school a day prior to a major clash
on May 4.
	   ``He almost lost his arm because the bone was fractured in the
attack. You know, it was their attack on Tholon which made us all
angry and led to the clash.
	   ``But who cares about that? Nobody. Nobody in the media asked us
our version of the clash. They only covered what the Betawi and the
officials told them.''
	   Central Jakarta Mayor Andi Subur said yesterday that the
Irianese, especially the youth, had often been involved in quarrels
with their Betawi neighbors.
	   Some efforts have been made to solve the disputes, including the
establishment of a joint night watch program between the two ethnic
groups, but there have been no results thus far, he said.
	   Andi was speaking to reporters after a closed meeting between
Sutiyoso and five representatives of the Irianese community.
	   ``We plan to hold a peaceful discussion between the two ethnic
groups to settle the feud,'' said Andi.
	   Andi said Sutiyoso had never planned to expel the Irianese from
the dormitory complex.
	   ``There is no such plan to relocate the Irianese. We never treat
any ethnic group differently. The Irianese can stay in their
dormitory,'' he said.
	   One of the five representatives, Nico, told reporters that
Sutiyoso promised to take good care of the Irianese community and
that he had never said anything about forcing them from the
dormitory.
	   ``The governor told us that all the newspaper reports were just
made up by the reporters themselves. That it was not what he told
them,'' said Nico.
	   ``The governor said he would ask his staff to check on the
publications,'' he added.
	   Some of the Irianese, however, reportedly saw and heard
Sutiyoso's statement on a private television channel.
	   ``We accept Sutiyoso's explanation and correction. But if there
is proof that he really said that on television, then he should
bear the responsibility,'' he said.

	   KOTA KINABALU, Sun. - Parti Bersekutu said it will establish
consultative councils for all ministries to evaluate government
policies and programmes if the party forms the next State
Government.
	   The party's acting president, Datuk Harris Mohd Salleh, said in
a statement that this was decided at the party's chief
co-ordinators' meeting held at the Balung River Resort in Tawau,
yesterday.
	   He said the councils would complement the efforts of government
officials by providing input from the private sector, and would be
chaired by the respective ministers.
	   ``These bodies will be similar to those set up by the Federal
Government on ad hoc basis such as groups invited for pre-Budget
dialogue sessions,''
	   Harris added.
	   He said one of the main tasks would be to collate views from the
people, especially from the target groups, to determine the
effectiveness of the policies and programmes, and submit proposals
to the Government on behalf of the private sector.

	   A group of Rancamaya village residents here staged a protest
Monday to vent their opposition against the existence of a garbage
dump 200 meters away from their residential area.
	   Usep, the protesters' spokesman, said the residents wanted the
mayoralty to close down the garbage dump because it spoiled their
environment.
	   ``You can see here. Trash and flies are scattered everywhere,''
he said.
	   Usep said that when the mayoralty originally cleared the land,
it told residents that the site would be used for a housing
complex.
	   When the residents discovered that the land would be used as a
garbage dump, they informed officials of their opposition to the
plan, he said. ``The mayoralty's answer was that the garbage dump
would be well managed.''
	   Responding to the residents' opposition, however, the head of
the mayoralty's garden and sanitary office, Memet Sudarman, said
the protest was illogical. It would only worsen the city's garbage
problems if the dump were removed, he said.
	   ``We will improve the management of the dump,'' was the only
answer Memet offered.
	   The 9.21-hectare garbage dump has been operating over the last
eight months.
	   A scavenger was reportedly buried in huge piles of garbage
during a heavy rain Saturday. The man, identified as Usup, has yet
to be found.

Albanians halt Pristina rallies amid apparent lull in fighting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS and UPDATES with Albanians ending daily protests
in Pristina, Albanian professors reported beaten, Serbian ruling
party's statement, Serbs bringing in fresh reinforcements in
Kosovo, edits throughout. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Organizers of a protest in this
Kosovo capital, in which some 20,000 Albanians took part Wednesday,
decided to stop their daily rallies amid an apparent lull in
fighting.
	   The protesters fervently chanted ``U-C-K,'' the Albanian
language acronym for the Kosovo Liberation Army _ a militant
organization fighting to wrest the southern province away from
Serbia _ and sang a popular Albanian song, praising their ethnic
leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Groups of protesters leaving the rally _ the 60th consecutive
demonstration _ got into a stone-throwing scuffle near the
university with Serbs. Police intervened and dispersed the
protesters. Organizers later said they would stop ``this form of
protest.
	   Also on Wednesday, police burst into a meeting of the
underground Albanian-only university in Pristina, beating 24
professors and one student who were there, the pro-Albanian Kosovo
Information Center said. Six professors were seriously injured.
	   More than 250 people have died in escalating clashes in Kosovo
between Yugoslav troops and ethnic Albanian militants that began in
early March.
	   No further violence was reported early Wednesday elsewhere in
the province, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
Kosovo's restive Albanian majority seeks independence from Serbia,
which stripped its autonomy in 1989 and has since ruled the
province with a heavy military and police presence.
	   Political observers in Pristina said that Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic apparently has decided to somewhat ease the
situation in Kosovo in view of growing international resolve not to
let the fighting escalate into a new Balkan war.
	   A statement issued after Milosevic presided over a leadership
meeting of his ruling Socialist Party said that the party
``supports measures taken by the state bodies aimed at normalizing
the situation'' in Kosovo.
	   The party, as reported by the state news agency Tanjug, also
stressed the need for ``organized efforts to decrease tensions and
take measures that would restore confidence between members of
different ethnic communities in Kosovo.'' But it warned that
``terrorists'' would be ``decisively'' confronted.
	   Meanwhile, the Kosovo information Center said government forces
had brought in reinforcements in southwestern Kosovo, near the town
of Djakovica, where Albanians spotted ten buses with troops, seven
trucks and six armored vehicles.
	   The center also said a group of Kosovo Albanian parties appealed
to the U.N. Security Council, saying military actions by NATO are
``urgently needed'' in Kosovo because economic sanctions against
Serbia are not enough.
	   Chased by the fighting, thousands of Kosovo Albanian refugees
have trekked on perilous mountain paths into northern Albania.
	   Mans Nyberg, a U.N. refugee official, said Wednesday in Belgrade
the total refugee number in Albania was estimated at about 12,000.
	   An additional 10,000 were earlier reported to have fled to the
neighboring republic of Montenegro, which together with Serbia
makes up Yugoslavia. Nyberg said the number of 5,200.
	   Nyberg said the number of Kosovo people displaced within the
province was estimated at 42,000. A Kosovo-based human rights
organization earlier put the total at 50,000.
	   But the refugee situation has become more complex, with some
2,000 Serbs and Montenegrins fleeing Kosovo to find shelter in
Montenegro and several hundred Gypsies, or Roma, were said to have
fled Kosovo to central Serbia due to threats from ethnic Albanians
who consider them loyal to the Serbian government.
	   Meanwhile, Rugopva, the moderate Albanian leader, went to Paris
and London to attend meetings of the Contact Group nations, which
monitor developments in the former Yugoslavia, and seek help for
his people.

Korda beaten, Krajicek advances at Gerry Weber Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS Korda QUOTES about his sickness &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HALLE, Germany (AP) _ Top-seeded Petr Korda was upset in
straight sets Wednesday at the Gerry Weber Open, while Richard
Krajicek sailed into the quarterfinals behind his big serve.
	   Paul Haarhuis of the Netherlands beat the Czech player, still
slowed by a flu, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 at the dlrs 875,000 grass
tuneup for Wimbledon.
	   Krajicek, the 1996 Wimbledon champion and No. 3 seed, downed
German Davis Cup player Tommy Haas, 3-6, 6-4, 6-1 in just one hour,
27 minutes.
	   Korda said the weakness he still felt from his sickness, where
he was bed-ridden, drained his confidence heading into Wimbledon on
June 22.
	   ``I lack confidence in my body. It's going to take time to come
back to a high level,'' said Korda, the world's third-ranked
player.
	   ``But what could I do against Haarhuis _ everything he did
turned to gold,'' added the visibly disappointed Korda.
	   Last year, Korda started his comeback from a long groin injury
by reaching the event's final. Afterwards he pushed Pete Sampras to
five sets in a fourth-round Wimbledon match, then swept the title
at this year's Australian Open.
	   Haas, a 20-year-old German Davis Cup player, lost control of the
match against Krajicek after he twice failed to break the Dutch
player's serve in the second set.
	   After that he was worn down by the punishing serve of Krajicek,
who blasted 987 aces last year, and his greater experience on
grass.
	   The event has five top 10 players, with French Open champion
Carlos Moya of Spain and defending champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov of
Russia scheduled to play Thursday.
	   Italy's Gianluca Pozzi also beat Australia's Richard Fromberg,
6-1, 7-6 (7-1) and Sweden's Magnus Larsson routed Scott Campbell of
the United States, 6-0, 6-3.

 &UR; Report: Nazi sympathizers flourished in Switzerland &QL; 
 &UR; By RAYNER PIKE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A report picturing Switzerland as a place where
anti-Semites and Nazi sympathizers enjoyed strength and influence
during most of World War II was issued Wednesday by the Simon
Wiesenthal Center.
	   The 128-page report, based on material from Swiss archives,
concluded that probably no other country in Europe had a larger
proportion of right-wing extremists than the neutral nation of 4
million.
	   It was formally released at a news conference in New York
Wednesday.
	   The report, ``Survey of Nazi and Pro-Nazi Groups in Switzerland,
1930-1945,'' said the most damning document showed Switzerland's
justice minister, Eduard von Steiger, promising an anti-Semitic
organization at the height of World War II that Swiss borders would
be sealed more tightly against Jews.
	   Von Steiger also told the head of the Swiss Fatherland
Association that he would hold in confidence the association's
recommendation against increasing Jewish influence in Switzerland,
according to a memorandum of a meeting on Oct. 17, 1942, the report
said.
	   ``We intend to reduce fundamentally'' the flow of Jewish
refugees, the report quotes von Steiger as saying.
	   The Swiss maintained they were restricting the flow of refugees
from Nazi-controlled neighboring countries on political and
economic grounds.
	   Even so, the tiny country gave shelter to 27,000 Jewish refugees
during the war, more than the United States, the Swiss government
said in a rebuttal issued through its consulate.
	   Rolf Bloch, head of the Swiss Confederation of Hebrew
Congregations, said in Bern that Switzerland's treatment of some
Jewish refugees was ``a dark chapter,'' but added that the report
appeared to be ``one-sided and exaggerated.''
	   Thomas Borer, head of the Swiss task force reexamining the
country's past, called the report ``absurd and wrong.''
	   Rabbi Marvin Hier, the dean of the Los Angeles-based Wiesenthal
Center, said, ``This is not about the Swiss people, nor is it about
the Swiss government of today. It's about righting a wrong, it's
about making public documents that have for too long remained
dormant.''
	   Hier also promised more such reports targeting other
governments.
	   ``Switzerland is not the only country with a problem of hanging
on to documents,'' he said, ``Everyone knows the Vatican has that
problem, the French have it, the United States has problems with
archives that we can't get a hold of, that are secret after 50
years.''
	   The report's author, historian Alan Morris Schom, said ``a clear
pattern of hatred of Jews'' was evidenced in Switzerland during the
Hitler era, with numerous references to ``stinking Jews'' and ``pig
Jews'' appearing in print.
	   Last January, the center, named after the famed Nazi hunter,
released another report by Schom accusing the Swiss of running
camps where Jewish refugees were used as slave labor and told they
would be handed over to Germany's Gestapo if they complained.
	   Switzerland conceded that some camp commanders had treated
refugees badly, but prominent Swiss Jews and a number of Jews who
lived in the camps said by and large Switzerland was a safe haven
for many on a hostile continent.

	   TALHA ISMAIL is very much a seasoned politician. With more than
30 years in politics, this former headmaster is an inspiration for
young and upcoming politicians.
	   Being a full-time politician, Talha, 62, always makes himself
available to his constituents of 16,000.
	   If he has no other appointment outside Lenggong, his daily
routine will be a trip to the Chenderoh Umno division office in
Lenggong town, a short distance away from his house in Kampung
Gelok.
	   There village headmen, community leaders and the other kampung
folk will come to seek assistance and advice from this two- term
assemblyman.
	   At times, informal meetings take place at a Thai food restaurant
located on the ground floor of the Umno office. The restaurant is
another favourite place where the constituents meet their
representative.
	   Talha said in general, he was satisfied with the development
that had taken place in his constituency.
	   All households in Lenggong have electricity and clean water
supply while roads, health and other social facilities are of
comfortable standards.
	   ``There are however a few sectors which can be further promoted
like tourism, considering Lenggong has been blessed with a
colourful historical past and endowed with natural beauty.
	   ``The discovery of the `Perak Man', pre-historic discoveries,
the Chenderoh and smaller lakes as well as beautiful limestone
hills, are all potential tourist attractions,'' he said. A 3.2ha
site has been allocated for an archaeological museum at Kota
Tampan.
	   Talha would like to have a secondary religious school in the
area, a vital facility, he said, considering the increasing number
of parents who want to see their children pursuing higher religious
education.

	   ``I want to serve the people and that is my priority as wakil
rakyat,''
	   insists Chenderoh MP Datuk Mohamed Nazri Abdul Aziz, who says
that he tries as much as possible to spend most of his time in his
constituency.
	   Nazri adds: ``I enjoy being wakil rakyat.
	   ``I usually spend Thursday nights in my constituency. I get to
meet many of my constituents during Friday prayers.''
	   The conscientious MP says that he stays on ministering to his
constituents until Sunday night after which he leaves for Kuala
Lumpur where his home is.
	   On whether he thinks he is doing a good job, Nazri replies, ``I
would say that my success rate in accepting invitations to visit my
constituents is 100 per cent.''
	   ``I don't reject any invitation from my constituents,'' he adds,
stating that if he had to make a choice between a programme in KL
``where I am not the main guest'' and an invitation in Chenderoh
``where I am the main guest,'' he would choose Chenderoh.
	   ``In the kampungs, I become the main star,'' says Nazri, who
obviously enjoys the attention he gets as a wakil rakyat in his
rural constituency which lies on the fringes of the two districts
of Kuala Kangsar and Hulu Perak.
	   ``It is not difficult to be the wakil rakyat there. They will
not bother you unless it is truly necessary,'' says Nazri,
contradicting the popular perception of the ``kampung style''
people's representative on call every hour of the day.
	   ``It is mostly bread and butter issues,'' says Nazri, who is
also Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister's department. He says
that the rakyat also approach him when they need assistance for
scholarships and endorsements in relation to their children's
education.
	   ``Then of course they also ask for the basic infrastructures
like roads.''
	   Nazri maintains that it is easy to satisfy his voters.
	   ``I find it easy to perform my duties as the people are
well-mannered and there is so much respect for leaders.
	   ``I don't wear a suit or tie when I am there. I sit with them
and I wear a sarong and T-shirt and crack a few jokes. It helps
break the ice and I find that they are all comfortable with me,''
says Nazri, who adds that due to the fact that the people of
Chenderoh are mainly involved in agricultural activities, they have
accepted that the place will never be as developed as Ipoh or Kuala
Lumpur.
	   ``But that does not mean that I do not look into its
development,'' says Nazri.
	   ``When I was the Mara chairman in 1995, I decided that one of
the new Maktab Rendah Sains Mara should be built in Chenderoh. I
could afford to do this then as I was not the MP at that time.''
	   Nazri says that the project has been delayed due to the economic
downturn but ``it has not been shelved.''
	   ``Once the MRSM comes up, the whole place will be opened up as
there will be outsiders moving in as teachers and students. The
locals will have business opportunities,'' says Nazri.
	   ``The main problem in the schools there is the lack of English
teachers,''
	   Nazri says, explaining that it is difficult to get English
teachers to be posted to Chenderoh as many perceive it as being
very rural.
	   Nazri adds that the schools also lack facilities such as
computers and a big chunk of his allocation goes to buying
computers for schools.
	   On infrastructure such as roads, Nazri says that he has managed
to get them built as ``I hold a high post and I have friends up
there in the respective ministries.
	   ``Furthermore, top ministers are wakil rakyat of the
constituencies bordering Chenderoh and this helps.''
	   Nazri also plans to encourage the people to venture into the
tourism industry.
	   ``It is a beautiful place with a beautiful lake,'' says the
wakil rakyat of the scenic Tasik Raban.
	   ``But we have to `jaga' the sensitivities of the people,'' says
Nazri, who believes ``politics is about people liking you.''
	   ``I am lucky the assemblymen in my constituency are experienced
politicians and we have a close working relationship,'' he says.
	   ``At present, I am happy being an MP in Chenderoh and I enjoy
doing what I am doing,'' he says, adding that to him it is
important to have ``personal satisfaction.''
	   The interview was conducted in the comfort of the Deputy
Minister's office. That day also happened to be his birthday. But
Nazri fidgeted a lot and seemed uncomfortable throughout the
interview.
	   It seemed to give credence to what those who know him say: that
he is uncomfortable being in the public eye. Thus when he does make
an appearance, he is said to make it with a bang and then disappear
as he did when he was appointed to the post of acting Umno Youth
leader back in 1995 in the place of the former Malacca Chief
Minister Tan Sri Abdul Rahim Tamby Chik.
	   ``I try as much as possible not to get into the papers. I am not
a terribly ambitious person and I do not require much publicity,''
says Nazri, with the wide-eyed look of an innocent child.
	   ``To me, what is important is that I do a good job, be it as a
member of the Umno supreme council or as a wakil rakyat.
	   ``I prefer to do my job quietly and I do not believe in trying
to attract unnecessary attention.
	   ``For me, at the end of the day, it is always the voters who
decide the outcome.''

New uncertainty over death toll in German train wreck
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS grafs 4-5 with ICE train stopped after noises heard,
other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CELLE, Germany (AP) _ A week after postwar Germany's deadliest
train disaster, officials were still uncertain Wednesday about how
many people were killed in the crushed and twisted wreckage.
	   After lowering the death toll twice _ to 95 on Tuesday _ police
spokesman Michael Hanke said the number was now being raised.
``With certainty there were 96 dead, and possibly the number will
rise to 99,'' he said.
	   Forensic experts have been having trouble making a definitive
count because many of the bodies were mutilated.
	   In a sign that the German railway is taking no chances, an ICE
train traveling from Munich to Hamburg Wednesday stopped in Celle
about midday after personnel aboard reported loud noises.
	   A railroad spokesman said that some 250 passengers were switched
to a slower inter-regional train to complete the trip. The ICE was
taken to a maintenance deport in Hamburg, where all wheels were
checked for damage, but nothing was found.
	   In Hanover, 20 kilometers (13 miles) to the south, the Lower
Saxony state parliament held an hour of speeches and prayers in
honor of the victims of last Wednesday's crash.
	   The parliamentary president, Rolf Wernstedt, praised the efforts
of rescue workers and residents of Eschede, the village north of
Celle where the crash occurred.
	   Afterward, lawmakers joined rescue workers and victims'
relatives for a memorial service in Market Church, a restored
Gothic landmark that is the city's main church.
	   The service started at 11 a.m., around the same time that the
high-speed InterCity Express train derailed and slammed into the
support pillar of an overpass. The impact brought 200-300 tons of
concrete down onto the jackknifed passenger wagons.
	   ``It happened a week ago today at this time: the terrible noise
of destruction, the giant cloud of dust, the stillness and then the
screams,'' Lutheran Bishop Horst Hirschler said in his address to
mourners.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt is refusing to allow Sheik Ahmed
Yassin, the spiritual leader of the radical Islamic group Hamas, to
travel to Cairo, Hamas officials said Wednesday.
	   Yassin, who was scheduled to arrive in Cairo from neighboring
Sudan Tuesday night, has had to remain in Khartoum since Egyptian
authorities told him that he may not fly to Cairo, said Mohammed
Nazal, Hamas spokesman in Jordan.
	   Yassin has asked to transit through Cairo on his way back to his
home in Gaza.
	   Earlier, Jordan rejected Yassin's request to transit through the
kingdom on his way home, Jordanian officials said Wednesday. They
spoke on customary condition of anonymity.

	   WITH the recent upheaval concerning the Unit Pusat Universiti's
mistakes in the matter of entrance for both Sijil Pelajaran
Malaysia and Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia students, one can't
help but wonder how an important body like UPU functions. And, more
importantly, why did it do such things?
	   For example, last year, forms for university applications were
sold at post offices. First of all, not all places have post
offices, and then only main post offices were in charge of the
sales.
	   The obvious problem at that time was that people all over had
rushed to the post offices to buy the forms. We all remember that
mess. Not the least of the problem is black market sale of the
forms.
	   Coming back to this year, a minister explained that the mix-up,
delayed reports etc, were due to wrongly filled OMR forms. And not
just a few but almost half of them. Is that possible?
	   You are not dealing with a bunch of primary school children
here, these are SPM and STPM students who intend to go to
universities. So, are Malaysian schools producing students who
can't even fill an application form? Of course not! The obvious
reason is that someone made a mistake and the ministry is trying to
cover it up. This is not the way to improvement. If there is a
problem, admit it! Take responsibility and improve on it.
	   With the UPU assessing and assigning students/applicants to
various universities, each institution of higher learning has a
fair share of ``better'' students and ``average'' students. This
may seem the fair thing to do at the moment.
	   What is the point of every university being exactly the same as
the rest? In the long run everyone is pulled down. The smart ones
will become average and the teachers/lecturers/administrators will
not work hard because if they do, the slower ones will not be able
to catch up.
	   If they don't, the bright ones will score but they will never
excel and push their potential to the maximum.
	   It is a rather cold but real fact that the smart ones need to be
with others of the same intellectual level to really excel. They
need the competition.
	   If raw diamonds aren't polished with diamond dust they will
never shine.
	   The better universities always take in the best students and the
teaching staff are constantly improving themselves in order to
teach these bright students.
	   Other universities won't be left behind in the long run. They
need a model to look up to. They will constantly try to be on par
with that model university.
	   We are always trying to copy renowned overseas universities, we
should have one for our own local universities. This will enable
all our universities to improve their standards.
	   Then we will be able to restore the glorious days when our
universities were recognised even in countries like Britain and
America.
	   We should understand that it is actually an injustice to the
genius of Malaysians that they are not being placed in a better
environment to develop their abilities.
	   A strong nation isn't built by making things easy for the young
generation. Young minds need to be trained. Only by ensuring that
the next generation are able to compete not among ourselves nor
weaker countries but with other stronger nations can we ensure the
survival of the country.
	   Remember that a diamond will not become a diamond if the coal
wasn't put through a journey of tremendous heat and pressure.

	   Police are hunting a friend of a Yemeni man murdered in Hotel
Pitagiri in Palmerah, West Jakarta, on Monday morning.
	   ``Officers of the Palmerah police subprecinct are looking for
the victim's local friend, identified as Rusdi, 25, as some clues
have emerged in the case,'' city police spokesman Lt. Col Edward
Aritonang said.
	   He refused to give further details. ``It's all being
investigated. But the police have found a strong connection between
Rusdi and the killing,'' he added.
	   The victim, identified as Hasan Muhammad Yeslam, 26, was found
with an open neck wound in room 312 at about 6 a.m. by a hotel
security guard, West Jakarta Police chief Lt. Col. Timur Pradopo
said.
	   The police officers handling the case expressed concern about
the hotel management waiting one hour after finding the body before
reporting it.
	   ``We were confused and did not know what to do,'' said Haris,
the security man who found the body.
	   Haris had noticed bloody shoeprints on the hotel stairs.
	   ``I followed the track and found that it led to room 312. I told
the hotel manager and then we opened the door. He was already dead
when we found him lying on the floor,'' Haris explained.
	   Hasan was reportedly in Indonesia on business and ran a garment
business here. His local friend, Rusdi, 25, dropped him off at the
hotel at about 2 p.m. Sunday.

	   ON May 26, the National Unity Advisory panel met under the
chairmanship of National Unity and Social Development Minister
Datin Seri Paduka Zaleha Ismail following its re-organisation and
the appointment of additional members.
	   Appointed by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the
59- member panel consisted of secretaries-general of relevant
ministries, state secretaries, departmental heads, representatives
of volunteer organisations, corporate leaders, religious heads and
social activists.
	   Panel members were given a specific task to freely discuss all
issues concerning unity and to make recommendations to the
government on what needs to be done to tackle problems which impede
unity.
	   The panel's role is important considering one of its tasks is to
help the National Unity Department to formulate and implement
programmes to promote unity and resolve potential causes of racial
or religious conflict.
	   Malaysia has often been cited by many foreign visitors as an
example of how a nation of diverse races and ethnic communities can
live in peace and harmony.
	   Yet, Malaysians must not take this unity for granted but instead
continuously work towards nurturing and reinforcing unity.
	   Even though we have been a tolerant and accomodating society, it
is necessary for Malaysians of all races to always be sensitive to
issues or disputes which can lead to unrest.
	   The Hindu temple-mosque dispute in Kampung Rawa, Penang, has
proven how fragile religious and racial harmony can be if problems
pertaining to places of worship are not handled properly.
	   Not only must the followers of the respective religious faiths
be respectful and sensitive to one another, even civil servants and
those in authority including the law enforcers must be sensitive to
the needs and wants of the community so as to ensure actions taken
will not give rise to racial conflict.
	   As pointed out by the Yang di-Pertua Negeri of Penang, Tun Dr
Haji Hamdan Sheikh Tahir, the Kampung Rawa incident should serve as
a reminder so that everyone should be careful, tolerant and
sensitive to the feelings of other communities.
	   It is imperative that Malaysians of all races work for racial
harmony and enhance efforts to promote understanding and unity
which is vital for economic recovery and nation-building.
	   Unity which involves the fostering of shared values and a shared
destiny with a feeling of a common identity is a fundamental
prerequisite for the realisation of Vision 2020.
	   We must therefore ensure that there is unity between the
communities, unity between labour and management, unity between
business and government and above all unity between the political
parties and within the national leadership.

Air France reaches agreement with striking pilots
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with flights Thursday, other details &QL;

 &UR; By DEBORAH SEWARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ After secret all-night talks, pilots agreed on
Wednesday to end a 10-day strike that has kept Air France from
flying players and fans to the World Cup and soured confidence in
the company _ and the country.
	   Nobody really celebrated the surprise agreement, in which the
pilots finally accepted Air France's offer of shares for salary
cuts.
	   The carrier said it would take 48 hours for all service to
return to normal, beginning with 40-50 percent of flights Thursday.
The longest routes, including Hong Kong, Manila and Johannesburg,
were to be among the last re-established.
	   Three smaller unions still on strike were to meet Thursday to
decide whether to pursue their job action.
	   Only hours after the strike was declared over as a result of the
unannounced talks, the World Cup got under way with the first
match, Brazil vs. Scotland.
	   The strike left lingering bitterness at Charles de Gaulle
airport north of Paris, where red lights still ominously flashed
``annule'' and ``canceled'' for most Air France flights Wednesday.
	   ``Air France was picking up again, and now they've lost
everything,'' said Nathalie Seulin, who works at the information
desk at Charles de Gaulle.
	   ``The pilots are like babies with pacifiers in their mouths,''
said Didier Bernard, a 38-year-old security guard at the airport.
``As soon as you take it out, they cry.''
	   Jean-Cyril Spinetta, president of Air France, called the
agreement a good compromise but that the strike had ``heavy''
consequences, costing the company a billion francs (dlrs 166
million.)
	   ``Now we have to think of confidence, confidence in Air
France,'' he said.
	   In concessions to the pilots, the carrier said it would scrap a
two-tier salary scale, under which new pilots earned less than
their colleagues. The highly paid pilots felt that that system
undermined cockpit solidarity.
	   The pilots seemed satisfied.
	   ``On the whole, the agreement is a good one for everybody,''
said Christian Paris, a spokesman for the SNPL, the main pilots'
union.
	   ``The company had its constraints and its objectives to achieve.
I think it will be able to reach them,'' he said.
	   The strike, coming as the world focused on France, had deeply
embarrassed the government.
	   It inconvenienced thousands of World Cup fans, who had to switch
airlines at the last minute or find alternative transportation.
	   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin welcomed the agreement _ but said
it had been too long in coming.
	   ``But I hope the company above all will benefit, because that is
my primary objective and what guided me throughout this period,''
he said after a Cabinet meeting.
	   Besides disrupting the World Cup, the government had feared the
strike could jeopardize investor confidence and eat up profits
ahead of plans to partially privatize the state-owned airline.
	   Wednesday's agreement, to be finalized by Aug. 31, was reached
with the SNPL, the main union representing the vast majority of Air
France pilots.
	   The pilots had been protesting 500 million francs (dlrs 83
million) in proposed salary cuts. Air France had said the cuts were
needed to provide capital to modernize the airline, which was saved
from bankruptcy in 1993 but reported profits in 1996 and 1997.
	   Air France said part of the agreement involved guaranteed
training for young pilots, at least part of which would be paid for
by the company. The salary-for-shares swap is voluntary.
	   As well as the airline strike, France has been hit in recent
days by walkouts by train drivers, baggage handlers, and some bus
services. There were no major walkouts Wednesday.

U.N. Drug Board member resigns, conflict of interest a concern
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With UN-Drug Summit &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Colombia's federal prosecutor has resigned
from the U.N. board that combats narcotics trafficking following
concerns of a possible conflict of interest.
	   Alfonso Gomez Mendez, who once defended a former foreign
minister implicated in Colombia's biggest drug scandal, stepped
down last month, said the president of the International Narcotics
Control Board, Hamid Ghodse of Britain.
	   Ghodse said the decision was made because Gomez ``has an
extremely tight work schedule and therefore he didn't think that he
can serve the board adequately when he has so much commitment
nationally.''
	   The U.N. legal office, however, believed Gomez's service as
federal prosecutor might impair his impartiality. The 1961 treaty
that established the board states that members should not hold
other jobs that might impair their impartiality.
	   After joining the board in 1997, Gomez was appointed Colombia's
federal prosecutor, replacing Alfonso Valdivieso, an
anti-corruption crusader whose investigations nearly toppled
President Ernesto Samper.
	   In a May interview with the Radionet network in Colombia, Gomez
denied that his defense of former Foreign Minister Rodrigo Pardo
was a factor in any possible conflict of interest. He said he was
considering quitting the board, but for other reasons.
	   Ghodse said the drug board last week asked member countries to
submit their nominations for a successor to fill Gomez' term, which
runs through 2002.
	   A choice was expected by February. A Colombian or a
representative from the region would be the natural choice, said
Herbert Schaerpe, secretary of the Vienna-based board, who joined
Ghodse at a news conference during the U.N. General Assembly
special session on drugs.
	   The narcotics board is one of the least known but most powerful
U.N. organizations. It works with governments to determine what
drugs should be declared illegal.
	   It also helps regulate ``precursors'' _ chemicals that are not
banned but can be used to manufacture illicit drugs.

 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS identification of Simoes as head coach, Brown as
assistant &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CHAUMONT, France (AP) _ The Jamaican team was settling into its
camp Wednesday after getting a keen reception by local children
during its first organized stroll though this northern town.
	   School children who were released from classes Tuesday in this
town of 8,000 asked for autographs from everyone from striker
Walter Boyd and head coach Rene Simoes to the dietitian and the
press officer.
	   The Reggae Boyz were holding nighttime practices Wednesday and
Thursday to simulate the 9 p.m. local time start of their opening
Group H game Sunday against Croatia in Lens.
	   The team looked nothing like the World Cup rookies they are as
they trained Tuesday night at the Georges Dobin Stadium.
	   After slick skills work, under the watchful eye of assistant
coach Carl Brown, Jamaica rounded off the two-hour session with
shooting and penalty drills in front of a crowd of 700 locals.
	   Boyd, who is still fighting hard to regain fitness after an
extended absence from the squad, appeared sharp and keen, as did
fellow striker Marcus Gayle, who is pressuring the out-of-sorts
Deon Burton for a starting role up front Sunday.
	   Coach Carl Brown said the team was relaxed and, despite a ``few
niggling'' injury problems, ready to make its historic World Cup
debut.
	   ``They have been working extremely hard and well and they are
all in a positive state of mind,'' said Brown. ``I am sure they
will give a good account of themselves on Sunday against a very
tough team.''
	   Missing from the drills were key central defender Linval Dixon,
and defenders Frank Sinclair and Steve Malcom.
	   Dixon will miss Sunday's encounter because of a knee injury but
claims he will be available for the team's second match against
World Cup giants Argentina in Paris on June 21.
	   Sinclair is still feeling the effects of a groin injury, while
Malcolm felt soreness in one of his feet after a team meeting
Monday night and was rested from Tuesday's two sessions.

	   RECENTLY I read a few complaints about the Subang Jaya Municipal
Council in our local newspapers. The most recent was the one
published in the Malay Mail with the heading, ``Unfair fines, cry
SJ ratepayers''.
	   Well, being a USJ resident for the past three years has indeed
made me realise that the town council really needs a lot of
``shaping-up''.
	   The complainant was right in saying they shouldn't be compounded
for failing to pay the assessment. Although the notice I received
is dated March 18, the postmark showed May 15.
	   The Public Relations Officer of MPSJ said Datapos should be
blamed as ``she did not realise that they sent the notices late''.
This clearly reflects that the PRO does not even know such things
are going on.
	   The second issue I wish to raise is the MPSJ payment collection
system.
	   Many of my colleagues and I have noticed that if you pay by
cheque, the amount is not debited in a week, or even a month, but
only six months later.
	   This results in bounced cheques because we no longer have
maintained our accounts because rationally, one would think that
the amount should have already been cleared.
	   Thirdly, try calling their 1-800-885235 (the 731-1616 is even
worse) and one would be passed around like a ball, because no one
wants to take responsibility. They shove you away before you can
even voice your complaint.
	   And finally in our current water crisis, the council should be
more helpful in giving us information. When asked questions on the
topic, they simply decline or refuse to speak.
	   We went to the extent of calling Sime UEP and we were fortunate
enough to get some information from them and telephone numbers of
the Selangor Waterworks Department and Subang Jaya State
Assemblyman Lee Hwa Beng's office. They were more accommodating
when answering our questions. And how did they achieve this? By
reading local newspapers. This is what the council personnel lack.
	   My friends and I have called (and still call) MPSJ to ask for
information regarding various issues. The council either declines
or redirects us nowhere. Sometimes we have no choice but to call
Lee Hwa Beng's office or even Sime UEP, because we do not know
where else to turn.

	   Hundreds of taxi drivers licensed to operate out of
Soekarno-Hatta International Airport protested about the operation
of unofficial taxies at the airport and the corrupt security
officials who assist them yesterday.
	   The drivers, who came from various taxi companies, parked their
cabs in the terminal one and two parking lot.
	   The protest, which began at 10 a.m., did not have a severe
impact on traffic because of the limited number of passengers
arriving at the airport at that time.
	   A driver from Gading taxi, who asked for anonymity, said the
number of unofficial taxies operating out of the airport had jumped
to about 450, causing a sharp decrease in income for licensed taxi
drivers.
	   ``The unofficial taxies have been operating here for quite a
long time. They fearlessly take passengers who are supposed to be
ours,'' he said.
	   The drivers lost patience and decided to stage a protest to
demand that steps to sanction the unlicensed taxies be taken.
	   The unofficial taxis are poaching work from licensed cabs to an
extent that many drivers who would formerly make two or three trips
from Jakarta to the airport every day now only make a single
journey.
	   ``It's very hard on us because taxi rental payments remain at Rp
80,000 a day,'' he said.
	   He explained that the number of official airport taxis had
dropped from 1,000 to 300.
	   The drivers also complained about unofficial drivers who operate
taxis without airport stickers but are allowed to pick up fares
because they pay a small fee to the duty security officers.
	   ``Some 'naughty' unlicensed drivers pick up passengers and
quietly slip a backhander to the security officer on duty,'' a
President taxi driver said, adding that this method was much
cheaper than purchasing an airport taxi sticker.
	   The drivers also complained about the high cost of
identification cards that must be worn at the airport, he said.
	   He said they had to pay Rp 20,000 for an ID card officially
priced at Rp 7,500.
	   Suryono, head of security at state-owned airport management
company Perum Angkasa Pura II, which manages Soekarno-Hatta
airport, could not be reached for comment yesterday.
	   ``Suryono is out in the field,'' a member of staff at the
airport said.
	   Separately, more than 4,000 of the 12,000 strong PT Gajah
Tunggal workforce went on strike yesterday demanding that the tire
manufacturing company gradually increase their salaries.
	   The workers said the company had postponed salary increases
planned for this month because of the economic crisis.
	   They said the company had first agreed to raise their salaries
last October and then again in June, but only the first increase
had taken place.
	   Head of Tangerang office of the Ministry of Manpower Apon
Suryana and local councillor Gusti Rustam were jeered by the
workers when they arrived at the company's factory to mediate in
the dispute.

	   MALAYSIA has been ranked 17th among the world's most competitive
economies, a drop from its previous ninth placing, the World
Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report 1998 said.
	   Singapore topped the table followed by Hong Kong and the United
States.
	   Thailand is down to 21, from 18th placing, and Indonesia has
fallen 16 places down to 31st placing.
	   The other 10 most competitive economies were the United Kingdom,
Canada, Taiwan, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Norway and Luxemburg.
	   Competitive countries are those that have the highest capacity
for medium-term economic growth, taking into account their starting
level of income.
	   The competitive index is based on several factors including
openness, government finance, infrastructure, technology,
management, labour and institutions.
	   According to Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Harvard Institute
for International Development, and co-chairman of the Advisory
Board of the Global Competitiveness Report, the rankings define
which countries have a range of markets and factors of production,
and other characteristics which give them the capacity to achieve
sustained economic growth.
	   He said a healthy market economy was an indispensable condition
of competitiveness, with private sector-led growth, rule of law and
well- functioning markets as keys.
	   ``In 1997, East Asian countries received high scores for small
government, high savings rates, low labour costs and flexible
labour markets ... export-led growth.
	   ``They received low scores for institutions. There is basically
no reason to look at that and see economic collapse.
	   ``In fact, what is happening in the markets is a blow-up that is
vastly more extreme than the situation merits.''
	   The report described Singapore and Hong Kong as ``well-run''
countries, adding that as both provide financial and other services
to their neighbours, it is natural that they would suffer somewhat
when their neighbours suffer.
	   ``Our data however, continues to indicate that conditions for
medium-term growth - over a five to 10-year period - is good in
both economies.
	   ``Both economies continue to be organised around open trade and
finance, small government, superb infrastructure, rigorous
enforcement of commercial contracts and low levels of corruption.

	   The Association of Indonesian Journalists (PWI) and the
Association of Indonesian Publishers (SPS) have joined forces in
calling on the government to annul a newly issued decree allowing
it to freeze errant media's publishing licenses for an unspecified
period of time.
	   The organizations claim the ruling -- replacing the
controversial ministerial decree which effectively sanctioned press
bans as it allowed former president Soeharto's regime to revoke
publishing licenses -- is open to numerous interpretations and in
many ways similar to the previous decree.
	   In a statement yesterday the two organizations said Article 23
of the new Minister of Information Decree No. 1/1998 should be
annulled.
	   Critics say the vague formulation allows the government to issue
suspensions for indefinite periods.
	   Meanwhile, ParOn tabloid and the Bandung Pos daily separately
announced yesterday they would cease publication as of today.
	   Bandung Pos blamed the monetary crisis, skyrocketing production
costs and the fact that 90 percent of subscribers, who are
government offices, defaulted on their subscriptions.
	   ParOn managing editor Agus Basri said in a statement that the
decision to close was made in an editorial staff meeting after its
investor Mohamad ``Bob'' Hasan decided to pull out.
	   ParOn's last edition bore the front cover headline Tanah
Keluarga Cendana Seluas Jakarta (Cendana Family's Land is as Large
as Jakarta), referring to alleged business holdings of the Soeharto
clan.

Rain halts play at Queens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP)_ Australia's Patrick Rafter was in the middle of a
fightback against compatriot Scott Draper at Queen's, when the rain
that has dogged the event halted play late Wednesday.
	   Less than 30 minutes of tennis was possible between rain
showers.
	   When organisers eventually called an end to play Draper, who
last year sent Michael Chang packing and has a winning head-to-head
record over the US Open champion, led 4-3.
	   Only one game was completed before the players were forced off
court initially, and when they returned it was Draper who
impressed.
	   While third seeded Rafter struggled with his serve, hitting six
double-faults in four service games, Draper struck some crisp
volleys, served steadily and made some good returns.
	   Draper's enterprise paid off when he broke to lead 2-1 as Rafter
failed to make a low volley.
	   Draper then held two break points leading 4-2 but Rafter held
his ground and when rain intervened he led 40-15 on Draper's serve.
	   No other play was possible, leaving players with the prospect of
playing two matches Thursday.
	   Due to the backlog of matches and public interest in second seed
Greg Rusedski and seventh seed Tim Henman, world number one Pete
Sampras will be relegated to a secondary court when - or if - play
gets underway Thursday.

	   Most political experts believe Indonesia no longer needs laws to
govern political parties as the new electoral law, currently being
drafted, should be sufficient.
	   Indria Samego of the Indonesian Institute of Sciences and Afan
Gaffar of Gadjah Mada University asserted that despite the
emergence of new political parties, there was no need for the
government and the House of Representatives to prepare a new law on
political parties.
	   Instead, a comprehensive electoral law would encompass issues
regarding the establishment of political parties, the two experts
pointed out in a hearing with House Commission II for domestic
political affairs which was attended by political scientist
Nazaruddin Syamsuddin from the University of Indonesia.
	   Commission chairman Budi Harsono said the hearing was held as
part of the commission's preparations to deliberate the draft laws
on general elections, political parties and the role and function
of the House currently being prepared by a team appointed by
President B.J. Habibie.
	   ``The existing law on political parties is not more than a set
of prohibitions, which in the end only makes the (existing)
political parties nothing more than a means to legitimize (claims)
that the country is democratic,'' Indria said, as quoted by Antara.
	   ``The rest of the ruling in the law has actually been covered in
the parties' statutes. Therefore, why don't we just let the parties
establish their own stipulations rather than (having) a law,'' he
said.
	   The existing political laws recognize only two political parties
-- the United Development Party and the Indonesian Democratic Party
-- and Golkar, which does not call itself a political party but
contests elections.
	   Habibie's government has pledged to open the political corridors
and allow people to build their own political parties. The
government has appointed a team, headed by political expert Ryaas
Rasyid, to prepare new laws to replace the existing ones.
	   Habibie said the new laws should be ready by August when they
will be submitted to the House for deliberation.
	   Several groups have already taken advantage of the promise and
established parties. These include the Indonesian Workers Party
(PPI) and Indonesian-Chinese for Reform Party (Parti).
	   On Monday a group of environmentalists announced plans to
establish the country's first green party, the United Republic
Party. The announcement was made during a ceremony at the summit of
the 3,019 meter Mt. Pangrango 65 kilometers south of here on
Sunday.
	   ``If the government wants to improve the political laws, it'd be
better if it provides a definition of what a political party is,''
Indria said.
	   Afan concurred and said that parties are part of the electoral
system. The electoral law should therefore consist of many chapters
in order to prevent ``unfair interpretations.''
	   ``The (electoral) law will have around 200 chapters,'' said
Afan, who is included in Ryaas' team.
	   The law will also abolish the election registration committees
in order to prevent cheating.
	   Amien
	   In Yogyakarta, opposition figure Amien Rais said he did not have
any plans to jump onto the bandwagon and establish his own
political party.
	   ``Let other people articulate their interests through parties
that they establish,'' he said in a discussion at Gadjah Mada
University Monday evening.
	   He said there was no reason for concern over the emergence of
many political parties of late, because a natural selection process
would occur and parties which did not have the support of many
people would dissolve automatically.
	   ``The public will decide whether certain parties would continue
to exist,'' he said.

 &UR; Singapore says tough laws, executions have brought drug problem
under control &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Singapore defended its harsh drug
penalties, telling the U.N. drug conference that tough measures
which include mandatory execution had brought the drug problem
``very much under control.''
	   ``We take the drug problem seriously because our geographical
location puts us at constant risk of being used as a transshipment
point for drug trafficking,'' Home Minister Wong Kee Seng said.
	   ``Our stringent deterrent laws are well-known,'' Wong added.
``Drug offenders are treated with the same gravity, regardless of
whether they are Singaporean or foreign nationals.''
	   This month, Singapore's parliament imposed the death penalty for
trafficking in methamphetamine, and introduced corporal punishment
and long jail terms for repeat drug offenders.
	   The previous law dictated sentences of less than two years in
drug rehabilitation centers for repeat offenders. Singapore imposed
mandatory death by hanging in 1975 for drug trafficking.
	   But the government no longer makes public the number of people
hanged.
	   Under the new law, anyone convicted of dealing in more than 250
grams (8.75 ounces) of methamphetamine faces the gallows.
Traffickers in 167-250 grams (5.85-8.75 ounces) of amphetamines
face life in prison and 15 strokes of the cane.
	   Lesser amounts are punishable by up to 20 years in prison.
	   Wong said such policies were part of a longterm plan to ``create
a national consensus toward zero tolerance for drug abuse,'' which
he said was showing results.
	   Since 1994, he said, the number of persons arrested for drug use
had declined from 6,160 to 4,750 _ a 22 percent decline. The
relapse rate had dropped by 15 percent, he said, although he
acknowledged that two-thirds of those who underwent treatment
resumed drug use after their release.
	   Nevertheless, he said the figures were enough to show that ``the
drug situation in Singapore is very much under control.''

	   The Attorney General's Office has formed a team, headed by
Deputy Attorney General for Civil and State Administrative Courts
Soehanjono, to investigate the wealth of current and past
government officials.
	   ``The results (of the investigation) of officials from both the
central and provincial governments will be announced to the
public,'' the office's spokesman, Barman Zahir, said yesterday.
	   He did not elaborate on when the investigation results would be
announced.
	   The offices of the attorney general, the chief public prosecutor
and public prosecutors have already asked the public to provide
information on the wealth of officials through P.O. Box 777 to help
the team in its investigation.
	   ``P.O. Box 777 has been opened and placed at the offices of the
attorney general, the chief public prosecutor and all public
prosecutors in the country,'' Zahir said as quoted by Antara.
	   This is expected to make it easier for the public to present
information or preliminary evidence on the wealth of serving and
former officials.
	   Deputy Attorney General Ismudjoko SH had previously asked all
public prosecutor offices throughout the country to open the post
office box address. The public should use this to provide any
information on the wealth of officials, Zahir said.

	   IPOH, Mon. - Sixty-nine open burning cases are currently being
considered for prosecution as part of the Government's nationwide
crackdown.
	   The cases were among the 341 detected from the time the
operation was launched on April 8 until last Saturday.
	   Science, Technology and Environment Minister Datuk Law Hieng
Ding said the Government was coming down hard on those responsible
for land and forest fires as open burning has been identified as a
contributing factor to the haze.
	   ``Several cases have been mentioned in court while others are
still under investigation,'' he said at the closing of the 5th
International Chinwoo Wushu competition last night.
	   Law said Asean member countries were trying to work out plans to
prevent forest fires in view of the dry spell.
	   ``An unofficial two-day meeting of Asean ministers in charge of
the environment would be held in Singapore from June 18 to discuss
forest fires.
	   ``This is because the change in wind direction from
northeasterly to northwesterly is expected to bring a dry spell. We
have to prevent forest fires especially in Sumatra, the Riau
Archaepalego and Kalimantan,'' he said.
	   Law said the ministry was also concerned about rain as a result
of the coming La Nina phenomenon, which could be as damaging as its
opposite, the El Nino.
	   While El Nino is a periodic warming of the waters in the eastern
Pacific Ocean, La Nina is marked by a rapid cooling of the seas in
the same area, a phenomenon which tends to bring heavy rain to
areas hit by drought during the El Nino.

	   The Navy will continue to place a strong emphasis in its civic
work missions to help alleviate poverty in the country's least
developed areas.
	   ``The Navy sees the Baskara Jaya civic work mission as a must.
Now the social mission becomes urgent due to the economic crisis
that has plagued the country in the last 11 months,'' Navy Chief
Adm. Arief Kushariadi said in the launching ceremony of a joint
Indonesian and Sigaporean navy civic work mission on Bangka and
Belitung islands, at Palembang Naval Base here yesterday.
	   Also attending the ceremony were Singapore Navy Chief Vice Adm.
Richard Lim and South Sumatra Governor Ramli Hasan Basri.
	   The ceremony ended with a parachute jump show involving 40
marines.
	   Arief stressed that the motive behind the civic work mission was
concern over the livelihoods of the millions of people living below
the poverty line.
	   ``The civic work mission is aimed not only at helping develop
the least developed villages but also at strengthening economic and
defense resilience in remote areas,'' he said.
	   The Singapore navy deployed a warship and almost 200 personnel,
including medical workers, to participate in the civic mission.
	   Arief said personnel from both countries would carry out
development projects, such as road and irrigation construction and
school and mosque renovations, while their medical teams would
provide free medical services to the needy.
	   Lim said the Singapore navy would continue to cooperate with the
Indonesian Navy in civic work missions and joint military exercises
in the future in order to enhance bilateral cooperation.
	   ``We have carried out joint military exercises for 20 years.
This year, the two navies will conduct a joint patrol operation in
the Strait of Malacca,'' he said after the ceremony.
	   He said this was the second time the Singapore navy would
participate in a civic work mission.
	   He added that the Singapore navy contributed rice, textiles and
food worth Rp 300 million to the mission.
	   Three warships -- Indonesia's KRI Teluk Banten and KRI Teluk
Peleng and Singapore's RSS Excellence -- with almost 800 soldiers
and medical workers from both navies have been deployed to carry
out the month-long operation.

WWII POWs seeking Japanese compensation meet with Blair
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former prisoners of war who were held by the
Japanese during World War II met with Prime Minister Tony Blair on
Wednesday to press their campaign for compensation from Japan.
	   The issue returned to the news two weeks ago during the state
visit by Japan's Emperor Akihito. Veterans turned their backs on
him in protest when the emperor appeared in public.
	   The veterans said they were encouraged by Wednesday's meeting
with Blair and that the prime minister told them the government had
the political will to take up the issue with Japan again, if legal
opinion supported such action.
	   The government earlier had said it could not seek more
compensation because the matter was finalized in a 1951 treaty that
could not be reopened.
	   The veterans said two legal experts concluded that ``good
arguments can be made to support the view'' that the time-lapse
since the 1951 treaty ``would not be an insurmountable obstacle in
the present case,'' according to lawyer Martyn Day, who is
campaigning with the veterans.
	   ``As far as the legal issue is concerned, they (the government)
are prepared to review the position in the light of the legal
opinion we provided them,'' he said. ``They will come back to us
once they have had the chance to review it.
	   A spokesman for the prime minister said Blair wanted to do all
he could, but didn't want to make any promises he couldn't keep.
	   Government lawyers are studying the new legal opinion.

	   IPOH, Mon. - The Ipoh Hospital opened the country's first Quit
Klinik today to help smokers kick the habit.
	   The clinic provides counselling for smokers who find difficulty
in trying to quit smoking, and for those who have stopped smoking
but need help to prevent them from lighting up again.
	   Hospital director Dr Umar Said Amad, who opened the clinic, said
the move was one of the hospital's efforts to help discourage
smoking, especially among the younger generation.
	   He said despite anti-smoking campaigns launched by the
Government and other agencies, there were still many people,
especially youths, who take up smoking and who refused to quit.
	   Dr Umar said the number of young smokers increased tremendously
over the past few years.
	   ``For the first quarter of this year, there was a 30.7 per cent
increase in the number of habitual smokers aged below 18, compared
to 10 years ago.
	   ``Female smokers in the same age group increased by 14.4 per
cent compared to a decade ago,'' he said.
	   Dr Umar attributed the increase to the aggressive promotions
carried out by tobacco companies in recent years.
	   ``The tobacco companies spend millions of ringgit on cigarette
commercials and this has defeated the purpose of our awareness
programme,''
	   he said.
	   He also said 2,971 people were issued compounds during the
first-third of this year for smoking in public places. Of this, 402
were below 18 years old.
	   From today until Saturday, Quit Klinik will open from 8am to
4pm.
	   However, from next week, it will be opened once a week on
Thursdays from 9am to noon. Appointments can be made by calling
05-5222030 or 05-5222031.

	   President B.J. Habibie will appoint seven of the country's top
businessmen as special envoys with ambassadorial rank to help
promote the Indonesian economy abroad and improve foreign investor
confidence.
	   Chairman of the Indonesian Chambers of Commerce and Industry
(Kadin) Aburizal Bakrie told reporters after meeting with the
President yesterday that the new envoys would be James Riady,
Hashim S. Djojohadikusumo, A.A. Baramuli, Suryo Sulistio, Marimutu
Sinivasan, Iman Taufik and Muchrim Hakim.
	   James Riady, chairman of the country's widely-diversified Lippo
Group, will become a special envoy to China, Hong Kong, Taiwan,
Australia and New Zealand.
	   Hashim Djojohadikusumo, son of senior economist Sumitro
Djojohadikusumo and chairman of the Tirtamas Group, will be in
charge of Europe.
	   A.A. Baramuli, a businessman and current chairman of the Asian
Chambers of Commerce Committee, will be a special envoy to East
Asia, including Japan and South Korea.
	   Marimutu Sinivasan, chairman of the country's giant Texmaco
Group, will handle South Asia, including India.
	   Iman Taufik, Kadin's deputy chairman, will be responsible for
member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN).
	   Suryo Sulistio, also the chamber's deputy chairman, will be in
charge of the United States and Muchrim Hakim. also a Kadin
executive, will handle the Middle East and Africa.
	   Aburizal said yesterday that all the ambassadors had good
relations with the business communities in the countries to which
they would be assigned.
	   ``But the business ambassadors will pay their travel expenses
out of their own pockets because the government does not have
enough money to finance their missions,'' Aburizal said.
	   When asked about the country's mounting private sector debt,
Aburizal said that most companies were facing problems meeting debt
payments because their value had quadrupled in rupiah terms.
	   ``There is not a single major company that is free from problems
relating to their foreign debts,'' he said.
	   The government announced on Monday that Indonesian private
sector debts due to mature in the current fiscal year totaled
US$29.2 billion. But their repayment will be rescheduled to eight
years, including three years of grace period.

	   Last week we talked about maintaining brakes during the rainy
season. This week, we'll see why the car fails to stop, even though
you've hit the brakes.
	   First of all you must be aware how much the brake pedal sinks
every time you brake (which is simply the distance between the
brake pads and the discs). In other words, if the distance
increases, that means that the brake pads are wearing out. Another
way to check the brake pads, especially in cars with disc brakes,
is the amount of brake oil remaining in the cylinder in the engine.
The wearing out of the pads will result in the oil filling that
space. So if there is little brake oil left, the pads are worn out
as much.
	   If you see the brake warning bulb light up on the dashboard,
even though the handbrake has been released, and the brake oil
level is lower than usual, it's likely that the brake pads have
been worn out and it's time to replace them.
	   Brake pads for drum brakes have a longer life, usually about
three times of those for discs. The reason is that drums have a
much larger contact area.
	   Oh, I almost forgot to mention this -- always remember that
brakes are not the only thing that stops the car. Imagine that you
are on a wet road and brake heavily. You can feel that the wheels
are locked, but the car just doesn't stop.
	   The purpose of the brakes is not to bring the car to a complete
halt, but to reduce the power from the engine and transmit the
force to the tyres. The tyres, in fact, are the last factor that
determines whether the car will stop. Therefore, it is very
valuable to know whether the stopping problem is caused by the
tyres or not.
	   Tyres with a particular type of tread pattern provide a short
braking distance even though the wheels are locked, but those with
large block patterns tend to take a longer distance depending on
the tread pattern and rubber compound. Those with larger blocks and
harder tyre composition, which is aimed at increasing tyre life,
will still slide more while braking whether on a wet or dry road.
	   In a nutshell, worn-out tyres provide for a poor braking
performance -- and can be dangerous.
	   Using the wrong tyre pressure, especially if it's too high, also
significantly reduces the braking performance of a car, even if the
brakes are in good condition. The problem is, that with too much
pressure there is less contact area between the tyres and the road,
thus less grip. So regularly checking the tyre pressure is helpful
in maintaining a good stopping distance, especially on wet and dry
roads, as well as on slippery surfaces such as sand-covered roads.
	   Braking problems are sometimes caused by things you might be
unaware of, such as the car carrying a too heavy load or not
distributing the weight properly around the car.
	   In hard times like these, many are forced to earn more income
and a popular trend now is selling things at car-boot sales on the
weekends. Some of us put pile things into the boot, whith could
total 200 to 300 kilogrammes, and that is bound to cause problems
since the front of the car is levered up resulting in poor handling
and braking distance.
	   That's why the driver should have a reasonable understanding
about the associated problems because some of them can be taken
care of easily and most of all, free of charge.
	   So remember, that if you are carrying extra weight, try to
distribute it around the car, such as on the front and rear
passenger seats, apart from the trunk.

	   The Ministry of Agriculture admitted yesterday that malfeasance
occurred in the distribution of subsidized fertilizers earmarked
for farmers.
	   Mohammad Jafar Hafsah, the secretary of the Mass Guidance
Engineering Unit (Bimas) of the ministry, said much of the
subsidized fertilizer ended up instead with plantation companies.
	   He said the probe was still underway into the amount of
government losses caused by the irregularities.
	   ``I can't give you the amount of the loss of the subsidy because
we are still investigating it,'' Jafar said after a hearing with
House of Representatives' Commission III for forestry and
plantations, agriculture, transmigration and food affairs.
	   Bimas, established in 1967, is assigned to develop the food
crops sector.
	   The government has subsidized three common fertilizers -- urea,
ZA and superphospate 36 -- to assist farmers amid soaring prices of
fertilizers and to boost the country's rice and food crop
production. Subsidies for other types of fertilizers have been
abolished gradually since 1990.
	   Subsidies are limited to food crops and horticulture farming and
are exclusive for farmers.
	   Sources at the ministry said many major plantation firms bought
the fertilizers at subsidized prices due to dubious distribution
practices and collusion committed by officials of state fertilizer
producer PT Pupuk Sriwijaya and village cooperatives.
	   Most of the misconduct occurred in fertilizer distribution at
the regency level and in village cooperatives' warehouses.
	   A source said the deviation caused huge losses to the
government.
	   Jafar said the government would order PT Pusri to distribute
fertilizers directly to farmers to ensure transparent distribution
and help farmers.
	   Under the new scheme, PT Pusri would distribute a particular
amount of fertilizer according to orders from farmers.
	   ``The move will be taken to cut the distribution chain and to
end the unfair practices.''
	   Jafar also said the government would need around Rp 393.9
billion (US$39.4 million) to lower the price of the Kalium Chloride
(KCl) fertilizer to Rp 1,250 per kilogram.
	   He said that the country's consumption of KCl fertilizer reached
315,120 tons this year. The government's subsidy-- which had been
abolished -- is 60 percent of KCl's current price of Rp 2,100 per
kilogram.
	   Early this month, Minister of Agriculture Soleh Solahuddin
announced the government would reintroduce the subsidy on the
fertilizer to boost rice production.
	   Reduction of KCl use in rice farming resulted in a downward
trend in the country's volume of production, Soleh said. He
attributed the reduction to farmers no longer being able to afford
the fertilizer.

	   SUNGAI PETANI, Mon. - The Japanese Government will spend two
billion yen (about RM7 million) to train workers in the Southeast
Asian industrial sector this year.
	   The training programme aims to improve the skills of workers and
help to increase the ability of industries in Southeast Asia to
compete at the international level.
	   The manager of the Japanese Association for Overseas Technical
Scholarships (AOTS), Hidetaka Kawai, said the programme was also
established as part of the efforts to help Southeast Asian
countries facing economic problems.
	   ``We hope such training programmes will help to increase overall
productivity in local industries and boost exports from the
region,'' he said after launching an engineering course organised
by the AOTS.
	   The five-day course was organised in co-operation with
Sharp-Roxy Corporation (M) Sdn Bhd and the AOTS Alumni of Malaysia.
	   Hideki said the association would identify workers to be trained
in several areas of high technology. The trainees will undergo part
of their programme in a Southeast Asian country and the rest in
Japan.
	   The AOTS was established in 1959 as a non-profit organisation
and trains about 1,000 workers in the industrial sector in Malaysia
annually.

	   Not long after the first riots broke out in Jakarta less than a
month ago, hundreds, or even thousands, of people hastily grabbed
their belongings and fled the city in fear of their lives. Some
even left the country.
	   Most of them were Indonesians of Chinese descent -- the main
targets of the rioters.
	   Lily, who went to Denpasar with her family, decided to escape
after her shop, located near her house in Pamulang, South Jakarta,
was looted and burned down.
	   ``The people were still on the street until very late that night
and we stayed awake the whole night because our neighbors warned us
that we must be prepared to get out of the house in case people set
it on fire,'' she told The Jakarta Post.
	   ``To add to the chaotic situation, my mother slipped and fell.
The morning after, even though I knew it wasn't safe to be on the
street, I decided to take my mother to the hospital. The next day,
we all flew to Bali.''
	   Lily's sister added: ``According to my shop attendant, when the
people were burning and looting our belongings, the police arrived.
But they only watched, it was said they were waiting for further
instructions.''
	   Caught up by fear and panic, they decided to go to Bali, leaving
their important documents with a Moslem neighborhood leader, with
whom they had a good relationship.
	   Frantic. That was the situation in Jakarta then.
	   ``We kept calling our family, relatives and friends to let them
know how we were faring. We were on the phone almost all the
time,'' Shirley, who lives in Karet Sawah, near Jl. Sudirman,
Central Jakarta, said.
	   ``My heart beat faster whenever the phone rang. It was always
about Mr. X's house being burned, or that Mr. Y's shops were
looted. All our relatives experienced financial losses,'' she
recalled.
	   The chaotic situation forced many people to flee the city or
even the country to save their lives. Some who were badly need of
cash sold their cars at the airport.
	   ``They brought their car papers with them and tried to sell the
vehicle at the airport for a very low price,'' said a driver, who
had just dropped his boss, a Briton, at the airport.
	   ``One of them asked if I would buy his car, but I didn't have
the money,'' he added.
	   There are always people ready to make a profit out of others'
hardships, and last month was no exception. Not only did desperate
people rush to the airport, but so did people with a sharp business
sense, and they knew people would go to the airport by car. Cars
that they could buy cheap. Ten million rupiah was the going rate
for a 1993 Toyota Kijang van, a Toyota Starlet sedan of the about
same year had a going rate of Rp 10 million. Normally a Starlet
would sell for Rp 50 million. A BMW would normally fetch between Rp
100 million to Rp 200 million, at the airport an owner had to
accept between Rp 35 million and Rp 40 million.
	   The fact that many desperate Chinese-Indonesians fled Jakarta
and even sold their cars for such low prices might draw unfavorable
comments. Some said it was ``too much'' while others said those
leaving the country were unnationalistic.
	   ``This has nothing to do with nationalism,'' said Lily, who
returned from Bali last week. ``It is not foreigners, but our own
fellow countrymen who attacked us. People who say that have no idea
how horrible our experiences were.''
	   Tono, an office boy at a PR company, was on his way home on May
14 when he saw a girl of Chinese descent being sexually assaulted
in Kebon Jeruk, West Jakarta.
	   ``The girl was terrified. She was trapped and surrounded by a
violent mass that was stripping her clothes off. Once her clothes
were off, the people harassed her and threw her clothes here and
there.
	   ``The people were not satisfied, and they forced her to take off
her bra and panties. She was begging and crying. My God, I wish I
could have helped her, but I didn't dare as there were too many
people there. Finally, an old man came and gave her newspaper to
cover her naked body. He stopped a taxi, which happened to pass by,
and told the driver to take her home.''
	   As Tono got closer to his house, he saw another shocking
incident.
	   ``One of my Chinese (Indonesian) neighbors died in her shop. She
was burned. I saw her shriveled body.''
	   Melly, who lives in a residential area in Pluit, North Jakarta,
said all her neighbors, except two families, fled the area.
	   ``My husband didn't want to move out of the house because we
didn't have any place to go. The day before, they had burned down
our shop. My three children, including my baby, were all sick that
day.
	   ``In my neighborhood, there were only two families left. That
day (May 15), I heard people approaching from both directions, we
were trapped. I was scared to death, but we stayed because my
driver told me that he had seen a girl who fled from her nearby
apartment get caught by the masses. They ripped her clothes off,''
she said.
	   She continued, ``When people were throwing stones at our house,
a truck full of soldiers arrived and blocked their way. The Army
protected us and took us to the nearest police station.''
	   Still, she considers herself lucky. ``Most of my friends'
children have been traumatized, they frequently sob and scream
during their sleep, 'Mommy, Mommy, I'm scared.' My children were
frightened but coped well. They just said, 'Mommy, they were
bad'.''
	   Report
	   Tini, a secretary who works on Jl. Sudirman, said one of her
Chinese-Indonesian friends was raped in Glodok.
	   ``She tried to hide in her shop. But the people battered the
door down and gang raped her.''
	   Asked if she or her friend would report the case, she said
``Why? What's the benefit? Who would care?''
	   These incidents depict only a very small part of the experiences
of Chinese-Indonesians during the recent riots. There are probably
many other equally terrifying cases, or even worse stories, that
would only be told to close relatives. Many victims of rape and
other forms of sexual harassment have chosen to remain silent and
bury the incidents.
	   ``You'll never find such stories in the newspapers. The victims
and their families will never let them out,'' said Wiwied, an
education counselor.
	   The Commission on Human Rights said last week it had received
reports of the deaths of 1,188 people and 101 injuries along with
some cases of rape.
	   It also said that 40 shopping centers, 2,479 shop-houses and
1,604 shops were attacked, burned or looted, along with 1,119
vehicles, 1,026 private homes and 383 offices.
	   Women's rights group Mitra Perempuan also said it had received
many reports on sexual abuse cases during the riots.

	   Sometimes you have both the money and the desire to buy a new
car, but those available on the market and sold through
distributorships just don't appeal to you. You need something more
distinguished and something that comes with the latest
technologies. So where do you go? You go to a 'grey' market car
dealer.
	   But considering the exchange rate and the increase in import
duty for completely-built-up (CBU) vehicles to 80 per cent flat,
you wonder if the greys are still around.
	   Indeed, many independent car dealers have simply disappeared
since the economic turmoil really kicked in, and many have turned
themselves into appointed dealerships such as Benz Bangna, formerly
a grey market importer, but which has now become a Thon Buri
Automotive Assembly Plant (TAAP) Co appointed Mercedes-Benz dealer,
or Benz Inter Co Ltd, which has now joined as one of the Bangkok
dealers for the Ford Army.
	   Apart from the fiscal problems, another reason for the fall of
the grey importers is the fact that many do not have an after-sales
service facility.
	   ''To operate a car dealership business, you have to provide a
complete service to the customer,'' says Sompong Vittayarakrangsan,
managing director of SEC Group Co, a major grey market car importer
specialising in Japanese cars.
	   Sompong, who is just 30 years old, said that customers are
staying away from independent importers that do not provide
after-sales service.
	   ''Many importers have gone out of business because they just
sell the car to the customer and then forget about everything --
which is the wrong approach,'' he said.
	   SEC is quite serious about doing business, he says. Apart from a
reasonable stock of parts worth Bt40 million, the company also
provides a 24-hour hotline service to customers just like the big
car companies do.
	   ''We keep a large amount of spare parts because we have to cater
for our old customers who have purchased cars like the Toyota MR-2,
Supra or Celica from us. We might not import some of these cars
anymore, but we must be able to service them.'' Despite the auto
market dropping by as much as 75 per cent this year, SE has not
been affected that much. ''We forecast a drop of only 20 per cent
compared to a 75 per cent total market drop, because we deal with
the upper market where the customers still have purchasing power.
Even though the economy has dropped, our customers are the
well-to-do and have budgets for cars unlike the middle and lower
market segments.
	   He said that despite the fluctuating exchange rate and increased
import duties, the business is still making money. ''Japanese
imports are still able to cater to the buyers' needs, are as safe
as European counterparts and are easy to maintain.'' SEC started
business seven years ago when the Thai government liberalised the
automobile industry, and has sold over 2,600 imported cars. Last
year alone it sold 700 units worth Bt1.6 billion and despite the
current economic condition, plans to sell another 500 units worth
Bt1.4 billion this year.
	   ''After five months, we have already sold 250 units,'' Sompong
noted.
	   The company has also expanded from its Rama 9 head office, with
new showrooms in Bang Na, Chiang Mai and Rayong, and there is a
plan to open another showroom in the Sathorn area later this year.
''We see the importance of expanding to get closer to our
customers. For example, we decided to open the Bang Na branch
because 30 per cent of our customers are located in that area.
Chiang Mai and Rayong are tourist destinations with lots of
customers too.'' Among the current imports include the Toyota
Granvia multi-purpose vehicle (Bt2.55 million), Land Cruiser VX100
(Bt4.1 million) and the Toyota Harrier off-roader (Bt3.1 million).
Other brands and models could also be imported upon request.

	   The Treaty of Cordiality and Friendship, which was signed by
Indonesia and Egypt on June 10 1947, is a very important document
in the history of the bilateral relations between the two
countries. It had a profound effect on the efficacy of subsequent
Indonesian diplomatic endeavors in support of the struggle to
defend and preserve Indonesian independence.
	   By virtue of this treaty, Egypt became one of the first
countries to recognize Indonesian independence and sovereignty.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Alatas, in a seminar on
Egyptian-Indonesian relations in Jakarta in July 1995 described the
signing of the treaty as the first victory of Indonesian diplomacy
abroad.
	   Egypt is one of the Indonesia's closest friends in the Middle
East, a fact that most Indonesians are aware of. This is because
when Indonesia was struggling to gain international recognition for
its independence and sovereignty, to overcome the military blockade
the Netherlands had imposed on its former colony to isolate it
economically and diplomatically, Egypt and the other members of the
Arab League stepped forward and accorded de facto and de jure
recognition to Indonesia.
	   To emphasize its commitment to Indonesian independence, Egypt
went to the extent of declaring persona non grata a member of the
Dutch Embassy staff in Cairo for his obstreperous opposition to
Egypt's recognition of Indonesia.
	   Egypt's role in Indonesia's struggle for independence was firmly
acknowledged by Dr. Muhammad Hatta in an interview with Akhir Sa'ah
on Dec. 23 1949. He stressed that Indonesia's first diplomatic
victory was indeed pivotal because it was soon followed by
recognition by several other Middle East countries and increased
pressure on the Netherlands to keep its promise to withdraw its
forces from Indonesian territory.
	   Egypt's recognition of Indonesia became the basis of a decision
taken by a foreign ministers' meeting of the Arab League on Nov. 28
1946. In that forum, the independence of Indonesia that had been
proclaimed the previous year was unanimously recognized.
	   Getting the instrument of recognition into the hands of the
Indonesian authorities was no easy task. This was not only because
no other nation had recognized Indonesia at that time but also
because Indonesia was in the grip of a tight blockade by Dutch
forces.
	   To break that blockade, the Egyptian Consul General in Bombay,
Muhammad Abdul Mun'im, on instructions from Cairo, secretly flew to
Yogyakarta on March 13 1947 to officially convey the documents of
the recognition of Indonesian independence and sovereignty by Egypt
and the Arab League nations. Abdul Mun'im was welcomed by president
Sukarno, vice president Hatta and several cabinet members.
	   In response to the visit, Indonesia sent a diplomatic mission to
Cairo led by the foreign minister, the ``Grand Old Man'' Haji Agus
Salim. The mission included Nazir St. Pamuncak, H. Moh. Rasyidi,
Abdurrahman Basweden and Major General Abdul Kadir.
	   Among the vitally important achievements of that Indonesian
diplomatic mission were the signing of the Treaty of Cordiality and
Friendship on 10 June 1947, the Agreement on the Opening of
Diplomatic and Consular Relations and trade agreements. Indonesian
foreign minister H. Agus Salim signed for Indonesia and his
Egyptian counterpart Mahmud Fahmi Nokrasyi signed for Egypt.
	   The Netherlands often hampered the implementation of the Treaty
of Cordiality and Friendship in various ways. Nevertheless, the
signing of these treaties encouraged other Arab countries and their
neighbors to sign similar treaties with Indonesia. These included
Syria (July 1947), Lebanon (July 1947), Iraq (July 1947), Saudi
Arabia (November 1947) and Yemen (May 1948).
	   Egypt's recognition of Indonesian independence occurred at a
time when Egypt itself was facing serious political problems such
as the emergence of the state of Israel and a dispute with Paris
over Egypt giving asylum to a Moroccan citizen wanted by the French
Government. But these obstacles did not deter Egypt from doing what
it believed should be done for Indonesia.
	   On many occasions, Agus Salim expressed the view that relations
between Egypt and Indonesia date back to the ninth century. Such
relations continue to flourish today. The opening of an Indonesian
representative office in Cairo in 1949 served to intensify these
relations. The visit of former president Soeharto to Egypt last
month, during which he also participated in the G-15 Summit, served
only to further strengthen the bonds of friendship between the two
nations.
	   In the course of their excellent diplomatic relationship, Egypt
and Indonesia have signed more than 20 agreements, Memorandums of
Understanding and Agreed Minutes covering politics, economics,
information exchange, trade, culture, sports, science and
technology and religion.
	   Agreements between the two countries include an Agreement on
Culture (October 1955), an Agreement on Cooperation in Information
(October 1972), an Agreement on Cooperation between Antara News
Agency and MENA (October 1977), a MOU on Youth and Sports
(September 1994), an Agreement on Trade (March 1955) which was
renewed on June 1977, an Airspace Agreement (August 1964), and an
Agreement on Avoidance of Double Taxation.
	   Relations between Egypt and Indonesia can be expected to grow
further in the future, bilaterally as well as multilaterally. This
is because of the close historical ties between the two countries
and their shared perceptions on international developments as well
as their common vision of a more equitable world order.
	   The foreign policies of the two countries are similar in many
ways. Both nations are advocates of nonalignment and cofounders of
the Non-Aligned Movement. At the Asian-African Conference in
Bandung in 1955 during which a new ethos of international
relations, the Dasa Sila Bandung was handed down, Egypt was
represented by its revered leader, Gamal Abdel Nasser. Since then
the two countries have been complementing each other's diplomatic
initiatives in such forums as the Non-Aligned Movement, the Group
of 77, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and, of course,
in the United Nations.
	   Indonesia had occasion to come to the support of Egypt when
Cairo nationalized the Suez Canal in 1956 and sent a peacekeeping
force under the umbrella of the United Nations to the Sinai
Peninsula in 1973. Indonesia has also consistently supported
Egypt's endeavors to help solve the issue of Palestine in the same
way that Egypt has consistently supported Indonesia's stand on East
Timor in the UN since 1977.
	   In light of the financial and economic crisis that has engulfed
Indonesia since last year, Egypt has come to the aid of some 2.500
Indonesian students who are studying in Egypt by granting them
scholarships so they can continue their studies in Egypt.

	   The Toyota Harrier, which is also known as the Lexus RX 300 in
some markets, marks a new direction where sport utility vehicles
(SUV)'s are heading.
	   According to importer SEC Group Co Ltd, the Harrier, which is
the first Lexus-badged off-roader that competes against rivals like
the Mercedes-Benz M-class, successfully combines the handling of a
passenger car to off-roading capabilities of an SUV.
	   ''It's an off-roader that drives like a passenger car,'' a
company official said.
	   Price has been set at Bt3.1 million, which is reasonable
considering the value of the baht against the yen, and the car
comes with full options similar to those sold in Japan.
	   The Harrier is powered by an electronically-fed 3.0-litre
24-valve four-cam V6 that develops 220 horsepower at 5,800rpm and
31.0 kilogramme-metres of torque at 4,800rpm. Thanks to Toyota's
computer-controlled VVT-i (variable valve timing-intelligent)
system, the smooth-revving powerplant provides exceptional
performance and low emissions. Acceleration from start to 100km/h
is claimed at 8.9 seconds.
	   Transmission is a Super ECT four-speed automatic that comes with
three driving modes (economy, sport, winter) that responds to all
driving conditions. Also included in the transmission system is a
manual shift button behind the steering wheel that allows the
driver to shift manually with hands still on the wheel.
	   A 50-50 full-time four-wheel-drive system is supported by an
electronic traction control and ABS brakes working on four disc
brakes for optimum performance. Independent MacPherson strut
layouts are used in both front and rear suspensions.
	   Passive safety highlights include dual front and side airbags,
seatbelts with pretensioners and belt force limiters, a GOA
uniframe safety structure, a four-link wiper blade and discharged
headlights for optimum visibility.
	   Standard features include automatic climate control, leather
upholstery, wooden veneer, five-door central locking with remote,
electric mirror and windows, sound system with CD player, etc.
	   The rear seats could be easily folded for increased luggage
space with a one-touch operation, while backrest recline and
legroom could also be adjusted.
	   The TV monitor located on top of the centre console displays
information regarding the climate control system, sound system,
etc.
	   The Harrier measures 4,575mm in length, 1,815mm in width and
1,665mm in height. Wheelbase in 2,615mm while front and rear track
are 1,565mm and 1,550mm respectively.

Azerbaijan may seek international arbitration in oil deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ The government of Azerbaijan may seek
international arbitration in the dispute between its state-run oil
company and an international consortium over a pipeline for early
Caspian Sea oil.
	   The pipeline will cost dlrs 591 million, which is dlrs 276
million more than the international consortium estimated, the
deputy chief of the oil company said.
	   The consortium insists that Azerbaijan make up the difference
through its share of oil sales. Azerbaijan says it will not
compensate the consortium for its mistake.
	   Azerbaijan also believes the dlrs 591 price tag is too high,
said the oil company official, Ilkham Aliev, who is also a son of
Azerbaijani President Geidar Aliev.
	   The pipeline would run from Baku, the Azerbaijani capital on the
Caspian, to Supsa, a Georgian port on the Black Sea. It is expected
to carry 5 million tons (33.5 million barrels) a year.
	   The route for the main export pipeline has yet to be determined,
but Azerbaijan has indicated it favors a Turkish proposal over
those put forward by Russia, Georgia and Ukraine.
	   Ilkham Aliev suggested Wednesday that if Azerbaijan and the
consortium failed to come to terms in three months, the government
would have to turn to international arbitration.
	   The consortium is made up of 11 oil companies from seven
countries _ including American firms Amoco, Exxon, Pennzoil and
Unocal.
	   Azerbaijan's Caspian Sea reserves are believed to be the world's
richest after the Middle East.

	   There should be no place for racial prejudice by citizens of
this country against fellow citizens. The preamble of Indonesia's
1945 Constitution clearly states that one of the nation's duties is
to protect all the people. This statement is placed ahead of
defending the fatherland, or advancing the general welfare and
intellectual life of the citizenry, though the latter ideals are no
less important.
	   As a unitary nation, we should not think in divisive terms,
loyal only to our own particular ``tribe,'' ``race'' or ethnicity.
Arab-Indonesian, Chinese-Indonesians, Indian-Indonesian,
European-Indonesian, as well as what are usually called
``indigenous'' Indonesians: Batak, Minangkabau, Balinese, Timorese,
Sundanese, Javanese, Jakartans, Irianese, Ambonese and all the
rest, live together in this country.
	   Indonesian unity is an ideal, and it is truly a worthwhile
cause. How else can we achieve the peace and harmony needed to
build a strong economic base and advance living standards? If for
example, Sundanese hated Javanese, or vice versa, and conflict
situations existed, on a nationwide scale, Indonesia might as well
be 300 different countries, or some similar number. But the fact
is, we aren't.
	   I will remind those who doubt we have gradually been successful
in forging a national unity, by pointing out there have been
numerous mixed marriages among various ethnic groups. The offspring
of an Acehnese man and a Manadonese woman -- to take an example I
personally know about -- can be nothing other than Indonesian. It
was part fun and part experiment for me, some years ago, to ask
schoolchildren in the town of Waikabubak on Sumba island, who
Indonesia's first vice president was. Those kids immediately knew,
using Indonesian, the same language I used to communicate with
them.
	   Last May 15 -- the day after the massive riots in Jakarta -- I
was walking through a side alley in my neighborhood and noticed
some newly scrawled racist graffiti on a wall. Somebody had written
hate slogans and I made a plan to visit a paint shop after the
situation had calmed down (perhaps later in the month) to
spray-paint over those words.
	   I needn't have bothered. Two days later, in the afternoon, I
came across a Betawi (Jakartan) neighborhood elder with his two
sons, who had brushes and a can to paint away the offensive words.
They told me that someone from outside our area had been trying to
sow hatred in the neighborhood. I am telling this story to show
that not all Indonesians have ethnic loathing in their hearts.
Unity is still an ideal for many enough citizens, it seems. But let
us beware of divisive forces at work in our society that tend to
undermine that unity.

	   The Volvo V70 XT's added features does provide a dash of style
to their earlier wagons and gives you the worth for the extra money
you pay, reports Kingsley Wijayasinha.
	   The Volvo V70 XT might not classify as an off-roader or even a
sports utility, but this turbocharged wagon definitely does provide
that extra touch of freedom while retaining the famous practicality
of Volvo wagons.
	   The initials ''XT'' stand for cross-terrain, which does explain
the concept of the car. Based on the standard V70 2.3T model, the
XT come with several extra features ranging from a heightened
suspension, new bumpers to roof racks and coolers.
	   But don't mistake the V70 XT for the V70 XC that was introduced
last year. The big difference is that the latter comes with an
automatic all-wheel-drive system (AWD) and traction control that
makes it much more versatile under rugged conditions. But that's
going to cost a lot, and would seem inappropriate, especially in a
time when the market is slowing and sales are down.
	   Retail price for the V70 XT is Bt2.389 million, but V70 owners
can get their standard wagons fitted with the same features. That's
if they happen to have a spare Bt250,000 to hand.
	   The front and rear bumpers, with fibre lining that goes all the
way to wrap the entire body, are larger and gives a bolder, tougher
appearance to the car while the ''XT'' and ''Cross Terrain''
stickers on the rear doors and hatch distinguish it from standard
V70's. A fibre side skirt and rear spoiler with brake light gives
the finishing touch.
	   Other exterior differences are the new front air dam with
foglights and a new, meaner grille. Dual exhaust pipes add a sense
of sportiness to the rear while a heightened suspension with
16-inch mag wheels gives the car a robust look.
	   Since it is based on the standard V70, it comes with the same
engine -- a 20-valve five-cylinder 2.3-litre that is souped up with
a light-pressure turbo. The powerplant develops 190 brake
horsepower at 5,400rpm, which is almost 30bhp lower than the T-5
high-pressure turbo version, but the 270Nm (newton-metres) of
maximum torque could be produced right from just 1,800rpm and goes
all the way to 4,800rpm. This engine is flexible! The low-pressure
turbo and cross-terrain concept does go together well, since the
rich low-rev torque will show its benefit especially when going
uphill or on rugged surfaces -- the natural environments of the XT.
	   And thanks to the low-pressure turbo, the problem of turbo lag
has been successfully taken care of, the engine responding
instantly to throttle inputs. The XT performs well in stop-and-go
traffic, taking off with respectable acceleration, and provides
adequate pulling power for comfortable overtaking. The only area
that it might not stand out strongly is high-speed acceleration,
which appears to be just average.
	   However, there seems to be a high level of engine noise entering
the cabin, even at cruising speeds.
	   The four-speed automatic gearbox shifts smoothly, and comes with
three driving modes -- sport, economy and winter. The buttons for
these programmes, which earlier used to cause some inconveniency
since they were located on the left of the gearshift lever, has
been moved to the centre and are now easier to select.
	   Despite possessing a similar chassis layout with the standard
version (front spring strut and rear multi-link), height has been
increased by 35 millimetres to tackle more demanding surfaces.
	   On normal highways, the suspension performs similarly to the
original, but the increased height results in more body roll than
usual. However, it also takes care of vibrations better, especially
sharp inputs from potholes and speed bumps. The extra height is
also advantageous in terms of mobility, especially when going
through floods.
	   Not counting the increased roll, handling is similar to the
standard version, with the solid steering feel accompanied by a
good level of understeer during heavy acceleration. Traction
control (Tracs), which could be found in the T-5 model and would
greatly suit the ''Cross Terrain'' concept as well as minimising
understeer, is not available.
	   The four-wheel-discs have ample stopping power and the
smooth-pulsing ABS starts to activate only in extreme braking
conditions. The brake pedal, however, is a bit firm and needs a
strong kick to get the message.
	   The rack-and-pinion power steering has a best-in-class turning
radius of only 5.1 metres, and has a rather good weight, although
if it was lighter at parking speeds it would be even better.
	   Both the reach and rake of the steering wheel could be adjusted,
and for safety reasons the steering column is collapsible during a
frontal collision.
	   The interior is highlighted by the two-tone steering wheel and
console, with wooden veneers adding the luxury.
	   Both front seats are powered, with three memory positions for
the driver seat, and there are manually-adjusted lumbar support
knobs for both.
	   Performance of the air-conditioner might not impress everyone,
but considering the interior volume of the wagon, it does justify
itself. But cost-cutting is seen again as the controls for the a/c
are all manually-operated rather than coming with automatic
temperature settings.
	   Apart from traction control, something that would benefit the
traveller, but is available only in the T-5, is the info switch
which displays data such as average fuel consumption, remaining
distance until fuel runs out, temperature, etc. Another
cost-cutting that is easily detected is the disappearance of the
vanity mirror on the driver side.
	   But major components like electric windows, mirrors (with
defroster) and central locks with remote are included, as well as a
top-notch sound system with both a three-disc (front unit) and
six-disc cd-changer (luggage compartment). It even comes with a
built-in Dolby Pro Logic surround processor that improves imaging
dramatically.
	   The master switches for the electric windows, located on the
driver armrest, have automatic function for the driver-side, but
are too firm and the automatic function doesn't work for closing.
	   Other standard features for the XT are aluminium side steps,
roll bar in the engine room, roof racks and 16-inch mags with
205/55 tyres.
	   Our demonstration car also came with the ''Lifestyle'' option
list that stresses the XT's concept further. A highlight is a
DC-powered cooler for both hot and cold drinks located in the
luggage compartment area and held in position by a safety belt.
Others are roof rack for bicycles, sun visors for the rear windows,
coin tray, luggage nets and extra reading lights for both front and
rear.
	   If you think the conventional Volvo wagon is already outstanding
in terms of practicality, the V70 XT goes a step further, although
with a price. The XT is still far from being a true ''Cross
Terrain'' without the AWD system, or at least some sort of traction
control, but it is still a good move by Volvo to stimulate the
market by introducing continuous improvements to its existing
products.

	   PENANG, Mon. - The Penang Island Municipal Council and the
Penang Development Corporation will co-operate fully with the
Anti-Corruption Agency should it decide to investigate the
allegation of unfair allocation of stalls at the Lebuh Gat Macallum
Market Complex.
	   Chief Minister Tan Sri Dr Koh Tsu Koon said this in a statement
today in response to allegations of impropriety by 10 traders at
the Prangin market.
	   The disgruntled traders charged that the whole procedure, from
the purchase of land from the PDC to the allocation of stalls,
lacked transparency and there was impropriety by ``certain key
people.''
	   Koh, who is also PDC chairman, said he had directed the council
and PDC to make all documents related to the market complex project
available if the ACA requested for them.
	   The council and the PDC had also been asked to give full reports
to Koh regarding the matter.
	   ``Both organisations will prepare Press statements to inform the
public about the background of the project, and the principles and
procedures involved in the resettlement exercise conducted by the
council,'' Koh added.
	   The RM62 million project, privatised to the Prangin Market
Traders Association by the PDC, will provide facilities for the
resettlement of traders from the Prangin market.
	   The Prangin market site will make way for a coastal road
development project and phase five of Komtar.
	   A total of 202 traders at the Prangin market will be relocated
to the complex next year.

	   We were very unpleasantly surprised to read an article on June
2, 1998 in your esteemed newspaper, which stands for a serious and
professional Indonesian daily. The article, titled Kosovo: Method
in Milosevic's madness by Gwynne Dyer, was full of rude
anti-Yugoslav and anti-Serbian attitudes, in which the president of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was unscrupulously offended.
	   Following writings of your newspaper for many years we could
have not noticed that it is in its policy to offend any president
of any country, including presidents of this country.
	   For this mentioned offense and the numerous untruths,
half-truths and the intentionally twisted ``facts'', the article in
question could be even a subject of an official lawsuit.

	   In his letter of June 30, Mr. Sumarsono finds fault with the
fact that many Chinese-Indonesians chose to flee the country during
the riots which engulfed Indonesia several weeks ago. He also cites
their siege mentality, feeling of victimization and lack of
commitment as reasons why they will continue to be victimized. Mr.
Sumarsono prefers to blame the victim rather than look in the
mirror and realize that, because of people with attitudes like his,
Indonesia is a country where the ethnic minority is systematically
persecuted and lives under the constant threat of racial terror.
	   First it needs to be stated that many Chinese-Indonesians did
not leave the country before the riots broke out and we all know
the consequences they suffered.Rampaging mobs stopping cars and
motorcycles, and if the riders were ethnic Chinese, the vehicles
were burned on the spot, the people beaten. Reports of rape of
Chinese-Indonesian women by rioters are also widespread. Many
shop/houses were ransacked and burned. Unfortunately, in this
arrangement the owner's family often inhabits the top floor of the
shop/house, and if the rioters set the bottom floor ablaze we can
only wonder at the fate of its inhabitants trapped on the top
floor. Even private residences were not exempt with whole housing
complexes being invaded and ransacked by the mobs.
	   Its easy to understand why Chinese-Indonesian would try to
escape in a crisis. They face discrimination on every level of
government and society. Differentiated from natives by their
identification card numbers, they must pay extra legal fees to
process even the simplest of documents. Subject to restrictive
quotas by government universities and excluded from employment in
the civil service and Armed Forces, is it any wonder that they
choose to become entrepreneurs? We all saw the signs posted in
front of stores and houses which read ``native Moslem property''
despite the fact that Islam is a religion which is universal and
knows no racial differentiation. Is this the reaction of an
inclusive society or one which is fundamentally exclusive as well
as pervasively racist?
	   Many political and social observers cite the disparity in
economic wealth as the reason for the riots. If this is true, why
weren't the scores of corrupt officials who live opulent lifestyles
which cannot possibly be supported by their meager salaries as
civil servants made targets? Mom-and-pop stores selling instant
noodles, soft drinks and rice hardly qualify as financial giants
but were also vandalized and burned for the sole reason that the
owners were Chinese-Indonesian.
	   Among the demands of reformers is increased democracy and the
enforcement of human rights. Democracy guarantees the rights of all
its citizens regardless of race or religion and human rights are
just that, universal rights for all people.
	   I think that in the spirit of reforms, it is time that all
Indonesians contemplate the true meaning of the concepts of human
rights and democracy, as well as how to apply them universally and
fairly to all layers and segments of society including the ethnic
Chinese minority. Until this society does so, real democracy and
genuinely universal human rights will remain an elusive dream, and
innocent people will continue to be persecuted.

	   Does the Democrat Party's economic team still exist? If it does,
the public is not quite sure whether the once much-hyped members
are team players. More disheartening is the fact that the Democrats
no longer boast about this selling point. This underlines the grave
economic situation the country is facing.
	   The names frequently mentioned today are either Deputy Prime
Minister Dr Supachai Panitchpakdi or Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanahaeminda, who have to endure persistent news that they still
don't see eye to eye with each other, and that the worst is yet to
come.
	   Already six months in office, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and
his team must have realised that their task of propping up the
economy proved far more daunting than expected and probably beyond
their capability, taking into account the pressure for them to
produce results before the public completely loses faith and
confidence in the government.
	   Should we presume that we are heading towards a worse condition
and that the chance to stop the economic tailspin is no more than
zero?
	   When the Democrats campaigned for votes in the previous
election, they lined up a list of candidates with impressive track
records. They represented the Who's Who of economic managers in
politics, unmatched by other parties. Even the Chat Pattana Party,
which also boasts its own economic team, had to step aside because
it was incomparable.
	   Those much-touted people have suddenly become quiet. There were
no comments from them on economic issues. It could be that they
allowed only Dr Supachai and Tarrin to speak for the government
while they were acting as back-room supporters. A problem is that
the public does not think that is what is actually going on.
	   Let's guess then. Do the Democrats feel increasingly uneasy over
the obvious failure to effect an economic turnaround, and that
disquiet would soon become nervousness and then alarm?
	   Of course, there must have been some worries among the Democrats
that they will not be able to sport a brave face when it's time for
them to ask the angry voters for continued support. They have to
produce a very nice explanation as to why they could not achieve
what they were expected to.
	   They are losing their grip; that's what the public perceives.
And this is not good at all. The Democrats can still think that
they remain the best now and the public does not have much choice
-- another alternative is the New Aspiration Party (NAP).
	   ''This government is still the best under present
circumstances,'' argue the people who shudder at the thought of
having Gen Chavalit Yongchaiyudh and his team back to govern. It
was enough somehow to prevent critics of the Chuan administration
from becoming harsher with their attacks.
	   The NAP just does not care. Its members are rejoicing when they
see the Democrats struggle hard to tame the economic turbulence --
and not yet showing any signs of success. They believe that it
would not take long before they would be on a par with the
Democrats if the government's economic rescue efforts flop.
	   They score more points somewhere else. The NAP heavyweights shed
crocodile tears for the poor, scoff at the urban rich and blame the
Democrats for a twisted irony that the two layers in society should
suffer simultaneously.
	   A disturbing question is: What do the Democrats intend to do
from now on until the election, amidst signs of falling popularity?
	   For the public: What should the people expect if the Democrats
finally fail to live up to their expectations? Will disappointment
turn into anger and outburst which can lead to unpredictable
consequences?
	   It might not be wrong for those who still believe that the
Democrats remain an acceptable choice as the coalition leader after
the next election. The Democrats have to see the light, no matter
how pain they feel, that their leader Chuan will not be a selling
point. A third term of premiership would be too much for him, and
for the country.
	   And Chuan should understand his limits, no matter how much
self-confidence he has. The fast-changing times are having effects
on him and the country needs a better replacement and certainly
that person must not be among the present party leaders.
	   Chavalit must be kidding if he still thinks that he deserves
another chance. Does he think ex-president Suharto would ever
forgive him for the collapse of his empire? Will Dr Mahathir
Mohamad want to see him in Kuala Lumpur if the Malaysian economy
manages to survive the currently growing adversity by that time?
	   The Democrats have to plan for the future. Of course, they are
doing exactly that, thus such advice is unwarranted. The hard task
is to find someone to succeed Chuan. The modest man from Trang
province must not be punished by taking the third term through an
election. Cabinet reshuffles excluded.
	   There has been idle talk that the party should woo, persuade,
cajole, plead, request, or beg Anand Panyarachun to take the party
leadership to ensure public support for the party and restore
public hope that continuity will stoke recovery.
	   If Anand agrees, of course, because he has been shunning
politics by being actively in politics all along. What he has been
doing right now is something like prime minister without portfolio,
anyway.
	   This arrangement, with Anand as the Democrat leader, can last a
few years, or even longer if he delivers, until another generation
takes over. That person could be Dr Supachai, Tarrin, or other
Democrats who believe that they are big enough for their britches.
	   This is a short-term solution for the Democrats, for long-term
economic results, with political reforms as a by-product which
eventually lays down a foundation for transparency, good governance
or whatever ideals we hope for, as frequently sought by Anand.
	   If the Democrats don't like this idea, it's not entirely
unexpected. It's not their fault either. They are just like that by
nature, and political heritage. But they should present a better
choice before the people truly realise that they are not that smart
after all.

	   Thailand needs to give recognition to its human-rights defenders
of yesteryear and today as we commemorate the 50th anniversary of
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Otherwise this year-long
celebration would not help increase awareness on the important role
which human rights play in our society and everyday life.
	   Thailand was among the first 48 countries which signed and
ratified the declaration when it was adopted in 1948. According to
the declaration, everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and
expression and the right to peaceful assembly and association.
However, over the past five decades, Thailand has not been immune
to human-rights violations.
	   To celebrate this special event, the Thai government has set up
a national committee in March chaired by Justice Minister Suthas
Ngernmuen together with six sub-committees to work out plans for
the year-long commemoration. These activities include issuing a
special phone-card, conducting seminars, and reviewing laws related
to human rights. The initial plan calling for special commemorative
stamps has, however, been cancelled.
	   Judging from the planned programmes and activities, there seems
to be little substance in the commemoration. Besides, it reflects
the shallow thinking of Thai officials who are prone to believe
that the commemoration amounts to nothing more than a publicity
exercise.
	   The Thai people have yet to take the concept of human rights
seriously. Owing to the country's violent past, as reflected in the
events in October 1973 and 1976 as well as May 1992, the Thai
public usually associate the violation of human rights with armed
confrontation between those in uniform and civilians.
	   Certainly for the three decades between 1950 and 1980 when
communist ideology was considered a major threat to the country's
security and stability, very few people criticised the detentions
without trial, disappearances and extrajudicial killings as
violations of basic human rights. Thais in general believe that
there are no human-rights violations from rampant shootings by
errant law-enforcers. That explains why the demonstrations by
labour groups and non-governmental and grass-roots organisations
have not received much moral support from the public at large. Some
of these rallies are even labelled social nuisances.
	   The protection of human rights covers individual, civil,
political, and workers' rights as set forth in the declaration.
These rights include freedom from torture or other cruel, inhuman,
or degrading treatment or punishment. It also states that all
people have the inalienable right to change their government by
peaceful means and to enjoy basic freedoms without discrimination
on the basis of race, religion, national origin or sex.
	   Most importantly, as stipulated in the new Constitution adopted
last year, universal human rights aim to incorporate the respect
for human dignity into the processes of government and law. In this
respect Thailand still has a long way to go despite the existing
liberal-democratic atmosphere.
	   The country is a signatory to only a few of all 24 international
human-rights conventions. Thailand last year signed the Covenant of
Civil and Political rights after years of delay due to the
Parliament's bureaucratic red tapes and MPs' lack of understanding.
But Bangkok has yet to accede to Covenant of Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights.
	   To ensure that the commemoration would not be a wasteful
exercise, it is crucial that the Thai government give recognition
to some of our more prominent human-rights defenders. Without
knowing and learning of these people's dedication and sacrifices,
how can the public appreciate, let alone value and respect human
rights? In addition, to sustain and protect fundamental rights
there is a need for a new generation of human-rights fighters.
	   For instance, Thongbai Thongbao could be named one of the
country's foremost human-rights defenders along with Vitit
Muntarbhorn of Chulalongkorn University. Both of them have spent
most of their lives fighting against all forms of totalitarianism.
	   As a lawyer, Thongbai has defended hundred of cases of
human-rights violations in this country. As an educator, Vitit uses
his knowledge to raise awareness in Thailand and the whole region
of all aspects of human rights. At the same time there are also
labour-union and farmers' leaders who have sacrificed their lives
in defending those bodies' rights, many of them unknown and
unrecognised.
	   The UN Human Rights Commission has approved a declaration on
human-rights defenders which will be adopted by the UN General
Assembly at the end of the year. It says that ''everybody has the
right, individually and in association with others, to promote and
to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and
fundamental freedoms at the national and international level''.
	   It is unfortunate that Thailand does recognise human-rights
defenders as do other countries. Well-known human-rights fighters
such as Czech President Vaclav Havel, South African President
Nelson Mandela and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung virtually
walked out of prisons to become national leaders.
	   Finally there is a question closely associated with the
human-rights issue -- the quality and commitment of Thai
politicians, who constitute the largest pool of Thai leadership.
Without their active support, the promotion of human rights will be
stymied as many archaic pieces of legislation need to be repealed
or amended in Parliament. All this can only be done with their
consent and unwavering support.
	   If Thailand's history is any judge, politicians and those in
uniform have been colluding with one another to block the
development of the promotion of human rights in Thailand. They feel
that if the public enjoyed greater human rights, their existence as
societal arbitrators would be restricted. The delay in the
establishment of the national commission on human rights was a case
in point. Now under the new Constitution the commission will be set
up within two years, and that is an important step forward.

	   DEPUTY Finance Minister Datuk Dr Affifudin Omar said Pengurusan
Danaharta Nasional Bhd may raise more funds through issuance of
bonds if the initial amount is insufficient.
	   ``The mechanism of the company allows it to issue more bonds ...
(But) the company just started its operations. Let the management
assess the situation first.''
	   Affifudin said the bonds may only be issued if the initial RM25
billion is insufficient, and this decision would be made by the
Cabinet. Last Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister
Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said the national asset management company
may need about RM25 billion to take up the non-performing loans of
the banking system.
	   The company will initially raise RM10 billion through the issue
of bonds locally and abroad. Of this, the equivalent of US$1
billion (RM4 billion) to US$2 billion would be sourced from the
international bond market. The bonds are Government-guaranteed.
	   Pengurusan Danaharta was formed by the Government to deal with
banks' non-performing loans, which stood at 9.3 per cent of total
outstanding loans as at March this year.
	   The establishment of the AMC is aimed at reviving still-viable
assets and allowing banks to focus on their daily operations, both
of which the Government hopes would assist in the economy recovery.
	   Affifudin said with the NPLs taken over by Pengurusan Danaharta,
the banks would be able to increase their efficiency and liquidity.
	   ``The recent (lending) problem faced by the banks is because
they do not have enough liquidity. They will have more liquidity if
they are not burdened with NPLs.''
	   He was speaking to reporters after officiating the Asia Pacific
Co- operation Customs Industry Dialogue or Acid '98 in Kuala Lumpur
yesterday.
	   Affifudin said the setting up of Pengurusan Danaharta was
similar to the ``Brady scheme'' and has proven to be successful
when it was implemented in Latin America.
	   He refuted claims that Pengurusan Danaharta was set up as
``bail-out''
	   agency adding that the company is taking the collateral pledge
to the banks.
	   Earlier, Affifudin said the customs law, regulations and
procedures need to be more transparent so as to ensure certainty
which would benefit those involved in trade.
	   Although the issue has been tackled by the Apec Sub Committee on
Customs Procedures, he said there still remained a lot to be done
in terms of ensuring a greater degree of simplification of customs
clearance procedures.
	   Jointly organised by the Customs and Excise Department of
Malaysia and the National Chamber of Commerce and Industry of
Malaysia, the dialogue precedes the annual Apec leader's meeting to
be held in Kuala Lumpur in November.

	   It has been almost a month since the riots that rocked Jakarta
between May 13 and May 15. The wounds from the violence, arson and
looting of those days are, however, still far from healed. With a
countless number of shops and businesses destroyed and their owners
having fled to other countries or safe havens here in Indonesia,
our daily commerce has yet to fully return to normal.
	   Considering the fact that last month's riots left thousands of
people without a job or livelihood, it would be wrong to say that
our fellow citizens of Chinese ancestry -- more popularly referred
to as ``nonindigenous Indonesians'' -- were the exclusive
casualties of the rioting. Nevertheless, Chinese-Indonesians were
the ones who bore the brunt of the tragedy. Minority groups of any
category -- religious, ethnic or racial -- make easy targets for
the airing of social discontent. This could explain the feelings of
animosity, bred by envy, that exists among many Indonesians toward
those among them who are of Chinese descent.
	   Such feelings of hostility and envy, as historians have often
pointed out, existed among Indonesians even before the country
became independent. Chinese immigrants prospered under the old
colonial system, while the indigenous population was left to occupy
the lowest rank on the social ladder. Since then, although access
to better education and life opportunities have gradually became
available to more and more indigenous Indonesians, anti-Chinese
sentiments have continued to ferment, especially among less
privileged Indonesians.
	   The interesting question, however, remains: Why did such
anti-Chinese sentiment in the past rarely explode with such
calamitous force as was seen in Jakarta last month? The answer to
this question may be for our historians and sociologists to find.
One explanation that has been offered, however, is that the dubious
practice of engaging certain well-liked Chinese-Indonesian
associates as business partners of indigenous Indonesians in power
has widened the divide between Chinese and indigenous Indonesians.
The fact that their business dealings were often perceived by the
public as shady in nature, obviously did not help to make things
better.
	   From the Chinese-Indonesian point of view, one complaint is that
they have been practically shut out of all other fields except
business. They feel that this has contributed to their ``economic
animal'' image -- one that they, in fact, would like to shed as
soon as opportunity allows; hence the formation of an
Chinese-Indonesian political party soon after Soeharto's fall.
	   Whatever the actual reasons may be for the continuing irrational
anti-Chinese sentiment that widely exists among indigenous
Indonesians, it is high time that we begin making some serious
efforts to resolve the problem. Government and private think tanks
could provide a valuable contribution by doing the necessary
research. The Malaysian model of preserving harmony in a
multiracial society may be worth studying in this context.
	   To live as one nation, undivided by ethnicity, language, race or
religion is not only an ideal that is enshrined in our national
philosophy Pancasila, it is also one that was publicly proclaimed
as early as 1928 in what has since become known as the 1928 Youths'
Pledge. As a policy goal, that ideal was publicly pronounced in the
early years of our independence by then vice president Mohammad
Hatta. The job that awaits us now is to give substance to that
ideal. Unless we do so, racial strife and economic disruptions may
continue to hound us, even as the new century dawns and makes a
mockery of our stated ideal to become a modern nation.

	   NIIT (M) Sdn Bhd, the local subsidiary of the India-based IT
company NIIT Ltd, yesterday launched its Software Solutions
business in the country and hopes to turn in total revenue of RM127
million in five years, said managing director Rahul Patwardhan.
	   With the launch of the Software Solutions business, NIIT
Malaysia assumed from Singapore operations the role as the Asean
headquarters for NIIT Ltd and will establish a software development
centre here to support its parent company's global business, he
added. The Multimedia Super Corridor-status company, which
commenced operations in January this year, has surpassed its modest
whole-year revenue target for 1998 by generating RM5 million within
five months.
	   The company expects by the year 2000 to make up 25 per cent of
NIIT Ltd's Asean business expected to record a total revenue of
RM400 million by the turn of the millennium.
	   Bullish on its activities here, NIIT Malaysia will continue
recruiting locals to make up 50 per cent of its staff in three
years' time and has allocated a sum of RM32 million for investment
purposes for the next five years.
	   Patwardhan said this in Kuala Lumpur after the official launch
of NIIT Malaysia's Software Solutions business by Multimedia
Development Corporation chief operating officer Dr Mohamed Arif
Nun.
	   The new unit under NIIT Malaysia, called NIIT Consulting,
Software and Systems Integration Business Group, will focus its
activities in the government, transportation, manufacturing,
telecommunication and financial services sectors.
	   It offers to these sectors IT services such as IT consulting,
systems integration, software development, professional services,
implementation, facilities management and outsourcing.
	   Its technology activities include client-servers,
Internet/Intranet, networking, multimedia, workflow, Year 2000
solutions and enterprise resource planning.
	   Patwardhan said the company's SSB unit is expected to contribute
60 to 70 per cent to its five-year target revenue figure.
	   On the parent company's decision to shift its regional
headquarters from Singapore to Malaysia, he said the move was made
due to higher operating costs in Singapore.
	   NIIT Malaysia, which has 20 employees hopes to increase its
strength to over 100 in five years.

	   The city administration, beset by a deluge of complaints over
new tap water rates, decided yesterday to lower them by an average
of 25 percent starting next month.
	   Governor Sutiyoso said the decision was made after the two
foreign business partners of city-owned water management company
PDAM Jaya agreed to the new tariff proposals.
	   Tariffs for affluent customers will not be affected.
	   Customers categorized in middle and low economic brackets --
such as residents of low-cost apartments, buildings for social
services, houses of worship and hospitals -- would have their rates
lowered by 17 percent, he said.
	   ``The new tariff is still set under the cross-subsidy principle
in that the wealthy customers subsidize those of the middle to
lower class.''
	   Sutiyoso could not provide further details on new tariffs and
told reporters to check with PDAM.
	   The city administration raised tap water tariffs by an average
of 25 percent April 1. The highest increase of 65.71 percent was
imposed at that time on affluent customers, with the cost per cubic
meter of water rising from Rp 1,175 to Rp 2,545.
	   Tariffs for middle income families were raised by 38.36 percent,
from Rp 930 to Rp 1,935 per cubic meter, while those for poorer
families went up 38 percent from Rp 775 to Rp 1,600.
	   PDAM made the increases after it signed a 25-year cooperation
agreement with PT Kekar-Thames Airindo (Kati), a joint venture
between former president Soeharto's eldest son Sigit Hardjojudanto
and Thames Water International of Britain, and PT Garuda Dipta
Semesta (GDS), a cooperation between the giant Salim business group
and Lyonnaise des Eaux of France.
	   Customers strongly protested the increase in the midst of the
economic crisis.
	   The administration subsequently canceled the cooperation last
month as the contracts with the two joint venture firms were
believed to have been won through nepotistic and collusive
practices.
	   PDAM then established new deals with the foreign partners.
	   City Council urged the administration on Monday to lower the
tariffs as promised following the revocation of the cooperation
agreements.
	   Sutiyoso said yesterday the administration had not dragged its
feet on its previous pledge to lower the tariffs. The delay was due
to lengthy negotiations with its partners, he said.
	   ``The decision was made through a hard struggle because we had
to negotiate with our partners as we have a commitment to them.''
	   The governor mentioned several issues which had to be considered
before establishing the new tariffs, such as the smaller revenues
to be collected by PDAM even as it had to pay off huge debts.
	   ``We also had to consider maintenance costs, salaries for
employees and so on. Following that, we found the 25 percent
decrease to be the most reasonable.''
	   The governor said he would ask members of his staff to soon make
an explanation before the City Council.
	   Meanwhile, head of the council's Commission C for financial
affairs, Amarullah Asbah, warmly welcomed the tariff decrease and
said: ``We are waiting for the executive's explanation on it.''
	   He recommended that the move should be followed by efforts to
reduce leakages in water production and distribution, estimated to
reach up to 40 percent.

	   THE Securities Commission has proposed that the Government raise
the foreign equity cap in local stockbroking firms to 70 per cent
from 49 per cent currently.
	   The idea is to attract foreign parties into the current effort
to assist ailing stockbroking firms, SC chairman Datuk Dr Mohd
Munir Majid said yesterday.
	   He also called on other strong local stockbrokers to emulate the
example of Hwang-DBS Securities Bhd in assisting clients of ailing
stockbroking firms, should their licences be revoked - as in the
case of Omega Securities Sdn Bhd.
	   ``I am not saying more stockbroking licences may be revoked.
But, it is better to be prepared,'' he said at the SC office in
Kuala Lumpur.
	   Munir said the SC initiated the reimbursement scheme some weeks
ago, and Hwang-DBS had come forward to assist in the case of Omega
clients.
	   The scheme was initiated to keep the existing RM314 million
Compensation Fund - managed by the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange -
from being depleted.
	   ``We have approached a number of other strong stockbroking
firms, but Hwang-DBS was the only one to come forward with full
gusto.''
	   As an incentive a participating stockbroker would be allowed to
open additional branches - subject to minimum capital investment
requirements.
	   But this incentive is only applicable to the reimbursement
scheme which, Munir pointed out, was not tied in any way with the
SC's prerogative to revoke or suspend any stockbroker's licence.
	   Hwang-DBS, which is contributing RM70 million towards the
reimbursement scheme for Omega Securities' clients, would now be
allowed to operate a new branch in Shah Alam, Selangor - where
Omega Securities operated.
	   Hwang-DBS managing director Datuk Hwang Sing Lue, who was also
present at the Press conference, said the branch would be opened in
a few months.
	   Under the reimbursement scheme, Hwang-DBS will be sending by
June 15 letters to eligible clients of Omega Securities.Replies
opting to accept payments must be in by June 30.
	   KPMG Peat Marwick have been appointed as special auditor to
verify these clients.
	   Those who fail to meet the deadline will have to claim from the
KLSE Compensation Fund. Remisiers will have to seek other legal
redress under contract laws for their deposits paid and other
claims.
	   Payments to eligible clients of Omega Securities under the
reimbursement scheme will be made at the KLSE between July 13 and
17 between 9am and 5pm.

	   Not only does the World Cup, which kicks off today, promise
hectic competition, but a respite to the country's looming
political and economic tension.
	   Minister of Defense and Security/Armed Forces Chief Gen. Wiranto
was quick yesterday to use the momentum of the sporting fiesta to
call on a lay-off to any movement that could lead to mass
deployment.
	   ``Wish you enjoy the matches and let's take a break from the
frenzied, energy-sapping campaign for sweeping reform,'' Wiranto
was quoted by general secretary of the Ministry of Defense and
Security Lt. Gen. Suyono in a World Cup get-together with
diplomatic circle.
	   ``World Cup should give us delight and consolation amid
adversities,'' said Wiranto.
	   The country has seen major political reform spearheaded by
students peak in the resignation of Soeharto as the republic's
president after 32 years in power. Yet political tension remained
unsettled.
	   Suyono said he and Wiranto, who chairs the Indonesian Contract
Bridge Association and the Indonesian Karate Association, expected
to watch as many matches as possible on television.
	   ``All we need is good physical fitness to stay up late, watching
World Cup matches, whereas we still have to keep our mind fresh to
talk about reform,'' Suyono said.
	   Most matches will start at 10.30 p.m. and 2 a.m. West Indonesia
Time.
	   Chile's Charges d'Affairs Diego Velasco, who spoke in fluent
Indonesia, shared Suyono's view.
	   Chile, a country smaller than Indonesia was once struck by the
similar economic and politic crisis but on its way to recovery,
soccer still became beloved sport, Velasco said.
	   ``First soccer then politics, give soccer 20 hours a day and
politics will recover,'' said the diplomat who married a Javanese.
	   In line with Velasco was the France's Cultural Counselor
Phillipe Martel who was amazed by the spirit and enthusiasm across
the country to welcome the World Cup despite the crisis.
	   He lamented that most of the matches are broadcast early morning
or late at night in Indonesia.
	   ``I'm afraid Indonesia's soccer fans will not get proper rest
and the condition will influence their working rhythm,'' Martel
said through his interpreter.
	   The French Embassy earlier wished to hold a special event to
mark the soccer tournament, Martel said.
	   ``But we don't think what we will do is comparable to what have
been done by all TV channels and newspapers,'' he said.
	   Ambassadors who attended the party wished the World Cup a
success and all teams would perform their best.
	   Then each of them began to hail their own national teams.
	   The South Africa Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Ambassador
B.S. Kubheka proudly claimed to be fanatic supporter of the South
African 'bafana-bafana (the boys).
	   ``It's the first time that South Africa gets honor to play in
the World Cup, what else can we expect, survive the first round and
win ticket for the second round is a bonus,'' he said.
	   Croatian Ambassador Zeljko Kirincic said his national team,
another World Cup first-timer, was well-prepared and could hope to
finish first in Group H, where it meets Argentina, Jamaica and
Japan.
	   ``I've talked to Argentine Ambassador. We agree that on paper
Argentina is tougher but we must be better on the field,'' Kirincic
said.
	   At least 11 ambassadors and Governor Sutiyoso attended the World
Cup'98 welcome party organized by noted soccer commentator Eddy
Sofyan and associates at the Hilton's executive club yesterday.
	   Eddy said the party was a routine to welcome the World Cup and
some ambassadors were always invited.
	   ``I do agree with Pak Wiranto and ambassadors who are here,
let's watch World Cup and maintain our cool. I'm in support of

	   FOLLOWING last week's reports that young actress Catleeya
Macintosh had fallen sick after being innoculated against the 'flu
-- or khai wad jai as it is called in Thai -- the FDA has issued a
warning for those who are planning to get their jabs.
	   According to Banphot Tontheerawong, deputy secretary of the Food
and Drugs Administration (FDA), the anti-influenza vaccine
manufactured by French pharmaceutical giant Pasteur Merieux was
granted FDA approval subject to certain conditions.
	   Under the present regulations, the vaccine is only available
under prescription from hospitals. The FDA has ordered physicians
to produce safety reports on the flu vaccine at quarterly intervals
over the next two years.
	   The drug is not yet classified as an essential vaccine at the
national level. Studies remain to be conducted on efficacy and
potential side-effects.
	   Banphat recommends that people interested in being vaccinated
check with their doctors to find out whether they might be
unwittingly placing themselves at risk.
	   The vaccination should not be given to individuals falling into
the following categories. - Known allegery to to albumin or egg
white - Known allergy to sodium thiomersal - Anyone running a high
fever - People suffering from persistent health disorders should
delay getting their shots.
	   Women in the first trimester of pregnancy and breast-feeding
mothers.
	   Health specialists recommend that the vaccination be given just
prior to the onset of the rainy season.
	   General side effects are mild pain at the injection site and a
low-grade fever lasting no longer than 48 hours.
	   However, Banphat concludes that the easiest way to prevent a
dose of flu is through regular exercise, a healthy diet and being
blessed with a strong immune system. THE NATION

Brazil grinds to a halt to watch World Cup

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Rush hour came early Wednesday as
Brazilians abandoned work to watch their team's first appearance in
this year's televised World Cup.
	   In front of the big hotels in Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana
district, tourists jostled with prostitutes and transvestites in an
effort to glimpse Brazil's match with Scotland on televisions at
beachside beer stands. Brazil won the game, 2-1.
	   The normally packed beaches were bare, and roads that were
jammed an hour before the game _ broadcast at 12:30 p.m. local time
(1430 GMT) _ emptied as it approached.
	   Half an hour before kickoff, Rio's downtown business district
was a ghost town except for random crowds clad in green and yellow
_ Brazil's national colors _ blowing on cheap plastic trumpets and
waving flags before large-screen TVs set up at several stores.
	   Banks closed at noon, and hospital emergency workers cared for
their patients with one eye on the game.
	   ``We're fully staffed and ready for any emergency, but we're
Brazilians so we'll find a way to do our work and root for Brazil
at the same time,'' said Dr. Fernando Mattos, who heads the
emergency room at the Miguel Couto hospital on Rio's upscale south
side.
	   On the city's poorer north side, residents painted the streets
with images of their favorite players under yellow and green
streamers strung across the road.
	   Barbecues were set up on sidewalks alongside TVs where fans
lounged in beach chairs.
	   In Bento Ribeiro, home of team superstar Ronaldo, cautious
enthusiasm turned to glee late in the second half, when Brazil took
the lead with an own goal by Scotland off a shot by Cafu.
	   Fabio Barata, one of Ronaldo's cousins, spoke for many his
fellow fans: ``What a relief!''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - About eight million tonnes of empty oil
palm fruit bunches (EFBs) per year can now be turned into organic
fertiliser in a cheap and environment-friendly way.
	   The BWS Composting System, the technology of Bio-Waste Solutions
(International) Ltd, eliminates the need for EFBs to be burned or
mulched.
	   The system is being promoted by Indus Inova (M) Sdn Bhd.
	   Bio-Waste Solutions director of marketing, Steve Lyons said two
palm oil mills were currently using this method on trial runs, but
declined to name them.
	   The system uses a decomposition process under aerobic
conditions, thus there is no obnoxious odour. A blend of organic
materials and a variety of micro-organisms are used for the
biodegradation process.
	   ``This system will help reduce air and water pollution. It will
also eliminate the use of inorganic fertiliser which is harmful and
costly with the current economic downturn.''
	   It will cost about RM1 million for mills to implement this
method, Lyons said, and the biodegradation process takes 28 days.
	   He said Malaysia imported RM1 billion in fertiliser last year.
	   ``All material and substances that make up our system are
Malaysian-made so our prices are not subject to the fluctuating
currency levels,'' he said.
	   Indus Inova's executive chairman P. Panjalingam said the system
can presently only be used by the palm oil industry but there are
plans to expand it to the other industries.

	   The rupiah remained weak yesterday due to political uncertainty
but share prices rose slightly in thin trading on the wake of late
buying support.
	   Currency dealers said the rupiah received no respite from last
week's debt accord or the likelihood of the release of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF)-brokered bailout package late
this week.
	   The rupiah closed weaker at 11,850 against the greenback, 2
percent lower than its close at 11,600 the previous day.
	   Dealers said most market operators remained concerned over the
country's political and social uncertainties.
	   ``Offshore funds continue to sideline the market and put their
funds in other currencies like the Thai baht, Malaysian ringgit and
Singapore dollar,'' a dealer with a local private bank said.
	   Dealers said commercial demand for the dollar coupled with labor
protests, such as those in Surabaya, East Java demanding the
Maspion Group raise their wages, put more pressure on the rupiah.
	   ``If similar protests take place in other cities, a possible
outbreak is likely to happen which would cause greater political
unrest,'' the dealer said.
	   ``If this happens, no offshore funds would come to trade the
rupiah,'' the dealer said.
	   Dealers said that if discussions between an IMF team and the
government to review the IMF-led assistance program bore fruit, the
rupiah's value could improve against the dollar.
	   ``But even if the IMF resumes the loan, it will not greatly
strengthen the rupiah's value,'' the dealer said, pointing out that
the country was struggling to face food shortages, skyrocketing
inflation rates and massive unemployment.
	   The dealers also attributed the weakening rupiah to a contagion
effect from the yen's fall against the American dollar.
	   The Japanese yen was quoted at 140.3 to the dollar yesterday, up
from its low at 141.05.
	   But unlike the rupiah, stock prices on the Jakarta Stock
Exchange (JSX) took a mild turn for the better yesterday with the
main benchmark price index climbing 1.65 points to 411.07 on a
total turnover of 177.2 million shares worth Rp 175.73 billion
(US$15.95 million).
	   Stockbrokers said trading activities remained lethargic as most
investors sidelined themselves from the country's battered market
due to the political situation.
	   ``Although the index rose, trading activities remained lethargic
with most investors dumping all the stocks they held,'' a
securities broker with Mashill Jaya Securities said.
	   Brokers attributed the increase in stock prices to late buying
on state-owned gold mining firm PT Aneka Tambang and cement maker
PT Semen Gersik.
	   Stock prices for Aneka Tambang rose Rp 75 to Rp 1,475 yesterday
on a total turnover of 5.94 million shares on the regular market.
Semen Gersik's stocks climbed Rp 1,000 to Rp 6,400, with 3.1
million shares changing hands.

	   THE world was taken by surprise back in 1977 when the seemingly
invincible Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was voted out of
power.
	   Within weeks, when her replacement sprightly septuagenarian
Morarji Desai was being sworn in, the international community was
hit by a second shock wave. Desai announced that his excellent
state of health could be put down to his long-time practice of
drinking his own urine.
	   The Indian public was considerably less shocked and dubbed
Desai's preferred beverage ''Morarji Cola''. His habit may have
brought him health -- Desai lived to the ripe old age of 97 -- but
it failed to promote political longevity; he was upstaged by Charan
Singh a year later.
	   Urine therapy has been practiced in Thailand for many years, but
it has seen a resurgence during the last five years among educated
people as well.
	   Although urine therapy has been practised for thousands of
years, the origins have never been traced back to any single
country. It is known that most of the yogis who lived at high
altitudes in the Himalayas, indulged in a warming cup of urine to
survive the bitter cold, so it's probably fair to assume that the
therapy developed on the Subcontinent.
	   Amarohi (the practice of ingesting one's own urine) is also
mentioned in the Aryurveda . There are references to shivambhu
kalpa vidhi which means ''the method of drinking urine in order to
rejuvenate''. It is said that Shiva himself encouraged the therapy
especially among those who practised meditation.
	   To many of us, the very thought of drinking what we've excreted
is unpalatable. How can imbibing the substances that our bodies
have rid themselves of improve our health? Yet this unorthodox
regime is embraced by a surprisingly high number of well-educated
people who are more than satisfied with the benefits it brings.
What's more, urine therapy now appears to be gaining recognition as
a promising preventive protocol.
	   In February 1996, the first World Conference on Urine Therapy
was held in India. Participation was higher than anticipated -- the
conference attracted specialists in different fields from all over
the world. The second international symposium is scheduled to take
place in Germany later this year.
	   The Thai Public Health Ministry specialist, Somsong Rakphao
recently appeared on the small screen to clarify the benefit versus
risk equation. ''People who practise urine therapy are very health
conscious and they may develop some psychological reactions which
are positive in the healing process,'' he stated. ''But from
medical point of view, drinking urine can be harmful to the
kidneys. Like the effects of hypnotism on the human spirit, the
benefits cannot be scientifically proven.'' Manop Udomdej, a
respected Thai movie director, argues that urine is not, as most
believe, just poisonous waste excreted by the body. ''Its
composition is not toxic,'' he says. ''The body naturally absorbs
urine. We don't realise it, but it contains an enormous amount of
water and useful substances. There's nothing to worry about from a
toxicity point of view if you drink a small amount.'' Manop has
been drinking his urine for more that four years and swears he has
benefitted from the practice. ''I was allergic to dust and couldn't
stop sneezing whenever I was in a dusty environment. Then in 1993 I
read an article in a local newspaper about a Japanese doctor called
Nagao Rioji who was promoting urine therapy as a way of preventing
disease and maintaining good health. I found it fascinating.
	   ''I started to explore the practice. From the questions I asked,
I learned that many people in rural communities routinely drank
their urine. There was nothing new about it, they'd been doing it
for years.'' But although his interest was piqued, Manop still had
doubts about whether it would work for him. Nevertheless, he
decided to give it a go and in spite of what he now describes as an
''initially unpleasant experience'' stuck rigidly to the regime.
Much to his surprise, his allergic reaction to dust disappeared.
Manop stopped the therapy after four months and the allergy
returned, this time exacerbated by itchy eyes and other unpleasant
symptoms. He went back to drinking urine and has remained faithful
to his routine ever since.
	   Not everyone shares his faith. Says one male non-believer after
his first experiment with the therapy, ''The taste was unbearable.
Actually, it wasn't just the taste, but I could actually feel some
substances going down my throat. It was horrendous. And all I'd had
to drink the night before was half a bottle of beer and a pot of
Chinese tea. If people really fancy drinking the waste from their
bodies, why don't they try to make it in tablet form? Anyway, I
felt like throwing up after the second gulp and I shall only try
again if I'm trapped in a dessert.'' Urine is composed of 95 per
cent water, 2.5 per cent urea (a crystalline nitrogenous compound
that contains some toxic substances) with the remaining 2.5 per
cent being made up of a mixture of minerals, salts, hormones and
enzymes. Practitioners of the therapy argue that it is a sterile
liquid with many antiseptic qualities.
	   Over the last 10 years, Nagao Rioji has been one of the major
movers in introducing the revolutionary regime to this part of the
world. He has conducted considerable research and come up with some
interesting results. He has even started a ''Miracle Club'' in
order to encourage the practice.
	   Rioji's studies have shown that urine contains a substance known
as interferon (a protein released through the cells). This acts as
a ''cursor'' and results in several chain reactions in the body.
Rioji says that this naturally-produced interferon helps the body
to fight back certain illness by increasing immunity. Morning urine
also contains traces of melatonin, a hormone with
immunity-enhancing qualities.
	   Other health specialists argue that the amount is too small to
be of significant use. Proponents of urine therapy rise to the
defence by pointing out that that the toxic substances contained in
urea are too minor to cause harm.
	   For some, the ''water of life'' may not an advisable option. For
example, the urine of patients taking allopathic (conventional)
medications inevitably contains samples of the drug's active
ingredients. Nor is urine therapy recommended for users of yaa-e
(ecstasy) or other illegal substances -- it is not a recipe for a
cheap morning ''high''. In 1992, Juljira Khontha, a Thai radio
programmer and columnist for the health magazine San Asoke , was
diagnosed with breast cancer. Although the disease was not
sufficiently advanced to call for a masectomy, she underwent
surgery to remove the malignant lump.
	   A few weeks after her discharge from hospital, she discovered
another lump. Terrified at the prospect of another and possibly
more radical surgical intervention, she started drinking her urine.
	   ''In the beginning I drank three glasses a day. It was not a
pleasant experience since I suffered from headaches and noticed
other changes in my body. Fortunately, I had read that these were
normal reactions and would subside once my body had adjusted to the
therapy.'' Juljira continued with the treatment but, on a friend's
advice, reduced her intake to one glass each morning. She checked
her breasts regularly and felt the lump start to shrink and finally
disappear.
	   Had the therapy worked a miracle? No one, including Juljira
herself, will ever know. She didn't consult a doctor when she
discovered the second lump so it could well have been a figment of
her imagination, the post-trauma often associated with surgery for
breast cancer. Nonetheless, Juljira has continued her daily regime
of a glass of urine and adheres to a vegetarian diet. She says that
this has helped her mentally too. The hot-tempered woman is now
calm and serene.
	   Neither Manop or Juljira have been subjected to ridicule by
their friends for their belief in, and practice of urine therapy.
Both say that part of their motivation for starting the daily
regime was enhanced by the fact that the practice is mentioned in
the Buddhist book Phra Traipidok (or Tripitaka ), and is described
as harmless.
	   Juljira pens a column titled Nam Chee Dee Jing Rue ? (is urine
really good?) for monthly magazine San Asoke . Several readers, she
says, write in to share their experiences of drinking urine. Manop
too encourages his friends to give the therapy a try. It is, he
stresses, harmless and cheap.
	   Will urine therapy become a revolutionary treatment? That
remains to be seen but there's no doubting that it's here to stay.
	   In the meantime, to any readers who may be enjoying a glass of
''Morarji Cola'' while reading this article -- cheers!

	   MUAR, Mon.- The Johor Government plans to expand the existing
Johor side of the 49,000ha core rhinoceros habitat in Endau-Rompin.
	   State Executive councillor Dr Chua Soi Lek said today the State
Forestry Department was conducting a study on this.
	   ``This is to allow the animals to have more room and populate,''
he said, when commenting on a New Sunday Times report that fewer
than five rhinoceros were in the Endau-Rompin area.
	   Dr Chua, who is also the State Environment and Consumer Affairs
committee chairman, said in the last census five years ago, about
five to l0 rhinoceros were found at the Johor side of the
Endau-Rompin area.
	   ``The Government has already allocated RM30,000 to enlist about
300 Orang Asli in the forest to ensure the animals within the Park
are safe and protected.
	   ``These people are experts and are considered a part of the
forest and they understand the animals and surrounding well,'' he
said.
	   Dr Chua said indiscriminate felling of trees, logging and
illegal construction might force the animals to flee. As such
strict enforcement is being carried out.
	   Endau-Rompin National Park, managed by Johor Parks Corporation,
only allows 200 people to visit the park daily, and not more than
6,000 visitors a month.
	   He said the State Government welcomed naturalists,
environmentalists and researchers from all over the world to
conduct and document their findings and identify the rare species
of animals, birds, insects and reptiles in the Park.
	   He said: ``We need all the help to explore the virgin jungle to
find ways to preserve the vegetation and conserve the animals
especially the rhinoceros.
	   ``We want to understand the mysteries of the forest in order to
draw up programmes to protect the living world within.''

Lawmakers debate early release of paramilitary prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam opened a
marathon debate Wednesday over plans to give early paroles to
convicted terrorists, the most controversial section of the Belfast
peace agreement.
	   Mowlam recommended to the House of Commons legislation that
would offer convicts of the Irish Republican Army and two
pro-British gangs, the Ulster Defense Association and Ulster
Volunteer Force, freedom by mid-2000.
	   She said the proposed law struck ``the right balance between the
steps necessary in the interests of lasting peace ... and in
ensuring that public safety will not be jeopardized.''
	   But leaders of Northern Ireland's pro-British Protestant
majority said no convicts should be freed unless the outlawed
groups to which they belong started disarming under international
supervision.
	   The agreement struck April 10 among eight parties specified
mid-2000 as the deadline for such disarmament, but didn't
specifically link this goal with the plans for paroles, which were
more specifically worded.
	   Proposed amendments to the Northern Ireland Sentences Bill, most
of them written by Protestant lawmakers determined to link paroles
to disarmament, will be debated Monday before the law's anticipated
easy passage later this month.
	   Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the Social Democratic and Labor
Party, which represents most of the north's Catholics, said the
promise of paroles ``places a debt of honor on the shoulders'' of
the IRA, UDA and UVF, whom he said could commit ``no tricks, no
games.''
	   But the Rev. Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist
Party and chief critic of the compromise agreement, predicted that
the IRA would retain its weaponry even after its senior imprisoned
members are freed.
	   ``What happens then? Then you get the gun on your head again,
and the IRA says, `We want something more','' Paisley said.
	   In Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams told his
supporters in the mainly Catholic town of Newry that he wants to
play ``a full and active part'' in Northern Ireland's new
government.
	   An election June 25 will determine membership in a new 108-seat
legislative assembly, from which a 12-member administration will be
drawn from several parties. The IRA-allied Sinn Fein, which won 17
percent of the vote in elections last year, is likely to be
entitled to one or two top posts.
	   Adams said Sinn Fein was willing to take part in governing
Northern Ireland, a state that the IRA had tried since 1970 to
destroy, because he wanted to enter ``a new century, a new
millenium, where dialogue is the key instrument for change.''

	   KUCHING, Mon. - The magistrate's court here today allowed a
joint application by two Bangladeshis charged with harbouring their
countrymen to have their international passports temporarily
released after hearing arguments from the prosecution and defence.
	   Magistrate Mahazan Mat Taib, who made the order, fixed June 17
for the trial to begin against them and two others who all pleaded
not guilty to the charge.
	   MD Abdul Razak, 40, and SMA Khan, 32, are jointly charged with
local businessman David Lau Sin Phang, 34, and another Bangladeshi,
Wabiur Rahman Khan, 32, with committing the offence.
	   Lau was released on RM10,000 bail with two sureties while the
three were each released on RM20,000 bail with one surety.
	   The four were jointly charged under Section 56(1)(d) of the
Immigration Act 1959/63 with harbouring 29 Bangladeshis at a
shophouse in Central Park, Batu Tiga here about 3.40pm on May 1.
	   Lau was represented by John Shek and the three by Anthony Tai.
Chief Inpsector Lim Kwai Seng prosecuted.
	   Soon after court adjourned, Lau was arrested by police on
another case.
	   Earlier, in applying for the trial against the four to be
adjourned, Lim said he was prepared to proceed with the trial but
had not received any directive from the deputy public prosecutor to
proceed with the hearing.

	   THE late twentieth-century has seen the growth of two phenomena:
globalisation and the increase in the use of narcotics. In an
attempt to use one to counter the other, the United Nations is
envisioning a dynamic web of international drug control to counter
the worldwide drug trade at all levels.
	   Today is the last of a three day Special Session the United
Nations General Assembly are holding in New York City, to tackle
the prevailing world drug problem in a cooperative manner. Pino
Arlacchi, Under-Secretary of the UN, former member of the Italian
Senate, and renowned expert on the Mafia and drug control has been
leading the session.
	   Although nations have cracked down domestically on illicit drugs
since the first UN convention on drug control ten years ago, drugs
continue to flourish in the 90's. They are a means of survival in
urban street-life, as well as in developing countries where farmers
can no longer compete with the legitimate agricultural market.
Drugs are popularised by youth subculture from England to Japan and
they are grown or manufactured in nearly every nation in the world,
industrialised or not.
	   And yet there is optimism for the next decade, for now that the
UN has realised that drug-trafficking is a multi-national
operation, it has finally decided that nations should work in a
cooperative manner to try and stem the flow. Adding to this
new-found hope is that nations will enter the next century better
able to cooperate with each other, in spite of ideological
differences (trade in general has had a decided impact on this),
armed with new monitoring techniques, as well as with accumulated
knowledge of drug control.
	   The United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNIDCP)
is leading the Special Session, with the main goal of developing a
global Action Strategy towards reducing the supply and demand for
illicit drugs. The Programme, operational since 1991, is stressing
tight, international cooperation to counter the worldwide drug
trade from initial cultivation of illicit crops and production of
synthetic drugs, to their manufacturing and trafficking.
	   In the spirit of globalisation, nations are finally expected to
work together through extradition procedures, mutual legal and
research assistance between states, joint training sessions, the
transfer of proceedings from state to state, and tighter monitoring
of sea-routes.
	   The session will also discuss prevention methods and ways of
helping drug abusers break their habit.
	   Other issues include the use of precursor chemicals, which are
diverted from legitimate commerce to process cocaine and heroin,
and to manufacture synthetic drugs. Current monitoring techniques
of the chemical trade, which have been very successful over the
past decade, are to be improved upon and used more frequently.
	   However, a worrying issue is the increase in amphetamine-type
substances (ATS) -- that have become widely available in the 90's.
According to the UNIDCP, these synthetic drugs are now used by 30
million people (5 per cent of the world population) and have now
become the most popular and widespread drug after cannabis, which
is used by 2.4 per cent of the world population).
	   Control of ATS is difficult as it is readily available and comes
in diverse varieties. The UNIDCP can only hope to raise awareness
of these harmful substances, reduce their demand, and continue with
investigation and research into the drugs.
	   While ATS is born out of clandestine laboratories in cities and
suburbs, heroin, cocaine, and cannabis are grown illegally in rural
areas. The UNIDCP needs to create alternate development projects in
areas where the cultivation of illicit crops is occurring.
	   While cannabis is grown worldwide, opium and the coca leaf are
found mainly in Southern Asia and Latin America. In these two
regions, 700,000 families depend on the cultivation of illicit
crops as a source of income. They are open to both exploitation by
ruthless middlemen and the constant threat of crop eradication.
What's more, they are often forced to work on large-scale farms
owned by drug traffickers, thus, the projects' aim must be to find
other sources of income for these families.
	   Thailand is one nation where alternate development projects have
led to the virtual elimination of opium poppy cultivation.
	   Finally, the concern over money laundering by drug traffickers
is being addressed with the aim of confiscating drug profits at
their entry point into the financial system, through international
cooperation and the stricter monitoring of offshore banking.
	   Representatives from 130 governments showed their commitment to
the project in the final preparatory session held in Vienna last
March. However, the issue of whether or not to allow for full
participation of member states was still left open. As we have seen
before, many of the UN's plans and strategies have not had the
success they had hoped for because they were non-binding.
	   So our new ''globalised'' world will just have to wait and see
whether the UN can make drug control a primary issue requiring full
and active cooperation of all member states.

	   JOHOR BARU, Mon. - Aquarium fish breeders in Johor want Malaysia
Airlines to provide air cargo facilities for the export of live
fish to markets overseas.
	   More than 80 per cent of all ornamental fish from Malaysia are
now exported through the Causeway via Singapore Airlines.
	   ``We are forced to use a foreign airline because our national
carrier does not have facilities for fish exports,'' said
vice-president of the Johor Aquarium Fish Breeders' Association,
Raymond Cheah.
	   ``Inevitably, many importers often think the fish are products
of Singapore.''
	   Malaysia exported RM60 million worth of aquarium fish in 1996,
an increase of about RM11 million, or 18 per cent, from 1995. (Last
year's figures are not available yet.) The exports included at
least 220 species and 500 varieties of aquarium fish, with the
United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy,
Netherlands, Spain, Belgium, Taiwan and Korea being the biggest
markets.
	   ``The new emerging markets for aquarium fish are China and the
Middle East,'' said Cheah.
	   Most of the parent fish stocks for the farms in Malaysia are
imported from South East Asia countries, Australia, China, India,
Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Congo, Zambia and Madagascar.
	   Cheah said Malaysia had less than 10 indigenous species of
ornamental fish, the most notable being kissing gourami, harlequin
rasbora and pearl gourami which are also exported.
	   There are now about 500 ornamental fish breeders in Malaysia who
give employment to some 2,500 people nationwide.
	   The breeders accounted for exports totalling about RM50 million
in 1995, with Johor alone contributing 62 per cent of the sales,
followed by Perak (22 per cent), Selangor (10 per cent) and Penang
(5 per cent).
	   Johor has over 400 aquarium fish farms scattered around
Jemaluang, Layang-Layang, Ulu Tiram, Pontian, Kulai, Kluang, Kota
Tinggi and Kempas.
	   Cheah said Malaysia had the potential to become a world leader
in the production of ornamental fish, noting that the Government's
encouragement and assistance augured well for the growth of the
industry.
	   He said countries like Indonesia, Thailand and Sri Lanka were
also going big in the breeding of ornamental fish for exports.
	   ``The problem we face is there are not enough big farms with the
necessary infrastructure to spur the growth of the industry.
	   ``There is also a dire need to train new breeders and teach them
the means to penetrate into the booming international markets.''

	   Automobile manufacturer PT General Motors Buana Indonesia
(GMBI), the Indonesian producer of Opel vehicles, announced
yesterday it has been awarded an ISO 9002 certification for its
production and service quality.
	   Company president Bill Botwick said the certification proves
that Opel offers an international quality standard even at a time
when the market was sluggish.
	   He is confident it will help GMBI win market share from
competitors who cannot offer their buyers such quality standards.
	   ``The market is down but this is not a time to sit on our hands
waiting for something to happen. Others may be in retreat but that
is not our strategy and we have now gained a considerable advantage
over our competitors,'' Botwick said.
	   The company, a subsidiary of the giant General Motors
Corporation, began producing automobiles in Indonesia in 1994.

Police cracks down on illegal gathering, arrests lawmaker

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian police arrested an
opposition member of the Parliament after he gave a speech at a
political gathering banned by authorities, witnesses said late
Wednesday.
	   Police led away Lim Guan Eng, deputy secretary-general of the
opposition Democratic Action Party, shortly after he spoke to 2,000
supporters at a brightly lit open-air dinner organized by the party
in a suburb south of the capital.
	   Three party members were also arrested after they tussled with
policemen who were trying to cart away the amplifiers and speakers
used at the political rally.
	   ``Just because I'm expressing my constitutional rights to free
speech, I may have to spend the night here in the lock-up,'' Lim
said in a telephone interview from a nearby police station.
	   ``With the government bent on establishing a police state, this
is the end of the freedom of expression in Malaysia. Indonesia's
moving forward, but we're moving backwards,'' he said.
	   Lim said the police had yet to inform him why he was arrested.
The precinct's deputy police chief, Hussein Ismail, who was at the
scene, refused to comment.
	   Several police in riot gear had stood watch at the fund-raising
dinner for Lim, who has been sentenced to 18 months in prison for
printing a pamphlet that questioned Malaysia's political system.
	   A number of DAP leaders spoke during the dinner. Vehicles
clogged the road adjoining the field, where more than 60 dinner
tables had been placed for their supporters.
	   As the night continued, hundreds of people from the surrounding
neighborhoods also gathered to watch the spectacle. Shortly after
Lim began to speak, dozens of police in riot gear moved in to
arrest him.
	   ``We're not criminals, we're not robbers, we're not even threat
to the nation,'' Lim's father, party Secretary-General Lim Kit
Siang, cried out into the microphone shortly after police led his
son away.
	   ``By breaking up the event, the government has created a crisis
which does not exist,'' Lim Sr. said as his supporters jeered at
police. ``The police has alienated the public, making them an enemy
rather than friends.''
	   Several scuffles broke out but no injuries were reported. Police
dispersed the milling crowd shortly after midnight.
	   Lim Sr., who's also opposition leader for Parliament, later said
his party had applied for permission to hold the public gathering
several days ago.
	   He said organizers assumed it was OK to hold the gathering
because there was no response by authorities until the last moment.
	   This is the fourth time police have shut down public meetings
over the past 10 days and the third time police have disbanded
gatherings where opposition leaders were scheduled to speak.
	   Since the cancellations of public meetings in recent weeks,
dozens of organizations have demanded more civil liberties and free
speech.
	   ``In Indonesia, the people who have been muzzled for three
decades are beginning to experience a new freedom of expression,''
said Lim Sr. ``But in Malaysia, the government has suddenly become
afraid of the voice of the people.''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - Malaysian football fans, already on
tenterhooks on the eve of the World Cup, now have a chance to win
football paraphernalia autographed by Manchester United's David
Beckham.
	   The Style in Action Challenge contest was kicked off today by
Brylcreem, which recently signed Beckham as its spokesman for its
new hair styling range of gels, sprays and shampoos.
	   Entry forms will be published in newspapers and magazines, and
contestants will have to answer some questions about international
football players and complete a slogan.
	   The grand prize winner gets Beckham's signed England World Cup
jersey, while the first prize winner will get his autographed
Manchester United jersey.
	   Other signed items up for grabs are two pairs of his football
boots and 10 footballs. Remaining winners stand to win 30 special
edition Beckham footballs, limited edition Beckham caps and Beckham
posters.
	   All entries must be received by July 31.
	   ``This is an opportunity for Malaysian football enthusiasts to
own a true collector's item. It is a wonderful piece of football
history,'' said Owen Ow, president of Sara Lee DE in Malaysia and
Singapore. The company is the owner of the Brylcreem brand.
	   Beckham, who has gained as much recognition for his engagement
to Spice Girl Victoria Adams as for his on-field skills, signed the
two-year endorsement contract two months ago.

	   Partners of state-owned telecommunications firm PT
Telekomunikasi Indonesia (Telkom) admitted yesterday the crisis was
making it difficult for them to meet targets for telephone line
installation.
	   Eddy Hadijanto, a spokesman of the five firms which participate
in the joint-operation schemes to build telecommunication networks
across the country, said the partners had problems securing loans
to continue their projects.
	   ``Our biggest problem is the confidence crisis. Lenders will
think twice before they extend loans to us,'' Eddy told reporters
in the sidelines of a hearing with members of the House of
Representatives.
	   Eddy said the monetary crisis, which began in the middle of last
year, largely affected the continuity of the projects' developments
as prices of goods and services had multiplied sharply.
	   The swollen value of investment slowed the realizations of their
business plans, he told House Commission IV for public works,
transportation, communications and public housing.
	   Telkom's partners have invested about US$1.21 billion since the
partnerships began in 1995, he said.
	   In October 1995, Telkom awarded 15-year joint-operation
contracts, popularly called KSO, to the five joint ventures to
install 2.25 million telephone lines by March 1999, and operate
them along with existing lines.
	   Telkom officially handed over management and operation of the
telecommunications networks outside Jakarta to the five companies
in January last year.
	   PT Pramindo Ikat Nusantara is responsible for installing 516,000
new telephone lines in Sumatra; PT Aria West International 500,000
lines in West Java; PT Mitra Global Telekomunikasi Indonesia (MGTI)
400,000 lines in Central Java; PT Daya Mitra Malindo 237,000 lines
in Kalimantan; and PT Bukaka Singtel 403,000 lines in the country's
eastern region, which covers Sulawesi, Maluku, Irian Jaya and Nusa
Tenggara.
	   Last week, Telkom cut the targets of new line installment to
1.27 million by next March to help the companies secure their
financial positions during the crisis.
	   At yesterday's hearing, the KSO's regional division for Central
Java and Yogyakarta reported yesterday it had built 27,544 new
lines from 100,000 targeted as of March 31.
	   Of this number, 5,870 lines were ready to be marketed, the
division said in a written report to the commission members.
	   It said it was in discussion with Telkom to review the target of
the new lines by next year.
	   The KSO division covering the eastern region said yesterday its
partner PT Bukaka Singtel had declared that it would stop new
developments, and would only continue those currently in
construction.
	   ``According to Telkom's evaluation, since the start of the
partnership, (our) partner has been delayed in the developments,''
division head Tatang Wigena said in a written statement.
	   Tatang said Bukaka had built 301,858 new centralized lines,
127,898 cable lines and 106,681 wireless lines as of last March.
	   ``The target to install 403,000 new lines will be hard to
reach,'' he said.

	   For two decades, B J Habibie was Suharto's minister of research
and technology, a position befitting his role as a political
outsider. He has virtually no links with the military. And he was
never considered a potential president, not even by his own
political mentor. No wonder he is still a bit non-plussed about
being the man in the hot seat. During an interview, he had to be
reminded not to refer to Suharto as president. ''You are the
president,'' said his aide.
	   Nevertheless, Habibie knows well that if he is to keep his new
job, he will have to stay ahead of the reform wave. So Habibie the
technocrat, is now Habibie the reformer.
	   In the two weeks he has been president, he has brought changes
once thought impossible in this vast archipelago. He has committed
the government to holding elections by mid-next year. He has
released four political prisoners -- including renegade politician
Sri Bintang Pamungkas and labour leader Muchtar Pakpahan -- and
vowed to free more. He has promised to sign the International
Labour Convention that would permit independent unions.
	   But all this, however, does not wash with a sizeable number of
his countrymen. His close personal ties with Suharto, and his own
well-known nepotism, will make it difficult for him to embrace many
in the opposition, and more importantly, for the opposition to
embrace him. In defending himself, Habibie argued that his two
decades ''in the cockpit'' at Suharto's side had prepared him for
leadership. ''I'm not deaf and blind. I can read. I can see,'' he
said. ''I learned at the hands of the master.'' But that is exactly
Habibie's problem. He may have donned the reformist mantle: yet, to
many he is still Suharto's man. Not surprisingly, despite the
dramatic change in the leadership, there is still widespread
dissatisfaction over the slow pace of reform. Calls are being made
for the expropriation of Suharto's ill-gotten loot, the repeal of
the five repressive political laws of 1985 which, among others,
allows only three authorised political parties; the release of all
political prisoners; and a referendum for the East Timor people.
	   Habibie's major concern now -- and that of the powerful military
-- is to contain this growing chorus for reform. According to his
economic czar, Ginanjar Kartasasmita, reform differs from
revolution. Reform, he said, comes from the top and it should be
orderly as well as constitutional. That is exactly what the new
regime is seeking -- it hopes that tinkering with Suharto's New
Order system will help to pacify the angry masses.
	   But it is hard to imagine how the system founded by Suharto
could be dismantled by the very people who built it. The New Order
regime is not just Suharto. It has been kept alive by the active
collaboration of most of the middle class. Like foreign investors,
this section of the society has no particular love for democracy.
Stability -- to ensure that their money is safe -- is what they
want. And Suharto was able to deliver that for three decades. But
as soon as he was no longer useful, he was quickly discarded. Now
they are putting their money on another creature of the New Order.
	   However, for the mass of suffering poor who are facing the brunt
of an economic meltdown that is not of their doing, patience is
fast running out. They want nothing less than a swift end to the
New Order regime. Thus, the battle lines are already drawn -- on
one side are the elite who want constitutional reform, and the
other, the poor who want total reform.
	   Stepping into this breach are the students and a group of
middle-class activists who want Habibie to immediately give way to
an interim government until elections are held. Others go even
further. Recently released political prisoner Sri Bintang demands
an end to military involvement in politics. Still others want the
constitution overhauled, much as in Thailand, since the existing
one is out of step with democracy. All of them clearly are from the
elite class, but they speak the language of the poor. And it is
they who will determine the extent and shape of the reforms to
come.
	   Indonesia is still in a state of flux. Expectations are running
high. Time is short. Habibie, whether he likes it or not, will not
last, for like his predecessor, he will inevitably be swept away by
the growing tide of reform.

	   WORLD CUP FEVER ... The World Cup fever is catching on in
Penang. In a move to kick up excitement, Sheraton Penang has built
a giant football in front of the hotel along Jalan Larut.
	   Passers-by cannot help but stare at the 3.7-metre ball which
weighs a hefty 550 kilogrammes.
	   It was hotel executive assistant manager James Tay Choon Aun's
idea to promote its programmes for the season - the sale of
merchandise and contests for guests.
	   The ``football'' which costs RM3,000 comprises a wooden frame
covered with PVC.
	   Construction was the effort of hotel chief engineer Mohd Khaliff
Abd Aziz and resident artist Bahrudin Salleh who took pains to
ensure a nice round shape which can withstand wind and rain, and is
aesthetically pleasing.

	   Bank Indonesia will take over the overall supply of subsidized
credit to small and medium-scale businesses because the country's
commercial banks can no longer make any contribution, a top
official of the central bank said.
	   BI director Miranda Gultom said yesterday that the central bank
would boost its contribution of total supply of subsidized credit
to 100 percent from 65 percent last year.
	   The remaining 35 percent of last year's subsidized credit was
previously contributed by the country's commercial banks, which
were required to allocate at least 20 percent of their total credit
through the credit for small enterprises scheme.
	   ``The proposal has been approved by the central bank's board of
directors,'' Miranda said at a discussion on how to strengthen
small-scale businesses, in which Minister of Trade and Industry
Rahardi Ramelan and Minister of Cooperatives and Small Enterprises
Adi Sasono were also speakers.
	   She said the subsidized credit would amount to several trillion
rupiah, channeled to the recipients by intermediaries at an
interest rate of 9 percent.
	   She explained that it was impossible for commercial banks to
provide subsidized credit at an interest rate of 16 percent, while
they had to raise funds with an interest rate of 50 percent.
	   Under the government's January 1990 deregulation package, the
central bank's role in providing subsidized credit to small and
medium-scale businesses was to be reduced gradually and replaced by
the increasing role of commercial banks.
	   ``But it is unrealistic to expect such a thing at the moment,''
she said.
	   Lowest
	   The country's banking system is currently at its lowest point,
battered by the monetary crisis, mounting bad debt and poor
management.
	   Miranda, however, said many small businesses had failed to
benefit from the subsidized credit facility because the channeling
banks had imposed corporate financing criteria.
	   ``Such a scheme is only applicable during normal times, which is
not now,'' she said, referring to the current economic crisis.
	   She said the failure was both caused by the inefficient
intermediary role of the banking system as well as a lack of
productivity in the real sector.
	   To improve the absorption of subsidized credit by small-scale
businesses, BI has designed a new scheme which initially will be
implemented through several pilot projects, she said.
	   She explained that the new scheme would include providing
technology and marketing skills improvement in addition to credit
facility in one package.
	   ``Because the facility is credit, not a grant, then there must
be feasibility to assure that it can be returned,'' she said.
	   Rahardi Ramelan said a key factor to strengthen the country's
small-scale businesses was to introduce an antimonopoly law.
	   He said the law was being prepared by his ministry and was
expected to be delivered to the House of Representatives (DPR) by
December.
	   He added that the law would include three aspects: antimonopoly,
anticartel, and healthy business competition.
	   Adi Sasono said the government must also eliminate other
distortions in the economy, including restructuring the country's
distribution industry by adding new players.

Sir David English, Associated Newspapers chief, dead at 67
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sir David English, chairman and group
editor-in-chief of Associated Newspapers _ who was editor of the
Daily Mail for 20 years_ died Wednesday after suffering a stroke.
He was 67.
	   English was admitted to St. Thomas's Hospital in London on
Tuesday and died on Wednesday, said Lawrence Sear, managing editor
of the Daily Mail.
	   English, who became editor of the Daily Mail in 1971 transformed
the tabloid over the next two decades.
	   Under his leadership, the newspaper became the self-assured
voice of middle England, identifying a fertile new market between
the traditional tabloid territory and the broadsheets.
	   ``With Lord Rothermere he reinvented the Daily Mail which became
the outstanding success story of modern Fleet Street,'' said the
newspaper's present editor, Paul Dacre. ``At heart he was a
newspaperman's newspaperman. He could do every job on the paper
better than anyone else and was an inspiration to everybody who
worked with him at the Mail.''
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair, told of English's death, called the

	   STUDENTS of two primary schools in Shah Alam had a fun time
recently thinking up the answers in the Kuala Lumpur Mutual Fund
(KL Mutual) Future Grads Contest. The questions were published in
the New Straits Times from May 25 to 29.
	   The contest offered the students of Sekolah Kebangsaan Section
24 and Sekolah Rendah Kebangsaan Section 18 a chance to win
attractive prizes and in the process test their knowledge of
current affairs.
	   ``The students were excited about the contest,'' said Karen Wong
Chek Fai, the English language teacher of SRK Section 18.
	   ``Many of them went home and asked their parents to buy the New
Straits Times because even though we buy the NST under the
Newspaper in Education (NIE) programme, there were not enough to go
around. The students preferred to have a copy for themselves when
they were answering the questions and filling in the entry form.''
	   SRK Section 18 has been buying some 50 copies of the New Straits
Times under the NIE programme since the beginning of this year.
Schools are entitled to a 50 per cent discount under the programme.
	   ``The students learn a lot from the New Straits Times,'' said
Wong.
	   ``I was amazed to see some students looking at the Stock
Exchange pages.
	   When I asked them why, they said that their fathers had shares
in some of the listed companies and they were checking the prices!
``Having access to the New Straits Times means they tend to read
more and hence gain more knowledge,'' she added.
	   Sekolah Kebangsaan Section 24 is also another NIE school. It has
been ordering the New Straits Times for the past two months.
	   Here, too, the students were busy answering the contest
questions.
	   Said teacher Noriha Yusoff: ``The students like referring to the
NST as it is an interesting source of news. They also learn a lot
of new words.
	   ``They also enjoy taking part in competitions like the Future
Grads contest as it offers great prizes and is fun.''
	   Three questions were published daily in the New Straits Times
during the contest period. Participants had to answer 15 questions
and also write a slogan on the importance of saving.
	   Twelve finalists will be selected for the finals to be held at
the Subang Parade shopping complex in Subang Jaya on July 5.
	   The first prize is RM5,000, the second RM3,000 and the third
RM2,000.
	   There will be nine fourth prizes, each worth RM1,000. All prizes
will be in the form of unit trust accounts. There are also 50
consolation prizes.

	   RAYONG -- A container of chemical substances belonging to a gas
company in Mab Ta Phud Industrial Estate exploded Tuesday morning,
resulting in a massive permeation of white dust all over nearby
areas which caused skin irritation.
	   The chemical, called Perlite and used as an insulator in the
nitrogen container, spread, causing skin irritation and respiratory
problems. It also resulted in a school being closed.
	   The Mab Ta Phud Phan Phitthayakharn was affected by strong foul
fumes emitted from factories in the estate last week. School
director Winij Prathanraj announced an indefinite closure of the
institution.
	   Jamnongjai Noiraj, an engineer of the Bangkok Industrial Gas Co
where the container exploded, said the Perlite was not toxic and
would not cause any problem other than skin irritation.
	   The Perlite cloud was seen over the company compound shortly
after the explosion, it covered the area for a long time before
moving to a major market and the school, which are located a few
kilometres away from the gas company.
	   Meanwhile, a group of 200 local villagers gathered at the estate
to call for the resignation of Industrial Estate Authority of
Thailand governor Somjate Thinnaphong for failing to solve various
problems caused to them by factories in the estate.
	   Daily lunch allowance raised THE Bt7 daily lunch allowance for
students in schools run by the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration
(BMA) will be raised to Bt10 next year, an adviser to the Bangkok
governor said Tuesday.
	   Mahin Tanboonpherm said the additional cash will authorities
retain the nutritional value of the free food for students, and
that the increase will cost the BMA an additional Bt140 million
from its 1999 budget.
	   He added that the students in BMA-run schools would still enjoy
free milk daily since it still does not cost the BMA and the
government more than Bt300 million which they jointly shoulder each
year.
	   During Bangkok Governor Bhichit Rattakul's two-year tenure the
rate was increased once from Bt5 to Bt7.
	   Fee hike plan on hold THE Education Ministry will not endorse a
proposed rise in tuition and other fees for an international school
until it considers a Private Education Commission report on the
proposal, Minister Chumpol Silapa-archa said Tuesday.
	   He said a number of parents complained of being unfairly
burdened by the rise in international school fees. The school,
located on Sukhumvit Soi 15, is seeking a 28-per cent rise in fees,
citing the plunging value of the baht by more than 35 per cent
since its de facto flotation last July. The school also said that
it had to pay more to retain its international teaching staff and
for school aid and equipment.
	   The requested rise was made despite the fact that school had
earlier obtained a fee rise, Chumpol said.
	   Currently, parents have to pay between Bt124,000 in tuition fees
for a pre-school student to Bt234,000 for a grade 13 student, on
top of the one-time admission fee of Bt105,000.
	   Six hurt as 'copter crashes NAN -- A Laotian helicopter, while
on a joint mission with Thai authorities to mark the border,
crashed Tuesday in Bor Klua district, injuring six crewmen.
	   A Lao army officer, who arrived the scene after notifying a
local Thai military unit of the incident and requesting initial
assistance, said the cause of the accident was because of the
aircraft's excessive load and weary condition.
	   The TA-32T chopper, which carried 10 Lao officials and surveying
equipment, left from Hongsa airport in Laos' Sai Buri province. It
crashed while trying to land at an operation base in the district.
	   Two seriously injured crewmen are being treated at Nan Hospital
and will be returned to Laos at a later date.

	   IN a bid to entrench its position as a leading systems
integrator in an increasingly wired world, Computer Systems
Advisers (M) Bhd has incorporated electronic commerce to facilitate
online dealings with its corporate customers.
	   Its managing director Chuah Tai Eu said the business-to-business
Internet commerce system is to facilite ease of doing business with
its customers who could now make their orders and other requests
online.
	   Speaking after the company's annual meeting in Petaling Jaya
yesterday, Chuah said: ``The system will increase our efficiency
and will contribute indirectly towards our revenue.
	   ``We expect it to make a significant contribution to our revenue
in two or three years' time. In the long-run, we hope to cement
customer loyalty.''
	   He said the company, which had spent a few hundred thousand
ringgit in the project, is incorporating Internet as an important
part of its operations following IBM's worldwide campaign to push
e-commerce into mainstream business dealings.
	   ``It is the fastest growing computer segment for Global
Information Management now. We see a strong potential there and are
currently focused on business-to-business electronic commerce
solution, and Internet Security and Payment System,'' added Chuah.
	   For the financial year ended Dec 31, 1997, CSA posted group
pre-tax profit of RM19.3 million, a 25.2 per cent increase from
RM15.4 million previously.
	   Group turnover increased to RM370.0 million from RM267.4 million
previously, a hefty 38.4 per cent increase.
	   At company level, pre-tax profit increased to RM18.5 million, an
increase of 26.9 per cent from RM14.6 million in the previous year.
	   Turnover increased to RM270.3 million from RM207.3 million, an
increase of 30.4 per cent.
	   ``We expect to maintain or even increase slightly by 10 per cent
our revenue and profit level for this year. In fact, our first
quarter results this year showed a slight increase from last year's
corresponding quarter.
	   ``In our business, 60 per cent to 70 per cent of our business
come from repeat customers.''
	   Chuah said CSA had clinched a few new contracts worth a few
million ringgit this year but declined to elaborate.
	   ``Our cash position is strong at about RM15 million, and our
gearing very low. We do not expect any major problem in collection.
	   ``We have a good customer base and a balanced portfolio of
products, software services, solutions and revenue streams. Thus, I
would say that overall we could expect another good year in spite
of the economic downturn.''
	   CSA, Chuah claimed, has six to seven per cent of the market
share last year in a RM4 billion market.
	   ``All we need to do is just increase our market share by one per
cent, and that will translate into a 10 per cent increase in our
sales.
	   ``We believe we are the biggest in terms of revenue and size. We
have a total of 800 workers in 24 branches in Malaysia.''
	   Competition-wise, Chuah said, there were no other competitors
that came close to them in terms of the breadth of services and
solutions that they offer.
	   ``We are a totally integrated solutions provider in the real
sense of the word.''
	   Currently, it derives 40 per cent of its revenue from
customising computer systems for its clients which include
financial institutions, stock brokerages, manufacturers and the oil
and gas industry.
	   Their wholesaling and distributing activities contribute 20 per
cent, while another 20 per cent comes from system integration and
software development including Internet applications.
	   Chuah said one of its strategies is to diversify its client and
supplier base, ``that is, we monitor our exposure to ensure that we
are not overly exposed to one single client.''
	   ``Last year, not one of our single customer contributed more
than two per cent of our turnover, or about RM8 million.
	   ``We maintain the level to less than five per cent, and if sales
from one client contributed more than that, we will try to increase
the overall sales base so that we do not depend too much on one
single client.
	   ``Similarly, we do not take more than 30 per cent of our
supplies from one single principal (supplier).''
	   Chuah said 20 per cent of its total turnover last year came from
banks/financial institutions, 15 per cent from stock brokerages,
five per cent from manufacturing, two to three per cent from the
oil and gas sector, and 20 per cent from its wholesaling and
distributing activities.
	   On the impact of the lower ringgit, Chuah said that for the last
financial year, its forex losses amounted to RM2.9 million.
	   However, he added that this year the impact should be
significantly reduced because almost all except three of its
suppliers have agreed to quote in ringgit, or have locked the
exchange rate for future dealings.
	   The three suppliers that still bill the company in US dollar are
Microsoft Corp, Sun Microsystems Inc and Cisco Systems Inc which
together account for 20 per cent of their supplies.
	   Chuah said the slower economic growth had not impacted the
company as much as some other industries, ``as we still expect a
lot of activity in providing or recommending others for
Y2K-compliant (Year 2000) solutions, and work from MSC-related
projects.
	   ``In fact, in spite of the squeeze on financial institutions,
there is no reduction in business from them. When it comes to
cost-cutting, I believe IT will probably be the last thing they
will cut back on,'' he said.
	   The company which was one of the first few companies to be
granted MSC status had booked two lots in Cyberjaya and expects to
move some of its activities there including the research
department, which is now located in Technology Park Malaysia, Bukit
Jalil in Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``We have also exercised our option in purchasing three floors
of Wisma CSA, the building we are in now, at a very good rate of
RM170 per square foot.''

Graf wins first match of comeback
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: updated with Steffi quotes, results including seeds out.

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Steffi Graf, playing her first match
in four months, rallied to beat Rennae Stubbs in three sets
Wednesday at the DFS Classic grass-court tournament.
	   The former world's No. 1 player recovered after losing the first
set and downed the Australian 5-7, 6-2, 6-4 in 1 hour, 51 minutes.
	   The two players, who are close friends, hugged at the net after
the match.
	   Graf, who received a first-round bye, advanced to a third-round
meeting against Kristie Boogert, of Netherlands.
	   After Wednesday's match she declared herself ``physically fit''.
	   ``I've been feeling good for the last few weeks _ now I need
matches and to play points, which I've not really done,'' she said.
	   ``With another 10 or 11 days I'll get better and better and
physically stronger.''
	   Graf, the winner of 21 Grand Slam singles titles, had played
only two tournaments since undergoing reconstructive surgery on her
left knee a year ago.
	   In February, she won a match at Hanover before losing a
quarterfinal clash with Sabine Applemans of Belgium 6-3, 7-6.
	   The next month, she won three matches at Indian Wells but had to
retire in the third set of the semifinals against Lindsay
Davenport.
	   Recent planned comebacks were postponed due to various injuries.
	   The start of Wednesday's match was held up by rain, which has
disrupted the first three days of the tournament.
	   Graf started the match with a brace on her left knee but she
removed it early in the first set.
	   Stubbs broke Graf twice in winning the first set. But the German
took control in the second, and her break of serve in the first
game of the third set held up the rest of the way.
	   Graf squandered two match points before closing out the match
with a trademark forehand winner.
	   Graf struggled with her serve, hitting 12 double faults to go
with her five aces.
	   Graf also plans to play next week at Eastbourne before starting
the challenge for her eighth Wimbledon singles title.
	   American Lisa Raymond was one of five seeds who lost to
qualifiers in round two, going down to Australian Kerry-anne Guse.
Guse won in three sets 6-3, 3-6, 6-1.
	   Third seeded Nathalie Tauziat, of France, was trailing
Zimbabwe's Cara Black by one set when play was suspended.

	   THE Transport Ministry is still in the process of drafting a new
legislation to replace the various ordinances which govern merchant
shipping in Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak.
	   Transport Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ling Liong Sik said the
proposed Malaysia Shipping Act will ensure that the shipping laws
of Malaysia are up to date and kept abreast with international laws
and practices.
	   ``It will also ensure that there is a single uniform law for the
entire country,'' he said in his opening address at the Fourth
Biennial International Maritime Conference on ``Maritime Industry:
Meeting New and Changing Demand Conditions in Asia'' in Subang Jaya
yesterday.
	   The two-day conference is organised by the Malaysian Maritime
Institute.
	   The three ordinances include the Merchant Shipping Ordinance
1952, the Merchant Shipping Ordinance (Sabah) 1960 and the Merchant
Shipping Ordinance (Sarawak) 1960.
	   He said the reason why the three existing ordinances need to be
replaced is that they were inherited from the British colonial
administration and thus, are quite archaic.
	   ``For a similar reason, we are drafting a new Carriage of Goods
by Sea Act.
	   ``The objective of the proposed Act is to update the liability
regime for sea transport.
	   ``At present, the current legislation enacted in 1950 adopts the
Hague rules of 1924. The new Act will adopt the Hague Visby Rules
of 1968,'' he said.
	   ``After these two Acts are passed, we can safely say that the
legislative framework would have been put in place,'' he added.
	   Dr Ling also urged all Malaysian shipping companies which have
yet to obtain their International Safety Management (ISM) Code
compliance certificate to start the process soon.
	   ``This is to ensure that their ships do not face any difficulty
when calling at foreign ports,'' he said.
	   1998 will be the year is when the ISM Code will be fully
implemented.
	   ISM Code compliance ensures that safety is given high priority
in the operation of the ships.
	   The Marine Department has been put in charge of issuing the
document of compliance certificate as well as supervising the
classification societies responsible for issuing the ISM Code
compliance certificate.
	   ``There are four lead auditors as well as four auditors from the
department authorised to issue the document of compliance
certificates.
	   ``To date, they have issued the certificates to 12 shipping
companies,''
	   he added.
	   Dr Ling also reminded the maritime industry of the new extended
Traffic Separation Scheme in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore
that will be enforced on December 1 this year.
	   ``This has already been agreed to by the Maritime Safety
Committee of the International Maritime Organisation. The scheme
will be complemented by the vessel traffic system.
	   ``It is at present undergoing pre-commissioning trials and is
expected to be fully operational soon,'' he said.
	   In line with the Government's efforts to position Port Klang as
a national and regional hub, Dr Ling said it has improved the
infrastructure facilities at the port, and Port Klang now has the
capacity to handle up to 77 million tonnes of cargo.
	   ``We have also improved the supporting landside infrastructure
leading into and out of the port.
	   ``The existing rail link to Port Klang has been doubled-tracked
and a new rail link to West Port is expected to be completed by the
end of this year,'' he said.
	   He added that the Government's efforts have shown encouraging
success resulting in over 90 per cent of the major shipping
alliances call at Port Klang.
	   Currently, 47 main line operators call at Port Klang compared
with 10 in 1990.
	   Malaysian ports handled 165.7 million tonnes of cargo last year,
up 10.2 per cent over the 1996 volume.

Albanians halt Pristina rallies amid apparent lull in fighting

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Organizers of a protest in this
Kosovo capital, in which some 20,000 Albanians took part Wednesday,
decided to stop their daily rallies amid an apparent lull in
fighting.
	   The protesters fervently chanted ``U-C-K,'' the Albanian
language acronym for the Kosovo Liberation Army _ a militant
organization fighting to wrest the southern province away from
Serbia _ and sang a popular Albanian song, praising their ethnic
leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Groups of protesters leaving the rally _ the 60th consecutive
demonstration _ got into a stone-throwing scuffle near the
university with Serbs. Police intervened and dispersed the
protesters. Organizers later said they would stop ``this form of
protest.
	   Also on Wednesday, police burst into a meeting of the
underground Albanian-only university in Pristina, beating 24
professors and one student who were there, the pro-Albanian Kosovo
Information Center said. Six professors were seriously injured.
	   More than 250 people have died in escalating clashes in Kosovo
between Yugoslav troops and ethnic Albanian militants that began in
early March.
	   No further violence was reported early Wednesday elsewhere in
the province, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
Kosovo's restive Albanian majority seeks independence from Serbia,
which stripped its autonomy in 1989 and has since ruled the
province with a heavy military and police presence.
	   Political observers in Pristina said that Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic apparently has decided to somewhat ease the
situation in Kosovo in view of growing international resolve not to
let the fighting escalate into a new Balkan war.
	   A statement issued after Milosevic presided over a leadership
meeting of his ruling Socialist Party said that the party
``supports measures taken by the state bodies aimed at normalizing
the situation'' in Kosovo.
	   The party, as reported by the state news agency Tanjug, also
stressed the need for ``organized efforts to decrease tensions and
take measures that would restore confidence between members of
different ethnic communities in Kosovo.'' But it warned that
``terrorists'' would be ``decisively'' confronted.
	   After meeting in Belgrade Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin
Jovanovic and other officials, Tony Lloyd, the British Foreign
Office minister, said ``there is no military solution, neither for
Belgrade government nor for the the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   ``The entire international community appeals for a return to the
negotiating table,'' he added.
	   LLoyd insisted that ``concessions are needed ... from both
sides.''

	   THE Finance Ministry Tuesday failed to win Cabinet support for
its privatisation proposal for Thai Airways International as
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda left for the G-7 conference
in New York.
	   The Cabinet agreed in principle to sell 335 million shares in
the airline -- 235 million existing shares owned by the government
and 100 million new shares --in what is seen as an attempt to
retain THAI's national airline status with a continued government
holding of 71.5 per cent.
	   The Finance Ministry wanted to sell 380 million shares to dilute
the government's stake to less than 70 per cent.
	   Permanent Finance Secretary Supachai Phisitvanich said that at
current prices the sale would add about US$300 million to the
national coffers and would reduce the government's stake to 71.5
per cent from about 93 per cent at present.
	   A government spokesman said the Cabinet approved the
establishment of a committee to select a consultant for the
privatisation process. However, it appointed permanent secretary
for transport and THAI board chairman Mahidol Chantrangkurn to head
the committee instead of the Comptroller-General director-general
following a recommendation by the Finance Ministry.
	   The consultant will be responsible for drawing up the terms of
reference to select a strategic partner, and setting a timeframe
and share price as well as adopting criteria for a share allocation
to airline employees.
	   The Cabinet also agreed that the airline should sell the shares
to strategic partners and institutions through private placements
and public offerings. Earlier, the Finance Ministry proposed that
the Cabinet sell the entire shares to a strategic partner to pave
the way for the airline's management to be revamped.
	   A Transport Ministry official said many international airlines,
including British Airways, Northwest Airlines and Singapore
Airlines, have expressed interest in becoming a strategic partner,
but most want more than a 20 per cent stake to give them an active
role in the airline's management.
	   THAI is a member of the Star Alliance led by United Airlines,
Lufthansa of Germany, SAS, Air Canada and Varig of Brazil.
	   Some time ago the Cabinet assigned the Finance and Transport
ministries to work on possible privatisation plans involving
diluting the government's stake to less than 50 per cent.
	   Under economic reform guidelines agreed with the IMF earlier
this year, Thailand proposed to accelerate the privatisation of its
national industries, including several strategic national
companies.
	   Shares in Thai Airways, Bangchak Petroleum Co and Electricity
Generating Plc were all slated for sale this year. Next year, the
government has promised to sell several other national bodies,
including telecommunications companies.
	   Meanwhile, the Cabinet approved a plan to strengthen the
airline's performance amid the regional crisis. The airline is
expected to cut its spending budget further in the 1998 fiscal year
to equal to last year, while adjusting its marketing strategy and
flight operating plan to boost its revenue.
	   The government urged the airline to improve its operating
performance -- excluding forex gains -- to attract investors and
ensure a good share price.

	   TENAGA Nasional Bhd (Tenaga) will emerge as a major shareholder
in Malakoff Bhd, with at least a 20 per cent stake, after the
proposed disposal of its stake in TNB Janamanjung Sdn Bhd and of up
to 20 per cent interest in Segari Energy Ventures Sdn Bhd.
	   Malakoff will issue new shares of RM1 each to Tenaga in the
exercise.
	   The number of shares to be issued will only be determined upon
the finalisation of the valuations of Janamanjung and Segari and
the percentage of Segari to be acquired.
	   The two major shareholders in Malakoff's are Malaysian Resources
Bhd with 21 per cent and National Power Plc (15 per cent). Malakoff
also holds 75 per cent in Segari.
	   Janamanjung, with an authorised share capital of RM25,000, is a
wholly- owned subsidiary of Tenaga.
	   It was set up to develop and operate a 2,100MW coal-fired plant
near Lumut.
	   Janamanjung is estimated to be worth around RM200 million
(excluding the power purchase agreement and engineering,
procurement and contraction contract).
	   Commerce International Merchant Bankers Bhd, in a statement to
the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange, said Tenaga and Malakoff signed
yesterday a memorandum of understanding to initiate the process of
the share acquisition.
	   The two companies have to enter into share acquisition
agreements for the proposed acquisitions by August 9 1998.
	   Tenaga executive chairman Datuk Dr Ahmad Tajuddin Ali, speaking
to reporters after witnessing the signing of a power purchase
agreement between the utility giant and Janamanjung, said: ``This
is only an intention from the two parties. All the terms of the
deals need to be negotiated and due diligence is also under way.''
	   ``It will take about two months to finalise the details pending
the approval from the related government agencies,'' he said,
adding that Tenaga views the exercise as a long-term investment.
	   Details of the agreeement are expected within two months.
	   It is understood that Tenaga will be using its equity in Segari
as an adjustment to keep its equity holding about 20.4 per cent in
Malakoff.
	   Tajuddin said the move is in line with the industry
restructuring as the utility company reduces its role in the
independent power plants.
	   It will, instead, concentrate on equity partnership with power-
generating companies.
	   The exercise, he said, is being undertaken considering that
Janamanjung is a priority project to the nation and the ability of
Tenaga to raise funding for the project.
	   The exercise, he said, will be strategic to both companies which
are involved in the power-generation business and providing a
strategic and synergistic benefits to Tenaga.
	   Tajuddin said the financing of the project will be decided by
the new owners of the company.
	   The project, which has been estimated to cost close to RM7
billion, will be financed through project financing, turning to
shareholders only as the last resort.
	   Credit Facility Agency will be providing up to 45 per cent of
the project financing in Janamanjung to finance the foreign portion
of the project.
	   Sources said while the Government wants the project to have
foreign direct investment, Tenaga views it as a lost in earnings if
the project is given to a foreign party.
	   ``The exercise will benefit Tenaga as it is able to lift the
financing off its books and consolidate it in a single account in
Malakoff.
	   ``At the same time, it is able to generate earnings from
Janamanjung and convert a future earning stream into immediate
earning through its stake in Malakoff.
	   ``Unlike Tenaga which has the Government as its majority
shareholder, Malakoff is much freer to make decisions.
	   ``The presence of National Power Plc in Malakoff is positive as
the foreign partner is able to inject funds at the project level or
take an active role in the project itself,'' the source said.
	   The source added that foreign direct investment in Janamanjung
is also possible to finance the project.
	   However, the combination of Tenaga, MRCB and National Power will
make it easier for the company to seek foreign funding.

	   BANK Kerjasama Rakyat Malaysia Berhad has no immediate plans to
go public despite having the potential to do so, its chairman Datuk
Dr Yusof Yaacob said.
	   He said although the current national economic climate had
affected business, the co-operative bank enjoyed strong support
from both its customers and depositors.
	   ``Our performance was good until last year when the country was
hit by regional economic problems but public confidence (remains)
good,'' he said after presenting the bank's business tithes (zakat)
amounting to RM125,325.41 to the Perak Religious Affairs Council.
It was handed to the Sultan of Perak at Istana Iskandariah in Kuala
Kangsar, Perak, yesterday.
	   The Sultan later handed the cheque to the department's director
Mohd Yusop Yahaya on behalf of the council.
	   The tithe was for business transacted by the bank's seven
branches in Perak between 1994 and 1996.
	   The bank will pay a total of RM2.6 million in business tithes
for business transacted by 73 branches nationwide in 1994, 1995 and
1996 to the respective State Religious Affairs Councils this year.
	   So far, it has handed tithes to the Religious Councils of
Perlis, Kedah, Terengganu, Kelantan, Selangor, Federal Territory,
Malacca and Sabah.
	   The chairman said talks that the bank was going public were mere
rumours.
	   The bank, which introduced Islamic banking at the end of 1993,
recorded a pre-tax profit RM106 million in 1996.

	   FOR Mercure Hotel Pattaya Resort, being alone does not mean
lying down and going to sleep on the beach.
	   Don't let the signboard fool you as you look at it from the main
Sukhumvit Road leading a few kilometres to Pattaya.
	   Mercure Hotel is indeed set along the beach, among 25 rai of
lush tropical gardens, a four-star resort focusing on vacations for
the entire family.
	   ''I strongly believe that Pattaya, despite its notoriety, can
still be a vacation destination for families. Here, is where we can
offer luxury, privacy, leisure and tranquility to unwind from the
hustle and bustle of city life,'' said Herbert Williams, general
manager with 17 years of experience under his belt.
	   Just two-years-old, Mercure Pattaya Resort has gained a
reputation for offering a get-away setting for both leisure and
business needs.
	   ''Besides our 540 rooms and three presidential suites, we have
52 self-contained executive apartments [from Bt45,000 to Bt95,000
ranging from 70 square metres to 140 square metres in size] for
long-staying corporate guests working in the Eastern Seaboard,''
said Williams, a Bombay-born graduate from Castle Klessheim in
Slazburg, Austria. The apartments are from the 16th to the 23rd
floor.
	   Williams, who replaced John Gardner (now in Indonesia), has been
here for around four months and is strongly convinced that Pattaya
can compete with Phuket. ''If Phuket is a 100-per-cent family
destination, then Pattaya can be 80 per cent.'' He points to mass
tourism as the solution to filling up Pattaya and said that ''only
time will tell''.
	   As part of the ''Amazing Thailand'' campaign, Williams perceives
that Pattaya has picked up in terms of tourist arrivals. ''We too
have benefitted from the campaign.'' If Pattaya segregates its
areas for different activities, Williams, with work stints in
Zurich, the Philippines, Jakarta, Jamaica, Taiwan and China, notes
that Mercure Pattaya Resort can be part of the family-oriented
area. Mercure Pattaya Resort has the facilities for families from a
fully-equipped fitness centre, swimming pool and outdoor jacuzzi,
mini-golf and golf driving range, indoor board games, squash and
tennis courts, snooker tables and saunas.
	   ''We provide free shuttle services on the hour into Pattaya
city. For parties and business conferences, up to 1,000 people can
be accommodated in our ballroom.'' The 'Arabian Nights' theme party
going on at the poolside is just one of the many that have included
'Russian Nights' and 'Indian Nights'.
	   Williams admits re-engineering had been done some time back to
cope with the economic downturn and expenses were trimmed last
year. ''Our exchange rate benchmark with foreign tour operators has
been around Bt45 and this will keep both parties happy.'' Although
a newcomer, Williams perspective of Pattaya does echo some old-time
managers' in Pattaya: ''Before Pattaya was relatively known for its
night life. With top brands like Delaney's, Ripley's and Central
coming in, the city has pitched more for families and 30 per cent
of the tourists over the weekends here are Thais.'' If you talk
family, then there must be a ''Kiddies Fun Centre'' where cartoon
videos and freebies are provided. ''We have that,'' Williams
smiled.
	   Despite the stiff competition in the initials years, Williams
now claims a 70 to 80 per cent occupancy rate. ''More Russian and
Taiwanese tour groups.'' During the low season, 65 per cent, he
said. ''Most of our guests are from Asia, 70 per cent, and the rest
from Europe. The Arabs are coming back.'' He is happy with the
local government for cleaning up the environs and cites the Bt1.86
billion water treatment plant which will be operation in June next
year for Chonburi, Naklua, Pattaya and Jomtien.

	   THE Government will look into the possibility of providing tax
reduction or exemption as well as other incentives to unit trust
holders and funds to boost the industry.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said the
Government has to continue to implement measures to safeguard the
interest of unit trust holders in view of the long-term benefit
derived from such an industry.
	   ``Besides being able to collect funds from all segments of the
community, the unit trust industry helps to ensure a fair and just
society,'' he said at the Federation of Malaysian Unit Trust Fund
Managers' (FMUTM) second annual general meeting in Kuala Lumpur
yesterday.
	   Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, was responding to FMUTM's
suggestion that the Government, particularly the Finance Ministry,
provide incentives to boost the industry.
	   Earlier in his speech, FMUTM president Abdul Azim Mohd Zabidi
said the federation had submitted a proposal to the Finance
Ministry to consider providing incentives such as tax exemption on
long-term savings in unit trusts, pension funds's investment in the
unit trusts and on unit trusts' earnings.
	   Anwar also reiterated that the Government will take the
necessary measures to revive and strengthen the economy.
	   ``We will have to continue to undertake the necessary financial
reform measures.
	   ``In admitting the truth, we can no longer afford to deny the
shortcomings ... there is a need to assert governance associated
with policy and implementation, including lack of transparency and
its related thought.
	   ``Corporations, too, can suffer from poor health due to their
lack of fairness, responsibility and transparency,'' he said,
adding that there should not be any compromise on the need to
ensure professionalism and strengthen the management of the unit
trusts.
	   In this regard, Anwar praised the FMUTM for making the efforts
to improve the level of professionalism through its various courses
and programmes.
	   ``With constant and healthy progress of the unit trust industry,
this will mobilise the growth of the capital market,'' he added.
	   On the overall unit trust performance, Anwar said, it is still
considered below expectation, adding that there is still room for
improvement.
	   ``As at March 31 this year, the unit trust industry was valued
at RM43 billion, which accounts for 9.5 per cent of the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange's market capitalisation.
	   ``This is considered low. Although we have vast experience such
as through Permodalan Nasional Bhd and state unit trusts, our
performance is still below par compared to those in Thailand and
India,'' he added.
	   The unit trust industry in Thailand and India was valued at 15
per cent and 25 per cent of the market capitalisation respectively.
	   ``The statistics surprise me because we have been conducting
intensive campaigns to promote the industry and ensure effective
unit trust management,'' Anwar said.
	   Anwar also said the move to impose a freeze on
Government-sponsored trust funds from December 10 last year was to
ensure the existing unit trusts can manage their funds effectively
and efficiently.
	   ``This is to enable them to strengthen their positions and
enhance their performance,'' he said.
	   In spite of the present downward performance of the local unit
trust industry, Anwar said, this is the opportune time for
Malaysians to buy the undervalued unit trusts for the long-term.
	   ``Since the middle of last year, the prices of the units,
including the eight state-sponsored ones, have fallen below RM1 a
unit,'' he said.
	   As an example, he cited Amanah Saham Sabah. The unit was valued
at RM1.38 on July 31 last year but now it is worth only 28 sen.

	   RETAILER Jaya Jusco Stores Bhd is confident of returning to the
black by achieving a net profit of about RM40 million this year
despite registering a loss after tax of RM14.44 million for the
year ended Feb 28, 1998.
	   The loss has been attributed to unrealised foreign exchange
losses of RM48.5 million from the company's offshore loans.
	   ``We have taken care of it (the loss) and if the ringgit
stabilises against the US dollar, we can expect to make some profit
this year,'' said chairman Datuk Abdullah Mohd Yusof.
	   The loans were to finance Jaya Jusco Stores' plan to set up more
retail outlets.
	   Managing director Masaaki Toyoshima said the company would
embark on a new strategy known as the Neighbourhood Shopping Centre
in anticipation of a difficult year ahead in the retail industry
and weakened consumer spending power.
	   ``The NSCs will be located in suburban centres away from city
centres.
	   Ten locations have been identified within the Klang Valley and
Johor Baru vicinity,'' said Toyoshima.
	   ``We expect a turnover of RM30 million and an investment of
about RM15 million for each store.''
	   When asked why the company continued to expand despite a
downturn in the retail industry, Toyoshima said: ``We are in a good
position to do so and the downturn does not affect us because we
are not selling speciality merchandise.''
	   The expansion will be funded through internally generated funds
to reduce the gearing ratio of the company which stands at between
0.51 and 0.73.
	   Currently its outstanding debts stand at about US$42.16 million
(RM168.64 million).
	   Toyoshima said the company's overall first quarter peformance
this year (March to May) improved by 4.9 per cent from the same
period last year.
	   Besides the NSCs, Jaya Jusco Stores will embark on ``we
identify, we design, we lease and you build'' concept to reduce
investment expenditure.
	   This concept, according to Abdullah, was used successfully for
the One Utama store in Petaling Jaya where its only expenditure
consisted of fitting out the store at a cost of RM30 million.
	   Currently, the company has six stores in Taman Maluri, Wangsa
Maju, Bukit Raja in Klang, Bandar Utama, Malacca and Ipoh.
	   There are also new stores in the making located in the Mid
Valley Mega Mall in Kuala Lumpur which is expected to be completed
by October next year, and in Penang and Johor Baru.
	   However, the opening of its stores in Bayan World Megamall in
Penang and Seri Alam Shopping Centre in Johor will be delayed by
one to two years due to a delay in the development.
	   The company will expand its Malacca and Taman Maluri stores into
new shopping centres by December and March 2000 respectively.
	   Jaya Jusco Stores is part of the AEON Group based in Japan.
	   The company registered a turnover of RM692.5 million for the
year ended Feb 28, 1998 - a 14.8 per cent rise over last year's
results. Operating profit also increased by 23 per cent to RM54.4
million while profit before tax fell 86.3 per cent to RM6.1
million.

	   EFFECTIVE July 15, rates for all refrigerated shipments to Asia
on carriers under the Westbound Transpacific Stabilisation
Agreement (WTSA) will be increased by US$150 (US$1  &QC;  RM3.94) per
FEU (40-foot equivalent units). Subsequent increases will follow
suit effective October 1 1998 (US$200 per FEU), and January 1 1999
(US$200 per FEU).
	   These increases, according to the WTSA chief executives who met
in Seoul recently, will be cumulative in effect for a total of
US$550 per FEU on refrigerated commodities.
	   Exceptions to the scheduled three-stage increase are beef and
pork from all origin points and poultry shipped via US East Coast
ports. These cargoes will see increases of US$350 per FEU on
October 1 1998 and US$200 on January 1 1999.
	   The increase is part of plans adopted by the 13 container
shipping lines to stabilise current rate levels and partially
recover a portion of lost revenues following declining cargo and
plummeting freight rates from the US to Asia in recent months.
	   The 13 major carriers in WTSA had reported an overall drop in
freight charges ranging from US$600 to US$800 per FEUs (40-foot
equivalent units) for both ``dry'' and high-value, time-sensitive
refrigerated cargoes, since the beginning of 1998. The WTSA chief
executives agreed on the need for a series of rate adjustments
through this and early next year, aimed at partially restoring rate
levels for refrigerated commodities.
	   WTSA, in a statement released in Kuala Lumpur yesterday, said
members also approved procedural steps aimed at stabilising and
improving revenues for dry cargos not exempted from tariff filing,
much of which now move under individual service contracts.
	   Members committed to developing a restoration programme that
would raise overall non-exempt dry cargo levels by US$250 per FEU
effective September 1 1998.
	   One exception, hay - which has seen rates cut by more than half
last year - will see a rate plan put in place effective July 15,
with the lowest rates from the from the US West Coast to Japan
ranging from about US$890 to US$965 and more uniform rules covering
charges associated with trucking, storage, container cleaning and
other practices specific to the carriage of hay.
	   For destinations other than Japan, hay rates be increased by
US$250, effective July 15. ``A strong dollar, tight credit and
pressures to export in Asia have led to a serious trade and cargo
imbalance in this large and complex market,'' WTSA executive
director Albert A. Pierce said.
	   ``The economies of positioning containers in Asia, recovering
high equipment and handling costs for refrigerated shipments, and
meeting total voyage costs, all make a rate restoration effort
essential, especially when cargo volumes are down. It makes no
sense for carriers to chase a larger share of a shrinking market
through discounting, when fixed costs are so high and service
demands are increasing,'' he said.
	   WTSA members are American President Lines Ltd, China Ocean
Shipping Co, Evergreen Marine Corp, Hanjin Shipping Co Ltd,
Hapag-Lloyd Container Line GmbH, Hyundai Merchant Marine (America)
Ltd, Kawasaki Kaisha (K Line) Ltd, Maersk Line, Mitsui O S K Lines
Ltd, Nippon Yusen Kaisha Ltd (NYK Line), Orient Overseas Container

World Cup: Boyd own goal gives defending champs 2-1 victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more quotes . &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Brazil usually doesn't need help.
This time they took it.
	   In a sloppy match that kept with the tradition of World Cup
openers, defending champion Brazil needed an own goal from Tommy
Boyd in the 73rd minute to beat Scotland 2-1 Wednesday, but showed
little sign that it's ready to win a fifth title.
	   Ronaldo, the two-time FIFA Player of the Year, lived up to
expectations with a dazzling repertoire of stutter-step dribbles,
explosive charges and artillery. But he got little help from the
rest of the Brazilian team _ especially a defense that looked slow
and confused.
	   ``We made mistakes in the first half,'' admitted Brazilian coach
Mario Zagallo. ``But we changed our way of playing, pressed them
more and dominated.''
	   But the best part of the game was the points in the victory
column.
	   ``Brazil is happy and we got the three points,'' he said.
``These opening games aren't easy.''
	   The afternoon began as a party for the defending world
champions. The Stade de France stadium was a sea of Brazilian
green-and-yellow jerseys, flags and body paint. Some bipartisan
fans wore kilts with Ronaldo's No. 9 shirt.
	   And before the players had time to break a sweat, Brazil was on
the board.
	   In the fourth minute, Dunga blasted a long shot from straight on
that Colin Hendry headed wide. Bebeto took the corner kick and
curled the ball into the near post, where Cesar Sampaio beat Craig
Burley and John Collins to a header that made it 1-0.
	   ``Things started well for me, scoring the first goal. And this
is a great start for the team, too,'' Cesar Sampaio said. ``Scoring
like that, the first goal, makes me unbelievably happy. During
those first five seconds one forgets about everything else. It's
like a dream''.
	   Meanwhile, Ronaldo troubled the Scot defense with runs from the
left and right.
	   In the 13th minute, the 21-year-old striker broke into the area,
and Colin Hendry nearly headed the ball into his own net trying to
clear.
	   Three minutes later, Rivaldo found Ronaldo open on the left
side, but his booming shot was tipped wide by goalkeeper Jim
Leighton. Ronaldo struck again in the 20th minute, twisting Hendry
around and racing through the defense to test Leighton once more.
	   ``I had my chances and did everything right,'' Ronaldo shrugged,
then corrected himself. ``Well, almost everything. The ball didn't
go in the net.''
	   But if the crowd sensed a blowout, the Scots had other ideas.
Slowly the Europeans settled and were able to gain more of the
possession, but were never able to control the game.
	   ``I think we were brave, but perhaps not good enough,'' Scotland
coach Craig Brown. ``They deserved to win, but we shouldn't have
lost, that's the way we're looking at it.''
	   Striker Gordon Durie created the Scots first real chance,
slipping behind the defense and caught a high pass in mid-flight,
but his deflection lofted just over the crossbar.
	   The left side of the Brazilian defense was an avenue for the
Scots, with Roberto Carlos charging upfield and 32-year-old
fullback Aldair, who was cleared by doctors only on Tuesday to
play, nearly always late on coverage.
	   In the 29th minute, the Scots blew in with a dangerous cross,
twisting around fullback Junior Baiano and forcing him to clear the
ball with the outside of his left heal.
	   Seven minutes later, Cesar Sampaio ran over the back of Kevin
Gallacher in the penalty area on another Scot counterattack.
Collins converted into the lower right corner to make it 1-1.
	   ``There was just no time to brake,'' Sampaio said. ``The
attacker was just smarter than I was.''
	   Then it was Brazil's turn to get nervous, flubbing passes and
losing the ball unchallenged. In the final minute of the half,
Aldair was yellow-carded for a rough tackle.
	   Leonardo came in for an apathetic Giovanni at the start of the
second half to improve coverage in the midfield and create more
movement, and Brazil came out pressing. Rivaldo put a scare in the
Scots with a series of three tight dribbles and bullet past the
right post.
	   But the defense seemed bent on complicating simple plays.
	   In the 49th minute, Sampaio kicked a ball out of keeper
Taffarel's arms. Six minutes later, the Scots wove in again up the
right, and Taffarel took a cleat in the head from Sampaio as they
collided, and Cafu sent the ball to a corner.
	   Rivaldo and Ronaldo were the sole sparks for Brazil, until a
fluke play decided the game.
	   In the 73rd minute, Dunga found Cafu with a long pass up the
right side. The Brazilian defender tapped a shot that bounced off
Leighton, again off a backtracking Boyd and into the net.
	   ``It hit me on the chest and I couldn't get out of the way,''
said the 33-year-old Celtic defender. ``It was probably the worst
feeling I have ever had to lose a game like that.''
	   For Brown, it felt almost like Scotland had allowed Brazil to
steal one.
	   ``They realized they were fortunate to win the game,'' he said.
``There's no denying that the better team won the game, but we had
a great chance not to lose.''
	   Meanwhile, the Brazilians were simply relieved to get it over
with.
	   ``It was a big step for us,'' said Leonardo. ``Everyone expects
so much more of Brazil.''

	   THE Petroleum Authority of Thailand and the Government Savings
Bank have confirmed that they will fully subscribe to the new
capital-increase shares to be issued by National Fertiliser Plc,
NFC vice president Trakul Chatdarong said Tuesday.
	   NFC announced Tuesday its plans to increase its registered
capital to Bt5 billion from Bt4 billion by issuing 100 million new
shares to existing shareholders at Bt5 apiece. Par value is Bt10
per share.
	   The Bt500-million capital increase plan is expected to lead into
a change in the shareholding structure of NFC since major
shareholders are expected to increase their stake in the firm,
against minority shareholders.
	   On the local stock market, NFC shares closed at Bt3 apiece on
Monday, down Bt0.10 from Friday.
	   According to Trakul, the five largest shareholders of NFC, who
hold a combined 65-per cent stake, are expected to participate in
the capital increase and maintain their holding ratio in the
company.
	   The top two NFC shareholders, the PTT and GSB, have provided
letters confirming their intention to subscribe to the new shares
and are even ready to increase their proportional holding in NFC if
other shareholders decide to dilute their holding, the NFC vice
president said.
	   Existing shareholders will be offered the chance to exercise
their right to subscribe to the capital-increase shares under the
ratio of four old shares per one new share. NFC will seek approval
at a shareholders meeting to be held on June 23.
	   Thammasek, a Singaporean investment firm, has also confirmed
through NFC's adviser Capital Nomura Securities Plc that it would
like to purchase NFC stock, but NFC prefers to wait and see the
results of the capital-increase programme before considering the
possibility of share sales to the Singaporean firm, Trakul said.
	   ''Others said they would rather see NFC remain a Thai-owned
company'', he explained.
	   NFC is 22.5-per-cent owned by PTT, 13.5-per-cent each by GSB and
Industrial Finance Corp of Thailand, nine-per-cent by the Crown
Property Bureau and 7.3-per-cent by the Finance Ministry.
	   As of June 3 NFC has about 3,000 shareholders. NFC shareholders
will have to pay for the new shares during a four-day period
beginning on July 20.
	   For the first quarter of 1998 NFC reported a net profit of
Bt1.77 billion, or Bt4.42 per share, including a foreign-exchange
gain of Bt2.2 billion. The company operates a
one-million-tonne-per-annum chemical-fertiliser factory in Map Ta
Phut Industrial Estate.

	   FUJI Photo (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd yesterday unveiled the latest
Fujifilm digital camera, the MX-700, taking amateur photography to
new heights with its 1.5 million pixel resolution for better
picture sharpness.
	   Set to capture 12 per cent of the local digital camera market,
Fuji has forecast RM13 million in sales this year for the camera
which is retailed at RM3,400 each.
	   The first Fujifilm digital camera was introduced in Malaysia in
1996.
	   Unlike it's older brother the DS-7 and other digital camera for
amateurs which only has a resolution of about 300,000 pixels, the
MX-700's pixel 1.5 million is set to revolutionise amateur
photography.
	   (A pixel is the small dots that make up a picture. The smaller
it is, the finer the picture).
	   At a Press conference to unveil the camera at Fuji Photo's
office in Kuala Lumpur, managing director Hiroatsu Machida said the
new camera was also the most compact of its kind available in the
market and would lead a new batch of digital equipment that allows
amateurs to take professional- level pictures.
	   This is because apart from the digital camera's ability to
produce pictures as shown on the small screen on it, users can also
make on-the- spot alterations to the colours even while focusing on
an object.
	   Conventional cameras, while still the popular choice due to its
huge consumer base, has the problem of the need to get proper
lighting and other factors.
	   Amateurs tend to end up with less than desirable results as a
picture might not be like what they saw through the lenses.
	   Still, the digital camera's average resolution of around 300,000
pixels leaves a lot to be desired compared to the conventional
one's picture grains that is equivalent six million pixels.
	   Thus the MX-700 high resolution is welcomed as it is learned
that previously the highest available resolution for digital camera
is 1.4 million pixels and even then it was made and priced for
professional photographers.
	   However, Machida said, this resolution gap between digital and
conventional would be closed in a few years although digital
cameras would not wipe out conventional ones. They would instead
complement it and expand the scope of photography.
	   ``What it offers is more possibilites for more people,'' he
said.

	   MALAYSIA has so far made substantial commitments to liberalise
the shipping industry under the General Agreement on Trade in
Services (GATS), according to a World Trade Organisation (WTO)
official.
	   WTO Trade in Services Division legal officer Pierre Latrille
said the country had joined the other 38 nations offering partial
commitments under GATS to liberalise the shipping and maritime
sector.
	   In his paper entitled ``Maritime Industry: Meeting New and
Changing Demand Conditions'' presented at a seminar in Subang Jaya
yesterday, he said Malaysia offers commitments of passenger
transportation, freight transportation, and supporting services for
maritime transport.
	   Latrille said in view of the slow progress of the liberalisation
in this sector, what Malaysia did can be considered as significant
and would yield benefits for the country.
	   There had been up to now two stages in negotiations under GATS.
One which was not distinct from the general negotiations on
services at the end of the Uruguay Round (1990-1993), and a second
one specifically related to maritime in 1995-1996.
	   Latrille said the first negotiation failed for various reasons.
The first of those of reasons had been the general reluctance of
the shipping profession towards GATS system.
	   The second reason was the specific position of the US in
shipping, making it reluctant to alter its existing maritime policy
that relies on a strong anti-trust system designed to favour small
shippers.
	   Latrilles said in the second round of negotiation in 1995-1996,
there was no real progress in the efforts to liberalise the
maritime sector other than mere technical progress, where new
jargons were introduced.
	   ``Without any possibility of linkage or trade, there was nothing
attractive enough to induce the US to make an offer. The US has
therefore used the argument that the critical mass, notably in
South-East Asia, Latin America and Africa, was not there,'' he
added.
	   He said those countries in turn did not feel the the need to
make substantial offers as they perfectly knew that the US, a major
actor, would not deliver in the end, which amounted to a very
unbalanced overall final package.
	   The European Union, entrenched in its classical tactical game
with the US, could not for political reasons maintain its offer in
the end, and wanted to keep ammunition for future debates on
audiovisual.
	   Latrille said the result was that only countries with genuine
interest in liberalising shipping or that for general policy
reasons wanted to advance liberalisation committed themselves in
the end.
	   Only a few new commitments were taken at this occasion -
modification of pre-existing commitments for Canada and Malaysia -
adding themselves to the 30 commitments taken at the end of the
Uruguay Round in 1993.
	   Latrille said for the Malaysian shipping industry the
provisional results of these negotiations is two-fold.
	   On the one hand, this industry will enjoy the legal stability
and the national treatment and the most-favoured-nation treatment
granted by the commitments taken by the 39 countries that have made
the commitments.
	   On the other hand, Malaysia shipping industry will have to face
the potential competition of the foreign providers that Malaysia
has allowed by its own commitments as a price for getting
commitments from the other members of WTO.
	   Shipping is a service. It is covered since 1995 by the WTO
disciplines known under the name of the GATS.
	   The concept of liberalising trade in services was introduced
during the preparation of the Uruguay Round in 1982, and discussed
during the Round itself between 1986 and 1993.
	   The result of these discussions was GATS, largely inspired by
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that had been so
successful in dismantling Customs duties and more generally
barriers to trade in goods, but adapted to the specificity of
services.
	   The core principles of GATS are universal coverage, shipping,
most favoured nation (MFN) clause, the transparency, market access
and national treatment when the sector is offered, irreversibility,
the submission to WTO dispute settlement procedures and the
progressive liberalisation.

	   WESTMONT Industries Bhd's creditors will decide on Aug 29
whether to allow the company to proceed with its proposed rescue
scheme under Section 176 of the Companies Act 1965.
	   ``The High Court has set the date (Aug 29) for the creditors to
vote (on the proposal),'' director Datuk Jaffar Indot told a Press
conference at Petaling Jaya, Selangor yesterday.
	   The proposal is to provide the group with the financial ability
to enable it to continue its operations on a going-concern basis
and, in the long term, to regain profitability.
	   The High Court had earlier granted a Restraining Order applied
for by Westmont Industries to allow the company to proceed with its
rescue scheme.
	   The exercise has several major components - including a proposed
capital reduction in which 33 sen will be cancelled for each
Westmont Industries RM1 share.
	   Then, three shares - now worth 67 each - will be consolidated
into two RM1 shares - with the final result seeing the reduction of
accumulated losses by RM77.67 million.
	   The capital restructuring will reduce Westmont Industries issued
capital from RM233.2 million to RM155.4 million.
	   This proposal will be followed by a proposed restricted issue of
new shares to the major shareholder, Swascojuta Sdn Bhd, to raise
about RM61.15 million.
	   Following the restructuring, Swascojuta would hold directly and
indirectly 21.8 per cent of Westmont Industries' revised capital,
compared to 16.5 per cent currently.
	   As at Dec 31, 1997, both Westmont Industries and wholly-owned
subsidiary Sabah Shipyard Sdn Bhd owed (to debenture holders,
partially secured creditors and unsecured creditors) RM66.49
million and RM907.3 million respectively.
	   The rescue exercise could be conducted by Westmont Industries if
it gets the approval of creditors - by 75 per cent in value of
debts and 50 per cent in number of each of the classes of creditors
affected.
	   Meanwhile, chairman and substantial shareholder of Swascojuta
Datuk Md Desa Pachi said the company had completed preliminary
meetings with all classes of creditors.
	   ``The thrust of our meetings has been to convince our creditors
that Westmont Industries' value is more than the sum of its parts,
and that its business has tremendous potential.
	   ``Liquidation of Westmont Industries is not a viable alternative
as most creditors would not receive full payment while
shareholders' investment in the company would likely be rendered
valueless.''
	   The response from creditors was encouraging as it remained the
best alternative for restoring the long-term viability of Westmont
Industries and Sabah Shipyard.
	   ``We are hopeful for a quick resolution and approvals from the
various authorities,'' he said.

	   THE ringgit closed stronger yesterday at 3.9500/600 against the
US dollar compared with Monday's close at 4.0000/100.
	   Dealers said the ringgit was traded at a high of 3.9350 and a
low of 4.0150 and activities on currency could be mostly attributed
to regional sentiments.
	   ``News in the market was that US funds sold dollars, sold enough
to push the ringgit up. The ringgit moved some 600 points today,''
a dealer said yesterday.
	   Another dealer said the stronger ringgit yesterday was also due
to activities on the ringgit-Singapore dollar front.
	   ``Players are selling the Singapore dollar for the ringgit after
Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that
Singapore's banks will no longer hide reserves and bad loans, will
open to foreign competition and have more liquidity.
	   ``There are indications that interest rates may be lowered in
Singapore and this has helped the ringgit strengthen a little,''
she said.
	   The ringgit closed mixed against other currencies. It ended a
stronger 2.3086/185 against the Singapore dollar from Monday's
2.3349/428. It also ended firmer against the yen at 2.8132/213
against Monday's 2.8424/505.
	   Against sterling, it firmed to 6.4559/742 from Monday's
6.5170/354.
	   As for other regional currencies, it was reported that there was
hardly any trading interest offshore in the Indonesian rupiah,
which closed at 11,800 against the greenback, down from Monday's
close of 11,700.
	   The Taiwan dollar ended at an 11-year low of 34.715 against the
US dollar, down from 34.697 while the Philippine peso rose to 39.40
from 39.63, as did the South Korean won at 1,395 from 1,400.
	   On the securities front, markets across the region closed mixed.
The Kuala Lumpur Composite Index ended 7.85 points up to 505.64 but
on generally quiet trading.

	   WESTMONT Industries Bhd hopes to close its sad chapter of
financial difficulties and chart a new course for the group's
future, said chairman Datuk Md Desa Pachi.
	   ``Looking at our financial status as well as the current
economic climate, the management will have its hands full in the
months and years ahead.
	   ``Out task is to ensure that our existing operations remain
viable and efficient, while seeking solutions to turn around the
fortunes of the group,'' he told journalists yesterday.
	   He added that Westmont Industries' crown jewel and wholly-owned
subsidiary Sabah Shipyard Sdn Bhd had received several enquiries on
shipping-related jobs, but had to turn down the offer.
	   The company had to decline the jobs due to uncertainty about the
direction of the group in view of the pending court case.
	   The High Court had on Feb 4 granted a Restraining Order applied
for by the company to allow it to proceed with its rescue scheme
pursuant to Section 176 of the Companies Act 1965.
	   ``We knew that the state of affairs we inherited was gloomy, but
we needed to determine definitively the size of losses and debts.
We know it is not going to be an easy task,'' said Md Desa.
	   Westmont Industries registered a group operating loss of
RM108.641 million for the year ended Dec 31, 1997 against a group
pre-tax loss of RM664.79 million previously.
	   Md Desa was appointed to the board on April 24 last year
following the acquisition of 32.9 per cent stake in Westmont
Industries, through Swascojuta Sdn Bhd, from Promet Bhd.
	   He is the substantial shareholder of Swascojuta.
	   Promet has earlier purchased the 32.9 per cent stake in Westmont
Industries from Westmont Holdings Sdn Bhd, which is controlled by
businessman and politician Datuk Joseph Chong Chek Ah.
	   Meanwhile, Westmont Industries executive director Mohd Shafeii
Abdul Gaffoor said Sabah Shipyard's ship repair operation had
commenced since March and it was currently doing well.
	   ``(The business) is more than sufficient to cover our current
overhead costs,'' he said, adding that the company hoped to
re-enter the ship building activity in the medium term.
	   Sabah Shipyard is said to be one of the largest and best
shipyards and builders of power barges and structures for the
offshore oil and gas industry, not only in Malaysia, but also in
the region.
	   Strategically located in Labuan near the oil fields off Sabah
and Sarawak, Md Desa said it played a key support role for the
country's oil and gas industry with a strong record of past
achievements.
	   Last week, the company was awarded the HSE Management Safety
Performance Award by Petronas for meeting its safety targets for
the last three years.

	   THE International Trade and Industry Ministry has approved 296
projects with foreign equity in the first four months of the year.
	   According to its minister Datuk Seri Rafidah Aziz, the ministry
had received 212 applications valued at RM4.027 billion during this
period.
	   Of the total, domestic applications amounted to RM1.823 billion
while foreign applications totalled RM2.204 billion, she said when
addressing a seminar organised by the Malaysian-Swedish Business
Association in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Last year, 759 projects worth RM25.821 million were approved. Of
the total, 462 were new approvals while 297 were for expansion and
diversification of existing operations.
	   Rafidah said despite the regional crisis, Malaysia is still an
attractive investment location for high value-added and
capital-intensive production.
	   Foreign investors also see Malaysia as a good country to
transfer technologies to.
	   ``They see Malaysia as a worthwhile place to carry out their
operations using state-of-the art processes,'' she said, adding
that some companies implement more advanced technology in Malaysia
than in their home country.
	   Some make Malaysia their regional base as they want to tap the
competitiveness that Malaysia offers, she added.
	   She said foreign investors' interest in Malaysia is evident by
the continuous investment in Malaysia.
	   Acknowledging that Malaysia has not been spared the shrinking
foreign direct investment (FDI), Rafidah said nonetheless the FDI
to Malaysia is still coming in.
	   Rafidah said that the Government is fine-tuning some policies
regarding foreign equity structure, incentives and costs.
	   In assessing Malaysia as an investment location, Rafidah said
foreign investors should look at the country's track record and see
beyond the current regional problems.
	   ``Most important is whether there is a market for the product or
services domestically, regionally or globally,'' she said.
	   In this context, investors will have to look at Malaysia's
competitiveness.
	   Rafidah said Malaysia is no longer competitive in
labour-intensive industries but is attractive for industries with
capital investment per employee ratio.
	   She said under the second Industrial Master Plan (1996-2005),
the Government identified 22 sub-sectors of industries where
Malaysia can serve as competitive production base.
	   ``The major elements are skills, capital and
technology-intensive manufacturing that can move the manufacturing
value-chain to a higher plane.

	   PROMET Bhd, which held its annual meeting yesterday after some
delay pending the finalisation of its accounts, said it had nothing
to hide.
	   Chairman Tan Sri Mohamed Ngah Said said an explanation had been
given to the shareholders and they were satisfied with it.
	   President and chief executive officer Datuk Soh Chee Wen did not
attend the meeting which lasted for over an hour.
	   Promet reported a group pre-tax loss of RM169.69 million for the
16- month period ended April 30, 1997. For the year ended Dec 31,
1995, it recorded a group pre-tax profit of RM17.14 million.
	   Turnover was at RM250.98 million during the 16-month period
while for the 12-month period it was at RM292.27 million.
	   Promet's principal activities are steel fabrication, marine
engineering and construction, civil engineering and construction,
property investment and development, and development of
infrastructure projects.
	   In Promet's latest annual report, its auditor, Ernst &AMP; Young,
listed discrepancies in the group's accounts and lack of certain
information. It was unable to form an opinion as to whether the
accounts were properly drawn up in accordance with the Companies
Act 1965.
	   It was unable to give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the company and of the group as at April 30, 1997; of
the results of the company and of the group; and, of cash flows of
the group for the same period.
	   The auditor was also unable to say whether the accounting and
other records have been properly kept.
	   When asked about a request by the Securities Commission for
Promet to provide an explanation for the discrepancy in its
accounts, Mohamed said an explanation had been given.
	   ``We are not hiding anything but we don't want to tell
everything to the world. There are some things that should be kept
within certain circles,''
	   he said.
	   ``We have explained (to the shareholders) why it is reported
that way.
	   The impression (of the report) is vague but if you look from the
inside point of view, you will get a different meaning.''
	   However, he declined to disclose what was told to the
shareholders earlier, saying that they were happy with the board's
explanation.
	   As for the group's pre-tax loss amounting to RM169.69 million,
Mohamed asked: ``Which company isn't losing today?''

	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Youssef Chippo headed the ball into
his own goal one minute into injury time, tying the score at 1-1
between Morocco and Norway on Wednesday on the first day of the
World Cup.
	   Chippo's error came after goalkeeper Driss Benzekri collided
with Henning Berg as they leapt for Stig Inge Bjornebye's free kick
from the left of the box. The ball went off Bjornebye's shoulder
and straight to Chippo, who missed badly as he tried to clear the
ball wide and instead glanced the ball off in the inside of the
post.
	   In the first-ever meeting between the two countries, Morocco
took the lead in the 38th minute after a splendid move by Deportivo
La Coruna midfielder Moustafa El Hadji.
	   After taking a long pass from Tahar, Hadji sped down the left
side and spun defender Dan Eggen around before blasting home a
right-footed shot just inside the right post.

	   SIAM Commercial Bank's wholly-owned subsidiary SCB Real Estate
has taken over two plots of land from Sansiri Plc in an effort to
help its developer clients who cannot repay their loans.
	   Sansiri reported to the Stock Exchange of Thailand Tuesday that
its board of directors has approved the restructuring of Bt225.9
million it owes to Siam Commercial Bank.
	   In Sansiri's report, the two plots of land are in Soi Sala Daeng
and the Bangrak area and will be transferred to SCB Real Estate.
Along with the land, the Bt187 million worth of debts will also be
shifted from SCB to the bank's property subsidiary.
	   The takeover follows that of Somprasong's assets, after the
property developer failed to repay loans and interest. SCB recently
established SCB Real Estate Co Ltd to take over the assets, as a
means to reduce its bad debts and loan provisioning requirement.
	   SCB Real Estate is a 100 per cent-owned subsidiary which will
help it restructure and manage some of its loans to the property
sector. The company will take over the incomplete assets and
complete them. After the properties are on sale, the bank will give
the difference to the developer. If the sales raise less than the
amount required, the developer will pay the difference to the bank.
	   Sansiri said it will issue 2.9 million new shares at Bt10 apiece
and offer them to SCB via a private placement. The allocation of
the new capital shares is part of the company's financial
restructuring programme.
	   Analysts said land transfers are becoming an alternative for
property developers to restructure their debts.
	   Other than Sansiri, MK Real Estate Development Plc has also
restructured its debts by allowing its bondholders, who want
immediate redemptions, to exchange the bonds for company land.
	   Moreover, earlier this year, SCB agreed to absorb risks from its
debtors by taking over the incomplete projects of Somprasong Land
Plc.
	   In late March, SCB, a major creditor of Somprasong, entered into
an agreement with the property developer which states the bank will
take over three plots of Somprasong land. Under the agreement,
Pitcha Park project in Samphran district, Nakhon Pathom, will be
transferred to SCB Real Estate. Somprasong said it will also sell
the project's units and use the money to reduce its debt to SCB.
	   SCB is a major creditor of Somprasong which has been in severe
financial straits since early 1997 when it defaulted on bond
interest payments to both local and foreign investors worth over
US$80 million. Aside from the $80 million in convertible
debentures, the company's liabilities, which are not
collateralised, stood at Bt3.57 billion last April.
	   ''There will possibly be more property development companies to
follow the similar method in restructuring their debts because such
a method is well suited to the current economic situation in
negotiating with the creditors,'' an analyst of ABN AMRO Securities
(Asia) said.
	   However, such debt restructuring methods will need to be
accepted by both the creditors and debtors, he said.
	   ''For the large property development company that has many plots
of land for the creditors to pick, such a restructuring method will
possibly be successful. But for the small company, there are
several limitations,'' he said.
	   An investment banker in Bangkok said the trend of conversion of
debts to land will depend on the creditor side as well as the land
price evaluation method used.
	   An analyst of another brokerage house said if such a debt
restructuring method is successful, the debtor's liquidity position
would improve and the reserve burden on debts for financial
institutions would also be reduced.
	   Due to the huge loans to the property sector, SCB is now
struggling with rising non-performing loans (NPLs). Recently, the
bank announced it would raise its registered capital by Bt34.11
billion to Bt40 billion. The increase will mark the second time the
bank has raised its capital since the financial crisis erupted in
July.
	   In February, SBC Warburg Premiere Securities Co predicted the
bank's NPLs would peak at 34 per cent this year and that it would
need at least Bt200 billion in capital to deal with the problem.

	   THE Crabtree &AMP; Evelyn flagship store, which opened at the Suria
KLCC in Ampang last month, has a unique marketing feature that sets
its apart from its other stores in Asia - a sink in the middle of
the shop floor to facilitate product testing.
	   The sink is part of the activity counter located strategically
at the centre of the store.
	   Customers can indulge in the novelty of testing all products
including bath gels and massage oils, a tradition very much in
keeping with the company's philosophy.
	   ``We want people to try out our products, to see that they get
good value for their money. We have a large offering of products
and we want people to understand what we have to offer,'' sales and
marketing manager for Asia Pacific Frederic Puech told Business
Times.
	   ``We feel that it is good to put these products up on stage as
it enables a close inspection of the products,'' he said.
	   Customer service and shopping ease is not centred on product
sampling alone. Crabtree &AMP; Evelyn ensures that its staff are all
well-trained and are able to give their customers information and
assistance.
	   The flagship store at Suria KLCC is the second Crabtree &AMP; Evelyn
outlet to be opened in the country. The first opened for business
in December last year at Starhill centre at Jalan Bukit Bintang.
	   In all, said Puech, there are 62 stores in Asia and New Zealand.
	   Worldwide, it has more than 350 company-owned and licensed
stores.
	   Its target market is typically working women in their 20s and
30s who are into lifestyle products and home decoration, said Puech
adding that in Asia, the clientele is younger.
	   ``The product lines are less feminine and there are more unisex
lines,''
	   he said, adding that these make up 40 per cent of its products.
	   He said that the unisex lines also help to make male customers
feel more at ease in the store.
	   While he declined to talk of the investment in the country,
Puech said ``we are pleased with the business and remain confident
of the Malaysian market.''
	   Crabtree &AMP; Evelyn was founded in 1970 as a family-owned business
in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In mid-1996, it was purchased by Kuala
Lumpur Kepong Bhd, based in Ipoh.
	   Crabtree &AMP; Evelyn carries a range of food, fragrances,
toiletries and accessories. Its home fragrance products include
potpourris, candles, environmental oils and room sprays.
	   Its fine foods include teas, biscuits, preserves, marmalades and
condiments created from traditional recipes.
	   In conjunction with its opening at KLCC, during the months of
May and June, visitors to the store will be treated to food tasting
and aromatherapy hand massage.

	   RECENT reports suggesting the likely acquisition of certain
non-performing loans or projects by Pengurusan Danaharta Nasional
Bhd are inaccurate, said chief executive officer and managing
director Azman Yahya.
	   ``Danaharta has only begun preliminary work in reviewing the
non- performing loans situation in general and has yet to evaluate
any specific loan,'' he said. He said before any acquisition could
be made, a number of ``milestones'' have to be achieved including
the appointment of a chairman and board of Danaharta, as well as
changes to the legislative framework affected and determining the
company's funding.
	   ``When operational, Danaharta will typically negotiate to
purchase non- performing loans from financial institutions at a
market value, then seek to maximise recovery value via a work-out
or management of the underlying collateral,'' he added.

	   THE Government is no longer concerned about the fluctuation of
the ringgit against the US dollar because the country is more keen
to carry out barter trade, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir
Mohamad said.
	   ``What we want to do is to get away from the (fluctuation) in
the value of the ringgit and this can be done easily by conducting
trade on a counter-trade basis or through practical bartering,'' he
said.
	   ``We are not very concerned any more,'' he said when asked
whether the Government was concerned about the ringgit's further
decline against the US yesterday morning when the local unit went
below the RM4 mark to RM4.15 against the dollar at one stage.
	   Responding to questions after inspecting the Kuala Lumpur
International Airport in Sepang yesterday, Dr Mahathir said the
ringgit went down to RM4.80 at one time, then recovered before it
declined again.
	   ``This is a play thing which we have no control of,'' he said,
adding the Government would be working out how much the country was
exporting and how much it was importing in terms of goods.
	   ``The value of goods does not appreciate or depreciate whether
the ringgit changes in value.''
	   Citing an example, he said a computer costing US$700 and a tonne
of palm oil costing the same would not change in value even if the
ringgit went up or down.

	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Youssef Chippo headed the ball into
his own goal one minute into injury time, tying Morocco and Norway
1-1 at halftime on Wednesday on the first day of the World Cup.
	   Chippo's error came after goalkeeper Driss Benzekri collided
with Henning Berg as they leapt for Stig Inge Bjornebye's free kick
from the left of the box. The ball went off Bjornebye's shoulder
and straight to Chippo, who missed badly as he tried to clear the
ball wide and instead glanced the ball off in the inside of the
post.
	   In the first-ever meeting between the two countries, Morocco
took the lead in the 38th minute after a splendid move by Deportivo
La Coruna midfielder Moustafa El Hadji.
	   After taking a long pass from Tahar, Hadji sped down the left
side and spun defender Dan Eggen around before blasting home a
right-footed shot just inside the right post.

	   ONLY well-established companies offering Vsat services are
expected to survive the economic crisis while newcomers will find
it harder to compete and stay afloat, a Samart Telcom Plc (Samtel)
senior executive says.
	   Before the economic crisis, there were six firms providing the
satellite-based communication services. One has already closed down
earlier this year. Of the rest, three are veteran providers.
	   Col Ruangsub Kovindha, president of Samtel, said the current
situation has forced several companies to halt investment and
expansion while strivng to keep up with the competition.
	   Two veteran operators, Samtel and Jasmine International's Acumen
Co, have enjoyed a fixed revenue stream after it won a
controversial bid from the Telephone Organisation of Thailand to
install Vsat equipment.
	   The project is to increase the number of rural telephone
terminals across the nation.
	   Since the middle of last year, Samtel has earned about Bt40-50
million a month, Ruangsab said.
	   Another veteran Vsat operator, Compunet Co, a joint-venture of
Cable &AMP; Wireless and Thai individual shareholders, is pondering
whether it should rewrite its concession with the Post and
Telegraph Department.
	   Compunet earlier won the department's approval to introduce
voice and image communication services, enabling it to create a new
concession with the department, though it has to pay the department
a higher royalty fee.
	   However, the current economic recession has discouraged business
expansion and the department was informed to wait for a board of
directors meeting of Cable &AMP; Wireless. PTD's director-general
Sethaporn Cusripituck said Tuesday that he has yet to receive a
response.
	   ''Compunet has yet to inform us. However, we believe that Cable
&AMP; Wireless remains interested in business expansion,'' Sethaporn
said.
	   After the closure of U-Sat, a new Vsat operator earlier this
year, the other two newcomers, Siam Sat and World Sat, were said to
be in financial difficulties. Siam Sat has served Siam Commercial
Bank which helped set up the company while World Sat is backed by
Thai Farmers Bank and Bank of Ayudhaya. Compunet is partly held by
the executives of Bangkok Bank.
	   However, commercial banks are currently more cautious with
non-performing businesses and question remains over whether they
would continue to support the Vsat businesses.
	   Ruangsub said the Vsat market is radically changing due to the
financial crisis, forcing operators like Samart to seek more
customers in the non-finance and non-banking sectors which used to
be the mainstream customer base.

	   ELLAMAH Kuppan is a kindergarten teacher. But there are no
preschoolers in her kindergarten.
	   ``My students are teenagers but they are still learning
kindergarten lessons,'' she said.
	   Ellamah, 48, teaches the mentally and physically challenged at
the Selangor and Federal Territory Spastic Centre in Jalan Utara,
Petaling Jaya.
	   Apart from the basics of reading, she also teaches them art and
craft and holds story-telling sessions.
	   Ellamah has not always been a kindergarten teacher. She worked
as a physio-aid at the centre for 14 years but left the job when
she got married and went to Kelantan.
	   She then returned to the Federal capital and began her career as
a kindergarten teacher in Port Klang before coming back to the
spastic centre. She knows many of the teenagers from her previous
stint as a physio-aid.
	   M. Latah Devi is another teacher who is employed at a
kindergarten set up by United Plantation Berhad in Ulu Basir, Lower
Perak.
	   The kindergarten provided by the oil palm estate, Latah said,
was very good and well-equipped.
	   ``The children get a good meal which includes oats, eggs and a
multi- vitamin drink during the break,'' she said.
	   Latah and Ellamah were among 22 kindergarten teachers who
completed a certificate course at Universiti Putra Malaysia
recently.
	   UPM regularly conducts kindergarten courses during the school
holidays but it was the first time they held one specially for
members of the Educational, Welfare and Research Foundation
Malaysia (EWRF).
	   These EWRF teachers teach in kindergartens in plantations and
urban squatter areas.
	   EWRF honorary general-secretary Sumangala Pillai said the course
would not only help them to serve the children of the community
better but also provide for their own career advancement.
	   EWRF is a voluntary, non-political service-oriented organisation
whose objective is to improve the educational, social and economic
welfare of needy Malaysians.
	   ``I have been teaching for the past seven years and have also
attended earlier courses organised by EWRF,'' said Latah.
	   ``The course at UPM will help me to improve the way I teach.''
	   The course was structured in two parts, with 10 days for each
module.
	   The emphasis was on hands-on experience.
	   ``We stressed the need for a balanced education for the
children,'' said Dr Rohani Abdullah, a lecturer with the child
development research centre at UPM.
	   The training programme covered topics such as musical and
creative movements, multi-media and interactive techniques, and the
nutrition needs of young children.
	   ``There was a special lesson meant for teachers handling
disabled children which I found very helpful,'' said Ellamah.
	   ``There were a lot of practical activities. In one of these, we
role- played the children to enable us to think like them and to
see their needs.''
	   According to Sumangala, these kindergarten teachers earn between
RM250 and RM350 a month. Yet they were willing to pay the RM1,000
fee for the course.
	   Latah, Ellamah and their friends would have had to pay a lot
more if not for the New Zealand High Commission and EWRF.
	   The total cost of the package charged by UPM was in the region
of RM50,000. The New Zealand High Commission contributed a grant of
RM12,000.
	   The fees collected from the participants came up to about
RM20,000. The EWRF paid the rest.
	   ``EWRF helped to subsidise the course as the salary the
kindergarten teachers earn would have made it difficult for them to
pay the fee,'' said Sumungala.
	   As to be expected, the teachers were grateful to the New Zealand
High Commission and EWRF for the financial assistance.
	   What motivated the kindergarten teachers was not only the chance
to learn new teaching techniques from a recognised and established
tertiary institution like UPM but also the prospect of enhancing
their own professional and career development.
	   ``We also hope we would be allowed to enrol for the child
development diploma programme which UPM plans to introduce,'' said
Ellamah.
	   According to Dr Halimah Ahmad, dean of the faculty of human
ecology at UPM, kindergarten teachers would find the diploma
programme useful as kindergarten management will be part of the
course.
	   ``After completing the diploma course, they would have the
chance to branch into other areas such as child psychology at
degree level,'' she said.
	   UPM hopes to start the course by May next year once the Ministry
gives the approval.
	   ``At this juncture, the proposal to introduce a diploma course
on child development has been evaluated and we hope to present it
to the Senate soon. After that, we will have to get the Education
Ministry's approval.''
	   So for the moment, the diploma course remains a distant but
enticing dream for Ellamah, Latah and other kindergarten teachers.

	   SOME small and medium-sized entrepreneurs (SMEs) are still
unaware of the funds and venture capitals granted by the Government
for them to involve themselves in the Multimedia Super Corridor
(MSC) project eventhough they are qualified for such facilities.
	   Entrepreneur Development Minister Datuk Mustapa Mohamed said
there is a great deal of ignorance and a lack of initiative among
these SMEs as to what is available and how to gain access for the
grants and venture capitals.
	   ``These are very basic information ... Without adequate funding
or access to the venture capitals, it is very difficult for SMEs to
move ahead in the area,'' he said in Kuala Lumpur when opening the
MSC Nationwide Conference 1998.
	   Mustapa said in the current economic situation, many
entrepreneurs complained against banks and financial institutions
for being very selective in approving loan applications.
	   ``Therefore, they (SMEs) need to find other alternatives,'' he
said, adding that he hoped to see more entrepreneurs take advantage
of the opportunities created by MSC.
	   ``MSC has given out some funds to support the growth of SMEs in
the multimedia industry. There are various opportunities provided
by the MSC which are outside the banking system,'' he said.
	   Mustapa said he would like to see that all the funding
opportunities are properly disseminated to those interested and
hoped that the Multimedia Development Corporation (MDC) will double
its effort in promoting these funds.
	   All this while, there is a misconception that MSC caters only
for the ``big boys'' - multinational companies and foreign
companies - that have joint-ventures with local companies.
	   ``With the notion dispelled, I hope it is now firmly established
among the SMEs that the MSC, in actual fact, is also meant for
small and medium- sized enterprises,'' he said.
	   Later in a press conference, MDC executive chairman Tan Sri Dr
Othman Yeop Abdullah said MDC has received about five applications
for the Multimedia Super Corridor Research and Development Grant
Scheme (MGS), which is directly administered by the company.
	   The MGS has allocated an initial sum of RM100 million under the
Seventh Malaysia Plan.
	   Other funds available to SMEs are the Fund for Small and
Medium-sized Industries (RM1 billion), Technology Acquisition Fund,
Commercialisation of Research and Development Fund, Industrial
Linkage Programme, Industrial Technical Assistance Fund (RM50
million), Mechanisation and Automation Scheme for SMEs, Soft Loan
Scheme for Quality Enhancement of SMEs, Technology Development
Programme, Skill Development Programme, Export Development
Programme, Infrastructure Development Programme and Financial
Packages for SMEs.
	   ``By the year 2000, we hope to spawn about 20 companies which
have been granted with MSC status, to become world class
companies,'' he said, adding that currently MDC has 40 companies in
the list.
	   Out of 218 applications so far, 142 companies have been granted
with the MSC status.

	   AN increase in the ceiling for foreign ownership in local
stockbroking companies to 70 per cent from 49 per cent now can help
local brokerages spring into the international arena and become
more efficient, analysts said.
	   They said while joint ventures between local stockbroking
companies (SBCs) and foreign companies thus far focused on
research, allowing foreign parties to get into the driver's seat of
the SBCs will see them taking an active role in the operational
aspect of the brokerages.
	   ``They will bring in foreign expertise and, to be honest, there
is room for improvement in the operations of local SBCs,'' one
analyst said.
	   He said while there are already SBCs that have alliances with
foreign companies, these are mostly to provide research on
Malaysian equities to the foreign partner and do not entail
complete technology transfer.
	   Securities Commission (SC) chairman Datuk Dr Mohd Munir Majid
said on Monday the SC has proposed a higher ceiling for foreign
ownership of local stockbroking firms, but the decision rests with
the Government.
	   Initially, foreign corporate ownership in local SBCs was limited
to not more than 30 per cent. In 1988 the cap was increased to 49
per cent.
	   Another analyst said what the authorities hope to see is capital
injection into the SBCs, which need fresh capital given the slide
in the local bourse and exacerbated by the tight liquidity
situation.
	   ``With foreign participation, the stockbroking industry will be
moved to another level of competitiveness. The foreign partners
will have their own captive clients so it will be more competitive
for local SBCs to get foreign clients,'' he added.
	   The analyst said the fact that foreign investors will be taking
up to 70 per cent equity in local SBCs indicates that they see the
current downturn as temporary until the local bourse springs up
again.
	   Another analyst also welcomed the proposal, and said he expects
keen interest as foreign investors have been waiting for a long
time to participate in the local stockbroking industry.
	   However, he questioned why it was not proposed or implemented
sooner, before share prices fell further on the local bourse. ``Now
we have no other choice but to accept foreign participation.''
	   He said the 70 per cent ceiling, while substantial, should not
be reduced as any further revisions will cause a loss of
confidence.
	   Similarly, additional regulations or restrictions need not be
imposed as foreign investors who take up the offer will be looking
to invest for the long-term.
	   ``We have enough regulations. What is more important is
enforcement. I think if we had provided better enforcement we would
not be in the present situation,'' he added.
	   The analyst said there is no need to make adjustments to
stockbroking regulations merely to please the foreign partners.
``If they want to come in, they must follow our rules.''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - An employee of Malayan Banking Berhad told
the magistrate's court today that the bank's former audit division
general manager Ahmad Fisal Abdul Rahman embraced her and
``brushed'' her right breast with his hand.
	   The 48-year-old woman said she struggled to free herself from
his embrace, and after managing to do so, she ran but fell and hurt
her nose and upper lip.
	   She was testifying at the trial of Ahmad Fisal, who is charged
with outraging her modesty by hugging her and touching her breast
in his former office on the 47th floor of Menara Maybank, Jalan Tun
Perak, about 8.55am on Aug 4 last year.
	   Ahmad Fisal, 51, is now Mayban Securities Sdn Bhd credit control
and business development division general manager.
	   Replying to a question from Deputy Public Prosecutor Fatnin
Yusof, the woman said when she fell and hurt herself Ahmad Fisal
came to her aid. She said he apologised but she scolded him by
saying: ``I told you not to play the fool''.
	   The woman said she related the incident to her husband who told
her to lodge a police report.
	   She said she told her husband that she would report the incident
to the bank's management for the matter to be investigated
internally as she had served the bank for 28 years.
	   She said subsequently the bank's industrial relations division
took statements from her and also promised to let her know the
outcome of their investigations.
	   However, she said, she lodged a police report as the bank's
management was taking far too long to investigate.
	   After lodging the report, she said, she decided to let the law
take its course.
	   Hearing before magistrate Ahmad Zaidi Zainal continues.

	   RECOMMENDATIONS formulated at the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (Apec) Customs-Industry Dialogue (Acid '98) will be
translated into appropriate action, said Deputy Finance Minister
Datuk Wong See Wah yesterday.
	   This will take the form of disseminating inputs, views,
proposals and recommendations to both government and the business
sector.
	   ``They (the recommendations) will provide the Apec business
community with guidelines for Customs administration,'' he said at
the end of the two-day dialogue in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Wong said the resolutions and recommendations outlined at the
dialogue will be taken up at the Sub-Committee on Customs
Procedures (SCCP) meeting in Kuching this September.
	   Custom laws, regulations, administrative guidelines and
procedures should be available to the public promptly and easily,
he said.
	   The Apec forum, which will see the admisssion of three new
members this year, will work closely on enhancing cooperation in
addressing issues such as trade barriers affecting the business
sector.
	   Wong said the dialogue will also help to ensure openness and
transparency in trade dealings and make the Customs and the
business sector more accountable.
	   The inclusion of Peru, Russia and Vietnam in Apec will bring the
total number of members to 21.
	   The dialogue was jointly organised by the Royal Customs and
Excise Department Malaysia and the National Chamber of Commerce and
Industry of Malaysia.

	   THE Thai government should fully guarantee risks incurred from
loans of state-run specialised financial institutions as a way of
increasing the money supply in the system.
	   A report released by Thai Farmers Research Centre (TFRC) said so
far the market has failed to work in an orderly manner due to the
liquidity crunch. New money should be injected into the system
through nationalised financial institutions such as the Export and
Import Bank of Thailand, Government Housing Bank and Government
Savings Bank.
	   Although such guarantees may increase the financial burden on
the national budget, the government should take this alternative
into serious consideration. If the liquidity crunch and high
interest rates continue, local companies are expected to fail due
to a lack of cash to run their businesses.
	   However, what the report suggested is quite different from what
the government intends to do as the exchange rates as well as price
stability are the top priorities for mending the economy.
	   The finance authorities, including Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanahaeminda and central bank governor MR Chatu Mongol Sonakul,
have ruled out increasing the money supply to allow interest rate
cuts in spite of the ongoing liquidity shortage.
	   They reasoned that such an increase will cause inflationary
pressure and further weaken the baht against the US dollar.
Moreover, foreign loans are expected to rise sharply in response to
the baht depreciation.
	   The TFRC made the suggestion because commercial banks are
reluctant to provide loans to the real sector, given that risks are
relatively high and their asset qualities may deteriorate further
due to the country's slumping economy.
	   The report said the Thai government should not have trouble with
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) if it decides to proceed with
increasing the money supply.
	   ''In the letters of intent submitted to the IMF, if necessary
the Thai government is given flexibility in managing the monetary
policy, including net domestic assets, net foreign assets and the
monetary base,'' it added.
	   Nevertheless, the TFRC urged the government to take caution if
it decides to increase the money supply in return for interest rate
reductions. The negative affects of such a move include an expected
depreciation of the baht against the greenback which would lead to
inflationary pressure, a rising foreign debt burden and foreign
capital outflows.
	   The report noted the baht should not weaken below 45 to the US
dollar, a level which would help reduce illiquidity and would not
harm the country as a whole.
	   If the government cannot maintain the baht at 45 to the
greenback, it would be forced to reintroduce a high interest rates
policy in defence of the baht, the report said.
	   ''Such a policy is likely as that will stop capital outflows as
well as reduce inflationary worries,'' the report added.
	   Under the current economic circumstances, the TFRC said the
government should adopt a prudent management policy which is in
line with the IMF's tough economic bail-out programme.
	   ''This will absolutely help boost investor confidence,'' it
said.

Arafat, Jordanian prime minister discuss Mideast peace process
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
met with Jordan's prime minister Wednesday to discuss the stalled
Mideast peace process and prospects for an Arab summit on the
issue.
	   Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have been frozen
for over 15 months and Jordan, who has ties to both peoples, has
often tried to help the sides.
	   ``We have very strong relations with Jordan. I had a very
important talk with the prime minister and we discussed ... the
problems facing the peace process,'' Arafat told reporters after
the meeting at his Gaza headquarters.
	   Palestinians have been trying to drum up an Arab summit to serve
as a forum to voice dissatsifaction with Israel over its hadnlign
of the peace process. Arafat said that efforts to such a summit,
hampered by conflicting interests between several countries, were
still underway. ``We are trying to do our best with all the Arab
leaders and we are going to continue this,'' Arafat said.
	   Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Salam Majali said that Jordan
would not break ties with Israel, which it signed a peace treaty
with in 1994 but said that ``if the time came when we could show
that cutting ties would benefit the Arab world, we would do so.''
He did not elaborate.
	   Arafat also criticized a decision Tuesday by Israel to build
more houses for Jews in east Jerusalem, which Israel captured from
Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war and the Paleastinians want as a
capital for a future state.
	   ``It's a clear violation to what had been agreed upon, not one
single house (was) to be added to any of settlement,'' he said.

	   RATING Agency Malaysia Bhd (RAM) has downgraded the long-term
rating of Taiping Consolidated Bhd's RM138.33 million mortgage bond
issue to B3 from BBB3(s). The rating reflects the company's tight
cashflow position and the uncertainties in its ability to unlock
its asset base in time to redeem the bonds. Furthermore, RAM said,
the suffix (s) was applied in the previous rating as the bond issue
is structured with a first legal charge against the Lot 10 Shopping
Centre which due to the prevailing economic downturn the prospects
of realising its value or raising funds against the building is
seen to be poor. RAM also said Taiping Consolidated is highly
geared with significant amounts of debt taken up to finance its
projects and with the exception of the bond issue, all other debts
are sensitive to the present high interest scenario.

	   SEPANG, Mon. - Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad
said today the Kuala Lumpur International Airport would be
officially opened as scheduled on June 27 and critics who said it
was too costly have been proven wrong.
	   Speaking after a three-hour visit to KLIA, Dr Mahathir said the
airport was built within a record time of four years at a cost of
only RM9 billion.
	   ``Other airports which are much smaller cost more than US$9
billion (RM36 billion).''
	   He also congratulated the Kuala Lumpur International Airport
Bhd, the developer of the airport.
	   ``When we wanted to build the airport, many said it would be too
costly.
	   But if we did not go ahead and were forced to do it later or
even now, we would not be able to build it at RM9 billion.
	   ``We made the decision to build the airport at the right time.
At the time the ringgit was strong, RM9 billion was only about US$4
billion then.
	   ``But now the RM9 billion is worth only some US$2 billion,'' Dr
Mahathir said, adding that even the Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah
International Airport in Subang cost more than RM20 billion.
	   Asked whether the low cost has affected the construction
quality, Dr Mahathir said: ``There is no compromise on quality. You
can see for yourself that the quality is very good, the finishing
is very good, the construction work is good, and the designs are
very innovative and the furniture is of very good quality.
Practically everything is made locally and of high quality.''
	   Dr Mahathir said KLIAB deserved praise as it required
considerable management skills to handle 25,000 workers and to
integrate 300 contracts.
	   ``It has shown good progress, its construction is of high
quality and indeed its Total Airport Management System appears to
be without hitches,''
	   he said.
	   Dr Mahathir said when he privately toured the KLIA several weeks
ago, he was quite apprehensive whether it could be completed on
schedule.
	   ``But after today's inspection, I am very happy with the
progress and the quality of the construction.''
	   To a question on whether the second phase of the project would
be delayed due to the current economic problems, Dr Mahathir said
even if there was a delay, it would not be for long.
	   Dr Mahathir said it would be pointless to build another terminal
if the number of users was small.
	   According to plans, the second phase of the development
envisages facilities which will increase the airport's capacity to
accommodate 35 million passengers by 2008 while the third phase
will cater for 45 million passengers by 2012.
	   The first phase can accommodate 25 million passengers.
	   Located about 50 kilometres from Kuala Lumpur, the
state-of-the-art airport is a four-phased project designed to cater
for the passenger and air cargo demands of Malaysia's major
international gateway for the next century.
	   On complaints that the signages are too small and unreadable, Dr
Mahathir said they would be remedied, if there was a need to do so.
	   The Yang di-Pertuan Agong Tuanku Ja'afar is scheduled to open
the KLIA on June 27. It would be fully operational three days
later.

	   THE Public Services Department (PSD) is currently receiving
about RM1 million a month in repayments from former study-loan
borrowers compared with just RM100,000 before 1997.
	   Its deputy director-general Datuk Khalil Hussain said the
increase in the sum collected is due to the aggressive action taken
by the department.
	   ``The department sends about four to five reminders to former
borrowers.
	   Only when they don't take heed of the reminders do we bring the
matter up to the Attorney-General's Chamber,'' Khalil said.
	   He clarified that it was not up to the PSD to take former
borrowers to court but the Attorney-General's Chamber as the PSD
can only take administrative action whereas legal action will be
taken by the Chamber.
	   It was reported on Monday that the PSD has started bankruptcy
proceedings against 89 former government scholars who have not
repaid their loans or have defaulted on their contracts despite
repeated warnings.
	   Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Datuk Fauzi
Abdul Rahman on Monday said they were among 1,500 sponsored
students who had failed to respond despite being warned repeatedly
over the last 10 years.
	   ``The PSD is allocated some RM500 million for loans and
scholarships a year,'' Khalil said.
	   He added that the department is in the process of finalising the
number of loans and scholarships for this year's local university
students.
	   Traditionally, about 18,000 students a year benefit from PSD
loans and scholarships.
	   Khalil also said that this year's application deadline has been
extended from May 30 to June 16 because the students have started
their studies at the universities later.
	   It has also been reported that the PSD is expected to spend
about RM300 million on sponsoring students at local universities.
	   The department received some 60,000 applications last year and
about the same number this year.
	   Meanwhile, when asked about government servants who have applied
for optional retirement, Khalil said the economic downturn has not
directly affected the number of those applying.
	   However, he said that the Government stands by its decision to
pay an initial 10 per cent gratuity to civil servants who have
opted for optional retirement, and the balance only after the
country's economy has recovered.
	   It was reported the Government made the decision to pay a small
amount of the gratuity based on the consideration that those opting
for early retirement will have immediate need of money.
	   This is a revision of the Government's earlier decision that it
was only prepared to pay gratuity for optional retirees once they
have reached the age of 55.
	   Civil servants can exercise optional retirement at the age of
40, upon which they will receive a gratuity. Each civil servant
receives between RM20,000 and RM100,000 in gratuity depending on
the length and category of service.
	   The gratuity payment for optional retirees is said to cost the
Government some RM100 million annually.
	   The PSD receives between 2,000 and 3,000 applications for
optional retirement every year.
	   Statistics show the Government spends more than RM300 million in
gratuity payments annually and about RM2 billion in pensions. There
are currently more than 300,000 retired civil servants and 897,000
in service.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - Former Deputy Prime Minister Tan Sri Musa
Hitam today proposed several measures that could be implemented by
the Government to help the economy recover.
	   They included formulating a comprehensive and co-ordinated
package of action programmes; being credible, transparent and
accountable in its moves; and not being involved in bailouts.
	   Speaking at a function organised by the Institution Of Engineers
at Hyatt Regency in Johor Baru today, Musa said: ``Firstly, we have
to offer a much more comprehensive and co-ordinated package of
action programmes for recovery.
	   ``Not in bits and pieces. Not giving different and conflicting
signals.''
	   Secondly, he said, the Government's credibility should always be
evident in its actions.
	   ``If we say that we practise accountability and transparency, we
should not be seen to deny accountability or accept wrongdoing.
	   ``We should not be seen to refuse to divulge the names of those
responsible for huge borrowings, resulting in huge losses
especially if the financial institution is a public one.''

	   AMANAH Capital Malaysia Bhd, through a corporate exercise aimed
at consolidating and rationalising its business activities, is set
to emerge as an integrated investment banking group. In a
statement, Amanah Capital, formerly known as Kompleks Kewangan
Malaysia Bhd, said the move will enhance its presence in the
industry and prepare the group for the liberalisation of the
financial sector. The restructuring exercise will be headed by
Encik Mohd Hata Robani, the acting group chief executive officer in
place of Encik Azman Yahya, who is now heading Malaysia's newly
set-up asset management company, Pengurusan Danaharta Nasional Bhd.
The restructuring, which is pending approvals from the authorities,
involves the transfer of the group's financial services companies
to its listed arm, Amanah Capital Partners Bhd (formerly known as
South East Asia Development Corp Bhd). Upon completion, six core
operational divisions under Amanah Capital Partners will be
created. They are merchant banking, asset management, capital
market and securities, insurance, retail financial and property.
Amanah Capital will remain the group holding company with its
principal investment being the 68.1 per cent equity interest in the
enlarged listed Amanah Capital Partners.

	   SOLE opposition State Assembly representative Chong Eng
(DAP-Batu Lanchang) was yesterday told not to ``fish in troubled
waters'' by raising the issue of the recent demolition of small
Hindu temples and shrines, including by the district offices.
	   State Health Committee chairman and Penang MIC chief Dr.K.
Rajapathy (BN-Prai) told Chong Eng she should not harp on it as it
could be counter productive to State Government's efforts to
enhance racial and religious harmony.
	   Replying to points raised during the motion of thanks to the
Yang diPertua Negeri Dr Rajapathy assured the House that the State
Government would implement a comprehensive plan to tackle
socio-economic problems of the Indian community.
	   ``While I appreciate the Batu Lanchang State Assemblywoman's
move to highlight the problems of Indians in the State, I disagree
that the State Government has done nothing concrete for them,'' he
said.
	   On Thursday and this morning, Chong Eng had questioned the State
Government's ``incompetency'' in resolving ``Indian problems'', in
preventing the Kampung Rawa communal skirmishes in March and the
recent demolition of, and notices to demolish issued against, Hindu
temples and shrines in the State by district offices.
	   On the question of malnutrition faced by Indian children in
estates raised by Tan Cheng Liang (BN-Jawi), Dr Rajapathy said his
committee had carried out various projects to provide nourishing
food to children and pregnant mothers.
	   To a question by Tan why the Sungai Bakap hospital took 10 days
to inform the family of the death of an accident victim recently,
Dr Rajapathy assured he would inform the House after investigation.

	   CEUTA, Spain (AP) _ The record for the fastest Atlantic crossing
by a commercial passenger vessel has been broken by an
Australian-built ferry, the company said Wednesday
	   The 91-meter (300-foot) Catalonia arrived in the Spanish enclave
city of Ceuta in north Africa around 10:00 p.m (2000 GMT) Tuesday,
clocking an average speed of 40 knots during a 67.5-hour
cross-Atlantic sprint that began in New York at 0035 GMT Sunday,
said Ivonne Sentis, spokeswoman for Buquebus, the
Argentine-Uruguayan company that owns the ferry.
	   Hoverspeed Great Britain set the previous record with an average
speed of 36.65 knots in 1990. Both ships were built by Incat
Australia.
	   Winning the record carries with it the Hales Trophy, donated by
British Member of Parliament Harold Hales in 1933. The trophy was
first held by the Italian Liner Rez, which set the record of 29
knots in the same year.
	   The ferry, with room for 900 passengers and 240 cars, will work
the three-hour route between Barcelona and the Mediterranean resort
island of Mallorca starting June 15.

	   THE Agriculture Ministry will investigate the cause of the
increase in rice prices if the indices indicate profiteering in the
industry.
	   Its minister, Datuk Amar Dr Sulaiman Daud said the ministry will
act after it receives reports on the matter from its Padi and Rice
Price Control and Monitoring Division and Padiberas Nasional Bhd
(Bernas).
	   ``When Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim announced
the price increase for padi last December, he specifically stated
that it would not increase the retail price of rice,'' he told
reporters after receiving a courtesy call from the Myanmar trade
delegation at his ministry yesterday.
	   If profiteering does exist, he said, the investigation will
cover all related parties including millers, wholesalers and
retailers.
	   He said the ministry has no plan to include Super grade rice as
a controlled item as this will affect the whole industry.
	   Currently, both retail prices for Premium and Standard grades of
rice are controlled by the Government. The price of Super grade
rice is not controlled but the Government has the right to fix its
grade specification.
	   Dr Sulaiman was earlier asked to comment on allegations by the
Federation of the Malaysia Consumer Associations (Fomca) that the
retail price of rice has increased due to Bernas selling imported
rice to its two subsidiaries, which in turn sells to consumers at a
higher price.
	   ``Bernas is not the only importer of rice in the country. Did
they check whether high prices are quoted at Bernas' outlets?'' he
said.
	   Asked whether Bernas should sell its rice directly to the
consumers, Dr Sulaiman said although the ministry encourages such
activity he doubts whether direct-selling is practical for Bernas.
He said Bernas has its own business plan and it will be quite
difficult to change the existing structure.
	   On the Myanmar trade delegation's visit, he said the discussions
involved several agricultural matters including joint efforts for
livestock and fisheries projects as the country hopes to increase
trade with Malaysia.
	   Representatives from the Myanmar trade delegation included the
country's Commerce Minister Major General Kyaw Than, Deputy
Agriculture and Irrigation Minister Brigadier General Khin Maung
and Deputy Livestock Breeding and Fisheries Minister U Aung Thein.
	   Dr Sulaiman, who visited Myanmar on April, said he had asked the
country to source rice for Malaysia.
	   Besides Myanmar, he said, Bernas has also been asked to look for
sources besides its suppliers like Thailand, Vietnam and Pakistan.

	   CLEANLINESS is next to godliness. It is an axiom on good habits
first learnt and acquired at home. Parents teach the importance of
personal hygiene and keeping the home and the surroundings clean.
Later, these lessons are reinforced in school where pupils are
rostered to maintain the cleanliness of the classroom and the
corridors. These habits acquired early in life remain with us as we
move on to adulthood and establish homes for our families. We
ensure our living, eating, sleeping and bathing environments are
clean. We are particular in packing and disposing of household
waste.
	   But once we leave home, we appear to leave this virtue at the
front door or gate. In public, we evince the attitude that
cleanliness is the responsibility of others. Forgetting, worse
still disregarding, civic duties we dispose of drink cans, food
wrappings and containers any which way we please. The collective
consequence is litter everywhere. Add to this phenomenon, rubbish
that is discarded with little or no thought, and we have dirty
towns and cities. Repeated exhortations in the past, from the Prime
Minister down to other elected and appointed officials, have
prompted little or no response from the public to show more civic
responsibility. Litter and rubbish remain eye-sores, blemishes on
the image of the country. Even frequent complaints on this
unflattering facet of Malaysian life from otherwise impressed
tourists in letters to newspapers have done little to change this
common indifference to the cleanliness of streets and public
places.
	   Our indifference quotient will, however, be taxed soon. In two
months' time, one of the biggest sporting events in the
international calendar will be coming to town, to the capital city.
	   The 16th Commonwealth Games will bring more than 6,000 athletes
and officials as well as scores of thousands of foreign visitors.
Thus, not only the sporting facilities and the organisation of the
Games but also the capital city itself will come under the scrutiny
of foreign eyes before, during and after the Games.
	   Surely we, who have had our temparatures rising in the past over
reports by foreign scribes who associated Malaysia with the
Himalayas and, worse, that we still live up high in the trees,
would not like these thousands of guests returning home with the
image that Kuala Lumpur is a dirty city and by extension, its
inhabitants, unhygienic. They might even circulate exaggerated
reports that we live amid stinking sewers.
	   Clearly, if we do not desire such an eventuality, we should shed
our indifference to the cleanliness of the city. And as Datuk
Bandar Tan Sri Kamaruzzaman Shariff said on Sunday, keeping the
streets, parks and backlanes clean is not the sole responsibility
of City Hall and Alam Flora, ``residents have to a part to play''.
	   Thus, the public should stop littering. To root out this bad
habit, City Hall should impose the maximum fine of RM500, not just
the current RM300, on all who are caught. This should put the fear
of God into those inclined to throw cigarette stubs, drink cans and
food containers anywhere they choose. The authorities should be
serious about hauling polluters of drains and rivers to court. Only
then would the ``Care For Your Rivers and Drains'' campaign, which
City Hall will launch soon, would have any significance. Otherwise,
it might end the way of many past campaigns - much song and dance,
but no action.

	   MALAYSIA International Shipping Corporation Bhd (MISC), a
Petronas-owned company, has taken delivery of two more vessels from
South Korean shipbuilders, bringing the number of ships built by
South Korean companies for MISC to 25.
	   MISC had to date awarded 39 shipbuilding contracts to South
Korean shipbuilders with total contract value of US$1.385 billion
(US$1  &QC;  RM3.94), Petronas said in a statement released in Kuala
Lumpur yesterday.
	   The delivery of the two container vessels, Bunga Raya Satu and
Bunga Teratai Dua, has increased MISC's fleet to 74 vessels with a
total tonnage of 2.76 million deadweight tonnes (dwt). Its fleet
comprises 26 container vessels, 18 bulk carriers, 13 chemical and
parcel tankers, 10 crude oil and product tankers, five Liquefied
Natural Gas tankers and two passenger ferries.
	   Bunga Raya Satu is a 2,700 TEU container carrier built by
Hyundai Heavy Industries Co Ltd. Since 1990, MISC has awarded 28
newbuilding contracts to Hyundai, of which 18 had been delivered
(including Bunga Raya Satu).
	   The remaining will be delivered in stages until the year 2000.
	   Bunga Teratai Dua is a 1,200-TEU container carrier built by
Daewoo Heavy Industries Ltd. It is the second of four container
vessels to be built by Daewoo for MISC, with the remaining two
scheduled for delivery in July and October this year.
	   Petronas said in addition to Hyundai and Daewoo, MISC had
awarded shipbuilding contracts to three other South Korean
shipbuilders namely Korea Shipbuilding and Engineering Corp (four
vessels), Hanjin Heavy Industries (two vessels) and Cheung Ku
Marine Industrial Co Ltd (one vessel).
	   MISC is due to take delivery another 17 newbuildings up to the
year 2000.

	   IF last week's efferverscence over the recent French Open in
France and in Europe, Roland Garros - kept most people either
riveted to their TV sets or listening to reports on the champions'
ups and downs, this will soon be swept away by the World Cup
Football tournament scheduled to start tomorrow and end on July 12.
	   At Roland Garros, foreign broadcasters were asked to refer to
the French Open in memory of World War 1 aviator who died shortly
before the armistice, and who, incidentally, preferred rugby to
tennis.
	   This year was marked by the women's game, especially top heavy
talents, such as Anna Kournikova, Venus Williams, Martina Hingis,
but most stunning was Monica Seles's return to Paris where she won
her first Grand Slam title at the age of 16. She defeated the
Hingis who had won the last three Grand Slam singles titles.
	   An English daily commenting on Grand Slam events said: ``If
Wimbledon is a tennis garden-party, the French Open is a far
grander gastronomic experience. While Wimbledon offers a nod to the
proletariat in the form of first come, first served `people's
Sundays', the crowds that pack Paris Roland Garros for the French
Open are there as much for the sophisticated atmosphere and food as
for the clay tennis court.''
	   France, Paris in particular, are awash with preparations of all
sorts for the World Cup Football kick-off tomorrow. France has been
granted the privilege of hosting the event, one of the last grand
international celebrations of the 20th century.
	   The French Organising Committee, chaired by Michel Platini
Fernand Sastre and Jean Tiberi Mayor of Paris, will stage a major
kick-off event 24 hours before the official start of the
tournament, heralding 33 days packed with matches and celebrations
to get the adrenalin going.
	   ``La fete du football'' spectacle will be truly impressive, as
grand as the gods of the football field says the programme.
	   It will incorporate the streets and historic monuments of Paris
which will be broadcast live via satellite to 800 million
television viewers.
	   If Paris is the centre of tournament, nine other cities will
participate in this sports festivity: Saint-Denis, Lens,
Saint-Etienne, Bordeaux, Tourlouse, Montpellier, Lyon, Nantes and
Marseille.
	   Needless to say, these cities have done their utmost to attract,
their foreign guests, by bringing forth their regional varieties of
food, wines, and cultural heritage.
	   To sum it up, a magazine reported: ``Paris `Foot folly', nine
French cities rejoicing''. Dream or nightmare is more or less what
the organisers have in mind.
	   Security problems are immense when you host the world event, the
Olympic Games is a good example, but the particularity of this
event is the very nature of the game that inflames the minds, the
passion, the chauvinist instincts that so often border on frenzy.
	   Fans numbering close to a million will be watching football
players representing 32 countries, among them, no doubt, will be a
few hooligans, that should not be difficult to subdue. Far more
hazardous is the terrorist threat, which thrives in such
surroundings.
	   Security forces are on the war path, the exact number was not
disclosed, for not only crowds are to be controlled, but in a
relatively closed area such as Paris, with numerous state and
ministerial buildings to safeguard, the task is indeed tremendous.
	   The French Organising Committee and FIFA, the World Football
Federation have been criticised for many things as could be
expected, but most stinging was the worldwide system used for
ticket allocations.
	   Their policies have come under attack, even admonished by the
European Union to improve the ticket distribution in a fairer way.
	   If all these headaches were not enough for the organisers,
another, rather unexpected problem arose. Industrial disputes from
several fronts came to the fore.
	   The worst being Air France pilots' strike, threatening to
maintain their walk-out through the World Cup event if their
demands were not met.
	   For once, the public, usually showing empathy for the strikers,
were less than impressed by claims from the world's best paid
pilots.
	   As a follow up to Air France pilots' demands, other social
categories are joining forces to blackmail the government for pay
increases and or social privileges, using the World Cup tournament
as a means of extortion.
	   The public for once, and the Press expressed their disapproval,
and see this as public relations disaster not to mention a further
deterioration of the country's credibility.
	   As negotiations between Air France management and pilots
continue, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, clearly stated that the
pilots' demands could not unsettle the forthcoming World Cup event,
that the airlines survival was of the essence.

	   ECONOMIC and population growth as well as increased use of
natural resources are the most fundamental reasons for a number of
environmental problems and threats.
	   It is not surprising then that Electrolux, the global appliance
company, bases its environmental work on resource efficiency,
legislations and gradually changing market demands.
	   In its 1997 Environmental Report, Electrolux says its proactive
environmental strategy is paying dividends for both customers and
shareholders by substantially reducing appliance running costs and
increasing investment returns.
	   According to Mr Per Grunewald, head of Environmental Affairs:
``In one key product area, for example, the products with the best
environmental performance accounted for 10 per cent of sales, and
up to 15 per cent of profit.''
	   The 36-page report details Electrolux's efforts in 1997 to
remain a front-runner in environmentally-sound products and
actively stimulate demand for appliances with reduced environmental
impact.
	   At the Conference on Climate Change in Kyoto last December, 38
developed countries agreed to further limit the emission of
greenhouse gases.
	   The protocol establishes that between the year 2008 and 2012,
the total emissions of greenhouse gases in these countries must be
reduced by 5.2 per cent compared to the 1990 level.
	   Decisions made and measures taken will affect Electrolux as well
as the industry as a whole.
	   Electrolux estimates that replacing all of Europe's domestic
white goods with new energy efficient appliances will account for
up to 25 per cent of the greenhouse limitations pledged by European
countries at the Kyoto conference.
	   Last year, white goods accounted for 74 per cent of sales in
household appliances, and for half of the total group sales.
	   The report added that Electrolux is far ahead of schedule in
phasing out ozone-depleting substances and in 1997, it became the
first company to market ozone-friendly refrigerators and freezers
in Brazil.
	   Sales of Electrolux refrigerators and freezers with the highest
environmental performance increased by 18 per cent from the first
to the second half of 1997, the report added.
	   In preventing waste and promoting recycling, Electrolux has
launched take-back of product programmes in several countries.

Blatter, Johansson try to minimize latest row _ slightly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Sepp Blatter and UEFA president Lennart Johansson
appeared to bury their hatchet again Wednesday, but only a few
centimeters deep.
	   The newly elected FIFA president and his vanquished opponent met
for a ``long personal talk'' Wednesday over allegations of
vote-buying in Monday's election by Blatter and ``have clarified
the issue,'' a media release from the world body said.
	   ``Lennart Johansson emphasizes that he at no time made any
accusations of bribery against Joseph S. Blatter,'' the release
said. ``He disassociates himself completely from these allegations
and vows to continue to cooperate with Joseph S. Blatter in his
role as the new FIFA president.''
	   That's not exactly what UEFA said, however.
	   Johansson and his UEFA vice-presidents _ Antonio Matarrese of
Italy, Egidius Braun of Germany, and Senes Erzik of Turkey _ met
with African Football Confederation president Issa Hayatou of
Cameroon, Oceania Football Confederation head Charles Dempsey of
New Zealand and Korean Football Association president and FIFA vice
president Chung Mong-joon to ``exchange views,'' a UEFA release
said.
	   ``They took note of media reports concerning alleged
irregularities in the FIFA presidential election,'' the release
said. ``However, Lennart Johansson stated that he did not wish to
speculate on such reports.''
	   ``Should these alleged irregularities become fact, we will take
the matter up,'' the release quoted Johansson as saying.
	   The dueling releases seemed to lessen the contentious battle
between Blatter and Johansson only slightly.
	   The two fought a bitter 2 1-2-month campaign for soccer's top
office, trading personal attacks and name-calling.
	   After winning, Blatter issued a press release Tuesday night
through FIFA ``categorically'' denying rumors ``of a manipulation
of the vote'' that gained him the post.
	   Rumors apparently were fed by a story in the International
Herald Tribune on Tuesday which quoted Johansson indicating that
Monday's vote wasn't fair.
	   ``Something happened somewhere,'' Johansson was quoted as
saying. ``I had so many promises of votes that I am, to put it
mildly, surprised and disappointed to be beaten so
comprehensively.''
	   Blatter didn't get the necessary two-thirds majority on the
first ballot, but led 111-80, more than enough to win a simple
majority on the second vote. Johansson conceded before a second
vote could be held.
	   In its release Wednesday, FIFA called the issue ``closed.''
	   ``FIFA intends to make no further statements in this connection,
but to concentrate all its efforts on running the football World
Cup in France.''

	   IT is a time for due diligence now as finance companies get down
to brass tacks in digesting the full impact of the recent merger
exercise which is viewed as necessary for the country's financial
well-being.
	   For these 39 finance firms to have been either merged into eight
groups or absorbed by their banking parents by the March 31
deadline, the road ahead is still threatened by many pitfalls.
	   For the next six to nine months, kinks have to be ironed out.
Internal as well as independent auditing has to be done. The
pricing has to be worked out, the mode of payment being dependent
on the strength of the balance sheet.
	   The logistics of rationalising branches and management for some
of these firms will have to be wrapped up.
	   The six core finance company groups are led by Mayban Finance,
Public Finance, Hong Leong Finance, Arab-Malaysian Finance, EON
Finance together with Credit Corporation under Suria Mahsuri Sdn
Bhd and United Merchant Finance.
	   Two other groups are Affin Finance and a strategic partnership
between MBf Finance and Bank of Commerce.
	   The merger of finance firms can perhaps be viewed as a foregone
conclusion. They had little choice but to merge.
	   The question of bad loans looms large in the performance of
finance companies. Among banking institutions, finance companies
experienced the most significant increase in non-performing loans,
rising from 4.3 per cent as at end-June 1997 to 7.8 per cent as at
end-1997.
	   According to Bank Negara's 1997 annual report, the decline in
pre-tax profit for finance companies in the second half of last
year (from RM923 million in the first half to RM381 million in the
second half) was largely due to an increase in loan loss provisions
and shrinking interest margins on their fixed rate loan portfolio.
	   Furthermore, a downturn in the motor industry had affected their
traditional hire-purchase business.
	   As a pre-emptive measure to contain asset price inflation, Bank
Negara had in March last year placed restrictions on hire-purchase
loans for passenger vehicles.
	   Under those guidelines, finance companies were not allowed to
provide financing in excess of 70 per cent of the purchase price of
non-commercial passenger vehicles while the repayment period of
these loans was restricted to not more than five years.
	   The regional financial meltdown had affected the repayment
patterns of borrowers pertaining to loans for the purchase of
passenger cars and commercial vehicles.
	   As at end-June last year, the NPL for this sector stood at RM1
billion or 2.4 per cent of total loans to this sector.
	   In comparison, commercial banks and merchant banks also suffered
a significant decline in profitability in the second half year. The
decline in merchant banks' profitability for the second half of
last year was also attributed to the sharp decline in their
traditional fee-based activities.
	   Banking is a service industry in which the cost is high. ``By
virtue of finance companies' fixed rate loan portfolio, it is
difficult for them to absorb increasing costs if the cost of funds
go up. There will be a squeeze on margins,'' says a senior banker.
	   It depends on whether they can borrow at favourable rates from
the money market, especially if they are smaller capitalised firms.
	   ``One or two bad loans can wipe out the capital of these
companies with small paid-up capital,'' he says.
	   Shareholders' funds of a mere few million ringgit in this day
and age is a pittance considering the advent of information
technology and communications.
	   The need to computerise extensively eventually for economies of
scale as well as sharpening financial institutions' competitive
edge is without doubt, more so when the Multimedia Super Corridor
is in place.
	   Furthermore, some of the financial institutions are family-owned
entities. For those reluctant to let go, having majority control is
good enough.
	   Finance companies which do not have a minimum of RM600 million
paid-up capital are required to top up by the year 2000.
	   Financial strength, together with good management, will
strengthen these companies and give them a better opportunity to
sustain their operations and instil investor confidence.
	   The strength of finance companies with a small capital base has
also been sapped by the size of the domestic market.
	   Pit that base with the number of players before the merger and
the population of Kuala Lumpur numbering about 1.5 million people,
and you have the elements of high cost in the making.
	   With one branch in Kuala Lumpur serving about 10,000 people for
all accounts, small firms may not be able to survive the escalating
cost of business.
	   It is not just finance firms which have to merge. The call is
out for brokerage firms to merge too. It is understood commercial
banks will have to do so by the year 2000 for by then, financial
services will be further liberalised in accordance with Malaysia's
commitment to the World Trade Organisation.
	   The risk of failure in the financial services industry has a
greater repercussion on the economy. If the pace of liberalisation
does not pick up, Malaysia may stand to lose out on cheaper cost of
funds, international sources of funding as well as innovative
financial products.
	   The pace of liberalisation has to be expedited as we need
adequate capital for investment. Liberalisation will require
greater transparency with timely disclosure of relevant
information.
	   In turn, this will enhance the performance of financial
institutions.
	   Strides have been made in improving transparency. The domestic
banking sector's inherent strength is that it does not have a huge
foreign debt.
	   The first corporate earnings reporting season of the year which
ended on March 31 - for companies whose interim of full financial
year ended on Dec 31, 1997 - is out, and it does not paint a pretty
picture.
	   Sharp falls in earnings and losses reported were mainly due to
larger- than-expected provisions that arose from untimely foreign
exchange loans and investments in stocks and shares.
	   The banking system's loan exposure to the broad property sector
has been an area of concern and property represents a sizeable
collateral against banking loans.
	   Though Bank Negara has laid the foundation for a more robust
financial system including more stringent prudential standards
imposed on the recognition of NPLs and provisioning besides
consolidating credit growth without curtailing productive
investments, the next few months are crucial for the financial
system in terms of its ability to withstand strain.
	   The sterling economic performance in recent years has
contributed to strong asset quality and facilitated the build-up of
capital and reserves to healthy levels.
	   As a result, the industry's capital and reserves have increased
by RM34 billion in the last five years to RM47 billion at the end
of last year.
	   Restoring confidence and expediting recovery in the financial
system is of paramount importance in the face of strains in a
difficult environment.
	   The current economic situation can be seen as an impetus in the
consolidation of the financial system, including merger intiatives.
	   Stronger prudential regulations, supervision and corporate
governance as well as greater transparency will strengthen sound
practices.
	   However, further tightening of provisioning rules for
sub-standard loans and off-balance sheet items may amplify the
problems faced by some banking institutions but ultimately, they
will result in stronger balance sheets.
	   These measures have to be instituted to restore investor
confidence and contribute effectively to economic recovery.

	   MANY exporters and importers still opt to ship their goods
through Singapore port rather than Malaysian ports.
	   Figures released by the Malaysian International Shippers'
Council showed that 37 per cent or 5.8 million TEUs (20-foot
equivalent units) of the 13 million TEUs of Singapore port's annual
container throughput are from Malaysia.
	   ``This number is huge,'' Council chairman Datuk Kerk Choo Ting
told reporters in Subang Jaya yesterday at the Fourth Biennial
International Maritime Conference on ``Maritime Industry: Meeting
New and Changing Demand Conditions in Asia''.
	   The two-day conference was opened by Transport Minister Datuk
Seri Dr Ling Liong Sik.
	   ``If we can bring back at least 10 per cent of this cargo volume
to Malaysian ports, it would certainly help the local maritime
industry amid the current economic slowdown.
	   ``But it is not easy to convince the shippers to change their
traditional way of practice. There is a reason why they still
prefer to go through Singapore port,'' he said.
	   Kerk said Malaysia has to improve the infrastructure facilities
at its ports, the operations and cargo clearance procedures, and
land transport facilities leading into and out of the ports.
	   ``With these three ingredients in place, I am sure the volume of
cargo going through Malaysian ports will also increase,'' he said.
	   In fact, he said, the Government has already done ``quite a
bit'' to upgrade the ports' infrastructure facilities to attract
exporters and importers to ship their goods directly to Malaysia.
``It is just a matter of time.''
	   Last year, Malaysian ports handled 165.7 million tonnes of
cargo, up 10.2 per cent over the 1996 volume.

	   THE advertising industry is looking at a reduction in
expenditure of between 25 to 30 per cent as companies do their
utmost to reduce expenditure and look for ways to keep their
business afloat in times of an economic slowdown.
	   Foote, Cone and Belding (M) Sdn Bhd deputy managing director T.
	   Renganathan said most companies failed to realise that cutting
back on advertisements will be detrimental in the long run.
	   Now more than ever, there is an urgent need for advertisements
to work harder and most cost effectively, he told Business Times in
Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``Gone are the days of mega productions. Advertisements have to
be more cost-effective with a quicker turnaround and at the same
time, they must maintain the brand in the long-term,'' he said.
	   ``Most clients are concerned with their own sales numbers, where
if financial figures are tracked on a quarterly basis previously,
now it is done on a monthly or even daily basis,'' he said, adding
that advertisers then have to work harder.
	   But while clients are looking for short-term ways to bring in
sales, some of the quick ``fix-its'' such as promotional sales will
diminish the standing of the brand in the long-term.
	   Customers, he added, look for value and this may come in the
form of the established brand.
	   ``Customers look for brands which they believe will be around in
the long term. Therefore if companies continue to advertise, they
will get the confidence needed,'' he said.
	   After all, if no one promotes anything, then business may well
come to a standstill, he said adding that the impetus then to
promote confidence and thereby stimulate the economy has to come
from businesses by way of advertisements and marketing.
	   FCB Malaysia's managing director Simon Bolton said one example
of a company that is aggressively advertising and marketing is
Suria KLCC.
	   He added that in times of slowdown, perhaps the last thing
needed is another new mall. ``But the approach taken in launching
the shopping mall is aggressive as seen by the full page
advertisements, radio as well as television commercials.''
	   On the impact of the economic problems on the agency's business,
Bolton assured Business Times that there is no sense of desperation
and ``we are faring a lot better than other companies.''
	   The statement is perhaps humble of FCB Malaysia, considering
that it recently won nine awards at the recent 3rd Malaysian Video
Awards.
	   FCB Malaysia won three gold awards, two for its TMTouch
advertisements and one for the National Cancer Council (Makna).
	   Renganathan said the rebranding of the agency two years ago has
paid off. FCB Malaysia was formerly called AP:FCB, a joint venture
between FCB and AP, a local advertising agency.
	   In 1996, FCB bought up the majority stake in the company.
	   ``Two years ago, we re-strategised plans for the business and we
recruited professionals to run the business and this is now paying
off.
	   ``We have our tools, we are building our client base and
employee confidence,'' Bolton added.
	   And who better than FCB Malaysia to realise the importance of
strong tools.
	   ``Strong tools are important because they help get better
communication for clients. At the end of the day, clients choose an
agency which they believe will give them a better chance of getting
better advertising for their brands,'' Bolton said.
	   And FCB uses and has developed tools such as an electronically
linked network of knowledge which enables any FCB office to tap
into the database of case studies.
	   This, he said, will give them an idea of how past advertisements
worked in another market or environment which then provides
confidence.
	   Another tool which is a FCB proprietary technique of gaining
insight into the behaviour of cosumers, is the ``mind and mood''
technique.
	   Bolton stressed that the ``mind and mood'' technique is
different from typical research as it provides insight into
consumer behaviour which then translates into ideas for better
advertising.
	   ``Mind and mood gives a consumer insight on how they look at
brands and peoducts, their buying behaviour and this then enables
the creative people to be more effective.
	   ``An example of how the technique works is if, say the client is
Mercedes and you want to talk to some S-Class owners.
	   ``These would be Chinese entrepreneurs and it is usually
difficult to meet them. So what happened was we found a sports hall
where some of these Chinese businessmen have played badminton for
the past 20 years.
	   ``So we went there and talked to them about how they felt about
their cars and we found that it is easy to get people to talk about
their passion,'' Bolton explained.
	   Apart from capitalising on their strengths, FCB Malaysia is also
investing in training where it has organised Information Technology
(IT) training programmes, departmental traning programmes as well
as regional programmes.
	   It is running seminar programmes on a variety of topics for
example, ``How to Write Radio Ads'' and ``How to Listen to Clients
Better.''
	   ``We are spending more significantly than we were in the past,''
said Renganathan.
	   Bolton added that FCB Malaysia is also looking for opportunities
to invest in other countries in the Asian region, for example, Sri
Lanka and Pakistan.
	   ``By and large we have a large network and we want to build on
this, be more successful and where there are opportunities, acquire
companies and talent.
	   ``By the year 2000, we hope to be close to the top of the cycle
and be at the top 10 in terms of size and client base,'' said
Bolton.

	   IF you're living a high cholesterol lifestyle your cholesterol
level may currently be too high or it may become high in the
future, increasing your risk of heart disease. High blood
cholesterol levels are not limited to overweight people but can
affect everyone. Even fit people can have high blood cholesterol!
Cholesterol is a fatty-like, waxy, yellowy substance that comes
from two sources: blood/serum cholesterol manufactured mainly by
the liver which is necessary to help carry fats to parts of the
body that need fat for energy and repairs, or fat for storage.
	   The other source is dietary cholesterol, absorbed from foods of
animal origin such as red meat, poultry, fish, cheese, eggs, milk
and ice cream.
	   If a food comes from a source that walks or swims, it has
cholesterol.
	   The main influence on cholesterol is saturated fat (found in
animal foods such as dairy products and meat).
	   Over a period of time cholesterol builds up in the walls of the
arteries forming plaque. This plaque can eventually block arteries
and rob the surrounding tissue of the oxygen and nutrients it needs
to stay healthy.
	   When this happens in the blood vessels leading to the heart, a
heart attack can occur.
	   The statements below will indicate whether you may be living a
high cholesterol lifestyle. Tick the boxes if they apply to you.
	   The food you buy You buy butter and other whole-fat dairy
products such as whole milk and cheese.
	   You eat a lot of steaks, chops and meat.
	   You always eat the skin on chicken and the fat off meat.
	   The way you live You've been putting off losing those extra
pounds of weight.
	   You don't take time to exercise regularly.
	   You've never had your cholesterol checked - has it been five
years or more since your last test?
	   The food you eat You eat a lot of fried food.
	   You like food with gravy and sauces.
	   When eating out, you choose food for taste - not your health.
	   The more boxes you ticked, the greater your risk of having high
cholesterol.
	   You will benefit greatly if you follow this guide for low
cholesterol living. Controlling cholesterol should be a daily
effort, starting in the morning and ending at night. Diet and
exercise are important daily considerations.
	   Follow this guide to low cholesterol living Check your results
Have your cholesterol level tested by your family doctor and know
what your cholesterol level is. A small blood sample is taken and
checked immediately or sent to a lab. Your doctor can measure your
lipoprotein levels to more accurately determine your risk of heart
disease.
	   Less than 200: Congratulations! Your total cholesterol level
should be less than 200. Your goal should be to maintain your
cholesterol at this desirable level by following the steps in this
guide for low cholesterol living.
	   You need to have it checked every five years at this level.
	   200-239 - borderline high: Because you may be at increased risk
for heart disease, have a follow up test to confirm the results.
Begin to lower your cholesterol to ``desirable'' by changing your
diet and following the guide below.
	   240 or higher - high: Because you're at increased risk for heart
disease. See your family doctor right away for a test that includes
total, HDL and LDL levels. Begin to lower your cholesterol by
following the steps in this guide.
	   Change your diet Eat less fat - your goal is to limit fats to
one-third of your total calories. Avoid obvious fats such as butter
and hidden fats in processed food.
	   Eat more fibre - soluble fibre lowers your cholesterol level by
keeping the cholesterol you eat from being absorbed by the body.
Oats, beans and fruit are rich in soluble fibre.
	   Eat less cholesterol - limit your intake of high cholesterol
food such as eggs and meat from all animals, especially organ
meats.
	   Eat more starches (complex carbohydrates) - starches aren't
fattening and can lower your cholesterol level by diluting the fat
you eat. Eat more starches such as grains, beans, rice and root
vegetables.
	   Pick your fats wisely Fats can be divided into three types;
monounsaturated, polyunsaturated and aturated. Your goal is to
choose less saturated fat and use monounsaturated and
polyunsaturated fats instead.
	   Monounsaturated fat - vegetable sources such as olive and rape
seed oil canola) Polyunsaturated fat - vegetable sources such as
safflower, sunflower or corn oil. Many margarines are high in
polyunsaturated fat.
	   Saturated fat - avoid animal sources such as butter, lard, and
meat.
	   Vegetable sources are coconut, and partially hydrogenated oils
found in many processed foods.
	   Shop for the best foods Changing your diet begins with making
changes in what you buy at the supermarket or market in your weekly
shopping. With a little practice you can develop skills for picking
the right fats, reading labels and making good selections whilst
shopping for the family.
	   Poultry (no skin), fish and seafood and lean cuts of meat, are
good low- fat choices.
	   Fresh fruit and vegetables are practically fat-free and contain
no cholesterol.
	   Starchy foods such as potatoes, yams, grains, breads and cereals
are all good choices.
	   Beans and oats can help lower your cholesterol. Choose low-fat
food products containing these ingredients.
	   Frozen desserts such as low-fat ice-cream and low-fat frozen
yoghurt are good low-fat choices.
	   This information was supplied by the Quaker Cholesterol
Information Bureau, which is a public education initiative
established to raise awareness of cholesterol and the risks
associated with it. The bureau is made up of a panel of health and
medical professionals. For further information, call 03-4701772 or

	   CEUTA, Spain (AP) _ The record for the fastest Atlantic crossing
by a commercial passenger vessel has been broken by an
Australian-built ferry, the company said Wednesday
	   The 91-meter (300-foot) Catalonia arrived in the Spanish enclave
city of Ceuta in north Africa after 10:00 p.m (2000 GMT) Tuesday,
clocking an average speed of 40 knots during a cross-Atlantic
sprint that began in New York at 0035 GMT Sunday, said Ivonne
Sentis, spokeswoman for Buquebus, the Argentine-Uruguayan company
that owns the ferry.
	   The crossing took three days, nine hours and 55 minutes.
	   Hoverspeed Great Britain set the previous record with an average
speed of 36.65 knots in 1990. Both ships were built by Incat
Australia.
	   Winning the record carries with it the Hales Trophy, donated by
British Member of Parliament Harold Hales in 1933. The trophy was
first held by the Italian Liner Rez, which set the record of 29
knots in the same year.
	   The Catalonia must now turn over its logs to the trophy's
technical review committee, which will render its decision within
30 days.
	   The ferry, with room for 900 passengers and 250 cars, will work
the three-hour route between Barcelona and the Mediterranean resort
island of Mallorca starting June 15.

Rebels, state police clash in Chiapas; at least one policeman dead

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Villagers who support
leftist rebels clashed with state police in at least two shootouts
Wednesday in the highlands of southern Chiapas state. At least one
police officer was killed and five were wounded.
	   Witnesses said the clashes started when state police, backed by
army troops, tried to dismantle a parallel town council the rebel
supporters had set up in the village of El Bosque, 25 miles (40
kms) north of San Cristobal.
	   Police and troops moved in early Wednesday to El Bosque and the
nearby communities of Los Platanos, Union Progreso and Chabajebal.
The gunfights began in the early morning, and sporadic shooting
could still be heard outside Chabajebal at 1:30 p.m.
	   Details remained unclear because state police and soldiers
blocked most journalists from entering a ``security cordon.''
	   Jose Luis Zenteno, a public security officer, told reporters in
San Cristobal that he and several other policemen were driving to
search a house in El Bosque when several men _ believed to be
Zapatista rebels and wearing ski masks _ opened fire with automatic
weapons.
	   Zenteno said one officer was killed and five were wounded in the
7 a.m. ambush. The state attorney general's office refused to give
out any information on the incidents.
	   Sympathizers of the Zapatista National Liberation Army had set
up a rebel town council in El Bosque 2 1/2 years ago. Members of
the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party had their own town
council at a house a few blocks away.
	   The two town councils appeared to coexist peacefully until
Wednesday.
	   In Chabajebal, state police and soldiers surrounded the town
early Wednesday afternoon. Rebel sympathizers there faxed a
statement to news media claiming there was much shooting and
``several dead and wounded among Zapatista sympathizers.'' The
claim could not be confirmed.
	   The fax appealed for help from the Red Cross and human rights
organizations.
	   The Zapatista rebels staged a brief uprising on Jan. 1, 1994,
saying they were fighting for more rights and better living
conditions for the Mexico's poor Indians. Peace talks are stalled
over the government's failure to implement an accord on Indian
autonomy.
	   At least 40,000 federal troops patrol the state. The government
has been accused of links to vigilante groups that have clashed
with Zapatista supporters, including a band that massacred 45 rebel
sympathizers in the town of Acteal late last year.
	   Supporters of the Zapatistas have set up 32 parallel town
councils _ most of them a symbolic presence _ since late 1994. The
government late last year began breaking them up, and 28 now
remain.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - Fifty-nine organisations representing
professional groups, health-related industries and non-governmental
organisations will present their memorandums during the Third
Health Ministry Annual Dialogue which started today.
	   Health Minister Datuk Chua Jui Meng said the dialogue was to
gather input from health-related bodies to formulate the country's
healthcare policy as well as to evaluate the existing policy's
effectiveness.
	   He said it also provided an opportunity for unions representing
the ministry's employees to present their memorandums on issues
relating to career prospects and conditions of work.
	   Chua said the dialogue was important as several developments in
healthcare had taken place as a result of past dialogues. An
example is the Private Healthcare Facilities and Services Bill
1998.
	   ``The Bill is the answer to calls for the ministry to practise
greater transparency on issues related to healthcare reforms.
	   ``There was concern over unregulated development of managed care
organisations which interfered with professional decision making,
resulting in the under-treatment of patients.
	   ``With the new Bill, the licensee and holders of certificates of
registration of private healthcare facilities will be regulated and
controlled.''
	   Chua also expressed his hope that this year's dialogue would be
as fruitful, if not better than the previous years'.
	   Among the professional groups which presented their memorandums
today were the Malaysian Endocrine and Metabolic Society, Malaysian
Radiological Society, Malaysian Association of Private Medical
Laboratories, Opthalmological Society of MMA, Malaysian Society of
Transplantation and the Malaysian Dermatology Society. Tomorrow,
Chua will meet representatives of industrial organisations.

Drug crimes up sharply in Poland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Serious drug-related offenses in Poland
rose by nearly 100 percent between 1994 and 1997 and the government
has mounting a major campaign to stem the tide, Interior Minister
Janusz Tomaszewski said Wednesday.
	   Tomaszewski said the use of synthetic drugs and amphetamines was
an increasingly serious problem.
	   ``Criminal laboratories operating on Polish territory ... are
producing amphetamines both for the needs of the domestic marlet
and for transfer abroad,'' Tomaszewski told the first session of
the three-day General Assembly special session on drugs.
	   ``The liquidation of 10 such illegal production facilities in
1997 was an undeniable success of Polish police,'' he added. He
said criminal gangs involved in the amphetamine trade were also
active in other crimes such as stolen cars, forgery and weapons
smuggling.
	   Tomaszewski said Poland's geographic location made it an
excellent transit point for smuggling drugs into Europe _ including
heroin from Asia's ``Golden Triangle,'' cocaine from South America
and cannabis from South Asia.
	   ``We observe increasingly closer links between Polish criminal
groups and criminal groups in other countries, especially in the
production of synthetic drugs and in the transit and smuggling of
drugs,'' he said.
	   ``Polish citizens are used by international criminal
organizations and also by Polish organizations as drug runners on
the most important smuggling routes.
	   He said that between 1994 and 1997, the number of serious drug
crimes such as production, distribution and smuggling rose from
about 4,000 to nearly 8,000.
	   In order to curb the trend, he said the government set up a
special narcotics bureau in 1997 to spearhead the fight against
drugs. He also said Polish laws were being adapted to meet
international goals of combatting money-laundering and seizing
drug-generated assets.
	   ``The Polish government will not relinquish its efforts to
combat drug addiction and drug-related crime,'' he said.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Tues. - It's bargains galore at the Sultan Abdul
Aziz Shah International Airport as it prepares for closure come the
opening of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang at the
end of the month.
	   The duty-free shops are plastered with stickers and placards
announcing the big move to the KLIA along with discount notices in
the hope of finishing their stocks before June 27.
	   Price cuts of up to 60 per cent are offered everywhere,
including at the Habib Jewel store where diamond accessories are
sold at a 50 per cent discount.
	   Even Christian Dior is offering 60 per cent cuts for certain
items although the notice is subtle and soberly printed on a
signage at the entrance.
	   Malaysia Airports Berhad commercial manager Yusuf Jamaluddin
said the shops had stopped acquiring new stocks and were trying to
dispose of all their stocks.
	   ``Some of them have started to transport their goods to the new
airport in Sepang,'' he said.
	   While most of the shops at Terminal Two can move their goods to
the new airport without any hassle, the other shops selling
duty-free goods have to go through the customs and time-consuming
procedures.
	   ``That's why they are so eager to sell off their stocks,'' Yusuf
said, adding that the shops would continue to operate until June 29
when the airport in Subang ceased operations.
	   He said sales, which had been down earlier due to the economic
slowdown, had been picking up again since the ``big move
discounts'' started last week.
	   ``Whatever happens, we want to make sure that customers get the
best bargains until the very last day,'' Yusuf said.

	   PETALING JAYA, Tues. - The proposed Malaysia Shipping Act, which
is being drafted, will update the shipping laws and ensure they are
abreast of international laws and practices.
	   Transport Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ling Liong Sik said today the
Act would replace three current shipping ordinances - one each for
Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak passed in 1952 and 1960.
	   He said the maritime industry required additional legislation to
prepare it to face future challenges.
	   ``Shipping trends worldwide show a tendency to hub a few major
ports in each region and the Government has embarked on a policy of
positioning Port Klang, our premier port, as a national and
regional hub,'' he added.
	   Besides the proposed new Act, another one being drafted is the
Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, to update the liability regime for
sea transport.
	   ``The current legislation enacted in 1950 adopts the Hague Rules
of 1924 while the new Act will adopt the Hague Visby Rules of
1968,'' he added.
	   Dr Ling was speaking at the two-day 4th Biennial International
Maritime Conference on ``Maritime Industry: Meeting New and
Changing Demand Conditions in Asia.''
	   Also present were president of Institut Kelautan Malaysia, Capt
Mohd Azmi Ahmad, chairman of Port Klang Authority Datuk Michael
Chen and Transport Ministry secretary-general Datuk Othman Mohd
Rijal.
	   Dr Ling said the new extended Traffic Separation Scheme in the
Straits of Malacca would be enforced by Dec 1, this year.
	   ``The Government is fully committed to ensure safety on the high
seas.
	   TSS has already been agreed to by the Maritime Safety Committee
of the International Maritime Organisation. It will be complemented
by the Vessel Traffic System,'' he added.
	   The International Ship Management Code would be fully
implemented this year.
	   ``This is to ensure that their ships do not face any
difficulties when calling on foreign ports. ISM code compliance
will also ensure that safety is given a high priority in the
operation of their ships,'' said Dr Ling.

	   MUAR, Tues. - Most of the 2,000 inshore fishermen have returned
to sea following an increase in police patrols to deter pirates.
	   Fishing activities were halted for about two weeks when armed
pirates kidnapped ll fishermen a fortnight ago. They were released
when RM54,000 in ramsom was paid.
	   Parit Jawa Fishermen's Association secretary Yap Ee Tiam said
today patrols by the Marine police had boosted the confidence of
the fishermen.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Two Israeli teen-agers were feared trapped
under the rubble of their high school gym roof after it collpased
Wednesday in the southern city of Beersheva.
	   Police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said 13 other boys who were in
the Mekif high school gym playing basketball when the roof began
caving in, succeeded in escaping. One boy was lightly injured and
taken to hospital and two others were missing and believed to be
trapped under the debris.
	   Israeli media reports suggested construction on the site may
have destabilized the roof and led to the collapse. Police said
they had not yet determined what caused the collapse.

	   KLANG, Tues. - Plastic goods worth more than RM30 million went
up in smoke when fire broke out at a factory manufacturing plastic
products in Jalan Haji Abdul Manan, Meru, today.
	   The fire which broke out at 1.30pm also left 600 employees of
Plastic Centre Groups of Companies Sdn Bhd jobless.
	   The factory director, identified only as Tan, said workers who
spotted the fire at the store immediately alerted their colleagues.
	   ``Fortunately no one was injured in the fire which razed three
blocks of the factory building,'' he added.
	   At the time of the incident, only 200 workers were on duty as it
operates on three shifts.
	   About 55 firemen from five Fire and Rescue Department branches
in Shah Alam, Port Klang, Petaling Jaya, north Klang and south
Klang rushed to the scene in six fire engines including a skylift
and took almost an hour to bring the flames under control.
	   Selangor Fire and Rescue Department director Wan Mohd Nor Wan
Ibrahim who led the operation said strong winds and inflammable
materials caused the fire to spread rapidly.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt is refusing to allow Sheik Ahmed
Yassin, the spiritual leader of the radical Islamic group Hamas, to
travel to Cairo, Hamas officials said Wednesday.
	   Yassin, who was scheduled to arrive in Cairo from neighboring
Sudan Tuesday night, has had to remain in Khartoum since Egyptian
authorities told him that he may not fly to Cairo, said Mohammed
Nazal, Hamas spokesman in Jordan.
	   Yassin has asked to transit through Cairo on his way back to his
home in Gaza.
	   Earlier, Jordan rejected Yassin's request to transit through the
kingdom on his way home, Jordanian officials said Wednesday. They
spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Salam Majali told reporters in
the Gaza Strip Wednesday that ``if he (Yassin) wants to visit as an
ordinary Palestinian he is welcome to do so but if he is planning
to come with political ideas as a VIP, we will decide the date and
the agenda of such a visit.''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Tues - Utilisation of funds by small- and
medium-scale enterprises for purposes of research and development
has been poor as most entrepreneurs are unaware of the funds.
	   Entrepreneur Development Minister Datuk Mustapa Mohamed said
today this was also true for various other funds set up for
entrepreneurs and was a matter for concern.
	   ``There is something wrong with our entrepreneurs. It is so
difficult for them to be exposed to and understand the various
facilities available,''
	   Mustapa said after opening the Multimedia Super Corridor
Nationwide Conference.
	   Also present was Multimedia Development Corporation executive
chairman Tan Sri Dr Othman Yeop Abdullah.
	   Mustapa said there were ample funds provided by the Government
and the private sector through venture capital and SMEs must take
the initiative to avail themselves of these.
	   Mustapa said the role of the Government and its agencies was to
assist and that the whole country had to ``buck up'' given the
current economic situation.
	   Yeop said MDC, through the MDC Advisory and Consulting Centre
for Enterprises (MDC ACCESS), hoped to develop 20 local IT
companies as world- class companies by 2000.
	   Earlier in his speech, Mustapa said more entrepreneurs should
take up the opportunities offered by the MSC.
	   He said to stay ahead in information technology it was
imperative to develop and nurture home-grown IT and multimedia
companies focused on developing indigenous technologies so it would
in turn, support the development of leading-edge
globally-competitive products and services.
	   ``In today's environment and with the advent of the digital
revolution, the chances of survival for a domestic player are
nearly non-existent unless we buck up and leapfrog,'' he said,
adding that was why despite the current economic downturn, the MSC
project would proceed at full steam.
	   He said the financial crisis was partly brought about by
globalisation and the revolutionary changes in telecommunications
and information technology.
	   Mustapa said it was hoped the MSC would provide an environment
that would nurture a thriving culture of creativity, innovation and
entrepreneurship - one that would accept failure as a natural
prerequisite to success.
	   Risk-taking must be encouraged in order to turn untried and
untested ideas into profitable business ventures.
	   He said his ministry had set up an IT Task Force and Knowledge
Workers IT Training Committee. The members comprised
representatives from the public and private sectors who worked
closely with SMEs.
	   Mustapa said the primary functions of the task force were to
assist entrepreneurs venture into IT-related businesses in the MSC
by helping them apply for MSC status, providing counselling and
guidance, as well as look out for related opportunities.

	   For I am mindful of the sincere faith within you, which first
dwelt in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and I am
sure that it is in you as well. - 2 Timothy 1:5 In 1950 only one
mother in 10 worked; but today four of every ten mothers of
preschool children bundle them off to the sitters or day care
center.
	   Today, five million children under age 13 spend 30 hours or more
a week in the care of someone other than their parents or school
teachers.
	   For years, Dr. Urie Bronfenbrenner, professor of family living
at Cornell, has been warning: Parents who allow surrogate mothers,
or electronic baby-sitters - television sets - to raise their kids
are seriously depriving their children of what no one else can ever
give - the security and warmth of a mother.
	   One of the most strongly worded criticisms, however, comes from
a woman, Dr. Selma Fraiberg, a child psychiatrist at the University
of Michigan, who has written the book Every Child's Birthright: In
Defense of Mothering. She says that children can profit from
half-day nursery school programs with small groups and qualified
teachers. What she objects to are babies and small children
delivered like packages to day care centers where they spend nine
to eleven hours a day - too long a time away from home - without a
good educational program and qualified teachers. And besides, she
points out, the parent who does this has only an hour in the
morning and not much more than that in the evening with the child.
One day care teacher recently said that she'd quit and raise her
child herself, ``no matter what the economic cost.''
	   Ralph Waldo Emerson pointed out that all generalizations are not
worth much, including the one that I am about to make, but I think
it's fair to say that if working mothers deducted the cost of
baby-sitters, additional clothes, gasoline, lunches and incidentals
from their earnings outside the home, and then evaluated the
emotional deprivation of their preschool children, there might be a
host of resignation by next Friday. Yes, it's a valid question.
Where have all the parents gone?

	   THERE is a need for environmental protection to be pursued in
the context of sustainable development, International Trade and
Industry Datuk Seri Rafidah Aziz said ``The promotion of
sustainable development should encompass initiatives which
strengthen and continue the liberalisation of the trading system as
well as consciously putting in place complementary environmental
policies,'' she said in Kuala Lumpur yesterday at the World Trade
Organisation (WTO) seminar on trade and environment for Asia
Pacific.
	   The text of her speech was read by the ministry's parlimentary
secretary Ahmad Kmaruzaman Mohd Baria.
	   Rafidah added that from the perspective of the multilateral
trading system, the WTO principle of non-discrimination should not
be compromised when pursuing environmental objectives.
	   She voiced the country's disappointment that some developed
countries continue to apply environmental policy measures
unilaterally and in a discriminatory manner rather than by
consensus.
	   ``What is of greater concern to the trading comunity including
Malaysia is that such environmental measures are conveniently used
as a covert form of trade protectionism to circumvent the WTO
system.
	   ``Many eco-labelling schemes were being promoted in the name of
sustainability but they could create problems if they are not
implemented based on a multilaterlly agreed criteria,'' she said.
	   Rafidah added that while Malaysia recognises the rationale for
eco- labelling, the indiscriminate use of such schemes as means of
trade harassment are affecting exports of developing countries.
	   ``The greatest challenge which faces the international community
is to effectively refrain from applying discriminatory trade
measures for environment purposes,'' she said.
	   Instead, there is a need to identify alternative means to
resolve regional and multilateral environmental problems.
	   ``Rather than punitive measures, positive measures such as
improving market access, financing, transfer of environmentally
sound technology, and capacity building in assisting developing
countries achieve sustainable development and meet environmental
objectives should be fully explored.
	   ``The special needs and problems associated with small and
medium industries in responding to the environmental challenge
would have to be adequately addressed,'' she said.
	   She reiterated that Malaysia is not oblivious to environmental
protection.
	   ``Various strategies relating to pollution control and
prevention, the integration of environmental consideration in
project planning and implementation and taking into account its
inputs into resource and development planning have been
incorporated into Malaysia's national development plans,'' she
said.
	   The seminar organised by the WTO secretariat in Geneva is the
first regional seminar to be held in the Asia Pacific region.
	   Economics officer of the WTO secretariat Sabrina Shaw said the
objective of the seminar is to bring together government
representatives in trade and the environment sector to promote
dialogue and understanding.
	   The three-day seminar is attended by some 60 participants from
22 countries.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Tues. - The Anti-Piracy Front of Umno Youth today
called on the authorities to be more serious and resolved in
combating intellectual and software piracy.
	   Its head, Abd Aziz Sheikh Fadzir, said pirated items were still
sold openly which indicated that the various measures taken so far
had failed to curb the problem.
	   He felt this would not happen if agencies like the Malaysian
Industrial Development Authority, the Customs Department and police
were more determined in their efforts.
	   Abd Aziz was speaking after chairing the front's annual meeting
at the Umno Youth headquarters at Menara Dato' Onn. Among those
present were representatives of recording companies and the
artistes' association.
	   ``For instance, MIDA should stop issuing new licence to
factories producing compact and video compact discs and revoke the
permits of those found to have been engaged in copyright
infringements.
	   ``But this is not done. New permits continued to be issued
resulting in 17 factories whereas statistics show we only need four
to meet the local demand. The main question that needs to be asked
now is what type of products are being manufactured by these
factories?''
	   Abd Aziz said the Customs Department must conduct more stringent
checks on consigments brought in, especially machines with
duplication facilities.
	   ``Some items should be placed under the list of controlled
items. The imports of raw materials like polycarbonate, an
essential item in the duplication and reproduction of softwares,
should only be allowed if permits are obtained.''
	   He also said enforcement must be intensified and efforts made to
ensure that offenders were not allowed to resume their trade
immediately.
	   ``There are cases where pirates are found to have resumed
operation a day after being raided. In other cases, this has been
made possible because the authorities only confiscated part of
their equipment.''
	   On the copyright laws, he said the current provisions were not
deterrent enough as the culprits were only subjected to a small
fine.
	   The front is proposing that a minimum fine of RM5,000 be imposed
for each infringing copy and a mandatory jail term of six months
for those found guilty of selling pirated items.

	   LOCAL ports must move away from its traditional role as an
interface and make quantum leap into providing a wide range of
highly integrated level of service which is able to respond to the
demands of globalisation of international trade, Kelang Multi
Terminal Sdn Bhd said.
	   Its executive chairman, Datuk G. Gnanalingam, said ports must
explore avenues of cooperation and collaboration in the wake of the
highly competitive forces unleashed by globalisation of trade such
as the structural responses taking place in other industries. ``It
must ensure that the sub-systems which make up the port industry
and operations become a total system working in a cohesive manner
and facilitate ship and cargo handling seamlessly.
	   ``In the long run, the impact of globalisation of international
trade on ports could make national port status irrelevant or less
important, as is evidently becoming in the shipping, airlines,
telecommunications, banking, insurance and petroleum sectors,'' he
said at the Fourth Biennial International Maritime Conference in
Subang Jaya yesterday.
	   Presenting his paper on ``The Response of the Port Sector to
Globalisation of Trade: A Malaysian Perspective'', Gnanalingam said
the pressure on Malaysian ports to respond to globalisation of
international trade is very strong.
	   ``The country is one of the most open economies in the world
with a very high level of dependence on foreign trade.
Globalisation of international trade will have tremendous impact on
the economy of the country and the ports must therefore respond
accordingly,'' he said.
	   In the wake of globalisation of international trade, Gnanalingam
said the demand for port services will be influenced by: The
emergence of large trading centres as opposed to production and
distribution centres.
	   The need to move very large volume of products from one point to
another.
	   The need to move very large volume of cargo in the most
expeditious and efficient manner to meet low or no inventory
requirements.
	   The need for greater integration in the transport and
distribution pipelines.
	   The spread of increasingly paperless transaction and environment
in trade and commerce.
	   Ports, Gnanalingam said, also need to address the response of
the liner shipping sector to the globalisation of trade as
reflected in the emergence of large alliances and deployment of
very large containerships with higher frequency of calls.
	   These lines are deploying ships in the range of 5,000 to 6,500
TEU capacity, with exchange sometimes exceeding 1,000 per call and
with number of calls in rapid succession.
	   He added that there is also a trend of some of these lines to
combine and integrate their operations beyond ocean leg of
transportation by engaging in inland transportation and related
services. The objective of the development is to lower the total
transportation costs, including by achieving economies of scale
with the deployment of bigger vessels.
	   This imposes severe burden and responsibility on ports to ensure
that the efforts by the lines to lower their costs are not
threatened by higher costs brought about by lack of efficiencies at
the ports.
	   ``Ports must, therefore, become more competitive. Shipping lines
will want to see greater efficiencies and improvements in costs at
ports and inland operations to bring about savings in their own
total cost of transportation. ``One way for the ports to respond to
this is, of course, to eliminate the seams in the transportation
chain,'' he said.
	   Gnanalingam said one other response which the ports sector
should be looking at is the scope of alliances. Alliance among
ports could become a counter-veiling power.
	   ``But it will not be easy forging alliance among ports. There
is, in the first place, the intra-port competition to contend with,
including in Malaysia, at Port Klang.
	   ``Then, there is a keen inter-port competition in the region to
be considered.
	   ``Unless ports are ready to shed or dilute corporate image and
identities to foster intra-port cooperation and remove national
identities to forge inter-port alliances, little can be achieved by
proposing alliances, like those taking place in the shipping world
or in other sectors.
	   ``It may be a long way to go before we see alliance among ports
in the same way as those taking place in other industries. But a
start can be made by the port sector in cooperating in specific
areas, including in feedering services, operating inland
facilities, storage and sharing or managing equipment and other
port related activities,'' he said.

	   Pushing for the participation of Mindanao as a major player in
the country's mango industry, associations of Mindanao mango
growers have once again organized the 2nd Mindanao Mango Congress
'98 from July 30 to August 1 in Butuan City.
	   This year's congress will continue pursuing the goal of
transforming Mindanao's mango industry into the largest industry in
the province by 2005.
	   The event organizer, Agusan del Norte Federation of Mango
Growers, expects about 500 participants from all levels of the
mango distribution chain, including growers, processors,
trader/buyers, exporters, technicians and researchers.
	   Among the factors that have turned Mindanao into a fast-growing
alternative source for local mango production are the increasing
demand for mango in both local and international markets; the rapid
expansion and development of areas for mango production in
Mindanao; and the large attendance of mango growers at major
meetings in the past two years.
	   According to Ted Rodriguez, Enterprises Development specialist
of Growth with Equity in Mindanao (GEM) which assists in organizing
the congress, the congress has multiple objectives. Among them are:
to provide framework for the equitable development of mango-based
enterprises in Mindanao; to promote investment opportunities in the
mango and fruit industry for the Caraga Region and Mindanao; to
update Mindanao mango growers' information about where mangoes are
grown; to present post-harvest and processing technologies; and to
provide a venue for consensus building on policy issues affecting
the Mindanao mango industry.
	   The congress, entitled ``The Philippine Golden Mango: Responding
to Golden Opportunities with New Strategies'', was also organized
in cooperation with the Mindanao Mango Industry Development
Foundation, the Department of Tourism, the Department of Trade and
Industry, the Agricultural Training Institute, Department of
Science and Technology, Jardine Davies-Agchem Division, and the
Department of Agriculture.
	   For further information on the event, call tel. (082) 224-0517
or 221-0649 and look for Giovanni D. Malundo or Lovella B. Lim.

	   PENGKALEN Holdings Bhd (PHB) and Pengkalen Capital Bhd (PCB)
simultaneously revised the basis of their earlier proposed rights
issues, primarily to pump in more capital into the latter's
stockbroking subsidiaries, Pengkalen Securities and Kimara
Equities.
	   Pengkalen Securities and Kimara are both currently under trading
restrictions and require additional capital injections.
	   Both companies, through their respective rights issues, will
raise a combined RM1.01 billion, in part to repay bank borrowings
but more importantly to free the two brokerages from the trading
restrictions.
	   They would have raised a combined RM650.32 million if based on
their respective original rights issues proposed.
	   PHB's earlier proposed 2-for-1 rights issue of 397.23 million
shares has been revised to 3-for-1 of 595.84 million shares of RM1
each, to raise RM595.84 million instead of the previous RM397.23
million.
	   PCB, on its part, revised its earlier 3-for-1 rights issue of
253.09 million shares to 5-for-1 of 421.81 million shares of RM1
each, to raise RM421.81 million instead of the previous RM253.09
million.
	   PHB will use RM366.00 million of the proceeds from its revised
rights issue to repay its bank borrowings and some RM220.43 million
to subscribe for its entitlement of 220.43 million new shares in
PCB's revised rights issue.
	   PCB in turn, will use RM267 million of the proceeds from its
revised exercise to subscribe for its entitlement of 267 million
new shares in Pengkalen Securities' revised rights issue.
	   It will also use another RM148 million to subscribe for its
entitlement of 148 million new shares under Kimara Equities'
revised rights issue.
	   Analysts meanwhile said with the additional capital injection
into the two stockbroking firms, they will have liquid funds as
well as improved cashflows.
	   PHB, on its part, made the revision upon the increase in size of
PCB's cash call. Its parent company, Malayan United Industries Bhd,
which now holds an 80.72 per cent stake in the company, will
subscribe for its full entitlement of 480.94 million shares in
PHB's revised rights issue.
	   On PCB's part, the revision was necessary, to accommodate a
larger size of capital raising required of its two stockbroking
subsidiaries.
	   Meanwhile, both Pengkalen Securities and Kimara Equities
yesterday obtained a restraining order from the High Court of
Malaya to grant them stay from actions against indebtedness or
other obligations to their creditors or claimants for a period of
up to six months.
	   In a separate announcement, Rating Agency Malaysia (RAM) has
downgraded Pengkalen Securities' RM100 million guaranteed revolving
underwritten facility (1995/2000) short-term stand alone rating to
`NP', saying that while the securities company has attempted to
secure rated financial institutions to replace its unrated
guarantors, the situation has remain unchanged.
	   RAM said in the event of default by Pengkalen Securities,
noteholders would have recourse to the consortium of guarantors.
	   It added that while the facility continues to be guaranteed by
the guarantors, some of them are not yet rated by RAM.

	   The effective implementation of the Community Based Forest
Management (CBFM), under the Natural Resources Management Program
(NRMP) of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources
(DENR), has undoubtedly helped upland farmers in Misamis Oriental
to focus on the planting of various cash crops.
	   CBFM has not only stopped logging and poaching activities in the
area but has helped create community organizations in many parts of
Mindanao as well.
	   One successful CBFM beneficiary is the Mat-I Green Agroforestry
Development Association (Mag-Agda), whose membership now totals
184. These members have obtained an agreement under the CBFM
program to take care of 1,500 hectares of forest land, which serve
as Watershed of Dal-as and Mag-Bais creeks.
	   Cirilo Camiros, Mag-Agda chair, recounted that during the Marcos
regime, logging and pouching activities were the prime source of
income of most of the upland farmers and lowland communities.
	   Mag-Agda was created in 1994 to protect and rehabilitate the
forest that hosts the six watersheds providing more than 50% of
Misamis Oriental's water needs.
	   ``The existence of illegal logging was rampant at that time. And
the Dumagats (lowlanders) were the ones conducting the negotiation
with the Lumads (tribesmen) to sell the timber in the forested
areas,'' Camiros said.
	   However, since logging or timber cutting was not that
profitable, the Lumads and Dumagats both decided to abandon and
cease logging operations.
	   They seeked the assistance of non-government organizations that
extend support services to any community.
	   Life After Logging Mag-Agda members are currently enjoying the
benefits provided by NRMP- and DENR-initiated livelihood projects,
while the Department of Agriculture helps the other residents of
Mat-I, Claveria through their own programs.
	   The earlier part of the CBFM program aided Mag-Agda members
obtain initial funding from the provincial government for the
implementation of these projects.
	   Among these projects are the making of tomato crates using
abandoned logs.
	   Cooperatives can make a total of 2,000 crates a week, Camiros
noted.
	   The creation of tomato crates was a big help to members' daily
income.
	   According to data from CBFM, 70% of farmers in Mat-I, Claveria
plant tomatoes. One hectare alone could produce as much as 1,000 to
1,500 crates of tomatoes.
	   Camiros noted that each crate, consisting of P25-30 kilos, can
be sold for as high as P450 per crate and as low as P50 per crate.
The tomato products are disposed mostly in Metro Manila markets,
particularly Divisoria.
	   Aside from tomatoes, upland farmers also plant rice, corn,
coffee and vegetables to sustain their daily needs. There are sweet
peas, Baguio beans, cabbage, carrots, eggplants and onions in the
organization's vegetable plantation.
	   For a capital of P50,000, each farmer can expect a return of
P700,000 a year from his plantation, depending on the crops,
Camiros said. In one season, a capital of P5,000 can even double to
at least P10,000 in estimated income.
	   Hot Deal Recently, Mag-Agda also signed an agreement with Nestle
Philippines to be one of the latter's supplier of robusta, arabica,
leverica and excelsa coffee beans. Camiros said Nestle has agreed
to extend a grant to Mag-Agda members in the form of seeds,
cellophane bags, fertilizer and chemical sprays for every coffee
plantation.
	   As part of the agreement, Nestle will buy the grilled coffee
produce at P45 per kilo to the Mag-Agda members. Camiros added that
they were targeting 100 hectares of coffee plantation a year.
	   Mag-Agda received a total of P720,000 loan from its provincial
government and was the first people's organization in Claveria to
avail of the loan.
	   The loan has been used to utilized certain projects with the
support of the NRMP.
	   NRMP is another DENR project supported through the US Agency for
International Development (USAID). NRMP is a government initiative
to implement the Philippine Strategy for sustainable development
and a 25-year Master plan for forestry development.

	   WHEN Victor Chin formally bade farewell to 15 years of old
shophouse paintings, it was not with the hysterical hoopla of
Seinfeld's last episode.
	   The end, marked by his Garden Pleasures exhibition, was
strangely unceremonious, even with the symbolic frangipani.
	   It was a startling, dramatic change: from watercolours and the
print versions of Straits Eclectic architectural facades of
buildings of Kuala Lumpur, Malacca, Penang and Singapore to, as the
exhibition title implies, flowers! There are heliconia, orchids,
hibiscus, pink and red lilies and the frangipani, of course.
Flowers and more flowers, including one even done on an ambitious
122x116cm scale in acrylic.
	   They are not rendered with the realistic forms of Khaw Sia with
a little bit of Chinese brushstroke influence or with the softer
delicate hues of Teh Siew Joo, nor with the underlying erotic
sensuality of Long Thien Shih or Georgia O'Keefe, or in luxuriant
overgrowth such as those by Aminah Abdul Rahman, Heng Eow Lin
(bougainvillea) and Calvin Chua (morning glory).
	   There are flowers in cutting semi-abstract geometric shapes in
acrylic; flowers in lively rendition in crayons reminiscent of
Rafiee Abdul Ghani's style; flowers in stark monochrome in pencil
and charcoal with its bold, black backdrops; and flowers in
watercolours with a palette of ``unnatural''
	   colours that play on the patterns and mood.
	   And these, from a crusader of architectural conservation with an
idealised oeuvre of quaint landmarks along Singapore's Boat Quay,
Penang's Lebuh Pantai, Malacca's Jalan Tun Tan Cheng Lock, and
Kuala Lumpur's Jalan Hang Kasturi.
	   Over 15 years, Chin has done a portfolio of 64 watercolours
together with the print versions. He started his offset-lithos
prints in 1980.
	   So, how is it like to quit doing paintings of shophouses that
are half a century old or close to a century old, paintings that
established his name and turned him into a media star of sorts?
What brought about the change?
	   ``After my last exhibition in 1994 (Isetan Gallery in Kuala
Lumpur, October-November), I decided I would not paint shophouses
anymore,'' said Chin, who brought the chapter to a close the next
year.
	   ``After 15 years of shophouses, it came to an end by itself. For
a long time, I thought shophouses were the only thing I knew.
	   ``I have been doing nothing else but one subject. It was a
difficult time hanging around at home and doing nothing much. I
want to continue to draw.
	   Then came the simple discovery, something homespun - my little
garden.
	   ``Flowers are the most immediate thing. For years, they are just
there, just next to me. Flower paintings were never my thing. I
thought they are not terribly serious.
	   ``They just came to me in a strange way over a length of time. I
started sketching and drawing,'' said Chin, who resolved various
aesthetic problems as he worked on them and described the learning
process as ``frightening, lonely and desperate.''
	   ``The only thing you have going for you is that doing it every
day gives you the confidence.''
	   Chin is not interested in copying his success. It was this
honesty with himself, his willingness to listen to his heart and a
determined effort to learn and re-learn the painting process that
he started concentrating on watercolours after his
photography-art-orientated Rupa Gallery at the Dayabumi complex in
Kuala Lumpur closed after eight years in 1989.
	   His drawings in pen and charcoal reveal harsh, raw strokes which
assume a rainbow blend in the crayons. In his watercolours, the
colours are vibrant, playing on the fluidity and natural
contrasting shades.
	   His acrylic works thrive on the spatial ambiguity by the
placement of colours, by the intensity and solidity.
	   These are more structured. Though the space looks ``flattened'',
the angular cuts overlapping angular cuts in fragmented forms exude
a hard- edged veneer in parts, more like architectural shapes than
the delicate forms they are universally known for.
	   This has to do with the way Chin works, where every process is
reasoned out and resolved. His preference for the clinical and
clean lines is obvious.
	   ``I prefer clear lines to fuzzy lines. I prefer very resolved
forms to unresolved forms,'' he said.
	   And what he said of his shophouse watercolours years ago is true
of his flower paintings too: ``I craft my pictures. I try to paint
with an economy of lines, shades and design.''
	   Though his flower paintings are by his own admission ``a second
wind'', to his career, he has not turned his back completely on
issues of architectural heritage.
	   He may not be painting them anymore, but he is writing a book on
his experiences in growing up in such shophouses.
	   He is also involved with the Malaysian Nature Society and was
the first president of the Friends of the Heritage Society (1985).
	   Chin also has a series of anti-war works entitled Paradox which
he unveiled in 1988.
	   They reflect on his earlier graphic art training at the Harrow
College of Art in England.
	   Works such as Going Nowhere, Mutual Suicide Pact, Accusation and
the T- shirt The Next War is MAD (Mutual-Assured-Destruction) use
symbolic signposts of arrows, hand-signs and rockets to launch the
message.
	   While his works, either on architectural heritage or war, could
not stop the destruction, they help to create greater awareness
about the environment and Man.
	   While his flower paintings are fixated on more painterly ``how
to''
	   concerns, they are not without the philosophical basis.
	   ``I look at flowers more as a landscape, as a portrait because I
am not copying a flower. The flowers also reflect contemporary
issues of life.
	   ``I see flowers like a cycle of four stages from bud to blossom
to bloom and to withering.
	   ``Not many artists paint withering flowers. We all like to look
at things at full bloom. Youth is the most cherished period but old
age is just as important.''
	   The works in Garden Pleasures are not for sale. The exhibition
ends at the Creative Centre annexe of the National Art Gallery on
June 17.
	   He will also give a talk entitled Matters Within The Frame on
June 13-14 (2-3pm).

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Tues. - Former Malayan Banking Berhad audit
division general manager Ahmad Fisal Abdul Rahman was ordered by
the magistrate's court today to enter his defence on June 25 on a
charge of molesting a female bank worker.
	   Magistrate Ahmad Zaidi Zainal said the prosecution had proved a
prima facie case against Ahmad Fisal, now the Mayban Securities Sdn
Bhd credit control and business development general manager.
	   Ahmad Zaidi made the decision after hearing submissions from
Deputy Public Prosecutor Fatnin Yusof and defence counsel K.
Murali.
	   Ahmad Fisal is alleged to have hugged and touched the woman's
breast in his former office on the 47th floor of Menara Maybank,
Jalan Tun Perak about 8.55am last Aug 4.
	   If found guilty, he faces up to 10 years jail, or a fine or
whipping, or any two of these punishments.

	   Government has proposed 13 development projects, mostly in the
infrastructure sector, worth some $900 million to be financed under
Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF).In a memorandum
to President Fidel Ramos, Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said
these projects, which were reviewed and discussed by both the
Japanese and Philippine governments, would be financed under the
22nd yen loan package.
	   Japan, the country's biggest source of official development
assistance, wanted the signing of this year's loan agreement held
before the end of Ramos' term this month.
	   Siazon explained this was because the OECF would merge with the
Japan Export-Import Bank on July 1, lessening the fund's financial
power and influence.
	   ``It is, therefore, highly desirable that the 22nd yen loan
package be signed before the merger,'' said Siazon.
	   Among the biggest projects that will be part of the loan package
are the Metro Manila strategic mass rail transit development line
two, N23,668 billion; domestic shipping modernization program,
N19,990 billion; Batangas port development, N14,555 billion:
Central Luzon irrigation, N14,136 billion; and the arterial road
links development, N13,564 billion.
	   Other projects in the list are the Metro Manila interchange,
selected airports development, metro Iligan regional infrastructure
development, Iloilo food control, Agno river flood control,
southern Mindanao integrated coastal zone management, fisheries
resource management and the local government units support credit
program.
	   Tokyo has expressed particular concern over the Central Luzon
irrigation project.
	   Based on Investment Coordination Committee estimates, the
project will cost some P2.6 billion.
	   However, the Japanese government, which estimated a cost of P3.8
billion, wanted the Philippines to accept the maximum rather than
the lower amount during the signing of loan agreement.
	   In view of the ``great efforts'' made by Japan in securing
bigger loans for the country, Siazon agreed with Tokyo's position
and asked the finance secretary to accept the proposal.

	   THE witch Medea is surely the most sympathetic of the terrible
females of Greek mythology. She began by deceiving her father and
murdering her brother, but only so that her lover Jason could steal
away with the Golden Fleece. Later she persuaded the daughters of
the usurper king of Iolchos to cut up their father and boil his
flesh in a cauldron, but this was to ensure that her husband Jason
would gain his rightful throne.
	   Finally she destroyed Princess Glauce on her wedding day with a
present of a poisoned robe and crown to prevent her from marrying
the deceiver Jason, and then murdered her own children by him to
punish him further for abandoning her. It is this last episode
which is the subject of Cherubini's opera, composed in 1797.
	   Maria Callas, by reputation the most temperamental of divas,
fittingly made Cherubini's heroine her greatest role.
	   She appears in the middle of Act I to ruin the wedding
festivities and is onstage for most of the rest of the opera. In
this 1957 recording, made four years after her debut in the role,
Callas' voice is occasionally wild, but her theatrical power is
stunning throughout. For 1 1/2 hours her Medea threatens, accuses,
pleads, cajoles, laments, feigns, curses, invokes, relents, and
finally exults over her enemies in a tour de force of dramatic and
vocal powers.
	   The other performers hardly count. Only Miriam Pirazzini as
Neris, the nurse and confidante of Medea, has a memorable long aria
with bassoon obbligato at the opera's exact halfway point,
promising faithfulness to her mistress lying exhausted before her
(the diva taking an onstage break before the ordeal of the second
half).
	   Accompanying them, Tullio Serafin's orchestra sounds its
primitive recording age, uncomfortably shrill, particularly in the
orchestral interludes. Cherubini's original Medee is a setting of a
French text intelligently adapted from the plays of Euripides,
Seneca, and Corneile by Francois-Benoit Hoffmann. Because it
combines singing and declaimed speech, and most singers are not
actors, it never became popular, and even in Lachner's fully
musical version demands a supreme soprano to make it a success.
	   Yet Beethoven and Brahms, rightly, thought very highly of it.
The music combines the spirit of the Sturm und Drang (Storm and
Stress) movement with the opera techniques of Rameau and Gluck. It
is hardly memorable melodically, it more than makes up for this by
a realistic vocal line undermined by a writhing, rumbling, and
frequently erupting orchestral accompaniment. No other opera I've
heard is more relentless, beginning agitatedly with Glauce's
nervousness over her approaching marriage to the final minute when
Medea burns down the temple.
	   Nuova Era's world premiere recording is of Patrick Fournillier's
live performance of Cherubini's original, 1797 score and text,
which he himself altered in later years. Its declaimed lines, in
quite effective alexandrines, match the arias, intensifying the
music as well as allowing Medea especially to rest her voice
frequently.
	   The conditions of a live performance result in an orchestral
sound as uncomfortably piercing as Serafin's in 1957, accompanied
throughout by the discreet noise of stage movements and audience
coughing. But Fournillier's Creon, Jean-Philippe Courtis, aided by
the spoken text, stands up bravely to Jano Tamar's Medee who, while
not as authoritative as Callas' (and which other Medea is likely to
be?), acquits herself magnificently in a still demanding role. The
performances all declaim very notably, though their Italian French
accents jar somewhat, and the offstage singing in Acts II and III
is always clearer than in the Callas version.
	   I am generally for original against revised versions of works,
but in this case I feel that the Lachner adaptation deserves to
continue in popularity, and not only because of Callas. If its
Italian translation and recitatives are weaker than Hoffmann's
text, its single tone - and Lachner's new music matches Cherubini's
in intensity - and the discreet cuts in the original's arias make
for a more immediate opera.
	   Indeed, both versions deserve to be regularly performed and
recorded.

	   Furniture makers in General Santos City, Mindanao are expected
to hike productivity this year after local artisans and members of
furniture manufacturing cooperatives went through a series of
training conducted by experts from the Forest Products Research and
Development Institute, an agency of the Department of Science and
Technology.
	   The continuing training and technical assistance kicked off with
a five-day furniture processing seminar designed for members of
GenSan Furniture Manufacturers Multipurpose Cooperative,
particularly those members classified as micro-cottage
entrepreneurs.
	   The group was under the auspices of Notre Dame, of Dadiangas
College's Notre Dame Business Resource Center Foundation, which
also got assistance from the Department of Trade and Industry
regional office.
	   FPRDI's technical participation - which came after a dialogue
between technical services chief Engr. Flex Moredo and NDBRCF
President Robert McGovern - included technology transfer in machine
and woodworks, wood drying and protection, joinery production,
waste utilization, planning and quality control.
	   FPRDI researchers are about to come up with three manuals
separately detailing advanced techniques and solutions on finishing
works for handicraft and furniture industries, especially those
made from rattan, bamboo, and buri midrib.
	   Health and safety procedures, waste management, and special
effects finishing tricks are also included.
	   A builder's manual for the construction of low-cost classrooms
using mainly the versatile woodwool cement bonded board explains
notes on design, site location, building orientation, construction
steps, materials handling, tools, manpower requirements and cost
estimates.
	   On the other hand, the botanical manual on Philippine mangrove
trees is a helpful guide in identifying local mangrove species for
foresters, environment specialists, and forestry students.

	   DEPUTY Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said managers of
unit trust funds have to continuously upgrade their capabilities
and maintain a high degree of professionalism.
	   He said the unit trust industry was important because it helped
mobilise funds from the public and addressed social disparities.
	   Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, said the Government would
strive to protect unit trust holders, whether it was a private or
Government-backed fund.
	   He added that it was important that the public had confidence in
the country's economic and financial system and that the Government
would take the necessary steps to turn the economy around.
	   ``I believe we can revive the economy. Those involved in this
business of trust, be prepared to take the right measures and make
necessary adjustments. With resilience, we shall overcome.''
	   Anwar was officiating the second annual Unit Trust Conference
and Exhibition organised by the Federation of Malaysian Unit Trust
Managers in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   He also launched the federation's new corporate logo and
website. Also present was Securities Commission chairman Datuk Dr
Mohd Munir Abdul Majid.
	   Anwar said although the unit trust industry had grown over the
last few years, it accounted for only 9.5 per cent of the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange's capitalisation.
	   ``It is too small compared with the unit trust industries in
other countries such as India where it accounts for 25 per cent of
market capitalisation while in Thailand it accounts for 15 per
cent.''
	   He said the industry could ensure the viability of the KLSE
through injection of liquidity, thus preventing the capital market
from being vulnerable to outflow of funds.
	   The decision to freeze the launch of Government-backed funds in
December last year was to allow existing funds to enhance their
performance as well as give space to the industry to grow.
	   Anwar also commended the federation for its effort to make
comprehensive information available to unitholders.
	   Meanwhile, Munir said unit trust managers must have proper
standards, practices and codes of conduct firmly in place.
	   ``Such standards and practices should go beyond regulatory
requirements to both promote and maintain unitholders' interest and
to safeguard the reputation of the entire industry.''
	   Munir said as at March 31, a total of 47.3 billion trust units
were issued, up 4.4 per cent from the end of last year.
	   There are 31 management companies with a total of 85 funds, he
said, adding that six more funds have been approved.

	   The Federation of Philippine Industries (FPI) and the Kilusan
Tungo sa Pambansang Tangkilikan are supporting a government order
to close down duty-free shops in Clark and Subic by the end of the
year.
	   In an executive order, President Fidel Ramos ordered that all
privately-owned duty-free shops in the two former US military bases
be closed down by Dec. 31, 1998.
	   FPI Chair Jesus Arranza said he has asked the Supreme Court to
immediately rule on a case filed by the Coconut Oil Refiners
Association, Philippine Association of Meat Processors Inc.,
Federation of Free Farmers, Bukluran ng Manggagawang Pilipino
questioning the President's order.
	   The final resolution of the case will determine whether
duty-free shops in Clark and Subic should be closed down.
	   After a series of hearings, the congressional oversight
committee submitted a report stating that the bases conversion law
did not intend to allow the establishment of duty-free shops that
can import finished products.
	   The law allows these firms to import only raw materials.
	   Local manufacturers have complained duty-free shops in the
country are being used to smuggle cheap imports into the country,
resulting in unfair competition and depriving government of taxes.
	   Arranza said the huge volume of smuggled goods passing through
duty-free shops had contributed to the growing trade deficit and
depreciation of the peso.
	   ``The existence of duty-free shops in Clark and Subic and in all
other economic zones is not only illegal but also immoral,'' he
said.

	   ASIAN currency traders have listened to the news of the yen's
fall with dread in their hearts. Economists and analysts are
predicting the end of the world as we know it for Asia and one look
at the tracking charts for the region's currencies and stock
markets is enough to send everyone running for cover. Most
economists say that the yen's decline has not only battered Asia's
recovery but is sounding alarm bells across the world.
	   Unless Japan comes up with a convincing programme to stimulate
its economy, Asia's emerging markets will suffer a further blow.
The yen's decline is a reflection of a weakening economy and Japan
may be unable to buy products from a troubled South Korea, Thailand
and Indonesia. Asian manufacturers may also have a harder time
competing against Japanese goods sold elsewhere, especially in the
US.
	   Lest we forget, every coin has two sides. A weaker yen will also
mean cheaper loans for many developing countries. As Japan is one
of the most aggressive countries in terms of overseas development
assistance (ODA), servicing loans will be less onerous for many.
Malaysia was the seventh largest recipient of ODA loans under the
Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF), with loans
amounting to US$9.4 billion (US$1  &QC;  RM3.94) last year. Since March
1961, Japan has disbursed 15.805 trillion yen (100 yen  &QC;  RM2.83) to
85 countries. As one of the main recipients, Malaysia will benefit
from a weaker yen, especially with regards to cheaper Japanese
goods as well as components and parts for development projects.
	   The day after the yen broke through its seven-year low against
the US dollar, the Tokyo stock market celebrated. Yesterday,
trading pushed up the 225-share Nikkei average index by 235.46
points or 1.54 per cent to close at 15,530.17 yesterday. As
investors began to rake in the the profits, buyers, especially
foreigners, stormed the market in anticipation of some easy gains.
As the depreciating yen makes Japanese products less expensive
abroad, Asia must position itself to reap these benefits.
	   However, there is a possibility that a much weaker yen will
force Japan to cut down on its loans and financial assistance to
some countries. If this happens, developing countries will be left
with no choice but to accept the US dollar ODA package. With their
own currencies in a limbo, these economies must brace themselves
for a more difficult future.
	   The greenback's gain over the yen has many disadvantages. The
impact was highlighted last Sunday in a report by the Bank for
International Settlements, which coordinates the activities of the
world's central banks. The dollar, according to the bank, was
overvalued by 33 per cent against the yen and 21 per cent against
the mark. This doesn't look good as it makes American exports less
competitive and increases the likelihood of the US trade deficit
growing further. The dollar rose as high as 141.79 yen, its
strongest since June 19 1991, when it traded at 141.20 yen. It was
at 1.7786 marks, up from from 1.7751 marks amid concerns that
Russia's financial troubles will hurt Germany.
	   The weaker yen makes Japanese exports cheaper and more
competitive, while increasing the price of Asian imports to Japan.
However, the international community should realise that a plunge
in the yen will create problems not only for the Japanese economy
but also for Asia, the US and Europe. If the yen depreciates,
Japanese companies operating in Malaysia will see their income in
ringgit fall even if they maintain the same export volume. Japan
must therefore make some major moves to prevent the yen from
depreciating further. There is not much that the G-7 can do for the
yen without the Japanese Government providing support policies.
	   Even a surprising round of central bank intervention measures to
support the yen will only have a temporary impact if Japan's
policies are not changed. However, such measures, although
successful, may only serve to divert attention from the real cause
of the problem: the frail and finicky global system that allows
currencies to be so volatile. Half measures will no longer suffice.
It is time for the world to arrest the rot before the entire
financial system collapses.

	   SHARE prices closed 1.5 per cent higher yesterday mostly
benefiting from buying of export-related issues on the yen's
weakness, brokers said.
	   ``Sony and other consumer electricals were bought due to the
recent weakness of the yen,'' a broker at Orix Securities said.
	   The key Nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange gained 235.46 points to end the day at 15,530.17.
The Topix index of all issues on the first section rose 10.32
points at 1,208.68.
	   Turnover was subdued on volume estimated at 310 million shares,
compared with 251.3 million shares the day before.
	   Late buying of the futures contract pushed prices higher after
limited profit taking was seen in the afternoon session, brokers
said.
	   The market managed to absorb selling in leading banks after the
Long- Term Credit Bank plunged on rumour of cancelling a tie-up
with SBC Warburg Securities, a brokerage arm of Swiss Bank Corp,
brokers said.
	   LTCB closed 7.7 per cent lower, but rebounded strongly in the
afternoon after the bank dismissed the rumour in a statement and
news conference.
	   The stock lost 14.4 per cent in the morning. It ended down 14
yen at 167.
	   Public funds also supported the key Nikkei index.
	   ``There was modest buying from public funds towards the morning
close,''
	   the Orix broker said.
	   ``But overall, public fund buying was sporadic.''
	   Most exporters finished higher, with Sony up 250 yen at 11,670,
Aiwa up 120 at 4,300 and Sharp ahead 58 at 1,098.

	   Local marine scientists have successfully rehabilitated the rare
and exquisite-tasting angel wing clam, a bivalve known in Western
Visayas as diwal, which was previously feared to be on the brink of
extinction, the Philippine Council for Aquatic and Marine Research
and Development said.
	   Diwal is ``one of the most-sought and expensive marine food in
the country.''
	   Strong demand, coupled with deterioration of its natural habitat
over the years, pushed its population down to alarming levels.
	   But a joint research made by marine experts at the University of
the Philippines-Visayas in Miag-ao, Iloilo campus and in Nova
Pacific Research Institute yielded crucial information on diwal's
reproduction process including embryo formation and larval
development.
	   By understanding its reproduction process, the experts scored a
breakthrough when they achieved mass production of diwal in
hatcheries that served as laboratories.
	   Now the experts have developed an A to Z method for larval
spawning and rearing adapted to diwal's natural environment and
experts hope to conduct additional field research in Roxas City,
San Dionisio town in Iloilo, and another still undisclosed site in
Negros Occidental.
	   On Tilapia Meanwhile, an information manual in the development
of the so-called YY technology or the production of genetically
male tilapia (GMT) is now off the press, the Central Luzon State
University announced.
	   The 67-page manual details tilapia's biology, problems on early
sexual maturity and the development of YY technology and its
proposed dissemination strategies in the Philippines.
	   Tilapia farm operators and interested entrepreneurs will surely
benefit from the manual's section on culture performance of GMT in
intensive hatchery production systems, and extensive to
semi-intensive pond production.
	   The manual was co-authored by Dr. Tereso Abella of CLSU and Dr.
Graham Mair of the University of Wales Swansea in the UK.

	   TENAGA Nasional Bhd is poised to become a substantial
shareholder in Malakoff Bhd under a share swap exercise.
	   In a memorandum of understanding signed yesterday, Tenaga
Nasional has proposed to inject its entire stake in wholly-owned
subsidiary TNB Janamanjung Sdn Bhd into Malakoff.
	   The MoU will also see Tenaga Nasional injecting its 20 per cent
stake in Segari Energy Ventures Sdn Bhd into Malakoff, which
already holds a 75 per cent stake in it.
	   This will see the issue of new Malakoff shares to Tenaga
Nasional - with details of quantum and price to be finalised later.
	   Tenaga Nasional is finally expected to have at least a 20 per
cent stake in Malakoff.
	   Tenaga Nasional executive chairman Datuk Dr Tajuddin Ali
yesterday said in Kuala Lumpur that Malakoff was chosen for the
exercise as it was ``...
	   the best selection for the benefit of the company (Tenaga
Nasional), shareholders and country.
	   ``We have considered several options to ensure that the project
can be implemented and does not burden us in view of our current
financial position.''
	   The MoU is expected to be concluded within two months.
	   TNB Janamanjung is now building a 2,100MW coal-fired power plant
in Manjung, Perak, costing about RM6.9 billion.
	   The Manjung power plant is being built on 245ha of the 320ha of
reclaimed land in Teluk Penchalang about 10km south of Lumut in
Perak.
	   Of the 245ha, 70ha is for the power plant and 175ha for the ash
pond.
	   The remaining area will be used as port facilities, coal stock
piles and common access road.
	   The power plant will be based on three units of 700MW each. The
first unit is due for commercial operation in July, 2001.
Successive units are expected to come onstream at six-month
intervals.
	   On why Tenaga Nasional decided to dispose of its interest in
IPPs, Tajuddin said it was inconsistent with the utility's present
direction.
	   ``TNB Janamanjung was set up in early 1997 ... before my time
... It's not inconsistent with our future moves. It is the right
time for us to not be directly involved in the power generation
business.
	   Nevertheless, he described the disposal as ``something
consistent with the restructuring of the (energy and
telecommunications) industry.''
	   In a statement issued on behalf of Tenaga Nasional and Malakoff,
Commerce International Merchant Bankers Bhd said the proposal was
expected to provide long-term benefits to Tenaga Nasional.
	   Malakoff's Segari Energy owns a power plant in Lumut capable of
generating 1,303MW of electricity. Malakoff also has a 20 per cent
stake in Port Dickson Power Bhd, another IPP.
	   Malakoff is also acquiring from Malaysian Resources Corporation
Bhd the entire stake in Teknik Janakuasa Sdn Bhd - operator of the
Segari Energy Lumut plant - via another share swap.
	   MRCB is a substantial shareholder in Malakoff, and UK-based
National Power plc will acquire a 15 per cent stake in Malakoff -
based on the enlarged capital after the acquisition of Teknik
Janakuasa is completed.

	   THE Culture, Arts and Tourism Ministry has yet to receive any
reports on retrenchment in the hotel industry, its minister Datuk
Sabbaruddin Chik said.
	   He said hotel occupancy nationwide currently is still at 70 per
cent and this indicates that there are still ample career
opportunities in the industry.
	   ``With this high rate of hotel occupancy there is no reason for
hotel managements to retrench workers in this sector,'' he told
reporters after witnessing the Memorandum of Agreement between HRR
Travel-Trade Management Services Sdn Bhd and Wigan &AMP; Leigh College
of the UK in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   The agreement signals the partnership between both organisations
for the provision of education and training in the hospitality and
tourism sector.
	   He pointed out that the hotel industry has slightly better
prospects this year compared with 1997 and the ministry forecasts
an increase in visitors due to the ringgit's depreciation, which
gives Malaysia a competitive edge, and the forthcoming Kuala Lumpur
Games '98.
	   Last year, he noted that 6.2 million tourists visited the
country, a 13- per cent drop compared with 1996, when the country
had 7.1 million visitors.
	   The ministry has revised its forecast for this year and expects
6.8 million tourists.
	   Sabbaruddin said the agreement between HRR Travel-Trade
Management Services and Weigh &AMP; Leigh College also indicates a
favourable outlook for the hospitality and tourism industry.
	   ``If prospects for the hospitality and tourism industry are
unfavourable fewer institutions will be offering such courses but
as a matter of fact there are more doing so,'' he said, adding that
students will not enrol for courses if job opportunities are not
promising.
	   So far, he said, the ministry has granted licences to 35
institutions to conduct training for the hospitality and tourism
industry and all of these institutions comply with National
Occupational Skill Standards requirements.
	   These requirements, he said, are in line with the Tourism
Industry Act 1992 under which all tourism training institutions
that provide ``multi skills'' courses have to be licenced.
	   The minister admitted that currently institutions which offer
multi skills courses in tourism are still insufficient and the
Government encourages the setting up of more such institutions.
	   At present, he said, there are about 130,000 employees working
in hotels in the country but the industry still lacks trained
personnel as not all hospitality and tourism graduates are absorbed
by the hotel sector.
	   Meanwhile, in Subang Jaya yesterday, Sabbaruddin also advised
hotels in the country to eliminate the ``double plus sign'' for
their room tariffs for the convenience of their guests.
	   Hotels should instead display a ``nett'' pricing for their room
rates, he told reporters after launching Faber Hotels Industry
Holdings Sdn Bhd's Malaysia Bagus Luxury Holidays packages.
	   ``If, for example, the rate is at RM100++, this means that
customers will have to pay RM115, which is inclusive of the RM10
for the 10 per cent service charge and RM5 for the 5 per cent
government tax.
	   ``Instead of displaying RM100++, hotels should instead fix the
pricing at RM115 from the beginnning,'' he said.
	   The ministry, he added had long suggested that hotels eliminate
the ``double plus sign'' pricing, but most were reluctant to take
up the proposal.
	   However, the Malaysian Hotel Association had at the end of last
month assured the ministry that all its member hotels will display
the nett pricing by October.
	   Sabbaruddin said the ministry does not intend to enforce the
proposal but leaves it to the hotels to consider the matter.

	   THE Dow Jones index of leading industrial stocks was up slightly
on Monday, as bank, pharmaceutical and technology stocks stood
firm.
	   The Dow was up 31.89 points (0.35 per cent) closing at 9,069.59.
About 538 million shares traded hands with 1,670 gainers, 1,301

	   Passenger car sales fell 49% in the first five months of the
year to 17,146 units when measured against last year's record.
	   For the month of May alone, car sales slipped 55.3% to 2,951
units compared with the year-ago 6,603.
	   Rising car prices due to the weak peso discouraged sales, the
Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines Inc. said in
a report yesterday.
	   The industry group said higher down-payment requirements and
financing charges, and the slow and selective approval of financing
applications also led to poor turnover.
	   ``Passenger car sales continue to be adversely affected by
increased selling prices resulting from...the devaluation of the
peso,'' Campi said.
	   Mitsubishi Motor Philippines Corp., a unit of Mitsubishi Motors
Corp., sold the highest number of cars at 8,840 units during the
five-month period.
	   It was followed by Toyota Motor Philippines Corp., a unit of
Toyota Motor Co., which sold 6,927 units and Honda Cars Philippines
Inc., a unit of Honda Motor Co. Ltd., which sold 5,746 units.

	   THE RM4.5 billion engineering, procurement and construction
contract for the 2,100 megawatt power plant in Manjung, Perak has
been awarded to Anglo-French firm GEC Alsthom and consortium
partner Peremba Construction Sdn Bhd.
	   The power plant, valued at RM6.9 billion, is owned by Tenaga
Nasional Bhd's wholly-owned TNB Janamanjung Sdn Bhd. It will be
ready for commercial operations in mid-2001.
	   Funding for the RM4.5 billion EPC contract will come from export
credit agencies from the United Kingdom and France, GEC Alsthom
Power Plant Ltd managing director of power generation division Nick
Salmon said yesterday.
	   GEC Alsthom, which takes the technical and commercial lead for
the consortium, will be supplying the main mechanical plant
including turbines, generators and boilers.
	   Peremba Construction will carry out the construction and civil
works as well as provide the main electrical equipment.
	   ``We will ensure that local contractors would participate in at
least 40 per cent of the sub-contract works under the EPC
contract,'' said Salmon after receiving the EPC contract from
Energy, Telecommunications and Posts Minister Datuk Leo Moggie in
Shah Alam.
	   Moggie had earlier witnessed the signing of a power purchase
agreement between Tenaga Nasional Bhd and TNB Janamanjung Sdn Bhd
and presented the licence to TNB Janamanjung to generate power from
the plant.
	   TNB Janamanjung has been given a 25-year concession to generate
power from the Manjung plant. The power is sold to Tenaga Nasional
at 11.95 sen per kilo-watt hour.
	   Moggie said, in order to improve the country's competitiveness,
the energy supply system and services would have to be continuously
upgraded in terms of capacity, reliability and efficiency.
	   Noting that the country needed a generation capacity of 11,500MW
from the current maximum demand of 8,500MW to satisfy the expected
growth, he said that it was imperative to see a nominal reserve
margin of 30 per cent maintained against the backdrop of the
increasing demand.

	   With its historical relics undamaged by two world wars and
classical chamber music played live on shopping boulevards, Vienna
exceeded my wife Nina's expectations. She also experienced a number
of ``firsts'' such as hotel signs, which urged guests not to use
towels to preserve the environment against the ill effect of soap
chemicals.
	   In my case, the trip to Austria opened my eyes to Graz, a city
about 300 kilometers southeast of Vienna. As our train approached
Graz, the profile of the countryside grew in beauty...green hills
with tree farms cultured for pulp and grass meadows freshly trimmed
for animal feed.
	   Graz has its share of tourist sights. But to me Graz stands out
as a model of a successful dispersal program, an undertaking where
our own Board of Investments has so far failed to produce results.
With the development of industrial communities in the outskirts,
people are moving out of Graz. Of course, commercial establishments
in the city complain about decreasing business opportunities and
revenues. But the people of Graz are really benefiting from the
comfort of uncrowded facilities and traffic-free streets.
	   Peter Rosenkranz, a native of Graz and married to Nina's
ex-classmate Dely, however, now complains about German incursions
into the business scene.
	   German hardware stores, for instance, are coming in with a full
range of lower priced goods, specifically Chinese-sourced products.
Peter finds himself no longer competitive with wooden specialty
doors, which he imports from the Philippines.
	   Peter has decided to retire in the Philippines. But he will
certainly retain Graz as a vacation haven.

	   WE LIVE in a country with good laws and generally law abiding
citizens. A good legal system is not only necessary to create a
stable society but also to protect and safeguard the individual's
rights.
	   However, laws sometimes have braoder and wider objectives beyond
merely regulating the conduct of individuals within a country or
providing boundaries for action.
	   A very early example of this broader objective may be seen in
Land Law.
	   At a time when Malaysia was not yet independent and needed to be
developed, there was a need to attract people who would invest and
help in the development of the country.
	   Land was cheap - at least by present day standards - and long
leases were offered. It may still be possible to come across leases
of 999 years in some parts of the country although one sees less
and less of such examples nowadays.
	   It was also common to alienate land on what was commonly called
a ``freehold'' basis but what is in our own context more
appropriately termed ``grant in perpetuity''. Similarly, the
changing of hands of land may be discouraged by placing
restrictions or imposing taxes.
	   However, the power to make such laws and the eventual enactment
of laws and regulations as well as the formulation of policies, are
tools which can be used to achieve certain desired objectives.
	   Thus in more recent times, such restrictions, especially with
regards to the purchase and sale of land by foreigners, have been
used to protect the local population. Foreigners may therefore only
buy properties of a certain value.
	   This has been achieved by means of incorporating specific
provisions in the National Land Code as well as requiring such
purchases to be approved by the Foreign Investment Commitee which
has its own guildelines for this purpose.
	   While foreigners are generally blamed for causing prices of
landed property to soar and making houses unaffordable for most of
the local population, this may not be unwelcome from the view of
the construction indsutry.
	   However, when such effects become widespread, there are likely
to be social and political repercussions. In this event, some
restraints are inevitable. In Malaysia, various restraints have
been imposed, setting out the price range of what may be purchased
alongside heavy ``levies'' on purchases by foreigners.
	   However, the fact remains that on occassion, the presence of
foreigners as purchasers of property, can be beneficial to the
local economic climate. This is especially so in times of economic
turmoil.
	   When an economic slowdown occurs, a country becomes more
concessionary to foreigners and makes available a broader range of
landed properties for them to buy. Levies may also be abolished in
the hope of attracting foreign investment.
	   While such swings and changes are not likely to enhance our
credibility with genuine long term investors, they may also not
serve our own expectations.
	   It was recently reported that the delay by the Foreign
Investment Committee in approving applications by foreigners
wishing to purchase houses costing more than RM250,000 has earned
the wrath of the Housing and Local Government Ministry.
	   This occurence is difficult to understand since the Government
had decided that houses above a certain value can be purchased by
foreigners.
	   Why should the agencies that have been given the task of
granting approvals be so slow in acting?
	   There seems to be an attitude amomgst some authorities granting
approvals that they may do so at their whim and fancy. They forget
that such departments and authorities are there to serve the people
in order that transactions may take place smoothly for the general
good of the country.
	   It would be beneficial to the country if the authorities could
provide definite guidelines and criteria for obtaining approvals in
respect of a particular transaction or category of transactions.
Where such criteria is met approval should follow as a matter of
course.
	   If this is done, then those who enter into transactions can
consider the criteria at the outset. In this manner, much time will
saved and productivity enhanced. Of course, this assumes that the
criteria are made known.
	   On the converse, exercising discretion without clear and
detailed guidelines can lead to abuse. Clearly detailed criteria
will help lessen any dissatisfaction and add to the general
credibility of any system.

	   THE British Malaysian Industry and Trade Association (BMITA) and
the Public Services Department (PSD) announced yesterday their 12th
joint training programme for Malaysian government servants.
	   The programme offers a lengthy attachment as well as training
for Malaysian civil servants in British companies, which enables
them to gain genuine work experience in the private sector and to
complete commercial projects during the programme.
	   BMITA's chairman Mr Tim O'Brien said 11 senior government
officers will participate in the 1998 programme, which lasts for
six months and includes 18 weeks' attachment together with
management courses and the completion of commercial projects.
	   ``The programme begins on June 15 with two weeks' pre-attachment
training at the National Institute of Public Administration
(Intan),'' O'Brien said at a press conference in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Participating companies sponsoring a candidate each will be
Malaysian Tobacco Company Bhd, HongKong Bank Malaysia Bhd, ICI
Paints Malaysia Sdn Bhd, Teamwork Corp Sdn Bhd, Standard Chartered
Bank Malaysia Berhad, Rothmans of Pall Mall (M) Sdn Bhd, BP
Malaysia Sdn Bhd, Unilever Malaysia, British Airways and Commercial
Union.
	   Glaxo Wellcome and Malayan Cement will take two candidates each.
	   ``The programme will be funded by British interests, including a
contribution from the British Government. In the light of the
recent economic downturn, all elements of the programme will be
undertaken in Malaysia,'' he said.
	   He said the programme provides an opportunity for senior
government officers to experience the dynamics of modern day
business management systems.
	   ``The initiative reflects the emphasis placed on government and
business interests working together effectively to ensure the
continued, rapid development of Malaysia,'' he added.
	   This year's BMITA-JPA Management Development Programme will be
launched by Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister's Department
Datuk Fauzi Abdul Rahman on June 15.
	   The programme is linked with the ``Britain in Malaysia - Just
Between Friends'' initiative.
	   The first BMITA Management Training Programme was launched in
1983 with an attachment of 20 participants for a period of one
year.
	   Such training programmes have so far benefitted more than 160
government officiers from various departments and ministries.
	   BMITA was formed in 1963. It is an organisation made up or more
than 200 companies and individuals who are involved in trade
between Malaysia and Britain, British equity investments in
Malaysia and the provision of services in Malaysia through joint
ventures.
	   The primary objective of BMITA is to promote and foster
bilateral trade, services and investment between Malaysia and
Britain and to maintain and improve commercial and official
relationships between the two countries.

	   Tom Brokaw reported in his NBC newscast yesterday that Honda was
fined $70 million for dismantling anti-pollution devices in two
million of its cars that were sold in the US. We can only surmise
that the devices were removed to improve profitability. In any
event, $70 million is a hefty sum and surely Honda will have
learned its lesson, painfully.
	   I can only wonder what kind of anti-pollution devices are
required of vehicles sold in the Philippines. For one thing, new
vehicles are not even equipped with catalytic converters that are
used for unleaded fuel. In other words, using unleaded gasoline in
this country does not serve any anti-pollution purpose whatsoever.
In fact, if enough vehicles use unleaded gasoline without catalytic
converters, the resulting pollution will be even worse than that
emitted by leaded fuel.
	   Definitely A Priority Pollution from fuel emissions is killing
Metro Manilans. So cleaning up MM's air should definitely be a
priority because it involves the health of over 10 million
Filipinos. That is just about 20% of the population. What can be
more important than that?

	   THE local unit trust industry continued to grow despite the
economic problems with increasing number of units in circulation,
the Securities Commission (SC) said yesterday.
	   As at March 31 1998, 47.3 billion units were in issue, up 4.4
per cent from the end of 1997 and up 21.3 per cent from the end of
1996, SC chairman Datuk Dr Mohd Munir Abdul Majid said in his
address at the second annual unit trust conference and exhibition
held in Kuala Lumpur.
	   The industry itself was valued at about RM43 billion, accounting
for 9.5 per cent of the market capitalisation of the Kuala Lumpur
Stock Exchange.
	   There were 31 management companies in operation, with a total of
85 funds under management and six more funds approved but not yet
launched, said Munir.
	   ``Notwithstanding the growth however, the industry still has a
lot more promise, if indications and the experience in more
developed markets are anything to go by,'' he said.
	   He said that the development of unit trust funds would bring
about greater institutionalisation of the domestic market, and also
contribute to the efficiency, stability, breadth and depth of the
Malaysian securities market.
	   Munir also stressed that unit trust participants, particularly
management companies, needed to have proper standards, practices
and codes of conduct firmly in place.
	   Such standards and practices should be sufficiently detailed and
scrupulously observed, he stressed.
	   Touching on disclosure-based regulations, Munir said management
companies must come to terms with their duty to disclose all
information fully and in a timely manner in the prospectus, annual
and interim reports and other documents of a unit trust fund.
	   Meanwhile, Abdul Azim Mohd Zabidi, president of the Federation
of Malaysian Unit Trust Managers (FMUTM) in his welcome address,
warned that the impending liberalisation of the financial markets
under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, ``if done too quickly,
may result in the demise of a number of local players''.
	   Suggesting a number of steps to be taken before liberalisation,
Azim called for emphasis on what he called `intra-liberalisation'.
	   ``... We should encourage local unit trust management companies
to take a more active role in the regional, if not international
markets,'' he said.
	   Furthermore, local companies should strongly consider merging
amongst themselves so that the pooling of their resources will
place them in a better position to be more resilient and
competitive in the global market place, added Azim.
	   The local unit trust industry, Abdul Azim said, still has room
for enhancing professionalism, and in this light, FMUTM now
requires employees of unit trust management companies involved in
the marketing of unit trust products to register with the
federation.
	   This comes on the back of commencing the provisional
registration of all tied agents two years ago. As at the end of
May, the federation had 14,963 tied-agents from 14 unit trust
management companies registered.
	   Further move to inject professionalism in the industry include
requiring tied agents to sit for examinations conducted by the
FMUTM and commencing talks with the Mara Institute of Technology
(ITM) and the Securities Institutes of the UK and Australia to
develop relevant courses and to guide the federation in
establishing its own institute.

Kasparov and Topalov to battle assisted by computers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEON, Spain (AP) _ World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov of Russia
and Bulgarian Grand Master Veselin Topalov claimed one win each on
Wednesday in the first two matches of their experimental tournament
that permits constant consultation with computers.
	   The six-game competition held in this northern Spanish city has
been dubbed as the ``chess of the future'' by the players who sat
beside Chessmaster 5500 program, designed by the U.S. company
Mindscape.
	   The seating had to be rearranged before the competition began
when the Bulgarian said he could see Kasparov's screen.
	   Topalov appeared less at ease at the start, consulting the
computer more frequently than his Russian opponent before he
settled down to win the first game with the white pieces. He lost
the second with the black.
	   Each player was allowed a maximum 60 minutes to make their
moves, adding extra pressure to the human-computer dynamic. Normal
competition games that can sometimes stretch on for hours or even
days.
	   The next two matches in the groundbreaking challenge that seeks
to eliminate human error while retaining human imagination and
creativity were scheduled for Thursday.
	   No title is at stake but the winner will earn dlrs 6,600 and the
loser dlrs 3,000.
	   Without computers, Topalov, 23, the world's No. 4, has defeated
Kasparov twice and lost six of the 15 games they have played. The
remainder were draws.
	   Over the last quarter of a century computers, despite being
barred from professional competitions, have come to dominate the
chess world. Modern programs, many of them designed under
Kasparov's guidance, have proved themselves capable of beating most
humans, including Kasparov himself.

	   PORT DICKSON, Tues. - More than 60 families living near a power
plant in Tanjong Gemuk are at their wits' end over endless woes
allegedly caused by noise and vibration from its turbines.
	   Taman NLFCS Residents' Association committee chairman S. Gabriel
claimed that despite numerous appeals to the authorities on the
matter, no action had been taken and lately the situation had
worsened.
	   ``About three weeks ago, large cracks began appearing on the
road in front of our houses and the IPP's (independent power
producer's) perimeter fencing which we believe could have been
caused by vibration from the plant.''
	   He said some of the cracks were more than half a metre deep and
this caused fears that the road might soon collapse.
	   ``Now, we not only have to live with the noise and vibration but
also the damaged road.''
	   He said the residents moved into the two rows of 60 terrace
houses in 1992 while the plant, which began operating with a single
turbine, was set up in 1994.
	   ``Since 1995, the plant had been operating three turbines,
causing our plight to worsen,'' he said, adding that the turbines
were on from 8.30am to 8pm.
	   Gabriel said the vibration had also caused cracks on the walls
of some houses.
	   ``Despite numerous complaints to the authorities, no action has
been taken and now with cracks appearing on the road, we are really
worried for our safety.''
	   According to him, experts from the Department of Environment and
Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia visited the area recently.
	   He said they had conducted tests at the place but to date
nothing had been done to solve their problems.
	   An official of the State DOE confirmed that tests had been
conducted and said a report had been submitted to the Menteri
Besar's office for further action.
	   The New Straits Times had highlighted the problem faced by the
residents in October 1996.
	   Former Port Dickson Power managing director/chief executive
officer Lt Kdr (R) Mohd Ismail Che Mat Din had replied then that
the noise and vibration were well within the limits set by the DOE.
	   He had said three independent tests carried out showed the noise
level to be not more than 60 decibels.
	   ``Each time we conduct the test, the plant will have to run the
turbines, costing us up to RM200,000,'' he had said, adding that
the plant was built after approvals were obtained from the
authorities.
	   Its Environmental Impact Assessment report had been approved by
the DOE.
	   He had said if the residents were still not satisfied with
measures taken by the company and the authorities, they could
appoint their own independent consultant to conduct tests at the
place.
	   ``If the independent tests showed that the plant did not breach
the limit, the residents must pay the costs.''

	   Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Gabriel C. Singson
confirmed yesterday that banks with cashflow problems were
subjected to close monitoring every year.
	   ``Every year we have banks under close supervision,'' he said,
adding that there was nothing ``abnormal'' about putting illiquid
banks under stringent surveillance as this was in line with BSP's
functions.
	   Singson was reacting to a newspaper report (not The Business
Daily) that 17 financially-troubled banks were under tight
surveillance. The report came amid BSP's decision to close down
Commonwealth Savings Bank.
	   Commonwealth Savings Bank has been in the red for the past three
years due to a high nuber of past due loans. The bank's situation
worsened after its parent company Eyco Group had been declared
insolvent by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
	   ``It is not unusual since we close down small banks every
year,'' he said.
	   He stressed, however, that no more banks would be shut down this
year.
	   BSP Deputy Governor for Bank Supervision and Services Alberto V.
Reyes, however, denied the existence of a ''watchlist'' of troubled
banks.
	   ``It is fiction. There are no commercial, thrift, and rural
banks which are insolvent. The system is entirely healthy,'' he
said.
	   According to Reyes, central monetary authorities have been
religiously checking banks' foreign exchange position, level of
exposure to real estate, and consumer loans.
	   ``We have not been monitoring the banks supposed to have been
included in the list. But since July 1997, we have been monitoring
all banks' foreign currency transactions; their exposure to auto
and salary loans; and we are daily tallying the interest rates
charged by banks,'' Reyes said.
	   The BSP said the practice was meant to ensure compliance with
banking rules and regulations.
	   Reyes also said BSP was willing to give incentives to banks
which resort to mergers to gain viability.
	   Reyes said the perks would benefit both foreign and local banks.
``Such a move is being considered. It will be endorsed to the
Monetary Board as soon as the banks submit their proposals,'' he
said.
	   Reyes said the policy-making Monetary Board would review the
specific petitions of the industry's major organizations such as
the Bankers Association of the Philippines, the Chamber of Thrift
Banks, and the Rural Bankers Association of the Philippines.
	   One incentive would be to give a bank with excessive past-due
levels access to BSP's rediscounting window provided it merges with
another bank.
	   Reyes also said bank-owned properties appraised by
duly-designated assessors would be treated as capital.
	   ``The appraised fair market value should be evaluated by an
independent appraiser approved by the central bank,'' Reyes
explained.
	   The measures are on top of the current benefits allowed by BSP,
namely: extension of the 20% individual and 30% corporate ceilings
on bank ownership, and allowing banks to have more than 11
directors.
	   Under the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Program (MEFP)
between government and the International Monetary Fund, the BSP is
enjoined to come up with measures to protect local banks from the
effects of economic crises.
	   Banking reforms include raising banks' minimum capitalization,
``dealing expeditiously'' with troubled banks; and loan-loss
provisioning to serve as a safety net in case of loan defaults.
	   Meanwhile, Senator Juan M. Flavier yesterday asked Singson to
sack bank examiners who failed to detect huge loan exposures of
several small banks which have been closed or are facing
insolvency.
	   Flavier said huge cash outflow in the form of directors,
officers, stockholders and related interest (Dosri) loans and not
the currency crisis was to blame for the thrift banks' financial
woes.
	   ``The BSP, through bank examiners, is supposed to detect Dosri
loans to safeguard the money of depositors. We had several events
in the past and we should learn from them. Why did it happen again
this time? The loss of money of small time depositors should be
stopped,'' the senator stated.
	   Flavier pointed out that a bank could not hide a high Dosri
level without the connivance of bank examiners.
	   Orient Commercial Bank, Richmond Bank, and Mindanao Development
Bank are reportedly facing closure procedures as they have been on
extended bank holidays.
	   He also said he intended to file a bill that would require the
Philippine Deposit Insurance Corp. (PDIC) to increase the coverage
amount for deposits from the current P100,000 to P500,000.
	   ``The PDIC charter should be amended to increase the amount for
which deposit are covered by insurance because times have changed
and the value of the peso has gone down,'' Flavier maintained.
	   PDIC's charter was last amended in 1992 when Republic Act 7400
increased the maximum insurance coverage to P100,000 from the
previous figure of P50,000.
	   PDIC acts as receiver of banks ordered closed by the BSP. Its
functions include gathering, controlling, and taking charge of
assets and liabilities of banks that have been declared insolvent
by government.

	   POPULAR HANDICRAFT ... These miniature baskets made from rattan
and bamboo, locally known as wakid, are becoming increasingly
popular among local and foreign tourists.
	   Rozie Haibir, 23, of Kampung Likas, can vouch for this as many
tourists stop at her stall at the handicraft market in Kota

	   She said the baskets were made by her aunts in Kota Belud and

	   They are priced between RM15 and RM100, depending on the size.

Saddam orders biggest diplomatic reshuffle since Gulf War
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has ordered
at least 10 ambassadors, including his half brother, to return to
Baghdad in his biggest diplomatic reshuffle since the Gulf War,
Iraqi diplomats said Wednesday.
	   Instructions sent to the embassies gave no reason for the move,
said the diplomats, speaking from several Middle Eastern embassies.
They said new ambassadors have been named to fill the vacancies.
	   The diplomats who were recalled include Saddam's half brother,
Barzan al-Tikriti, who was Iraq's representative to the U.N offices
in Geneva.
	   The Iraqi ambassadors to Yemen, Algeria, India, Tunisia,
Pakistan, Jordan, and the Cairo-based Arab League were also
recalled, said the diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The envoy to the Arab League, Nabil Najim, is a close associate
to Saddam and a member of his Tikriti clan. He is expected to be
named an undersecretary in the Foreign Ministry, the diplomats
said.
	   Some 30 junior diplomats also were transferred to the Foreign
Ministry in Baghdad, they said.
	   Most of the ambassadors have been in their post for more than
eight years. Iraq routinely rotates its envoys every four years.
	   Several Iraqi ambassadors defected to the West after they were
moved from their post in the past few years. The last was Majid
al-Samarra'i, the ambassador to Bulgaria. He defected to Britain
last year.

	   THE Malaysian rubber prices ended lower yesterday after a quiet
session on lack of demands.
	   At the close, June International RSS One dropped four sen to
278.0 sen per kg while the SMR 20 shed 3.5 sen to 267 sen per kg.
	   ``There is not much activity today as buyers seem to be not in a
hurry to buy,'' a dealer said.
	   He said the buyers may be expecting prices to move lower as the
prices in the region still continued to slide.
	   The Inro daily market indicator prices for June 7 fell to 196.89
Malaysian/Singapore cents from 198.44 cents on June 5.
	   The five-day moving average dropped to 200.22 cents from 201.60
cents previously.

	   KUCHING, Tues. - A 76-year-old medicine man was charged in the
magistrate's court today with the murder of a three-year-old boy
last month.
	   However, no plea was taken from Brahim Rais who appeared before
magistrate Mahazan Mat Taib in a courtroom packed with villagers,
relatives of the victim, Hazry Damian, and reporters.
	   Mahazan also ordered Brahim to be remanded in police custody for
14 days after Deputy Public Prosecutor Ahmad Zubir said
investigations had not been completed and the post-mortem report
was not ready.
	   Brahim, of Kampung Siol Kandis here, was charged with the murder
of Hazry at Taman Sapura Indah, Batu Kawa, about 8am on May 26.
	   He was arrested at a house not far from the scene of the killing
the following day.
	   Hazry and his mother Ranchin Chuchu, 25, who also sustained
injuries, were found in a drain by a youth who later lodged a
police report.
	   Hazry suffered head injuries suspected to have been caused by a
hard object.
	   The two were believed to have been attacked while they were
taking their bath at a fire hydrant in Taman Sapura.

	   TUMPAT, Tues. - The State Government welcomes cultural activists
for discussions to determine the guidelines for dikir barat
performances, Menteri Besar Datuk Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat said.
	   He said the State Government had no intention of imposing a
permanent ban on dikir barat and would lift it in due time.
	   ``For the time being, we welcome parties willing to give us
ideas to revive the State's culture and ensure that the
performances do not contain elements contradictory to Islamic
teachings.''
	   Nik Aziz was speaking to reporters after a ground-breaking
ceremony for the construction of a new building for Sekolah
Menengah Ugama (Arab) Tumpat today.
	   There have been requests from some quarters for a meeting with
him to discuss the State Government's decision to suspend dikir
barat performances in Kelantan.
	   The State Government has suspended all dikir barat performances
since last month when some were found to have abused their permits
by including other entertainment unacceptable to Islam.
	   Nik Aziz said the decision was made in the people's interests,
particularly to check moral decay among youths.
	   ``The State Government is not against culture because it is the
tradition and rights of the people. Some aspects of it, however,
are not good for the people.''

	   HONG KONG share prices fell 2.3 per cent in half-day trade
yesterday amid concerns over regional currencies and a further
weakening of the Japanese yen against the US dollar, dealers said.

	   Half-day turnover amounted to HK$3.281 billion, against Monday's

	   KOTA BARU, Tues. - The State Dikir Barat Association is prepared
to modify its performances to suit the State Government's
guidelines on entertainment in its bid to preserve traditional art
and culture.
	   Its secretary Mohd Rozi Mohd Yazid said he hoped this move would
persuade the State Government to lift the ban on dikir barat
performances.
	   He said the association would set up a monitoring body to ensure
that performances did not contravene the guidelines.
	   ``This body will be empowered to stop a dikir barat performance
if it breaches the rules set by the State Government.
	   ``The show promoters will also be required to submit a letter to
the association declaring that no other forms of entertainment will
be featured in the dikir barat show.''
	   Mohd Rozi said the promoters and performers would be required to
strictly follow the conditions set by the association to provide
clean entertainment to the public.
	   He said the association was confident that it could promote
dikir barat among the younger generations.
	   He said the association would arrange a meeting with State
Culture, Tourism, Youth and Sports Committee chairman Abdullah
Ya'kub to convey its willingness to adhere to the guidelines.
	   Two weeks ago, Menteri Besar Datuk Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat
announced the ban on all dikir barat performances.
	   The decision, reached at a State Executive Council meeting, was
on the grounds that certain quarters had violated the conditions in
the permit by featuring other forms of entertainment which are
contradictory to Islamic teachings.

	   KLSE Composite Index futures traded on the Kuala Lumpur Options
and Financial Futures Exchange (KLoffe) tracked the positive note
of the cash market to end higher.
	   Spot June ended 15.2 points higher to close at 508.2 with 2,162
lots traded while July futures gained 15.7 points to settle at 502
with 237 changing hands.
	   Open interest for June and July stood at 17,682 lots and 1,903
lots respectively. An analyst said the futures market closed higher
in tandem with the cash market.
	   However, he said despite yesterday's rise in the cash and
futures market, the overall sentiments for both markets remained
cautious following days of weakness.
	   He added the futures market will continue to monitor the cash
market closely today.
	   He foresees the cash market to stay sidelined in the next few
days ahead of any fresh leads.

	   THE SMASHING PUMPKINS - Adore (Virgin/73.21/LP): Arguably the
most adventurous of the alternative rock bands to emerge on the
scene this decade, The Smashing Pumpkins spring yet another
surprise on fans who expect more of the eclecticism that
characterised their last album, Mellon Collie And The Infinite
Sadness.
	   This is a pretty straightforward light-rock effort that owes
more to the British ambient movement than to any of the Seattle
grunge bands in terms of tone, texture and atmosphere.
	   Indeed, on the most effective cuts here, including Ava Adore and
Daphne Descends, synthesisers overshadow guitars. And the beats
have a strong electronic resonance.
	   Singer Billy Corgan's lyrics alternate between anguish and
ecstasy - extremes of emotion which bring an alluringly languid
beauty to the ballads here, especially the ethereal Once Upon A
Time.
	   It take a while to really get into the music, but once you do,
you'll be enthralled by the freshness of approach.
	   (Distributed by EMI) Performance: Sound: VARIOUS ARTISTS -
Twentieth Century Blues/The Songs Of Noel Coward (EMI/59:30/I):
More than any other songwriter of his time, Noel Coward defined the
charm of being British in a style of entertainment that was as
pride-stirring as it was self-mocking.
	   His Broadway-influenced songs evoke scenes of England in the
`30s and `40s as depicted in various films set in that era.
	   This tribute to Coward by contemporary artists has an equal
amount of hits and misses. But despite the shortcomings, it's still
an interesting project.
	   And you have people like Marianne Faithfull (Mad About The Boy),
Bryan Ferry (I'll See You Again) and Sting (I'll Follow My Secret
Heart) to thank for not overdressing Coward's work.
	   Texas (Parisian Pierrot), Pet Shop Boys (Sail Away), Suede (Poor
Little Girl) and Robbie Williams (There Are Bad Times Just Around
The Corner) among those who take too much liberty with the
material, making it sound like ordinary dance-pop fodder.
	   Proceeds from the album will go to the Red Hot AIDS Charitable
Trust.
	   (Distributed by EMI) Performance: 1/2 Sound: LENNY KRAVITZ - 5
(Virgin/66:35/I): Kravitz continues his rather extended journey
into the past, deftly recycling funk, soul and disco without
seeming blatantly derivative.
	   He's been doing this long enough to know how to make old ideas
sound fresh, and it's this ability to reinvigorate ripped-off riffs
that makes much of his new recording so engaging.
	   On some tracks, he will remind you of Prince at his most
inspired, but these moments are too few and far between to generate
excitement.
	   Still, there's enough here to remind you that what an undying
source of inspiration rock from the '60s and '70s is.
	   (Distributed by EMI) Performance: 1/2 Sound: DANNY WILDE + THE
REMBRANDTS - This Spin (EastWest/39:01/I): Best known as the band
that sang the Friends theme, The Rembrandts are pretty much a bunch
of lightweights with a gift for melody.
	   The songs here are catchy and boast a nifty line or two, but
they all seem to have a tiresome one-dimensional feel.
	   They would certainly work better as TV sitcom themes than
stand-alone pop pieces.
	   (Distributed by Warner Music) Performance: 1/2 Sound: HANSON - 3
Car Garage: The Indie Recordings '95-'96 (Mercury/Moe/45:01/I):
These are the demo sessions that got the three boys signed to a
major label and shot them to international fame.
	   It's a presentation of talent in its raw state, packaged for
fans who just can't get enough of the oh-so-cute things.
	   Well, it does show than the Hanson kids are no flash in the pan,
but really, it's just a demo collection that should have stayed in
the can.
	   Tracks include Day Has Come, With You In My Dreams and a
spirited but sparkless version of Mmmbop.
	   (Distributed by PolyGram Records) Performance: Sound:
ASIANDUBFOUNDATION - Rafi's Revenge (FFRR/49:03/I): Where dub meets
the East for a marriage that's not always happy.
	   The trouble is, the Eastern motifs serve as nothing more than
mild ornamentation on what are essentially frantically remixed
dance tracks.
	   And the ersatz rap style is not going to have any true fan of
the form convinced.
	   (Distributed by PolyGram Records) Performance: Sound: VARIOUS
ARTISTS - Allez! Ola! Ole! (Columbia/75:12/LP): Brought out to feed
the World Cup fever, this compilation features songs by artists
representing the various participating countries.
	   A project like this is, of course, going to have as many good
tracks as bad ones. So if you're thinking of buying it, check out

	   THE Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) closed higher yesterday
on late strong buying interest especially on blue-chip stocks.
	   In early trading, the market was lacklustre and range-bound as
investors stayed sidelined and refrained from entering the market
in the absence of new leads, analysts said.
	   According to analysts, days of weakness and the firmer ringgit
helped to spur buying interest.
	   Blue-chips stocks, Malayan Banking rose 24 sen to RM5.20,
Telekom increased 30 sen to RM7.60, Petronas Gas jumped 35 sen to
RM8.15, and Dutch Baby moved up 30 sen to close at RM9.70.
	   The KLSE Composite Index (KLCI) rose 7.85 points to 505.64
compared with Monday's close of 497.79.
	   The Broader Emas Index increased 1.07 points to 129.53 while the
Second Board Index dipped 0.18 point to close at 108.87.
	   Across the causeway, the Singapore Straits Times Industrials
Index dropped 11.36 points to close at 1,117.21.
	   On the home front, the scoreboard showed gainers outpacing
losers 317 to 211 while 186 counters remained unchanged.
	   The broad-based BT Ordinaries inched up 0.82 point to 122.60
while the 30-share New Straits Times Industrial Index dipped 13.43
points to close 2,974.62.
	   Total turnover dropped to 84.244 million shares valued at
RM179.801 million yesterday compared with 99.210 million shares
valued at RM225.384 million on Monday.
	   Turnover on the main board was 69.730 million shares worth
RM166.170 million while trade on the Second Board was 6.485 million
shares worth RM11.416 million.
	   Malayan Banking was the most active counter with 11.122 million
shares, followed by Commerce-Asset with 4.164 million shares and
Magnum with 3.163 million shares done.

	   KEN Holdings Bhd, with three government projects in Hong Kong
worth HK$130 million (HK$100  &QC;  RM53.80), is confident of
maintaining its profitability for the financial year ending
December 31 1998.
	   The construction and civil engineering group posted a pre-tax
profit of RM5 million, on the back of RM91.4 million in turnover.
	   Chairman and managing director Tan Boon Kang said the group is
working on the first Hong Kong project worth HK$30 million, while
the other two - amounting to HK$100 million - are still awaiting
approvals.
	   The group through its Hong Kong subsidiary, Kenly (HK) Ltd, has
secured specialist engineering projects which include
micro-tunnelling, soil- nailing, anchoring and slope rehabilitation
and stabilisation works.
	   Speaking after Ken Holdings' annual general meeting in Kuala
Lumpur yesterday, Tan said the contribution of overseas projects to
the group's earnings will increase.
	   Currently, about 75 per cent of the group's profit comes from
local projects, and the remaining 25 per cent from overseas.
	   Tan said the higher profit will also be achieved through its
on-going projects secured from the Malaysian Government and the
private sector totalling RM130 million.
	   On the local front, the group has deferred its RM17 million
condominium project in Petaling Jaya due to the slowdown in the
construction industry.
	   ``However, we are still hoping to complete the construction work
within the next three to four years,'' Tan said, adding that Ken
Holdings is currently seeking approval from the relevant
authorities to sell the property at a lower price.
	   If approved, the project is expected to generate sales of about
RM170 million.
	   Asked whether the group is exposed to ringgit fluctuations, Tan
said that it is fortunate because 90 per cent of its raw materials
are sourced locally. ``We purchase only machinery and parts.
Therefore, we are not affected.''

Sir David English, Associated Newspapers chief, dead at 67
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sir David English, chairman and group
editor-in-chief of Associated Newspapers _ who was editor of the
Daily Mail for more than 20 years_ died Wednesday after suffering a
stroke. He was 67.
	   English was admitted to St. Thomas's Hospital in London on
Tuesday and died on Wednesday, said Lawrence Sear, managing editor
of the Daily Mail.
	   English, who joined Associated Newspapers in 1969, became editor
of the Daily Mail in 1971 and transformed the tabloid over the next
two decades. In 1992 he was appointed overall editor of the group
whose other major newspapers include The Mail on Sunday and
London's Evening Standard.
	   Under his leadership, the Daily Mail became the self-assured
voice of middle England, identifying a fertile new market between
the traditional tabloid territory and the broadsheets.
	   He was knighted in 1982, and on Wednesday evening Prime Minister
Tony Blair's office announced that English was to have been given a
life peerage this week and made a member of the House of Lords.
	   Blair, told of English's death, called the newspaperman ``a
truly outstanding journalist. He never lost his love and enthusiasm
for his chosen profession and never lost his eye for a good
story.''
	   The Daily Mail's present editor, Paul Dacre, said, ``At heart he
was a newspaperman's newspaperman. ``He could do every job on the
paper better than anyone else and was an inspiration to everybody
who worked with him at the Mail.''
	   Said Lord Rothermere, chairman of the Daily Mail, ``He was
simply the best of his generation and the most able and talented
editor that I and Fleet Street have known. He took over the
editorship of the Daily Mail at the lowest ebb in its fortunes and
carried out with genius its conversion to a middle market
tabloid.'' -	   English's competitors, too, praised his skills.
	   ``David English was the newspaper genius that every journalist
of my generation looked up to and aspired to emulate,'' said Piers
Morgan, editor of The Mirror. ``He was a brilliant editor, a superb
technician and the most formidable of opponents.''
	   David Montgomery, chief executive of Mirror Group, called
English ``The greatest master of popular tabloid journalism of his
generation.''
	   Simon Kelner, editor of The Independent, called English ``truly
the journalist's journalist.''
	   And, ``If there has been a greater journalist, I've not met
him,'' said Kelvin MacKenzie, former deputy chief executive of
Mirror Group Newspapers and former editor of The Sun.
	   ``David was a colossal figure in post-war British journalism. He
defined the craft of newspapering for generations of young
journalists,'' said Les Hinton, executive chairman of News
International.
	   English is survived by his wife, Lady Irene, and three children.
No funeral arrangements were announced.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Angrily dismissing vague promises of a
transition to civilian rule, Nigeria's opposition movement
Wednesday lashed out at the country's new ruler and called for
Nigerians to reject his government.
	   Gani Fawehinmi, a Lagos attorney and one of the country's
best-known opposition activists, said he would file a suit in the
Nigerian high court challenging the appointment of Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar.
	   Fawehinmi said there was nothing in Nigerian law to say that a
chief of defense staff succeeds the head of state. Abubakar took
the helm of Africa's most populous nation after the death Monday of
Gen. Sani Abacha, a close ally who had run Nigeria as a
dictatorship for five years.
	   ``Nigerians must intensify their struggle to end military
rule,'' Fawehinmi said. ``Nigerians should expect nothing but a
continuation of economic persecution and political oppression.''
	   The denunciations followed a televised speech Tuesday by
Abubakar, who promised to proceed with a transition to civilian
rule that Abacha began. He gave no details on how that would
happen.

	   THE Federation of Unit Trust Managers plans to submit a
blueprint to the Securities Commission which consists, among
others, a proposal to merge the country's unit trust companies.
	   Federation president Abdul Azim Mohd Zabidi said FMUTM was
finalising details of the blueprint and would present the plan to
the regulatory body within two weeks.
	   There are 35 unit trust companies in the country.
	   Abdul Azim said the federation did not put a definite target on
the number of unit trust companies after the merger.
	   ``The recent merger of finance companies has resulted in the
final number of eight companies ... we might be looking at
something like that.''
	   The proposed merger would ensure the growth of the unit trust
industry with the eventual liberalisation of the financial sector,
he told reporters after the official opening of the second annual
Unit Trust Conference and Exhibition in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   The conference was officiated by Deputy Prime Minister and
Finance Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Abdul Azim said other matters in the blueprint included tax
issues which continued to be a constraint to product appeal, adding
that the federation was seeking tax relief and tax exemption on
investment of unit trust funds.
	   ``The proposal on the tax issue had been mooted to the Finance
Ministry two weeks ago.''
	   He said the tax relief and exemption were in areas such as
long-term savings plans, funding for retirement through unit trusts
and exemption of interest income received by unit trusts.
	   The blueprint will also cover issues on cross-border sales to
allow unit trust companies to increase their investment in foreign
stock markets.
	   The increase in foreign investment would also increase the unit
trust industry market capitalisation, he said adding that market
capitalisation was targeted to increase to 40 per cent within the
next 15 years.
	   Abdul Azim said including Amanah Saham Nasional, Amanah Saham
Bumiputera and Amanah Saham Wawasan, the market capitalisation was
at 9.5 per cent.
	   ``But if we take out the funds, it's only about 2.5 per cent.
So, there is massive room for improvement over the next years in
the unit trust industry.''
	   Abdul Azim said although the SC allowed managers in the unit
trust industry to invest outside Malaysia, they were constrained by
Bank Negara in terms of exchange control regulations.
	   Under the SC guideline, the managers can invest up to 90 per
cent, but most exposure on foreign investment by the central bank
is up to 10 per cent of the value of the fund.

	   PRODUCTION of fresh fruit bunches (FFB) is expected to fall this
year due to the prolonged drought in northern Sarawak, Sarawak Oil
Palms Bhd chairman Datuk Amar Hamid Bugo says in his annual
statement.
	   However, this has been cushioned by the large upsurge in crude
palm oil (CPO) prices at the end of last year and a further
increase to RM2,000 a tonne during the first quarter of this year.
	   The new kernel crushing facilities in Bintulu and the reduction
in forwarding costs, too, have compensated for the lower FFB crops
and it augurs well for 1998.
	   To strengthen its position, the group's is negotiating with
relevant parties to expand its oil palm interest, both in
plantations and refining.
	   It is expected to be completed within this year.
	   Reviewing operations last year, Hamid says the group established
a nursery for 85 per cent-owned subsidiary SOP Plantations (Suai)
Sdn Bhd, with first plantings projected within 1998.
	   The group also started replanting to replace mature palms, to
maintain the production of FFB.
	   In line with the expansion of its plantation interests, three
subsidiaries were established - SOP Plantations, a joint venture
with Sarawak State Financial Secretary Inc, SOP Plantations
(Balingian) Sdn Bhd a joint venture with Lembaga Masjid Mukah, and
SOP Plantations (Niah) Sdn Bhd.
	   The three subsidiaries will facilitate the development of
integrated oil palms projects.
	   Sarawak Oil Palms posted a group pre-tax profit of RM20.79
million for the year ended December 31 1997, compared to the
previous RM18.66 million.
	   Turnover, however, was lower at RM54.68 million in 1997, against
RM57.52 million in 1996. Profit after tax was RM14.29 million
compared with RM12.69 million previously.
	   Earnings per share came to 15.05 sen compared with 13.37 sen in
the previous year. No dividend has been recommended.

	   SINGER (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Berjaya
Singer Bhd, expects its sales to increase by between five per cent
and 10 per cent for the current financial year through its ``Mega
Double'' consumer promotions campaign.
	   Singer managing director San Wan Hing said the company recorded
turnover of more than RM400 million for the year ended Dec 31,
1998.
	   He was speaking to journalists after the launching of the
promotion campaign, starting from this month to August, by Berjaya
Singer deputy executive chairman Tengku Datuk Adnan Tengku Mansor
in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   At the ceremony, Tengku Adnan also presented a mock cheque for
RM1.5 million to Bank Simpanan Nasional chairman Datuk Ahmad Zahid
Hamidi.
	   The cheque is to acquire BSN premium savings certificates, which
will be given away as gifts to qualified customers.
	   During the promotion campaign, each customer buying singer
products valued at RM995 and above, in cash or with its easy
payment scheme, is entitled to a minimum of two units and a maximum
of five units of the BSN premium savings certificates.
	   In addition, customers can participate in the ``double''
contests - BSN's premium draws (in July, August and September) and
a Singer contest.
	   Tengku Adnan said the Singer contest offers more than RM200,000
worth of prizes, which range from Kriss motorcycles to holiday
packages and a whole range of Singer products.
	   San said the company is expected to increase the price of its
products by a single digit percentage in the second half of this
year.
	   ``So far we have been maintaining the prices at the same level
and absorbing the extra cost,'' he said.
	   On the company's operation, he said Singer plans to increase its
sales agents by 10 per cent nationwide from the current 4,000.
	   Singer retails and markets an extensive range of furniture and
household electrical durables which carry the Singer label.
	   The company has been marketing its products in Malaysia for 93
years.

	   GOLDEN Pharos Bhd is confident of returning to the black this
year, going by the performance achieved in the year's first half
compared with last year's corresponding period.
	   Chairman Datuk Mohd Azahar Othman said the confidence stems from
Golden Pharos' ability to garner RM5 million in sales revenue per
month from the export of its high end doors to its main markets in
the US and Europe.
	   He was speaking to reporters after the group's annual general
meeting yesterday. For the financial year ended December 31 1997
Golden Pharos posted a group after tax loss of RM19.06 million
together with a turnover of RM141.84 million and a loss per share
of 16.4 sen.
	   Currently out of the group's production output of 18,000 doors
per month, 99 per cent of the output are exported to US and Europe
and Golden Pharos is hopeful that once it gets the Forest
Sustainable Certification sometime this year, it will be in a
better position to sell its products in the European market.
	   This certification, Mohd Azahar said is needed by the year 2000,
by the United Kingdom and other European countries to enable the
group to export its products to this markets.
	   Meanwhile for the expectation of higher exports, the company
would increase the production capacity to 20,000 doors per month,
he said.
	   The company would continue to focus on producing high-end doors
and its plan to venture further downstream to produce pre-finished
doors has been deferred due to the current economic situation, he
said.
	   Mohd Azahar also said that the company has 140,000 ha forest
concession in Terengganu which would allow them to source
internally rather than to source for higher price of raw material
from the open market.

	   THE Securities Commission has completed phase one of formulating
marketing guidelines of unit trust funds for the marketing staff of
banks.
	   This includes developing disciplinary procedures for agents and
sales people with the aim of enhancing sales practices in the
industry. It is expected to commence later this year.
	   The formulation of phase two of the marketing guidelines for
institutional agents will commence in the second half of this year.
	   In addition, the Securities Commission will be promoting good
practices and compliance among management companies (companies
which establish the funds) through enforcing minimum standards for
compliance and internal controls, said its issues and investment
division manager Jas Bir Kaur in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   She was presenting a talk on ``The regulatory framework of unit
trust funds'' at the Second Annual Unit Trust Conference and
Exhibition organised by the Federation of Malaysian Unit Trust
Managers.
	   She said the Securities Commission would also be promoting good
accounting and reporting practices among management companies,
especially in the areas of improving interim and annual reports.
	   Besides the Securities Commission, other regulatory authorities
include Bank Negara, the Ministry of Finance, the Economic Planning
Unit, the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange and Registrar of Companies.
	   During her talk, Jas Bir said the Malaysian unit trust fund
industry, which may be generally categorised as equity funds, fixed
interest funds and Islamic funds, had a net asset value of RM42.9
billion with about 47.3 billion units in circulation among 83
funds.
	   Its assets account for 9.49 per cent of the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange market capitalisation and 14 per cent of the total fund
management industry sized at RM234 billion.
	   There are currently 8.33 million accounts in existence and the
average holding per account stands at about 5,700 units (including
those under Permodalan Nasional Bhd such as Amanah Saham Nasional
and Wawasan 2020).

	   THE Federation of Malaysian Unit Trust Managers (FMUTM) is
expected to submit a code of ethics for fund management companies
to the Securities Commission next week.
	   The federation's professional ethics committee, in a six
month-long process, has finalised the code after consultation with
its members, said executive director Jacob Thomas yesterday.
	   The code, containing the industry's minimum best practices, will
require fund management companies to be more stringent in their
operations, he said, adding that the federation has looked at
models of other countries before coming up with the code.
	   ``The code is a basic one, ...and members can add on later if
they want,''
	   said Jacob.
	   The main issue inherent in the code is that of investment, Jacob
said.
	   One of the guidelines stipulates that an investment manager is
discouraged from making an investment in a personal capacity a week
before and after his or her fund management company makes a similar
investment.
	   The code, to contain a list of approved stockbrokers, will also
have guidelines so that transactions by stockbrokers can be
monitored, Jacob said.
	   Jacob said this to reporters at the sidelines of the second
annual unit trust conference and exhibition, and the unveiling of
the federation's new corporate logo and website, held in Kuala
Lumpur.
	   Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Datuk Seri Anwar
Ibrahim officiated at the conference and delivered a keynote
address at the event.
	   Meanwhile, the SC said it will continue to promote good
compliance and control among fund management companies as part of
its three-year business plan beginning 1998.
	   One of the thrusts in the plan is its collaboration with the
FMUTM in coming up with a code of ethics, said Ms Jas Bir Kaur,
manager of the SC's issues and investment division in her speech at
the conference.
	   ``The SC, in its audit of management companies, have come across
inadequate internal controls and compliance, and varying degrees of
control in these companies,'' she said.
	   The SC wants to ensure a high level of minimum standards for
fund management companies, she said in her paper, ``The Regulatory
Framework of Unit Trust Funds''.
	   Part of the plan also includes, having these companies adopt
good accounting and reporting practices which included making unit
trust prospectus more reader-friendly.
	   Furthermore unit trust companies need to adopt a more
appropriate dividend policy with their disclosure of where the
dividends are coming from, she said.
	   In his paper on ``The Role &AMP; Responsibilities of the Trustee'',
Ms Ong Sau Yin, managing director of HSBC (Malaysia) Trustees Bhd,
said trustees have a wider role to play in providing investment
managers with comprehensive operations and fund administration
support.
	   ``The wider role, not only includes trustee and custodianship
services but also registrar services, fund valuation and full
accounting services,''
	   she said.
	   Ong also said that the feeling within the industry is that the
appointment of trustees for fund management companies by the SC
will no longer be an automatic process.
	   There is a possibility that the SC will see whether the trustee
has the necessary financial and human resources, and the required
systems in place before taking on the role of a trustee for fund
management companies.
	   The SC may even conduct a due diligence audit on the trustee
before granting approval, she said.

Morocco, Norway tie 2-2 in World Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHAN NASSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Tahar set up two goals with long,
precision passes, while Norway netted twice on clumsy plays off
free kicks as the two nations played to a 2-2 draw Wednesday on the
first day of the World Cup.
	   Moustafa El Hadji scored in the 38th minute and Abdeljilil Hadda
in the 59th for the ``Atlas Lions'', while Youssef Chippo had an
own goal in first-half injury time and defender Dan Eggen scored in
the 61st for the ``Drillos'' from Norway.
	   In the first-ever meeting between the two countries, Eggen
scored when Stig Inge Bjornebye's free kick was sprung loose in the
penalty box after a collision between defender Noureddine Naybet
and goalkeeper Driss Benzekri. Amid the disarray, Eggen
opportunistically headed the ball easily into the net.
	   Two minutes earlier, Hadda had taken Tahar's perfect upfield
pass and raced past Eggen before settling himself and placing the
ball into the upper right corner of the net to put Morocco ahead
2-1.
	   The tie extends Norway's international unbeaten streak to 15
games. It also wasn't surprising that both of the team's goals came
off set plays _ 12 of its 21 goals in qualifying were scored the
same way.
	   The Norwegians have already doubled their scoring output from
the 1994 World Cup, when they scored only one goal in three games
before being eliminated. The Moroccans also have an immediate show
of improvement _ they lost all of their three games before heading
home from the United States four years ago.
	   Morocco took its first lead on a splendid move by Hadji. After
taking the long pass from Tahar, the Deportivo La Coruna midfielder
sped down the left side and spun Eggen around before blasting home
a right-footed shot just inside the right post.
	   Chippo's error came after Benzekri collided with Henning Berg as
they leapt for Bjornebye's free kick from the left of the box. The
ball went off Berg's shoulder and straight to Chippo, who missed
badly as he tried to clear the ball wide and instead glanced the
ball off the inside of the post.

Polgar leads 3-1 after second day of play against Karpov
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungary's Judit Polgar, the world's top
woman chess player, held a 3-1 lead Wednesday over reigning world
champion Anatoly Karpov halfway through a four-day competition.
	   In the first game of the day, Polgar, 21, played the black
pieces, and started with a Ben-Oni defense. Karpov, of Russia, took
a slight advantage but then lost on time after the 82nd move.
	   In speed matches the players have 30 minutes each.
	   In the second game of the day, Karpov, 47, fought with the
Caro-Kann defense, and the game ended in a tie with the 57th move.
	   ``I think I was not for a moment threatened to be defeated
today. It will be tough in the next days, but I feel well and am
confident,'' Polgar said after Wednesday's competition.
	   ``Judit dominated the whole day, but Karpov is such a great
chess player that he is capable of surprising us even from such a
losing position,'' international master Janos Szabolcsi said.
	   The competition, sponsored by the state oil company MOL and
several smaller companies, is the first time in chess history that
the top male and female chess players have competed.
	   This was the second day of a four-day, eight-game speed match
challenge. Each win is worth one point, while a tie is worth a
half-point.
	   Polgar won one match on the first day of competition and tied in
the second.

Newspaper: Arafat may retire after signing withdrawal deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A government-owned newspaper said that
Yasser Arafat will step down as leader of the Palestinian Authority
for health reasons, possibly after signing a deal with Israel on a
withdrawal from the West Bank.
	   The Al-Gomhuriya newspaper reported in its early Thursday
edition that Ahmed Qurai, head of the Palestinian Legislative
Council, or Salim Zaanoun, speaker of the Palestine National
Council, will take over until a new president is elected.
	   The newspaper said it based its report on Palestinian sources,
but did not further identify the sources.
	   ``Palestinian sources confirmed that Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat will retire for health reasons,'' the newspaper said.
	   The newspaper said its sources ``suggested that Arafat may
retire after signing the agreement with Israel on the Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank.''
	   Israel's Cabinet is expected to vote by the end of the week on a
U.S. initiative for a 13 percent pullback from the West Bank, which
Israel seized from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast War. The Palestinians
already have accepted the proposal.
	   Arafat is expected in Cairo Thursday for talks with President
Hosni Mubarak on the stalled Middle East peace process.
	   There have been persistent rumors that the health of the
68-year-old Palestinian leader is failing.

	   PENGKALEN Holdings Bhd and its subsidiary Pengkalen Capital Bhd
have increased the size of the rights issues announced on March 9
to raise more cash to beef up the capital base of the group's two
stockbroking firms.
	   Under the two revised rights issue proposals, the group will
realise higher proceeds totalling about RM1.02 billion compared to
RM650.32 million from the original proposals.
	   Kimara Equities Sdn Bhd and Pengkalen Securities Sdn Bhd,
subsidiaries of Pengkalen Capital, were placed under trading
restrictions by the Securities Commission on April 23 and May 7,
respectively, for failing to fulfil the minimum liquid funds
requirement.
	   In a statement issued yesterday, Pengkalen Holdings announced
the revision of its original two-for-one rights issue of 397.23
million new shares at RM1 each to a three-for-one rights issue of
595.84 million shares at RM1 each.
	   Pengkalen Capital, in a separate statement, announced the
revision of its original three-for-one rights issue of 253.09
million shares at RM1 each to a five-for-one rights issue of 421.81
million shares at RM1 each.
	   Pengkalen Holdings said the revision of its original rights
issue was to ``raise larger capital in view of the increase in the
size of the cash call by its subsidiary Pengkalen Capital''.
	   Of the proceeds of RM595.84 million accruing to Pengkalen
Holdings under its revised rights issue, RM220.43 million will be
used to subscribe for its entitlement of 220.43 million new shares
under Pengkalen Capital's revised rights issue.
	   Another RM366 million will be used to repay bank borrowings
and/or to apply for any excess application in Pengkalen Capital's
rights issue, and RM9.41 million as working capital.
	   Pengkalen Holdings said its parent company, Malayan United
Industries Bhd which currently holds a 80.72 per cent stake in it,
had agreed to subscribe for its full entitlement amounting to
480.94 million shares.
	   Pengkalen Capital said the revision of its rights issue was to
accommodate a larger size of capital raising for injection into
Kimara Equities and Pengkalen Securities.
	   Of its proceeds of RM421.81 million, RM267 million will be used
to subscribe for its entitlement of 267 million new shares under
Pengkalen Securities' revised rights issue, and RM148 million to
subscribe in new shares of Kimara Equities. Another RM6.81 million
will be used as working capital for Pengkalen Capital.
	   It also said Kimara Equities and Pengkalen Securities yesterday
obtained a six-month restraining order from the High Court against
all further intended actions against the two stockbroking firms.

	   DUE to a steep drop in demand for cement in the region, local
cement manufacturer, Malayan Cement Bhd anticipates lower pre-tax
profits for the financial year ending December 31 1998.
	   ``Profits will be reduced for the current financial year, since
there is a reduction of 25 per cent from the cement activities
itself,'' Malayan Cement's managing director, Jeffery C. Pope said
after the company's annual general meeting yesterday.
	   For the financial year ended December 31 1997, the group
recorded a RM172.28 million pre-tax profit on the back of a
RM921.94 million turnover.
	   It is estimated that in Peninsular Malaysia alone between
January and May this year, cement consumption has contracted by
some 25 per cent compared to the corresponding period last year.
	   In view of the reduction, Pope said exports to other potential
markets are being developed.
	   ``We are (currently) exporting clinker to Singapore and
supplying to grinding plants in Malaysia,'' he said, adding that
the export market is also limited as the whole Asian region is
experiencing an excess of clinker.
	   When asked if the company will look into exporting to North and
South America, Pope said there is only a slim possibility since
shipping cost is very high.
	   Additionally, the lower demand in the region's cement industry
has caused Malayan Cement, a member of the Blue Circle Group, to
reduce its production significantly, but below 25 per cent.
	   Pope said the excess of supply had caused the export price to
fall below the domestic price by 30 to 35 per cent in terms of US
dollars.
	   Meanwhile, Malayan Cement announced that Mr Alister Cox will be
appointed as managing director in place of Pope upon his secondment
to another company within Group.

	   ALL telecommunications firms must draw up clear network
expansion plans to allow for easier co-operation between the
players - with the aim of providing better services to customers
within the country.
	   Energy, Telecommunications and Posts Minister Datuk Leo Moggie
yesterday said this was a requirement already stated in the
telecommunications licences - known as Universal Service Obligation
(USO).
	   So far, only Telekom Malaysia had submitted this USO plan, he
said after chairing a dialogue between the ministry and its
industry players in Kuala Lumpur.
	   The other operators, while having drawn up network expansion
plans, have not finalised when they would ``roll-out'' their
infrastructure expansion - largely due to the need to optimise
investment funds in the current economic climate.
	   These operators are Binariang Bhd, Celcom (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd,
Mutiara Telecommunications Sdn Bhd, Time Telecommunications Sdn Bhd
and PrismaNet (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd.
	   Given the difficulties involved in getting commitments from all
operators on their roll-out plans, Leo Moggie suggested that the
Telecommunications Department draw up an industry-wide roll-out
plan instead.
	   He said: ``We have not come up with the detailed plan but we
believe that other players must also participate in some aspect of
the USO.''
	   Leo Moggie said the ministry might look at the licensing
conditions of the existing telecommunications companies as a means
to compel then to participate in the USO.
	   ``There might be some existing criteria in the licence which can
be used as a requirement for the telecommunications companies to
have a roll-out plan.''
	   Leo Moggie said that nothing definite had been decided yet.
	   Meanwhile, an analyst said that it was high time the ministry
introduced steps to allow the telecommunications player to assist
Telekom Malaysia in constructing networks.
	   ``This topic of reducing Telekom Malaysia's burden of building
networks in rural areas has been talked about for a long time but
to no avail,'' she said.
	   ``The move should be implemented before equal access becomes a
reality.
	   ``I think it is only fair for other players to share the cost of
constructing networks in the country,'' another analyst said.
	   At the dialogue, Leo Moggie said there were fewer complaints on
the energy, telecommunications and posts services from industry
players as well as related associations.

	   CRUDE palm oil physicals were down by RM30 to RM2,350 in line
with the continued weakness of futures prices yesterday.
	   The price was at the high end and there was also uncertainties
brought about by volatile swings on the ringgit, a dealer said.
	   On the Kuala Lumpur Commodity Exchange, crude palm oil futures
continued to slide on lack of fresh and positive leads.
	   June lost RM28 to settle at RM2,330, July shed RM22 to RM2,311,
August was down RM22 to RM2,288 and September lost RM24 to RM2,273.
	   Turnover increased to 1,162 lots from 774 lots on Monday but
open interest decreased to 6,769 contracts from 6,853 contracts.
	   JF Apex Futures Sdn Bhd said futures prices opened lower and
continued to slide in early trading before being confined to a
narrow range.
	   Prices slipped further in afternoon trading after the ringgit
strengthened to 3.9450 to the US dollar.
	   JF Apex Futures said the CPO futures were expected to trade
sideways in thin volume in the coming days with a downside
potential capped at the RM22.60 level due to the absence of fresh
fundamentals.

	   THE Government should consider taking back privatized projects
of national interests into the public sector's fold as the private
sector may not be capable in handling them in the present slowdown.
	   The director and Head of Malaysian Research with Salomon Smith
Barney in Singapore Azman Mokhtar said, hence certain projects
which are strategic in nature and clear in national interest have
to be somewhat ``re- nationalised'' and maintained by the
Government due to the private sector's incapacity to handle them.
	   Azman did not name any of these projects as specifics but gave a
few examples such as the Bakun Dam and the Mass Transit System.
	   The multi-billion Bakun hydro-electric project is expected to
fulfill the country's future energy needs. Costing some RM13.6
billion, the contract was awarded to Ekran Bhd.
	   Last year, as a result of the economic downturn, the Government
has deferred a total of RM65 billion worth of projects which
included Bakun.
	   Ekran then announced that it was no longer interested with the
project after the Government's decision to delay the project. The
Minister of Finance Incorporated has since taken over the
construction of the dam.
	   On the Mass Transit System, Azman said that not many of these
projects are privatized in the world. This is due to its importance
as a public transportation project which will benefit the country.
	   ``In the case of bailouts, we should take a step back and deal
with it on a case by case basis, whether the projects to be taken
over are strategic and fit with national interest,'' he mentioned.
	   However, similar to Pengurusan Danaharta Nasional Bhd, the
national asset management company set up to take up non-performing
loans, re- nationalisation should be a temporary measure by the
Government, Azman stressed.
	   He was speaking to reporters after presenting a paper on
``Malaysian Economic Analysis'' at an executive briefing on
``Transforming the Corporation for Global Competitiveness: A CEO's
Imperative'', yesterday.
	   The briefing was organised by Intaha Consulting Sdn Bhd.
	   Meanwhile, Azman also mentioned that the Yen's alarming fall
could yet trigger another currency devaluation effect in Asia, more
so if China is pressured into devaluating its yuan.

	   UNION Paper Holdings Bhd is disposing of its paper products
business and acquiring four companies which are involved in timber
extraction, contracting, cultivation of oil palm and cocoa, and
have road and bridges maintenance contracts.
	   As a result, Union Paper will get a new set of substantial
shareholders since the restructuring exercise will see the issue of
247.32 million new shares at RM1.35 each. This will result in Union
Paper's issued capital eventually rising to RM291.15 million from
RM17.85 million currently.
	   These new substantial shareholders will also make an offer for
the sale of some of the new shares to existing Union Paper
shareholders and new investors.
	   In a statement issued on behalf of the company, Commerce
International Merchant Bankers Bhd said Union Paper proposed to
acquire the entire interests in Tung Hup Enterprises Sdn Bhd,
Tracpower Sdn Bhd and Syarikat Tung Hup Plantations Sdn Bhd.
	   The stake in Tung Hup will be acquired for RM305.41 million,
satisfied via the issue of 226.23 million Union Paper shares, while
the stake in Tracpower for RM22.48 million will be satisfied via
the issue of 16.65 million new shares. For the stake in Syarikat
Tung Hup at RM5.91 million, 4.37 million new shares will be issued.
	   The company also proposed to acquire one share representing a 25
per cent stake in Marceda Corporation Sdn Bhd for RM68,609. It will
be satisfied with the issue of 50,322 new Union Paper shares.
	   Union Paper said the restructuring exercise was undertaken to
rescue the company through the injection of income-generating
assets and the disposal of its existing loss-making paper business.
	   The disposal of Union Paper Industries Sdn Bhd is to Queeline
Sdn Bhd - an existing substantial shareholder of Union Paper - for
RM1. As at March 31 this year, Union Paper Industries has net
liabilities of RM11.68 million.
	   Union Paper also proposed to increase its authorised share
capital to RM500 million comprising 500 million shares of RM1 each
from RM200 million currently.
	   An employees' share option scheme was proposed with the maximum
number of shares available not exceeding 10 per cent of the issued
capital of Union Paper.

Forget the moon, the Capitals believe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM CANAVAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ This time, Ron Wilson didn't make a motivational
speech about the first moon landing or quote some inspirational
line to the Washington Capitals.
	   There was no need.
	   The Capitals came out of Game 1 confident despite losing 2-1 to
the Detroit Red Wings on Tuesday night.
	   Take out a couple of first-period breakdowns and Washington held
its own with the heavily favored defending champions. The Capitals
even had the better of play in the third period, but Red Wings
goaltender Chris Osgood prevented a tie with a handful of good
saves.
	   The question is can Washington carry the momentum to Game 2 on
Thursday night at the Joe Louis Arena?
	   ``I don't know if our thoughts on the series have changed,''
Capitals goaltender Olaf Kolzig said Wednesday, less than 12 hours
after an outstanding 29-save performance.
	   ``We knew we were going to give a good fight,'' he said, ``Other
than a few mistakes I thought we played stride for stride with
them, so I know our team has a lot of confidence that we can play
with this hockey team and that we have a chance of beating them.''
	   Of course, the Red Wings had their own way of looking at Game 1.
They never trailed after goals by Joe Kocur and Nicklas Lidstrom
and they limited Washington to 17 shots.
	   ``The outcome of last night's game was not going to dictate the
way the series was going to go,'' Red Wings center Steve Yzerman
said after a short skate Wednesday. ``I believe one game to the
next, things always don't carry over, so you can't take too much
out of one game, good or bad. You just play the game, analyze it
and make some adjustments.''
	   One adjustment the Capitals will want to make concerns the Red
Wings' third and fourth lines, which were on the ice when Detroit
scored.
	   ``For us, it seems we gave those goals away,'' Capitals forward
Joe Juneau said. ``It wasn't the big names scoring. It was still
good plays and on the second goal (Lidstrom) they cycled well and
we left a guy open at the point. We have to make sure we don't make
mistakes like that.''
	   Red Wings coach Scotty Bowman wants to do a better job matching
his lines on Thursday. It should be interesting to see what he does
with Yzerman on the ice.
	   Washington had Dale Hunter on the ice against Yzerman and the
long-time tough guy shoved Yzerman's face into the ice right in
front of the Capitals net late in the second period.
	   ``It's not something I want to make a big deal out of because
it's not,'' Yzerman said. ``I know how he's going to play. He's
doing his job. You just have to play and accept a lot of the stuff
and turn the other cheek. You'd hope the referee would make some
calls, but it's not that severe a thing.''

	   ARAS Murni Corp Bhd, formerly known as Inchcape Timuran Bhd,
announced a group pre-tax loss of RM121.28 million for the year
ended December 31 1997 compared to a profit of RM924,000 in the
previous year.
	   This was achieved on interest income of RM249.82 million,
compared to just RM53,000 in the previous year.
	   At company level, there was a pre-tax loss of RM8.90 million on
an interest income of RM10.03 million.
	   Directors said the group's performance was adversely affected by
significant losses incurred by wholly-owned subsidiary Kewangan
Bersatu Bhd due to higher provisions for non-performing loans made
by KBB and was also the result of goodwill written off by the
company.

More bad news for Japan _ GDP stats may confirm recession fears
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ As if Japan hadn't had enough grim financial news,
now comes the possibility of a new recession _ and its first year
of economic contraction in more than two decades.
	   The verdict will come Friday with the release of quarterly
statistics, but in the meantime, Japan's economic plight was driven
home again in the markets Wednesday. The dollar climbed to a new
seven-year high against the yen, and, on cue, Tokyo stocks fell
amid sharp declines in other Asian stock markets.
	   The possibility of negative economic growth, though a
psychological blow for the Japanese, hardly comes out of the blue.
	   The collapse of the real estate market late last decade set off
a downward spiral that continues Wednesday. The result is record
joblessness, a falling stock market and yen, flat corporate
earnings and a host of other problems.
	   Friday's figures _ for gross domestic product in the final
quarter of fiscal 1997 _ are widely expected to confirm fears that
the economy has contracted for two consecutive quarters, the
standard definition for an economy in full-blown recession.
	   It would be Japan's third recessionary plunge this decade and
its first year of overall shrinkage since 1974.
	   The government said Wednesday it was studying a possible
revaluation of the yen to make the currency more competitive.
	   ``It has to be pretty embarrassing because Japan had such a
great reputation in the 1980s, but has pretty much lost it,'' said
Peter Morgan, chief economist at HSBC Securities Japan Ltd.
	   To appreciate the sharp reversal in the world's second-largest
economy, one must think back to boom years of the early 1980s.
Americans saw Tokyo as an economic superpower able to snatch up
landmark buildings such as Rockefeller Center in a single purchase.
Japanese business practices were in vogue. America was playing
catch-up.
	   No more.
	   Japan's jobless rolls have jumped to a postwar high of 4.1
percent, Japanese corporate earnings have hit the skids and the
Tokyo stock market trades at less than half its peak value in 1989.
	   Even the mighty yen has taken a spill; at it current rate of
roughly 140 to the dollar, the infamous dlrs10 cup of premium
coffee in Tokyo's finer hotels can be bought for a mere dlrs6.
	   The reasons for Japan's sluggishness are many and complex.
	   Rigid corporate business practices such as lifetime employment
and dependence on parent banks for capital, for example, have
hampered innovation, hurt efficiency and slowed restructuring
efforts.
	   Management philosophies aside, analysts point to a clear policy
blunder as having sown the seeds for the current slowdown.
	   They blame Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and the
budget-conscious Finance Ministry for teaming up to pass a tax
increase that took effect in April 1997.
	   Raising Japan's national sales tax to 5 percent from 3 percent
chilled consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of
the country's GDP.
	   Japan's banking system, meanwhile, is awash in bad loans from
the collapse of a real estate price bubble in the late 1980s. And
much of Asia is embroiled in a financial crisis that has crimped
demand for Japanese exports and soured many of Japan's investments
in the region.
	   Going into Friday's forecast, however, one fact is clear: Japan,
once the envy of industrialized economies, is now one of its
laggards.

	   KOLEJ Tuanku Ja'afar, the only independent, co-educational
secondary boarding school in Mantin, offers a strong boarding
system for students.
	   Its principal Patrick Briggs said the system was at the core of
college life which enabled students to achieve personal development
while gaining an education.
	   ``Self-discipline is crucial to success and there are many
examples of individuals who have obtained places in universities in
the UK, US and Australia, as a result of the start they received at
Kolej Tuanku Ja'afar,'' Briggs said.
	   To name a few, since early this year, Ainul Hazura Mohd Rashid
is pursuing an Engineering course at the Imperial College London
together with another former KTJ student, Seung Taek Oh.
	   Cambridge has accepted Muhammad Nurazli Razali to pursue Land
Economy at Robinson College while Heng Yen Lee is studying Chemical
Engineering at Christ's College.
	   Todate, there are 12 KTJ scholars pursuing or have completed
various degree courses at top UK universities.
	   Engineering student Tan Yee Ho of the Jesus College in Oxford,
who scored four A grades at A-level, is the second KTJ product
accepted by the university.
	   The college has a conducive environment for studies.
	   Its director of studies Anthony Finch offers guidance on the
choice of subjects for students from Form Four to Lower Six.
	   Finch also assists students to select tertiary courses.
	   KTJ started with 150 students in 1992. It has an enrolment of
520 now.
	   In line with its drive to improve itself, more facilities are
being provided including a new boarding houses this year.
	   Sixth Form students will have their own rooms.
	   There will also be a resident tutor and matron in each house
which will have a surau, a library, laundry room and pantry.
	   The college also organises Sunday activities like expeditions,
games and club functions to ensure students have a holistic
education.
	   KTJ A-level courses will commence in August. Registration is
open for the next intake.

	   THE Malaysian National Shippers' Council is embarking on a drive
to get more importers, exporters and shippers to use local ports,
its president Datuk Kerk Choo Ting said yesterday.
	   ``We have already upgraded our port facilities, transport system
and moving into a complete paperless transaction with the
application of electronic data interchange,'' he added.
	   Kerk, who is also the Deputy Minister of International Trade and
Industry, said according to 1995 statistic more than 37 per cent of
the country's cargo for export and import used the Singapore port.
	   ``We are talking of about 5.6 million containers (TEUs) entering
or leaving Singapore port,'' he added.
	   If only another 20 to 30 per cent of these containers were to
come through the local ports, one could imagine the kind of
businesses spin-off for the auxillary maritime industries, Kerk
said.
	   Kerk, who was speaking to reporters after the opening of the
Fourth Biennial International Maritime Conference in Petaling Jaya,
said that the council was working very hard to woo local importers,
exporters and shippers' to use the local ports.
	   ``We cannot expect changes overnight.
	   ``There is still this traditional business link involving our
local businessmen with Singapore.
	   ``It will take quite awhile for them to shift their operations
here. We are moving towards this end,'' he added.
	   Kerk said the Government had already taken measures to improve
facilities and efficiency at local ports and the throughputs
recorded were much higher than before.
	   ``There were complaints before by our businessmen about
facilities and efficiency in local ports but all these have been
overcome.
	   ``Our ports are now among the best in the world. Therefore,
there is no reason why they should continue to use our neighbour's
port,'' he added.
	   Kerk added that the country also offered competitive sea freight
rate and it is an impetus for businessmen to use our ports.

Brazil wins first game of France '98

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Norway-Morocco &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH WHITE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ On a day when the Air France strike ended, the
first hooligan was arrested and bugs walked on stilts, it should
have been expected that a bizarre goal would decide the first game
of the 16th World Cup.
	   Scottish defender Tommy Boyd knocked the ball into his own goal
with his chest after a save by goalkeeper Jim Leighton in the 73rd
minute to give defending champion Brazil a 2-1 victory Wednesday
before 80,000 people at the new Stade de France near Paris.
	   ``I couldn't get out of the way,'' Boyd said. ``It was probably
the worst feeling I have ever had to lose a game like that.''
	   Also Wednesday, Norway and Morocco drew 2-2 at Montpellier in
another Group A match. Group B action begins Thursday when Cameroon
faces Austria in Toulouse and Italy plays Chile in Bordeaux.
	   Boyd's own goal ended a surprising threat from Scotland, for
whom even a draw would have been a stunning upset. The match pitted
the tournament's only four-time champions against a nation that has
never been past the first round in seven previous World Cups.
	   Early on, it appeared Brazil would produce the expected rout.
Cesar Sampaio scored on a header off a corner kick just four
minutes into the game.
	   ``Scoring like that, the first goal, makes me unbelievably
happy,'' Sampaio said. ``During those first five seconds one
forgets about everything else, it's like a dream.''
	   But Sampaio's foul on Kevin Gallacher led to John Collins'
penalty equalizer in the 38th minute, boosting Scottish hopes for
an upset.
	   ``There's no denying that the better team won the game,''
Scotland manager Craig Brown said. ``But we had a great chance not
to lose.''
	   At Montpellier, Tahar set up two goals with long, precision
passes, while Norway netted twice on clumsy plays off free kicks in
the first-ever meeting between the two countries.
	   Tahar set up Moustafa El Hadji in the 38th minute and Abdeljilil
Hadda in the 59th, while Youssef Chippo had an own goal in
first-half injury time and defender Dan Eggen scored in the 61st
for Norway. On both Norwegian goals, goalkeeper Driss Benzekri
collided with another player, springing the ball loose.
	   The two goals doubled the Norwegians' scoring output from the
entire 1994 World Cup, when they scored only once in three games
before being eliminated. The Moroccans also have an immediate show
of improvement _ they lost all of their three games before heading
home from the United States four years ago.
	   The Brazil-Scotland game was preceded by a colorful ceremony
featuring 600 acrobats and volunteers _ including stiltwalkers
dressed as striped insects and trumpeting bungee jumpers _ all
acting out the planting of a ``magic garden'' on the field.
	   Away from the field, police identified a known soccer hooligan
from Scotland as one of 15 people still in custody late Wednesday
as a result of overnight clashes between drunken fans and police.
	   The confrontations followed Tuesday's pre-tournament parade
through the streets of Paris.
	   Thirty-four police were injured in the violence, with one in
critical condition after being hit in the head with a beer bottle.
	   There were other World Cup-related arrests in Bologna, Italy.
Italian police detained 23 people suspected of belonging to a
militant Algerian Islamic group accused of plotting terror attacks
during the tournament.
	   The new roundup brings to nearly 100 the number of people who
have been arrested on such suspicions over the past several weeks.
Arrests also have occurred in France, Germany, Belgium and
Switzerland.
	   There was also good news Wednesday morning. Air France and its
pilots resolved a 10-day strike that had severely embarrassed the
country in the days leading up to the World Cup.
	   The company called for an immediate return to work. But the
airline has said it could take three days for service to return to
normal once the strike ended.
	   The kickoff of the Brazil-Scotland game not only marked the
start of competition, but it was also the deadline for teams to
petition FIFA to replace injured or sick players on their rosters.
	   Italy replaced striker Fabrizio Ravanelli, suffering from an
infection in his right lung, with Parma forward Enrico Chiesa.
Nigeria called up Mobi Oparaku to fill the spot vacated by defender
Jero Shakpoke, who was diagnosed with a broken left collarbone
suffered in the 5-1 loss to the Netherlands last week.

	   DUE to the excellent response to its Information Technology
courses, and calls for more places for tertiary education, HELP
Institute is planning to expand its range of courses and also offer
a distance learning programme.
	   The head of its School of Information Technology Dr Patrick Kee
said the college hoped to offer the new distance learning programme
soon.
	   He said the programme would be so designed that students would
be able to get all the study material they need through the
Internet.
	   The whole process will be done through the Internet including
downloading of study material and perhaps even, in the future,
audio and video study material.
	   ``An allocation of RM1.5 million has been made and work has
started on three new computer laboratories that will not only allow
us to offer distance learning courses but also make available more
advanced computers to students.''
	   Kee said one of the three new laboratories would be dedicated
for teaching multimedia technology while the other two would be for
general use.
	   Once ready, there will be a total of 300 computers available for
students.
	   This will ensure that all students who pass through the
college's doors are computer literate and ready to take on the
challenges of an Information Society.
	   Kee said the college was expanding its IT infrastructure
including multimedia facilities to offer all students access to the
Internet.
	   ``We realise that the Internet will play a very significant role
in the future business and home environment and are therefore
asking all students to take up a course that will familiarise them
with the Internet.''
	   He said the college had drawn up an introductory course for all
new students that will familiarise them with the Internet and its
applications.
	   Students who take up Information Technology courses will have to
undergo a longer course which would introduce them to programming
languages like JAVA.

	   The programme is equivalent to the pre-university courses
offered by secondary schools in Ontario.
	   More than 80 per cent of the teaching staff are Ontario-trained
and to ensure compliance with the guidelines on subjects, the
programme undergoes regular inspection by the Canadian Education
Ministry in Ontario.
	   Under this programme, students are given the flexibility of a
part course-work and part examination-based course.
	   Since its introduction in 1990, more than 2,000 students have
used it to gain entry into international universities.
	   There are two intakes each year, in January and July. The next
intake is now on.
	   Currently, Sunway offers two types of courses under the
programme. One is the Ontario Academic Course (OAC) or university
preparatory programme and the other the foundation course or
pre-OAC.
	   The fee for the programme is RM1,300 per subject for each
semester.
	   Subjects offered under the OAC include Accounting, Economics,
Law, Computer Studies, English, Geography, Calculus, Biology,
Chemistry and Physics.
	   The pre-OAC offers subjects like English as a Second Language,
Computer Fundamentals and Mathematics.
	   The programme's major attraction is its flexibility which allows
students to do a number of subjects which they are comfortable with
over one semester.
	   They are allowed to accumulate the number of subjects until they
pass a minimum of six subjects.
	   Upon successful completion of six OAC subjects, students receive
the Ontario Secondary Schools Diploma (OSSD).
	   ``Our pre-university programme has a graduation rate of more
than 90 per cent and our students have no problem being accepted by
international universities to do degree courses,'' Sunway College's
Canadian Matriculation Programme director John Futa said.
	   Futa said: ``The OSSD is a highly recognised pre-university
qualification that allows students to pursue their higher education
in universities in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United
Kingdom and the United States.''
	   Students can also further their studies through of the twinning
programmes offered at Sunway College.
	   Besides preparing students for entry into universities, the
programme also grooms them with skills to make them well-rounded
individuals.
	   Every year, selected graduates receive Certificate of
Recognition for Outstanding Leadership through their contributions
to the Students' Council, sporting events and the programme's
in-house newspaper.
	   One of the receipients, Tan Lit Kah said the well-rounded
programme ``was what makes CMP a `learning for life' experience and
not just an academic one''.
	   Tan also praised the ``academic rigours'' of the programme, its
cultural, social and sporting activities, the strong support among
students and the dedication of the lecturers.
	   In addition to the Canadian Matriculation Programme, Sunway
College also offers two other pre-university courses, the Cambridge
Board's GCE A-level and the Australian Matriculation Programme.
	   Also offered is a British Engineering foundation course from
Leicester University which is a direct and dedicated route to an
Engineering degree.

	   THE country lost a top educationist when Winston Pereira, the
chairman of the Raffles Education Group passed away, recently.
	   Winston, 45, was the founder of the Raffles Education Group and
former managing director of Stamford College when it was still run
by the Pereira family.
	   Calm and soft spoken, he was instrumental in the rise of
Stamford College as one of the largest colleges in the country, a
success that he repeated with the Olympia Business School which he
took over in 1995.
	   Within three years, the number of campuses increased to five
nationwide with a student population of 7,000 studying courses in
Accountancy, Banking, Computer Science, Business and Marketing,
Mass Communication, Tourism and Hospitality and Secretarial
Science.
	   Winston built up the new college with the same determination
that enabled him to put his seven siblings through school and
university after their father died when Winston was 17.
	   An uncle, Eric Pereira, the founder of Stamford, took Winston
under his wings and taught him the ropes of the business.
	   Winston worked his way up to the post of managing director until
1992 when the family sold its stake in the college.
	   ``He always believed that education should be for all and that
is what made him set up the OBS, which initially offered only
correspondence courses,'' said younger brother and deputy chairman
Colin Pereira.
	   Colin said his brother believed that education should be brought
to the people not the other way around, which is why the college
opened a campus in Kuantan.
	   ``Nothing gave him more satisfaction than seeing the students,
who he often referred to as his children, graduate,'' Colin said,
adding that Winston had never missed any graduation ceremony since
the OBS was founded.
	   College registrar Mary Reggie who worked with Winston for 18
years said he handled the students very well and they were often
surprised that the college chairman took an effort to listen to
their problems and offer advice and assistance.
	   ``He always had comforting words for those with problems and
generous to those with difficulties.
	   ``He had the memory of an elephant and a good eye for details,''
she added.
	   ``He always strove for a balance between his business and social
obligations, which is why the fees charged by the college are
significantly lower than other colleges,'' said another brother
Kevin.
	   ``All decisions made had to ultimately benefit the students,''
he added.
	   ```Don't worry, we'll sort it out', was his favourite phrase
whenever anyone came with a problem and solve it, he did.''
	   Deputy director of corporate affairs Jean Francois Jadin said:
``It was always a learning experience working for him and there
were no problems that could not be overcome.''
	   Although Winston is no longer them, his brothers at Raffles,
together with the management team, want to achieve the targets that
he had set - to have centres in every State and in Indonesia,
Singapore and Bangladesh.
	   So while Winston has departed, his legacy remains in the
corridors of the college and in the hearts of students and staff.

	   THE International Trade and Industry Ministry has approved 269
manufacturing projects valued at RM12.46 billion between January
and April, Minister Datuk Seri Rafidah Aziz said yesterday.
	   She said the ministry had yet to approve another 212
manufacturing projects valued at RM4.02 billion.
	   Last year, a total of 759 projects valued at RM25,821 million
were approved by Miti.
	   Of the total, 462 were new projects while 297 were for expansion
and diversification of existing operations.
	   Rafidah was speaking at a seminar ``Will Malaysia Continue to be
An Attractive Location for Swedish Investment'' organised by the
Malaysian- Swedish Business Association in Kuala Lumpur.
	   During a question-and-answer session at the seminar, Rafidah
said despite the current economic situation, Malaysia remained an
attractive place for foreign direct investors.
	   ``Basic policies and incentives for manufacturing remain intact
and additional flexibilities have been introduced.
	   ``Export-oriented companies are now allowed to sell in the
domestic market without requiring a change in their equity
structure.''
	   Previously, only companies which are export-oriented were
allowed to have 100 per cent foreign equity.
	   She urged companies which need a regional centre or headquarters
to consider Malaysia.
	   Rafidah said: ``Malaysia is not attractive to all types of
manufacturing operations.
	   ``For example, if you want to establish a labour-intensive
manufacturing plant then this is not the place.''
	   However she added that Malaysia was an attractive investment
location for companies that could contribute towards technological
and skills development.
	   To enhance Malaysia's manufacturing sector, priority will be
accorded to research and development efforts with incentives for
companies undertaking research and development.
	   Rafidah said the Malaysian-Swedish Business Association members
should disseminate the right information about Malaysia to
entrepreneurs in Sweden so that the ``right'' companies would take
advantage of the attractive investment climate in the country.
	   ``Tell them the good and the bad to draw a right picture about
Malaysia.''

Sanctions ineffective, Contact Group prepares options
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with French comment, details on meeting &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Aiming to stop the growing conflict in Yugoslavia's
Kosovo province, Western and Russian officials appeared to close
ranks Wednesday by drawing up options against Belgrade that go
beyond ineffective economic sanctions.
	   The talks by the so-called Contact Group came on the eve of a
NATO defense ministers' meeting in Brussels to consider military
options in the wake of Serb army bombardments of ethnic Albanian
homes in independence-minded Kosovo.
	   On Friday foreign ministers from the Group of Eight
industrialized nations are to meet in London to consider the
options drawn up Wednesday by the Contact Group, whose members
``were in perfect agreement,'' the French Foreign Ministry said.
	   ``The deterioration of the situation showed that the time
remaining for a political solution was increasingly short,'' the
ministry said.
	   The group, including France, the United States, Britain,
Germany, Italy and Russia, agreed that Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic was responsible for the increase in violence after
defying international economic sanctions.
	   The proposals to the G-8 would include a first ``phase of
persuasion'' in which Russia is to play an important role in
contacting both Serb-dominated Yugoslavia and the Kosovo Albanians,
said the Contact Group's French representative Jacques Blot at a
news briefing.
	   If Belgrade does not respond, the Contact Group would meet to
carry out the measures agreed on, he said. Blot declined to
describe the options under consideration, only to say they were not
sanctions.
	   Asked if Russia had agreed to possible military intervention, he
said: ``No delegation has excluded the military option.''
	   Blot said the Contact Group felt the U.N. war crimes tribunal in
the Hague, the Netherlands, should investigate cases in Kosovo.
While the European Union and Washington have called some cases
ethnic cleansing, Blot refused to use the term.
	   A senior U.S. official at the Contact Group meeting said the
bombing of homes to clear a cordon sanitaire near the Albanian
border, while aimed at stopping arms shipments, constituted ethnic
cleansing.
	   The growing conflict threatens regional stability, and
Washington feels ``all options are open'' to pressure Serbia, the
official said on condition of anonymity.
	   The conflict in Kosovo, where the ethnic Albanian majority seeks
independence, has killed 250-300 people and created as many as
100,000 refugees, the official said. Among them are up to 85,000
displaced people in Kosovo, 10,000 in Albania and thousands of
others who have fled to other countries.
	   Witnesses said Serbian MiG-21 jets have bombed homes, and
international observers have seen heavy artillery damage to homes.

	   I WATCHED with such interest and sadness a documentary entitled
The Selling of Innocents, about the trafficking of girls for
prostitution in the slums of India, shown repeatedly over Mega TV's
HBO channel.
	   Many young girls, mostly from remote Indian villages, are sold
to brothels in Bombay and other cities by their parents or male
siblings to settle debts. And these girls could spend the next 10
years or more paying up their purchase price to the procurers who
roam villages to recruit them.
	   Some are promised jobs in the city. Radio and television, with
their portrayal of the sophisticated and glamorous city life, also
contribute to the problem.
	   Those fortunate enough to be rescued from the clutches of
procurers and pimps report of beatings, torture, rape, sodomy,
isolation and starvation.
	   Ironically, some of the traffickers are women themselves.
	   The documentary brought viewers to the mountain villages of
Nepal, 1,500km from Bombay and one of the world's poorest
countries, where young girls are favoured by procurers for their
light complexion, good looks and docility.
	   These girls, it seems, are raised to obey their fathers,
brothers and husbands in a country where women are considered
little more than chattels, and hence easily sold off to pay family
debts.
	   Some 100,000 young Nepalese girls are believed to be working in
the city brothels of India.
	   The documentary also looked at the issue of girls given away to
temples to dance and slave for them, but who ended up in brothels
as some of the temples have links with them.
	   Social activists like Dr Gracy Fernandez and Vinod Gupta are
creating public awareness on the issue through campaigns to educate
sex workers on safe sex, distributing free condoms, rescuing them
from brothels and setting up shelters.
	   The documentary took a look at the work of Gupta, a former
politician whose non-governmental organisation, with police help,
is conducting raids on Bombay's slum brothels.
	   One raid was conducted based on a plea for help contained in a
letter slipped out of the Solapur brothel. The raiding team
initially failed to find anyone Then they broke into the padlocked
backrooms and attic and saw frightened teenage prostitutes huddled
together in the dark. These girls had not stepped out of the
brothel in three years.
	   The madams, who had earlier disappeared, soon returned but were
not arrested by the police. Apparently, some personnel were on the
brothel's kickback list.
	   The documentary also focused on goings-on in the Solapur brothel
and its poor living conditions. Some women complained of not having
enough to eat while they also had to fend for their children. Some
had HIV/AIDS, and although they received free condoms from
volunteer groups, many clients refused to use them.
	   In some villages, women are fighting back as they realise the
only way out is to be economically independent and to provide
education to their daughters - something they were doing only for
sons.
	   They conduct talks to change outdated thinking that places women
as second-class citizens.
	   ``We women must change because even we are not happy when
daughters are born,'' a woman activist told a crowd of village
women, watched sheepishly by some of the menfolk.
	   Although we are moving into the next millennium, one thing is
obvious from this documentary - that we have still a long way to go
in ending discrimination, ill-treatment and exploitation of women,
who make up half of humanity.

Police question survivors who claim officer shot Haitian refugees

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with police questioning survivors. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COCKBURN TOWN, Turks and Caicos (AP) _ Police on Wednesday
questioned Haitian refugees who claim an officer shot at and hit
passengers on their overcrowded boat.
	   At least six people drowned when the vessel capsized after
Monday's shooting, just 15 miles (25 kilometers) from
Providenciales, the largest of the British Turks and Caicos
islands. A tourism boom there has attracted hundreds of Haitians to
work on resort construction sites and in hotels.
	   Some of the 75 survivors claim there were 113 people on the
boat, but police divers and other searchers found no more bodies or
survivors Wednesday, said Bryan Davies, deputy police commissioner
of the island chain between Cuba and the Bahamas.
	   Davies said investigators looking for clues were working
Wednesday to raise the boat, a 35-foot (10.5-meter) wooden sailing
sloop submerged just off French Cay.
	   Marine police apparently had tried without success to get the
captain of the sloop to stop.
	   ``One of the officers present admits that warning shots were
fired,'' Davies said in a telephone interview. He said the marine
police were armed with small submachine guns since most of their
work involves halting drug traffickers.
	   ``Some of the passengers are alleging that people were shot,
although none of the survivors have any injuries from bullets, nor
any of the six bodies that we recovered,'' Davies said.
	   A pathologist from Miami's Dade County coroner's office was
expected to arrive Wednesday to establish whether any of the bodies
had bullet wounds, Davies said.
	   The investigation was hampered and likely to be prolonged
because the survivors spoke only Creole and were reluctant to give
information since their trip was illegal.
	   Five Creole-speaking police officers arrived Wednesday from
Bermuda, another British territory, to help interrogate the
detained survivors.
	   Davies said the sloop was just one of dozens that come to the
Turks and Caicos from its southern neighbor, many carrying drugs
and illegal immigrants.
	   ``Last year alone we sent back over 1,000 (refugees) and since
Christmas the police alone have detained more than 200,'' he said.
	   Officials estimate about 8,000 Haitians live among the islands'
15,000 citizens, about 2,000 of them illegally.

Newspaper: Arafat may retire after signing withdrawal deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A government-owned newspaper said that
Yasser Arafat will step down as leader of the Palestinian Authority
for health reasons, possibly after signing a deal with Israel on a
withdrawal from the West Bank.
	   The Al-Gomhuriya newspaper reported in its early Thursday
edition that Ahmed Qurai, head of the Palestinian Legislative
Council, or Salim Zaanoun, speaker of the Palestine National
Council, will take over until a new president is elected.
	   Palestinian officials were not immediately available to comment
on the report.
	   The newspaper based its report on unidentified Palestinian
sources.
	   ``Palestinian sources confirmed that Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat will retire for health reasons,'' the newspaper said.
	   The sources ``suggested that Arafat may retire after signing the
agreement with Israel on the Israeli withdrawal from the West
Bank,'' it said.
	   Israel's Cabinet is expected to vote by the end of the week on a
U.S. initiative for a 13 percent pullback from the West Bank, which
Israel seized from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast War. The Palestinians
already have accepted the proposal.
	   Arafat was expected in Cairo Thursday for talks with President
Hosni Mubarak on the stalled Middle East peace process.
	   There have been persistent rumors that the health of the
68-year-old Palestinian leader is failing.

Taiwanese officials consider importing Virgin Islands sheep
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ A breed of sheep
from the U.S. Virgin Islands that tolerates tropical heat well may
soon find its way to Taiwan, officials said after a visit by
Taiwanese agriculture officials.
	   The visitors from Taiwan's Livestock Research Institute said
Tuesday they were impressed by the Virgin Islands white-haired
sheep, a breed that has no wool and is raised for its meat. They
expressed interest in raising them, said Jim Rakocy, a University
of the Virgin Islands researcher who accompanied the group.
	   The animals have already been exported to farms in Portugal, and
local agriculture officials are trying to interest South American
ranchers in the breed.
	   The Taiwanese delegation visited the Virgin Islands for four
days under a technical exchange agreement signed by Gov. Schneider
during a trip to Taiwan in December.

	   PHILIPSBURG, St. Maarten (AP) _ Hundreds of St. Maarten
residents are protesting what they call racist proposals to allow
Europeans to enter the island freely while requiring visas from
residents of other Caribbean islands.
	   About 700 of the Dutch territory's 34,000 residents sent a
petition Wednesday to the United Nations and the Caribbean
Community urging them to oppose a proposed immigration treaty
between the Netherlands and France. The two countries share the
island of St. Martin.
	   Currently, all foreigners must have visas to enter St. Maarten,
where the island's main airport is located.
	   Under the agreement, the 300 million residents of the European
Union's 15 member countries would be able to enter without visas.
	   France approved the agreement in 1994, and the Dutch legislature
is expected to vote on it this fall.
	   Opponents call the accord racist, noting that most residents in
neighboring Caribbean countries are black.
	   ``The agreement is arguably an instrument of genocide by
substitution _ perceivably legalized ethnic cleansing against the
current St. Maarten population,'' said pro-independence author
Lasana M. Sekou, who helped organize the petition and a protest
against the accord in March.
	   The petition asks the United Nations and the Caribbean Community
``to engage all efforts, legislative and lobbyist, with the Dutch
and French governments against the Franco-Dutch accord before it is
ratified as a treaty.''

	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Brazil won, Scotland lost _ but the
fans' reactions showed how the stakes can vary for different
countries at this year's World Cup.
	   As the blue-and-white warpaint ran down his cheeks in the
post-match pouring rain, the defiant Scot grinned and said he was
sure his team would go far in the World Cup.
	   ``We were brilliant. Classy. Our spirit showed,'' said Paul
McGuinness, dressed in tartan green trousers and sporting a flaming
red wig.
	   Not far away, a group of Brazilians, draped in national flags,
trudged out of the stadium, downcast. ``We were too defensive.
Playing that way we won't win the tournament. We lacked soul,''
said Gina Souza.
	   In Wednesday's opening match of the World Cup, Brazil beat
Scotland 2-1 to kick off their defense of the title with a victory.
	   Brazil's superior technique was clear throughout the match, but
Scotland refused to be overawed, and a battling performance almost
earned them a priceless point. But an own goal by Tommy Boyd in the
second half settled the match.
	   But the two sets of fans reflected each country's ambition.
While Brazil is seeking a record fifth World Cup title, Scotland is
hoping to get into the second round for the first time ever.
	   Coach Craig Brown said his team was ``devastated'' at conceding
the late goal. But the Scottish fans were content, roaring with
approval whenever their players, renowned for strength rather than
skill, tried to play the Brazilians at their own flamboyant game.
	   ``I was proud to wear Scotland's colors,'' said Johnny Dowell,
decked out in Scotland's full blue-and-white kit. ``We were playing
the best in the world and if we keep it up, we'll qualify for the
next round.''
	   ``We might not be the best, but we make up for it by battling
And we shoed some style too.''
	   Alex McCuaig had paid dlrs 9,600 francs (dlrs 1,600) for two
tickets on the black market just before the game: ``It was my first
international match, but well worth it. Unbelievable. Our defense
was better than Brazil's, but they were better up front.''
	   ``But on that form, we'll go far,'' he said in a bar heaving
with Scots next to the Stade de France.
	   Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo said he was just relieved to start
off with a win, saying Scotland had been ``a major obstacle.''
	   Such words brought pain to the face of Sergio Nomme, from Belo
Horizonte.
	   ``Zagallo doesn't understand that we must play with flair, not
defensively. We have to win the World Cup, and with style,'' he
said. ``That's how it is.''
	   Commuting back to Paris, Paolo Tropeiro summed up his country's
dilemma: ``We were brought up on Pele and Zico,'' he said. ``Okay,
we won the World Cup in 1994, but it wasn't the Brazil we wanted to
see.''
	   ``We want to win, there's no doubt. But we also want to
thrill.''

Pan-African leader predicts African teams in World Cup final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ President Blaise Campaore, the
new leader of Africa's largest political body, the Organization of
African Unity, on Wednesday predicted that two African teams will
meet in the World Cup final.
	   Campaore, who became OAU chairman in his capacity as Burkina
Faso's president at a summit of heads of state here offered best
wishes to the five African teams _ Cameroon, Morocco, Nigeria,
Tunisia and South Africa _ contesting the Cup.
	   ``There will be two African teams in the final,'' Campaore said
to applause during the pan-African summit's closing ceremonies.
	   ``I would like, in the name of the whole of Africa, to address
the unanimous support of the continent and our wishes for success
to our noble representatives,'' he added.
	   Campaore, a keen soccer follower, was a vocal supporter of his
own national side, low-ranked Burkina Faso, during the African Cup
of Nations hosted by the West African country in February. Burkina
Faso lost in the tournament quarterfinals after surpassing all
expectations.

Police question survivors who claim officer shot Haitian refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COCKBURN TOWN, Turks and Caicos (AP) _ Police questioned
survivors Wednesday who claim an officer shot at and hit refugees
on a Haitian sloop overcrowded with boat people.
	   At least six people drowned when the vessel capsized after
Monday's shooting, just 15 miles (25 kilometers) from
Providenciales, the largest of the British Turks and Caicos
islands. A tourism boom there has attracted hundreds of Haitians to
work on resort construction sites and in hotels.
	   Some of the 75 survivors claim there were 113 people on the
boat, but police divers and other searchers found no more bodies or
survivors Wednesday, said Bryan Davies, deputy police commissioner
of the island chain between Cuba and the Bahamas and about 600
miles (950 kilometers) southeast of Florida.
	   Davies said investigators looking for clues were working
Wednesday to raise the boat, a 35-foot (10.5-meter) wooden sailing
sloop submerged just off French Cay.
	   Marine police on a launch apparently had tried without success
to get the captain of the sloop to stop.
	   ``One of the officers present admits that warning shots were
fired,'' Davies said in a telephone interview. He said the marine
police were armed with small submachine guns since most of their
work involves drug interdiction against heavily armed
narcotraffickers.
	   ``Some of the passengers are alleging that people were shot,
although none of the survivors have any injuries from bullets, nor
any of the six bodies that we recovered,'' Davies said.
	   A pathologist from Miami's Dade County coroner's office was
expected to arrive Wednesday to establish whether any of the bodies
had bullet wounds, Davies said.
	   The investigation was hampered and likely to be prolonged
because the survivors spoke only Creole and were reluctant to give
information since their trip was illegal.
	   Five Creole-speaking police officers arrived Wednesday from
Bermuda, another British territory, to help interrogate the
detained survivors.
	   Davies said the sloop was just one of dozens that come to the
Turks and Caicos from its southern neighbor, many carrying drugs
and illegal immigrants.
	   ``Last year alone we sent back over 1,000 (refugees) and since
Christmas the police alone have detained more than 200,'' he said.
	   Officials estimate about 8,000 Haitians live among the islands'
15,000 citizens, about 2,000 of them illegally.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Peru and the United States signed an agreement
Wednesday to gradually increase the number of flights between the
countries leading to an open skies policy in 2002.
	   The agreement increases the number of flights allowed each week
from 42 to 63 immediately, and will raise the number allowed each
year until June 2002. From then on, there will be no restrictions
on the number of flights, Transportation Minister Antonio Paucar
said.
	   The treaty also increases the number of U.S. destinations
permitted for Peruvian flights to 15 from six.
	   It increases the number of destinations in Peru allowed for U.S.
flights to three, meaning flights can land not only in Lima, but
also in the Andean city of Cusco and the Amazon jungle city of
Iquitos.
	   Cusco is the airport nearest to the ancient Incan citadel of
Machu Picchu, Peru's top tourist attraction.
	   With flights to Iquitos, Peruvian authorities hope to encourage
ecotourism to its Amazon rain forest.

	   He will replace Mauricio Wurmser, who resigned.

	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ The Lempa River Hydroelectric
Commission on Wednesday successfully auctioned the first
installment of shares in electrical utilities as part of a
government privatization program.
	   In two hours, the nearly 70,000 shares in the first batch were
snapped up on the Salvadoran stock exchange for a total of 12
million colones, equivalent to dlrs 1.5 million.
	   Stock exchange president Guillermo Hidalgo Quelh said there was
great demand for the shares and called the sale ``a smashing
success.''
	   A total of 1.6 million shares are being auctioned in the four
batches, for an estimated dlrs 7 million. Each batch is sold over
six days; Wednesday was the first day of the first batch.
	   Around 75 percent of the shares of the four public utilities
were purchased by strategic partners at the beginning of the year
for dlrs 586.1 million.
	   Another 20 percent were reserved for the workers, and now the
remaining five percent is being sold.

Albanians rally in Kosovo's capital, appeal for NATO help

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ About 20,000 people filled the
streets of Kosovo's capital on Wednesday in the 60th day of
protests against the Serb crackdown on the province's
independence-seeking ethnic Albanians. Waving photos of people
killed in the crackdown, they appealed for help from NATO.
	   Organizers of the demonstrations in Pristina later called a halt
to such protests amid indications that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic would back efforts to ease tensions in the southern
province.
	   More than 250 people have died since Serb security forces
started offensives in early March aimed at stopping militant
separatists in the province, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs
by 9-to-1.
	   After earlier imposing sanctions, Western powers are taking a
hard look this week at the use of force to stop the crackdown.
	   Demonstrators in Pristina chanted ``U-C-K,'' the Albanian
language acronym for the militant Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The protesters carried photos that they said were those of
victims in the crackdown and waved posters _ one imploring, `Help,
NATO, help.''
	   Groups leaving the rally got into a stone-throwing melee near
the university with Serbs. Police broke up the brawl.
	   Organizers later said they would stop ``this form of protest.''
It was not clear why their decision to stop the protests came now,
or whether the decision would stick.
	   Also Wednesday, Serb police burst into a meeting of the
underground Albanian-only university in Pristina, beating 24
professors and one student, the pro-Albanian Kosovo Information
Center said. Six professors were badly injured.
	   Serbia and the smaller republic of Montenegro make up what
remains of Yugoslavia.
	   After presiding over a leadership meeting of his ruling
Socialist Party, Milosevic issued a statement Wednesday saying that
the party ``supports measures taken by the state bodies aimed at
normalizing the situation'' in Kosovo.
	   The party also stressed the need for ``organized efforts to
decrease tensions and take measures that would restore confidence
between members of different ethnic communities in Kosovo,'' the
state news agency Tanjug reported. But it also warned that
``terrorists'' would be ``decisively'' confronted.
	   Meanwhile, the Kosovo Information Center, which is linked to the
ethnic Albanians, said Serbian government forces had brought in
reinforcements near the town of Djakovica, where Albanians spotted
10 buses with troops, seven trucks and six armored vehicles.
	   The center also said a group of Kosovo Albanian parties appealed
to the U.N. Security Council for ``urgently needed'' military
actions by NATO, claiming that economic sanctions already levied
against Serbia were not enough.
	   NATO defense ministers were scheduled to meet in Brussels on
Thursday and Friday to discuss Kosovo, and possible military
intervention was expected to be on the agenda, alliance officials
said.
	   Chased by the fighting, thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees
from Kosovo have trekked on perilous mountain paths into northern
Albania.
	   An estimated 12,000 refugees have fled to Albania, a U.N.
refugee official, Mans Nyberg, said Wednesday in Belgrade.
	   An additional 5,200 fled to Montenegro, Nyberg said. There were
other reports that as many as 10,000 had fled to the neighboring
republic.
	   Nyberg estimated that about 42,000 Kosovo people were displaced
within the province. A Kosovo-based human rights organization
earlier had estimated the total at 50,000.

	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Villagers who support
leftist rebels clashed with state police in at least two shootouts
Wednesday in southern Chiapas state. At least one police officer
was killed and five were wounded. Unconfirmed reports said six
Zapatista supporters were also killed.
	   Witnesses said the clashes started when state police, backed by
army troops, tried to dismantle a parallel town council the rebel
supporters had set up in the village of El Bosque, 25 miles (40
kms) north of San Cristobal. Local residents said six rebel
supporters were killed, but there was no official confirmation.
	   Police and troops moved in early Wednesday to El Bosque and the
nearby communities of Los Platanos, Union y Progreso and
Chabajebal. The gunfights began in the early morning, and sporadic
shooting could still be heard outside Chabajebal at 1:30 p.m.
	   By late afternoon, the fighting had stopped and all communities
were under government control, Deputy Attorney General Eduardo
Montoya said. He said 17 people had been arrested.
	   Jose Luis Zenteno, a public security officer, said in San
Cristobal that he and several others policemen were driving to
search a house in El Bosque when several men _ believed to be
Zapatista rebels and wearing ski masks _ opened fire with automatic
weapons.
	   Zenteno said one officer was killed and five were wounded in the
7 a.m. ambush. One of the injured was hit by a bullet while riding
in a helicopter, Montoya said.
	   Details remained unclear because state police and soldiers
prevented most foreign and national journalists from getting near
the scene of the fighting, allowing in only local journalists.
	   Sympathizers of the Zapatista National Liberation Army had set
up a rebel town council in El Bosque 2 1/2 years ago. Members of
the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party had their own town
council at a house a few blocks away.
	   The two town councils appeared to coexist peacefully until
Wednesday.
	   The Zapatista rebels staged a brief uprising on Jan. 1, 1994,
saying they were fighting for more rights and better living
conditions for the Mexico's poor Indians. Peace talks are stalled
over the government's failure to implement an accord on Indian
autonomy.
	   At least 40,000 federal troops patrol the state. The government
has been accused of links to vigilante groups that have clashed
with Zapatista supporters, including a band that massacred 45 rebel
sympathizers in the town of Acteal late last year.
	   Supporters of the Zapatistas have set up 32 parallel town
councils _ most of them a symbolic presence _ since late 1994. The
government late last year began breaking them up, and 28 now
remain.

Norway and Morocco play wide-open 2-2 draw

	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Fighting spirit is one of Norway's
strongest assets. The Norwegians showed it again Wednesday night,
twice fighting back from one-goal deficits to tie Morocco 2-2 in
their Group A opener.
	   Dan Eggen, a tall defender who couldn't hold off Abdeljilil
Hadda when the Moroccan made it 2-1 in the 59th minute, made up by
heading in Norway's equalizer just two minutes later to salvage the
point.
	   Eggen scored when Stig Inge Bjornebye's free kick was sprung
loose in the penalty box after a collision between defender
Noureddine Naybet and goalkeeper Driss Benzekri. Amid the disarray,
Eggen opportunistically headed the ball easily into the net.
	   ``Both Norway and Morocco played well,'' Eggen said. ``Morocco
was as good as we feared. This is not disappointing because Morocco
has a good team and they played very well. Both Scotland and Brazil
will have problems with Morocco.''
	   Midfielder Tahar set up both goals for Morocco with long,
precision passes, while Norway netted twice on clumsy plays off
free kicks.
	   Morocco took its first lead in the 38th minute on splendid move
by Moustafa El Hadji. After taking the long pass from Tahar, the
Deportivo La Coruna midfielder sped down the left side and spun
Eggen around before blasting home a right-footed shot just inside
the right post.
	   But Youssef Chippo, attempting to clear the ball wide, instead
headed it into his own goal one minute into first-half injury time
to tie it 1-1. Chippo's error came after goalkeeper Driss Benzekri
collided with Henning Berg as they leapt for Bjornebye's free kick
from the left of the box.
	   ``We were rather disappointed when after the first goal we made
that mistake,'' Morocco's coach Henri Michel said. ``This is our
weak point and we have to work on that.''
	   The Norwegians _ fourth in the world on FIFA's rankings and
unbeaten in 15 games _ also felt they should have had more than a
draw.
	   ``I think we started very well and should have scored very
easily, but didn't,'' said Norwegian coach Egil ``Drillo'' Olsen,
referring to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's point-blank miss early. ``After
that we lost control. We couldn't stop them from creating chances.
They were tired at the end of the match when we were the better
team.''
	   Hadda gave Morocco its second lead when he took Tahar's perfect
upfield pass and raced past Eggen before settling himself and
placing the ball into the upper right corner of the net.
	   Eggen then equalized, and the Norwegians had three late chances
to win, the best one coming when Havard Flo broke through the
defense but had his shot saved by a diving Benzekri.
	   The tie extended Norway's international unbeaten streak to 15
games. Its last loss came with a B team in Australia early last
year.
	   It also wasn't surprising that both of the team's goals came off
set plays _ 12 of its 21 goals in qualifying were scored the same
way.
	   The Norwegians have already doubled their scoring output from
the 1994 World Cup, when they scored only one goal in three games
before being eliminated.
	   The Moroccans also have an immediate show of improvement _ they
lost all of their three games and scored only two goals before
heading home from the United States four years ago.

 &UR; Netherlands cites its drug program as means of curbing demand,
death &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Netherlands cited its permissive drug
laws Wednesday as an effective way to combat the hard drug trade
and keep people safe from drug-related illnesses.
	   Speaking to the U.N. General Assembly's anti-drug session, Dutch
Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo said the primary goal of his
government's drug policy was to ``protect health and social
well-being and to reduce the harm and risks associated with drug
abuse.''
	   The Netherlands allows its citizens to use marijuana for
therapeutic and recreational purposes. Officials argue that by
tolerating the small-scale trade in those drugs makes users less
likely to progress to harder drugs such as heroin and cocaine.
	   ``Now one may ask whether our programs do not lead to an
increase in drug abuse,'' van Mierlo said. ``Our experience is that
they do not.
	   ``On the contrary, needle exchange programs, for instance, have
not led to more intravenous drug use, but they have led to less
people sharing needles. Consequently, few addicts in the
Netherlands suffer from AIDS,'' he said.
	   The Netherlands policy is a model for those who support
legalization or decriminalization of drugs _ something the U.N.
drug fighting board rejected Wednesday.
	   ``The board appreciates the frustration of the public, the
frustration of the government officials, the frustration of the
people in the field, on the issue that the war against drugs has
failed,'' said Hamid Ghodse, president of the International
Narcotics Control Board.
	   However, legalization is not the answer but is rather a
``shortcut'' that doesn't solve the problem, Ghodse said.
	   In his speech, van Mierlo said by making some drugs legal, the
government ``prevents drug users from going underground, where we
cannot reach them.''
	   The Netherlands doesn't consider drug users criminals, van
Mierlo said. Drug users ``on the contrary, should be provided the
help they need.''

Mariners stop Giants' streak; Mets down Devil Rays
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Wednesday's early games; will be updated &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ The longest winning streak in the majors
this year ended Wednesday when the San Francisco Giants lost 4-1 to
the Seattle Mariners, and the Giants may have lost a lot more than
a game.
	   David Segui drove in three runs for the Mariners, who broke
their own four-game losing streak and ended the Giants' 11-game
winning streak.
	   Right-hander Orel Hershiser left the game for San Francisco
after being hit on the wrist by a line drive, and Barry Bonds left
the game with tightness in his left calf. He was hit by a pitch in
the leg earlier in the game.
	   The two injuries came hours after the Giants placed second
baseman Jeff Kent on the disabled list with a sprained right knee.
He was hurt in Tuesday night's game against the Mariners.
	   Segui, who went 1-for-4 and had his average drop one point to
.341, had a two-run single in the first and an RBI groundout in the
third. Russ Davis added an RBI single in the fifth for Seattle.
	   Rey Sanchez had an RBI single in the fifth for the Giants.
	   Bill Swift (6-3) allowed one run on five hits in seven innings
for Seattle. Swift, who pitched for the Giants in 1992-94, struck
out seven as he won his fourth straight start. Heathcliff Slocumb
pitched the ninth for his first save. Hershiser (6-4), who had won
his previous six starts, allowed four runs on six hits and five
walks before being knocked out of the game in the fifth.
 &UR; Mets 3, Devil Rays 2
	   In New York, Al Leiter won his fourth straight start and the New
York Mets got two gift runs on five walks by Rick White in the
first inning for a win over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
	   Leiter (7-3) allowed one run and four hits with nine strikeouts
in six innings. The left-hander dropped his ERA to 1.70, second in
the NL to Atlanta's Greg Maddux.
	   The Mets got just four hits, but took advantage of White's
first-inning wildness and Butch Huskey's sixth-inning homer to win
for the 12th time in their last 14 home games.
	   Mike DiFelice had two of Tampa Bay's six hits. The Devil Rays
have lost seven of nine.
	   Dennis Cook struck out the side in the eighth as the Mets
recorded a season-high 14 strikeouts. Mel Rojas allowed an RBI
double to Wade Boggs in the ninth before picking up his second
save.

Andrews feeling good about her game
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EAST LANSING, Michigan (AP) _ Donna Andrews has putted her way
to the top of the LPGA money list.
	   Andrews, 31, has earned more than dlrs '465,000 this season with
a victory in the Longs Drugs Challenge in early April and runner-up
finishes in each of the last three LPGA events heading into the
Oldsmobile Classic, which gets under way Thursday.
	   ``My whole game has been good,'' Andrews said Wednesday
following a pro-am round. ``I am hitting a lot of greens and
fairways, but the big difference is that I have started making some
putts. My putting has been more consistent, although it still comes
and goes.''
	   Andrews, who suffered a back injury in 1995, credits more time
on the practice green.
	   ``I have been able to spend more time working on it. About 15
minutes a day was all I could spend standing there putting,'' she
said.
	   ``I don't think I have changed my (putting) stroke, but I have
changed my routine. Now my routine is much more solid. This is
probably the best I have ever putted. I am rolling the ball more
consistently than ever.''
	   Andrews, who has won six times on the LPGA tour, including three
times in 1994, tied for 17th in last year's Olds Classic.
	   ``I have always played OK here, but I have never felt that I
played real well here.
	   ``I have had a lot of great weeks lately, but I feel like I
still am not at the top of my game. I know I can play better. I am
not playing the best golf I can play.''
	   Andrews will be vying for the dlrs '97,500 winner's share of the
Oldsmobile Classic's dlrs '650,000 purse. The tournament, which Pat
Hurst won last year, will be played Thursday through Sunday on the
par-72 course at Walnut Hills Country Club.

 &UR; Hungary opposes legalizing drugs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Hungary opposes any effort to legalize
``soft'' drugs or distribute limited amounts of heroin to addicts _
rejecting programs underway in the Netherlands and Switzerland.
	   ``Hungary is against any attempt to liberalize access to soft
drugs or to heroin distribution techniques, and it continues to
oppose legalization of any illegal drugs,'' Welfare Minister Mihaly
Kokeny said Wednesday.
	   Speaking at the final session of the three-day U.N. General
Assembly special session on drugs, Kokeny said such practices
``would contradict not only the spirit of the U.N. Convention but
it could have an adverse affect on anti-drug educational activities
among young people.''
	   The Netherlands permits its citizens to use limited amounts of
marijuana for medical or recreational use. Switzerland reported
success in a program to give limited amounts of heroin to addicts.
	   The Swiss plan was designed to curb heroin use, reduce crime and
prevent the spread of HIV through dirty needles.

World Cup: Injury makes Arendse's dream a nightmare
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: REPEATING to RESTORE ``Soccer'' to slug. &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VICHY, France (AP) _ South African players have long dreamed of
finally getting the chance to play in a soccer World Cup. For
goalkeeper Andre Arendse, the dream has become a nightmare.
	   Injured in training Monday, Arendse will miss the tournament
after having damaged ligaments removed from his left knee on
Tuesday night.
	   ``My dream is gone,'' the lanky Fulham F.C. player, who turns 31
later this month, said after getting out of the hospital Wednesday.
``I have to put it behind me.''
	   Arendse led South Africa to victory in the 1996 African Nations
Cup tournament but was dropped from the team last year after former
coach Clive Barker resigned.
	   He regained his spot under new coach Philippe Troussier, who
took over in March, but was expected to back up Hans Vonk of
Heerenveen F.C. and Brian Baloyi of local club Kaizer Chiefs at the
World Cup. Team officials named Paul Evans of local club Supersport
United as Arendse's replacement.
	   The news was not all bad Wednesday, as captain Lucas Radebe of
Leeds United returned to fulltime training after bruising his heel
in Saturday's 1-1 draw against Iceland.
	   South Africa begins play Friday night in a Group C clash against
host France in Marseilles. Arendse's injury was a lone
disappointment so far for players lapping up the experience of
their country's first World Cup.
	   For 28 years until 1992, South Africa was banned from
international soccer because of apartheid. The players watched
World Cup matches on television, but actually taking the field
against the planet's best nations seemed impossible.
	   Midfielder Brendan Augustine, 26, recalled that ``it never
crossed my mind'' that he would play in a World Cup.
	   ``It was out of this world, a dream I never imagined,'' he said.
``Now that it's happening, it's out of this world.''
	   David Nyathi of St. Gallen, another midfielder, took a
philosophical view, saying the World Cup was like any other goal or
challenge a man faces, such as getting married or becoming a
father.
	   ``This is one of those dreams that becomes reality,'' said
Nyathi, 29. ``I have to say thank God I'm one of the people to be
representing South Africa in this glorious moment.''
	   He noted other South African players, including legends such as
former national coach Jomo Sono, never played in a World Cup
because of the apartheid ban.
	   ``It's a pity others never got a chance,'' he said.
	   Defender Mark Fish of Bolton Wanderers also mentioned those left
out by the political imbroglio.
	   ``We're representing South Africa, not only the republic but
also the players of the past who never had a chance,'' said Fish,
25. ``To play the host nation in the World Cup is the biggest
stage. It's a dream come true.''
	   Except for Arendse.

Els seeks three-peat at Buick Classic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOEL STASHENKO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARRISON, New York (AP) _ Ernie Els hasn't just prevailed the
last two years at the Buick Classic, he has pulverized both the
field and the course.
	   Two firsts, one second and one fourth in four career
appearances, dlrs 662,850 in winnings and consecutive wire-to-wire
victories.
	   Now Els goes for a three-peat starting Thursday. He is trying to
become only the 13th golfer to win the same tournament three
straight years and the first since Tom Watson at the Byron Nelson
Classic (1978-80).
	   Since the start of the 1996 tournament at Westchester Country
Club, Els has never been out of the lead or over par in eight
rounds.
	   The South African won the 1996 tournament by eight strokes. Last
year, he tied the four-round tournament record of 16-under 268.
	   Els, in his aw-shucks manner, has few answers about why he has
played so well on the par-71 layout, which is regarded as one of
the tougher courses on the PGA Tour.
	   ``When you've had success at a certain golf course, you feel at
home,'' Els said. ``This is a good golf course. I've always liked
to come here and play.''
	   Others, however, have their theories about Els' success.
	   ``With the greens being so firm, Ernie hits the ball very high
and very long and lands the ball softly on the greens,'' Jim Furyk
said. ``That plays perfectly to this golf course.''
	   Davis Love III thinks it's because ``he hits it real straight
and he's a great putter.'' And for someone who hits the ball as far
as Els, he is also an unusually patient and methodical player, Love
said.
	   Foreign players have traditionally played well at the Buick
Classic _ Lee Janzen in 1994 was the only American-born winner
since 1991 _ and that may again be the case.
	   Only two of the top 10 players on the PGA money-leader list, No.
7 Furyk and No. 8 Mark Calcavecchia, are entered. Players such as
Fred Couples, Tiger Woods and Justin Leonard preferred to take the
week off or prepare early for next week's U.S. Open at The Olympic
Club in San Francisco.
	   The prospect of having to play in suburban New York and then fly
cross country for practice at the Open caused several top American
players to skip the Buick Classic.
	   ``It's so far away,'' Furyk said. ``If you play well here, the
flights are limited. It's going to be hard to get out. You're going
to get in (to San Francisco) real late on Sunday night and
therefore it's probably going to cut some of your (practice) time
down on Monday.''
	   On the other hand, 17 of the top 30 players internationally are
at the Buick, led by the top-ranked Els, 1993 and 1995 Buick
Classic winner Vijay Singh, Darren Clarke, Jesper Parnevik, Jose
Maria Olazabal, Joe Ozaki and Lee Westwood. Many are treating the
tournament as a stopover on their way to the West Coast.
	   ``Basically, it is halfway between England and San Francisco,''
Westwood said.
	   Plus, the Westchester Country Club resembles a U.S. Open course,
with its narrow, tree-lined fairways, thick rough and fast, firm
greens.
	   Els, who will defend his 1997 U.S. Open title at Olympica, said
courses such as Westchester remind him of the ones he played
growing up in South Africa.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In the West Bank town of Hebron, a middle aged
man carried a TV across the city's dusty streets to the Al Quds
Cafe Wednesday so Palestinian patrons, some in Arab robes, could
enjoy the opening game of the World Cup soccer tournament.
	   In the executive dining room of Israel's parliament, the
Knesset, TVs were ordered to remain switched on to the World Cup
all month long so lawmakers could pop-in for updates in between
sessions.
	   All across Israel and the Palestinian territories Wednesday,
streets were deserted, sunflower seeds _ a favorite Israeli
accompaniment to sporting events _ were hard to come by and pizza
parlors hired extra delivery staff.
	   In Ramallah, West Bank, Palestinian men and women broke with
religious tradition and sat together at the Kanbata cafe drinking
beer and munching pretzels in front of a large screen TV. The cafe
strung soccer balls and French and Brazilian flags from the
ceiling.
	   In Jerusalem, Scottish soccer fans shared drinks with Israeli
soldiers at the Underground English Pub where a pint of beer sold
for the special World Cup price of five shekels (dlrs 1.75).
	   ``Everybody will make time to come watch this, it's a universal
unifier,'' said Banan Hazir, a 28 year-old Palestinian student of

Sugar production from six Caribbean countries reaches 472,000 tons

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ The six member countries of Sugar
Association of the Caribbean together produced about 472,000 metric
tons (512,000 short tons) of sugar between November and May 31, the
group reported Wednesday.
	   Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, Belize, St. Kitts and Nevis,
Guyana and Jamaica exported about 253,000 metric tons (278,300
short tons) to Europe under treaty arrangements giving preference
to Caribbean sugar, and 35,400 metric tons (38,900 short tons)
under other arrangements, the group said.
	   Sugar exports to the United States totaled 31,000 metric tons
(34,000 short tons), and 13,800 metric tons (15,100 short tons)
went to other markets.
	   Barbados produced 47,900 metric tons (52,700 short tons),
Belize, 92,000 metric tons (101,000 short tons), and Jamaica
produced 141,300 metric tons (155,400 short tons). St. Kitts
produced 21,500 metric tons (23,700 short tons), Guyana 90,000
metric tons (99,000 short tons), and Trinidad and Tobago, 78,800
metric tons (86,700 short tons), the association said.
	   The sugar harvest began in November in Jamaica, December in
Belize, and January in Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados and St. Kitts
and Nevis. The harvest started in February in Guyana.
	   In April, the association lowered its projections for the
1997-1998 crop from 732,000 metric tons (805,200 short tons) to
725,000 metric tons (797,500 short tons) because of drought in some
islands caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon.

	   DETROIT (AP) _ As expected, Washington's Dale Hunter was an
irritant to the Detroit Red Wings in Game 1. Hunter, known for his
in-your-face style, gave a particularly nasty time to Red Wings
captain Steve Yzerman.
	   ``We didn't have any particular assignments, but I think Hunter
can get under anybody's skin,'' Capitals coach Ron Wilson said.
``In particular, I think he irritated Steve. But Dale is not going
to let this opportunity pass by. At 38-years old, I don't think he
expects to play the next four years in the Finals.''
	   Wilson said there was no way he couldn't use Hunter, anyway.
	   ``All I had to do was turn around and who is over my right
shoulder but Dale Hunter's dad,'' Wilson said. ``So, if I did not
put Dale in, I might have had a beer thrown on me.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; LINEUP CHANGE: &LR;  Washington left wing Todd Krygier, who has been
sidelined with a groin injury suffered in the Buffalo series, will
probably return to the lineup on Thursday night, coach Ron Wilson
said.
	   Krygier skated on Tuesday and Wednesday and he said he feels
good.
	   It will be a homecoming of sorts. Krygier's parents, Roman and
Charlene, live in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. He spent the early part
of his youth in Novi, Mich. before his parents moved to Buffalo.
	   ``We had season tickets to the Sabres, but I still like coming
back here because my parents live here,'' Krygier said. ``It's
good. All of our parents have sacrificed a lot and to let them have
a chance to see us play is great.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; ZZZZ TIME: &LR;  Ron Wilson could not say enough good things about
rookie Richard Zednik, who scored the Caps lone goal in Game 1.
	   ``He is just a fun loving kid and he goes out there and he is
very relaxed,'' Wilson said. ``He is not intimidated by this
atmosphere at all. He is a new breed of European player, who comes
over as a youngster and plays junior hockey and isn't intimidated
by any stretch of the imagination with the surroundings.
	   Zednik's seven goals are tied for the team lead in the playoffs
with defenseman Sergei Gonchar.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; REPUTATION: &LR;  Joe Kocur, who made his NHL reputation mostly with
his fists, was out of hockey but living in Detroit when the Red
Wings signed him as a free agent a year ago. Detroit coach Scotty
Bowman admits he didn't know what he was getting.
	   ``I didn't know much about Joey,'' Bowman said. ``I never knew
what kind of player he was, just sort of the reputation that goes
around. He is really a smart player. He knows how to play hockey.
	   ``That sounds strange, but he has really got a big sense for the
game.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; STAY RELAXED: &LR;  Capitals goalie Olaf Kolzig looks like a poster
boy for cool. But looks can be deceiving. Kolzig says he has to
work hard to stay relaxed.
	   ``I'm always going to get nervous, but as long as I can vent,
I'll be fine,'' said Kolzig, who faced 31 shots in a 2-1 loss in
Game 1. ``My venting takes different forms. Sometimes it's yelling
an obscenity. Sometimes it's breaking a stick.
	   ``I don't take anything home with me. It all stays at the
rink.''

Government rejects Cable &AMP; Wireless request for rate increase
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaica's commerce minister on
Wednesday rejected a request by Cable &AMP; Wireless Ltd., the only
telephone service provider on the island, to raise its rates 20
percent.
	   Phillip Paulwell, minister of commerce and technology, said he
turned down the request in a letter to Mayer Matalon, chairman of
the company's Jamaican branch.
	   Under Jamaican law, Cable &AMP; Wireless can hike rates only if its
profit margin falls below 17.5 percent. Paulwell said the
government estimates projected a bigger profit than that in 1998.
	   The proposed increase had been expected to yield an additional
dlrs 68.5 million (Jamaican dlrs 2.4 billion) annually in revenue
for the company. The company's last rate increase was in September
1996.
	   The company can appeal Paulwell's decision to a mediator and can
request another increase in 12 months.

Hungary's witches beat the tax man
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY300 &QL; 
 &UR; By GEORGE JAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungary's witches have beaten the tax
man. And they didn't even need a curse.
	   ``They backed off after realizing they bit off more than they
could chew,'' crows head witch Jozsef Cezar Meszaros, demonic
eyebrows rising in glee as he shows a copy of the court ruling
acknowledging that his Hungarian Witches' Association is tax
exempt.
	   The attempt to collect comes as Hungary is coming to grips with
tax evasion _ endemic, as it is in all of post-communist Eastern
Europe.
	   Under communism, income tax did not exist. And although nearly a
decade has passed since the onset of democracy, many Hungarians
still consider taxes unjust.
	   Meszaros and others in his 10,000-strong association also could
have chosen the easy route _ declare a bit of income from the
incantations, hexes and readings they offer, pocket the rest and
count on being among those not being caught.
	   Instead, they decided to take on the tax-man head on, after the
association was ordered to register with tax authorities last year
and then told to pay a fine of 100,000 forints (nearly dlrs 500)
for registering late.
	   ``The fact is, we didn't have the 100,000 forints,'' Meszaros
chuckled, resplendent in a crimson velveteen robe in the semi-gloom
of his witches' parlor, behind a desk cluttered with pickled
tarantulas and snakes, a grinning skull, pin-studded dolls and
other occult paraphernalia.
	   So the association _ 200 ``experts,'' 500 apprentices and the
rest believers or followers with an inkling of witchcraft _
challenged the fine, deciding to nip any further tax demands in the
bud.
	   It had already registered itself in 1992 as a religious
organization. Moreover, members argued, all earnings went to paying
rent and utilities on parlors or by supporting sister
organizations.
	   ``Those of us in the association do this as a charity'' and make
their living through other means _ in his own case through dealing
in antiques, Meszaros said. ``We are not like the other big
religions, created to rake in money. We do not take membership
dues, nor do we get state support, like most churches (in
Europe).''
	   The state disagreed. In making his case earlier this year, state
prosecutor Istvan Sallos said the witches were ``business
oriented'' and were not keeping proper records.
	   Moreover, he questioned whether casting spells, sticking pins in
dolls and other witchcraft ceremonies had the same religious value
as the weddings, burials and other services conducted by
established churches enjoying tax-exempt status.
	   Auditors were sent several months ago, leading the witches to
expect the worst. The subsequent court ruling backing the
association's tax-exempt status and revoking the fine came as a
suprise.
	   ``As far as we're concerned the case is closed, they owe us
nothing,'' says Edit Body of the tax office.
	   Meszaros, who sons a head-dress of bull's' horns for some of his
spells, says the ruling is just, even while acknowledging that some
of his props - including a pair of bird's claws, the skull, the
stuffed raven on a perch - are for effect only.
	   Asked about the tiny vials of clear liquid scattered on his
desk, he admits chemists would have a hard time finding anything
else but pure water or oil within. ``It's the vibrations that
count,'' he says.
	   Sessions start at 2,000 forints (dlrs 10) _ a lot for the
average Hungarian _ but believers pay gladly.
	   ``They fulfill a need for me that no established church can,''
said Zsuzsa, a blonde woman in her 20s who refused to give her full
name or other personal details beyond saying she regularly consults
witches on her love and professional lives. ``They clearly should
have the same rights as the other religions do.''

After TV and musical versions, ``Sophie's World'' becoming a movie
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ In ``Sophie's World,'' philosopher Jostein
Gaarder wrote about a girl and a philosophy teacher who discover
they don't exist. Now they're about to star in a movie.
	   ``It's really exciting,'' said Gaarder on his first visit to the
set where his global bestseller is being turned into a movie.
``It's really like we are there.''
	   Gaarder's thinly-veiled philosophy textbook for teens
unexpectedly sold more than 15 million copies in 44 languages,
becoming the world's most-sold fiction title in 1995.
	   Since then, it was made into a British television series and a
CD-ROM. On Friday (June 12), the musical version is opening in
Germany.
	   Norway's state broadcasting network NRK now is turning it into a
full-length movie in the most expensive film project, at dlrs 10
million, ever attempted in this northern European country of 4.4
million people.
	   ``I was just writing a little book. I wasn't trying to write a
bestseller. If I had, it wouldn't have been a bestseller,'' said
Gaarder, 45. ``I was just trying to make philosophy accessible to
young people.''
	   The former high school philosophy teacher got bored with writing
a standard textbook, and decided to turn in it into a novel
starring 14-year-old _ almost 15! _ Sophie Amundsen and her
mysterious philosophy teacher.
	   In Gaarder's tale, Sophie starts receiving anonymous letters
posing such questions as: ``Who are you'' and ``Where does the
world come from?''
	   Eventually, the mysterious letter-writer, by the name of Alberto
Knox, emerges to teach the girl _ and now millions of readers _
about Western philosophy by meeting Socrates, Plato and other
greats.
	   Sophie and Alberto eventually discover they exist only in a book
that another character, Norwegian Major Albert Knag, is writing for
his own 14-year-old daughter. That infuriates Sophie and Alberto
and is a twist that opens the way for some of Gaarder's philosophy
lessons.
	   ``It's an impossible book to make into a movie,'' he said. But
Gaarder said he was pleased with the clips he has seen so far, and
understood that his 500-page work would have to be trimmed and
changed to fit the screen.
	   ``I feel no ownership of this movie,'' said Gaarder, who is not
involved in the production. Despite interest from Hollywood,
Gaarder said he preferred the movie being made in the book's
original language, Norwegian.
	   Director Erik Gustavsen, 42, said he trying to stick closely to
the original, but that it has to be adapted for the screen. The
main guideline, he added, is that philosophy lessons for young
people remain intact.
	   ``What we are trying to do is make the ultimate coming-of-age
movie,'' he said.
	   During Gaarder's Tuesday evening (June 9) visit to the NRK
studio in downtown Oslo, Sophie and Alberto were meeting William
Shakespeare at the premiere of Hamlet.
	   When the sequence was over, Gaarder mixed with a crowd of
colorfully clad actors, live chickens and a plastic roasted calf at
a medieval market scene.
	   After pausing to talk with Sophie _ actress Silje Storstein, age
14 _ Gaarder said, ``She really is a lot like the Sophie I
imagined.'' Gaarder also met Alberto, protrayed by veteran Swedish
actor Tomas von Bromssen.
	   Silje was picked from 4,500 hopefuls to portray Sophie. She said
she has become more interested in philosophy, but doesn't share the
obsession of her character who gives up everything to learn more.
	   ``It's not like I feel the need to rush home and read
philosophy,'' said Silje. ``Maybe if I started getting mysterious
letters.''
	   The movie is due to be released in Norway in August 1999, and
will be followed up with subtitled versions for other countries.

Bugs, own goals get World Cup off to odd start

	   PARIS (AP) _ Bugs on stilts and own goals. If that's any
indication, it's going to be a weird World Cup.
	   The usually dominant Brazilians opened defense of their World
Cup title in atypically Brazilian style Wednesday, relying on the
gift a second-half own goal by Tommy Boyd to beat Scotland 2-1.
	   Boyd wasn't the only goat, though. Youssef Chippo also cost his
team a goal, heading in one in first-half injury time as Morocco
drew 2-2 with Norway and barely missed a major upset.
	   The miscued goals were only a part of a peculiar beginning to
soccer's 16th world championship.
	   A 15-minute opening ceremony, including what were officially
described as ``strange insects'' on stilts, inaugurated France '98
at the filled, gleaming Stade de France prior to the
Brazilian-Scotland match.
	   But the gods seemed to be with FIFA and the French organizers.
On the day the World Cup began, Air France pilots ended their
10-day strike avoiding a potentially embarrassing transportation
problem for fans and teams.
	   There wasn't a dearth of goals in Wednesday's openers, but there
were few of the classic variety. John Collins scored Scotland's
lone tally on a penalty; Norway got its scores off the own goal and
a fortuitous bounce off a free kick; and Brazil won thanks to Boyd.
	   Italy and Chile, which were to open the Group B schedule in
Bordeaux, and Cameroon and Austria, which squared off in Toulouse,
had a chance to restore the glory when they played Friday.
	   In the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis, Brazil was less than elated
with its performance, but was happy to take the victory.
	   ``We made mistakes in the first half,'' admitted Brazilian coach
Mario Zagallo. ``But we changed our way of playing, pressed them
more and dominated.''
	   ``Brazil is happy and we got the three points. These opening
games aren't easy.''
	   It looked like it was going to be for Brazil the way it started.
Scotland took nearly 30 seconds to get the ball out of its own half
after kicking off, and within four minutes Cesar Sampaio had given
the South Americans the lead.
	   The defender deflected in a corner from Bebeto, getting his head
to the ball before Craig Burley and Collins to beat keeper Jim
Leighton.
	   The Brazilians controlled the possession and the majority of
play, but Cesar Sampaio gave his goal back seven minutes before
halftime, running over the back of Kevin Gallacher to give Collins
a chance from the penalty spot.
	   But the Scots also were in a generous mood. Doggedly hanging on
and desperate to gain the point from the draw, Boyd inadvertently
turned the ball into his own net while trying to come back and help
on the play.
	   Cafu fought off Gordon Durie in the penalty area to beat him to
a long ball from Dunga and touched it into goalkeeper Leighton with
the outside of his right foot.
	   Leighton was able to block the shot, but the rebound caromed off
the chest of a backtracking Boyd and dropped into the net.
	   ``I think we were brave, but perhaps not good enough,'' Scotland
coach Craig Brown said. ``They deserved to win, but we shouldn't
have lost. That's the way we're looking at it.''
	   In Montpellier, the Moroccans were looking at their draw almost
as a victory. Having lost all three games in their 1994 appearance
in the United States, and clearly the underdog in Group A, the only
downside to their performance was Chippo's askew header that cost
them a victory outright.
	   ``We were rather disappointed when after the first goal we made
that mistake,'' coach Henri Michel said. ``This is our weak point
(inconsistency) and we have to work on that.''
	   Tahar set up both goals with pinpoint long balls, sending in
Moustafa El Hadji in the 38th minute and Abdeljilil Hadda in the
59th.
	   Hadji used his feed to contort Dan Eggen before getting off a
shot that squeezed inside the right post, and Hadda ran onto
Tahar's ball down the right side before placing the ball into the
upper right corner.
	   Chippo's error came after Benzekri collided with Henning Berg as
they leapt for Stig Inge Bjornebye's free kick from the left of the
box. The ball went off Berg's shoulder and then to Chippo, whose
flicking header caught the inside of the right post and bounced in
instead of away.
	   Eggen equalized for Norway two minutes after Morocco had gone
ahead 2-1. Bjornebye's free kick bounced in the penalty area after
a defender Noureddine Naybet and goalkeeper Driss Benzekri
collided, leaving Eggen an open net to knock in a header.
	   ``I think we started very well and should have scored very
easily but didn't,'' Norwegian coach Egil ``Drillo'' Olsen said.
``After that we lost control. We couldn't stop them from creating
chances. They were tired at the end of the match when we were the
better team.''

Forget hot-shot Ronaldo; Boyd's chest gives victory to Brazil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ It wasn't Ronaldo's amazing speed or
a power-packed Roberto Carlos free kick that earned Brazil its 2-1
World Cup victory over Scotland.
	   It was Tommy Boyd's chest.
	   The Scottish defender will go down on the list of Brazil's
goalscorers because he couldn't avoid scoring the defending
champion's winner 17 minutes from the end.
	   ``It hit me on the chest and I couldn't get out of the way,''
the 33-year-old Celtic defender said after Scotland's opening day
defeat. ``It was probably the worst feeling I have ever had to lose
a game like that.''
	   Boyd's own goal before 80,000 fans at the Stade de France
settled the game and gave Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo the start
he wanted.
	   ``We made mistakes in the first half,'' Zagallo said. ``But we
changed our way of playing, pressed them more and dominated.
	   ``Brazil is happy and we got the three points. These opening
games aren't easy.''
	   The veteran coach jumped off the bench several times to bellow
his frustration at the Brazilian players who had taken a
fourth-minute lead and then allowed the upstart Scots back into the
game.
	   Cesar Sampaio was the hero and then villain for the Brazilians,
heading his team in front from Bebeto's left-wing corner and then
pushing Kevin Gallacher in the back to concede John Collins'
36th-minute equalizer from the penalty spot.
	   The Brazilians, with substitute Denilson tearing open the
Scottish defense after entering the field in the 70th minute, were
looking at their sharpest when they scored the second goal.
	   Denilson started a move that transferred to Dunga, who curled a
long through ball to the overlapping Cafu.
	   The fullback got past Gordon Durie and flipped a shot goalwards
with his right foot. Goalkeeper Jim Leighton, who rescued Scotland
earlier with two brilliant saves from Roberto Carlos and Ronaldo,
closed him down and blocked the shot.
	   But the ball bounced out to Boyd, who was at the wrong place at
the wrong time. He looked aghast as the ball struck him at the
junction of his chest and shoulder and rebounded back into an empty
net.
	   Cafu ran off and celebrated the goal with a somersault with the
Scottish players looked at each other in total dismay.
	   ``I think the reaction of the Brazilian team on their winning
goal reflected the credit for Scotland,'' said Scottish coach Craig
Brown. ``They realized they were fortunate to win the game.
	   ``There's no denying that the better team won the game, but we
had a great chance not to lose.
	   ``It was shocking the way we conceded both goals. We could have
got more out of the game with a bit more care at the back.
	   ``Other than that I thought the team played well, particularly
in the last 25 minutes of the second half,'' Brown said. ``We did
have chances, but we didn't have the final finish, a cutting edge.
	   ``But when you lose a goal at the beginning of the game it puts
you in a very difficult position, especially against the world
champions.''

World Cup: Japan's goalkeeper inspired by Brazilian spirit
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi may be only 22
years old and a bit on the small side for a goalkeeper, but it
would be plain foolish to count Japan's goalkeeper out at the World
Cup.
	   Kawaguchi, though just 1.81 meters and 75 kilograms (6-foot-1
and 165 pounds), has plenty of fire. He is quick and wise. He says
he's never been in better shape.
	   And he has picked up a thing or two from the Brazilians, who in
contrast to the debuting Japanese, are vying for their fifth World
Cup.
	   Kawaguchi and the entire team gathered around a hotel television
to watch Brazil's 2-1 win over Scotland in Wednesday's tournament
opener.
	   They were all rooting for Brazil, a nation that has greatly
influenced Japanese soccer. Many Brazilians play in Japan's
professional J-League, including Dunga and Cesar Sampaio.
	   ``It's hard not to get involved when you know them,'' said
Kawaguchi, who plays for J-League's Yokohama Marinos. ``But we
weren't for a moment worried about how things would turn out for
Brazil.''
	   Impressed ``oohs!'' went up when the Brazilians displayed their
flash. What Kawaguchi remembers the most is Ronaldo dribbling up
and taking a shot.
	   ``Brazil came through in the end, as always,'' said coach
Takeshi Okada.
	   Brazilian-born forward Wagner Lopes _ living proof personified
of Japan's deep ties with the South American nation _ was a little
proud because he had predicted Brazil's 2-1 victory.
	   ``The next game would be even better,'' he told reporters.
	   As for Kawaguchi, his most important Brazilian these days is his
44-year-old goalkeeper coach, Mario, who a former Juventus player
has been complaining recently that his leg hurts.
	   ``Once practice starts, though, his expression changes,''
Kawaguchi said. ``He has enormous mental strength.''
	   No one watching him in daily team practices could imagine Mario
in pain. He fiercely kicks the ball to the goalkeepers, again and
again.
	   ``Maybe not 500 times, but almost 300 times,'' Kawaguchi said.
``Mario's approach to soccer has been my inspiration. There is a
lot to emulate for me.''
	   Mario was also Kawaguchi's coach for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics,
the first time Japan went to the games in 28 years.
	   There, Kawaguchi made stop after stop to hold Brazil scoreless,
helping Japan to a miraculous 1-0 upset against its mentors.
	   Perhaps, Kawaguchi is ready to do it again _ this time, at
Japan's World Cup opener against Argentina on Sunday.
	   ``Argentina has players who can shoot from any position,'' he
said. ``But if you think too much about what the other players are
going to do, you can't concentrate on your own play.
	   ``Mentally and physically, my condition is excellent,''
Kawaguchi added. ``I look forward to seeing how I stand up against
the best at the World Cup.''

Deja vu in Belarus: Former Soviets and West in smelly diplomatic
</HEADLINE>
dispute &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A little Cold War has broken out in Belarus, the
most unapologetically Soviet of former Soviet republics.
	   This being the 90s, the dispute has nothing to do with missiles,
spies or Marxist ideology. This time, West and East are fighting
over sewers.
	   The sewage in question flows out of the foreign diplomatic
compound on the outskirts of Minsk, the Belarusian capital. Here,
in pleasant pine woods, ambassadors from the United States, Russia,
France, Germany and other countries live in comfort, if not
splendor, behind gates and fences.
	   Belarusian authorities have decided the sewage and plumbing
system that serves the 1940s-era compound is badly antiquated and
requires replacement _ urgently _ and the diplomats need to move
out.
	   On Wednesday, which was to have been the deadline for the
diplomats to clear out, Belarus announced that it was postponing
their eviction until next week. But it wasn't backing down.
	   ``I think they should use the time left to remove the
furniture,'' suggested Oleg Novikov, deputy head of the Dipservice
state agency in charge of maintaining the diplomatic residences. It
was not clear how the eviction would take place.
	   Western ambassadors have dug in their heels and refused to move.
U.S. Ambassador Daniel Speckhard called it the gravest violation of
the Vienna Convention on embassy operations since the end of the
Cold War.
	   As embassy disputes go, this one pales in comparison to, say,
the Iranian students' seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in
1979.
	   Belarus stands out mainly because it happens to have an
authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, who pines for the
days of the Soviet Union and loves to thumb his nose at the West.
	   The West has been sharply critical of Lukashenko's government,
accusing it of violating human rights by stifling democracy and
dissent.
	   Last year, the previous U.S. ambassador was recalled to
Washington for a month to protest the expulsion of a lower-level
U.S. diplomat who was accused of being a CIA agent and fomenting
dissent.
	   This time, Belarus has a whole slough of ambassadors and their
governments hopping mad.
	   ``Forcing these diplomats out of their residences goes against
the rules of human rights and politics,'' German Foreign Ministry
spokesman Markus Ederer fumed Wednesday.
	   The United States, Russia, France, Germany and Lithuania have
formally protested the planned eviction. France and Lithuania said
they will recall their ambassadors for consultations if Belarus
persists, and Washington has said it will also take some action in
response.
	   Belarus has offered the ambassadors what it considers a fair
deal: spacious, Soviet-style apartments in central Minsk or land
near the disputed Drozdy diplomatic compound on which to build new
houses.
	   Unacceptable, the diplomats say: Under the Vienna accord,
diplomatic residences are considered the sovereign territory of the
diplomats' country. Lukashenko, who has a residence down the road,
turned that on its head Wednesday, claiming that the diplomatic
complex belongs to him.
	   ``This is the residence of the head of state, you should know,''
he told reporters _ twice.
	   The ambassadors don't dispute that their houses, built for
Soviet bigwigs, could use some fixing up. In fact, they say, they
already have poured lots of money into fixing them. They would be
willing to spend more on the plumbing problem.
	   Opposition leader Stanislav Schuschkevich said Lukashenko's real
goal is to beef up his security at Drozdy.
	   ``The problem is, our president suffers from paranoia,''
Schuschkevich said. ``He sees spies and coup plotters everywhere.
... He might think his neighbors, the foreign ambassadors, want to
kill him. And he wants to show everyone that he can do whatever
comes to his mind to do.''

Iran coach: We hope to catch Yugoslavia on one of their bad days
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   YSSINGEAUX, France (AP) _ The Iranian coach says that on a good
day the Yugoslavs are no match for anyone. So he is hoping to catch
them on one of their bad days when the two teams meet Sunday at the
World Cup.
	   ``Yugoslavia is a very good team. They have a lot of very
skillful and experienced players who have technique and play attack
football,'' said Jalal Talebi, who took over the team less than a
month ago in Iran's second coaching change since the fall.
	   ``On a good day, Yugoslavia can beat any team anywhere in the
world. But on a bad day they can lose to anyone anywhere in the
world. We are hoping to catch them on one of their bad days,''
Talebi told reporters in this pastoral town where a famous pastry
school is Iran's World Cup home.
	   Defense is Talebi's preoccupation. Iran has three star strikers
who play in the German Bundesliga, but its defense has always been
weak.
	   It may suffer even more, with little chance that captain and
goalkeeper Ahmad Reza Abedzadeh, who is recovering from a knee
operation late last year, will play Sunday.
	   ``There's only a 40 percent chance that he'll be well enough to
play,'' said Talebi.
	   Nima Nakissa, seven years younger than the 32-year-old Abedzadeh
and not as experienced, will likely man the Iranian goal against
Yugoslavia.
	   Midfielder Sattar Hamedani, also recuperating from a leg injury
last month, pulled out of a practice match Sunday and limped back
to the team's living quarters with an ice pack on his knee.
	   After Yugoslavia, Iran faces the United States and Germany,
another soccer powerhouse.
	   Iranian soccer fans were so happy when their team clinched the
last World Cup spot that millions danced in the streets, and Talebi
admitted that his team was under tremendous pressure to beat the
Americans, Iran's political adversary for nearly two decades.
	   When the teams meet at Lyon on June 21 it may not be the best
soccer in the world, but it will be electric.
	   Despite recent overtures by Iran's moderate President Mohammad
Khatami, the United States is still ``The Great Satan'' for many
Iranian officials.
	   ``Everyone says that politics and sports are different, but
unfortunately they go together. There is a lot of pressure on
players and the team, but I hope that everyone understands we are
here to play football and not for any political reasons,'' said
Talebi, who has lived in the United States.
	   ``We are here to play football, and to show that we don't have
problems with anyone,'' he said.

World Cup: Jamaicans carry TVs to work for first World Cup matches
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Office employees carried televisions to
work and bank customers stood transfixed before sets in bank
lobbies as Jamaica turned its attention to the World Cup on
Wednesday.
	   Few telephones rang and traffic on Kingston's streets dropped
off as the first round of matches began Wednesday morning. Most
televisions were tuned to the face-off between Brazil, the
defending champion, and Scotland.
	   Interest in the World Cup on this Caribbean island has been
intense since Jamaica won its first-ever berth in the championship
playoffs.
	   It will be the first chance a Caribbean country has had at the
World Cup since Haiti played in 1974.
	   Prime Minister Percival J. Patterson announced he would leave
Thursday for France to attend tourism promotions tied to the team
and watch the Jamaicans play in their first match against Croatia
on June 14.
	   He will also attend the team's match against Argentina on June
21. Both of those games will be on Sundays.
	   Business owners said they are bracing for massive absences on
Jamaica's first weekday match, a June 26 game against Japan at
Gerland Stadium in Lyon.

Battle for Jerusalem shifts to biblical Mount of Olives
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Terraced with thousands of Jewish graves,
dotted with venerable Christian churches, home to a quiet Arab
neighborhood, the biblical Mount of Olives has become the latest
battleground in the fight for Jerusalem.
	   A Jewish seminary on its slopes has won permission to expand,
drawing a furious reaction from Palestinians who say the housing
project will change the character of a traditionally Arab area.
	   That, along with growing Jewish footholds elsewhere in the
city's eastern sector, is seen by the Palestinians as a deliberate
Israeli stragegy to doom their hopes for a capital in east
Jerusalem, which they call ``Al-Quds'' _ the holy.
	   Israel claims sovereignty over all Jerusalem, and says it will
never relinquish it.
	   The status of the city as a whole is to be settled in later
negotiations, and Palestinians say changes now in the character of
Arab neighborhoods captured by Israel in the 1967 war _ facts on
the ground, as both sides call them _ will greatly affect the
outcome of those talks.
	   ``The people have to mobilize themselves ... to defend
Jerusalem,'' said Palestinian Cabinet Secretary Ahmed Abdel-Rahman,
a day after the Beit Orot yeshiva won approval to build 58 Jewish
homes on Mount of Olives land that had originally been set aside
for an Arab girls' school.
	   Palestinians consider the Mount of Olives particularly strategic
in their capital aspirations, because it serves as a land link
between the Muslim holy sites of the Old City and other Palestinian
neighborhoods to the east.
	   Recent weeks have seen a sharp escalation of activity by groups
seeking to bring more Jews to east Jerusalem.
	   Below the Mount of Olives, protesters gathered again Wednesday
in the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Silwan. Earlier this week,
under cover of darkness, Jewish settlers moved into five
apartments, setting off shouting and shoving matches with Arab
neighbors.
	   A stone's throw away, in the walled Old City, Israeli
authorities this week hastily convened an archeological dig after
Jewish settlers set up sheds on the site in the Muslim Quarter.
With the start of the dig, the settlers were allowed to stay on,
serving as guards.
	   Palestinians and Israeli peace activists claim the government of
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Jerusalem municipality is
colluding with the settlers.
	   From biblical times, the mount has been a place of portent.
	   Scripture says that from its slopes, Jesus pronounced his lament
over Jerusalem's impending doom. The Roman army of Titus made its
summit a staging ground for its siege of the city. Apocalyptic
prophecy has it that here will begin the resurrection of the dead,
with the appearance of the Messiah.
	   The mount, with sweeping views of all Jerusalem, is the site of
the world's oldest and largest Jewish cemetery, dating back to the
15th century, with tens of thousands of graves.
	   Between 1948 and 1967, when the area was under Jordanian
control, a roadway was built through the Jewish burial ground on
the Mount of Olives. Gravestones were smashed and some used for
building and paving.
	   ``This area is holy to us, sacred,'' said Chaim Silberstein,
director of the Beit Orot yeshiva. ``Jews must have sovereignty
over it, and all Jerusalem.''
	   Silberstein says there is nothing political about the seminary's
building activity. It has housing for only 40 of its 150 students,
he says, and simply needs more.
	   But the activity fits in with a pattern of expansion. Beit Orot
was founded by an extreme right-wing settler, lawmaker Benny Elon.
And the housing would be built on land purchased by Miami
multimillionaire Irving Moskowitz, who has been a driving force
behind Jewish settlements in east Jerusalem.
	   Asked about the timing of the housing project, coming as it does
amid fitful efforts to restart the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process, Silberstein shook his head.
	   ``There will never be a time when it will please the Arabs that
we build housing,'' he said. ``It is they who are being militant
about this, not us.''

	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Office employees carried televisions to
work and bank customers stood transfixed before sets in bank
lobbies as Jamaica turned its attention to the World Cup on
Wednesday.
	   And Jamaica's team doesn't even play until Sunday.
	   Few telephones rang and traffic on Kingston's streets dropped
off as the opening matches between Brazil and Scotland began
Wednesday morning local time.
	   Interest in the World Cup on the Caribbean island has been
intense since Jamaica won its first-ever berth in the tournament.
	   It is the first appearance for a Caribbean country at the World
Cup since Haiti played in 1974. Jamaica plays Croatia on Sunday,
followed by a match against Argentina on June 21.
	   Both of those games will be on Sundays, but business owners said
they are bracing for massive absences on Jamaica's first third
match, June 26 against Japan. That one falls on a weekday.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   VICHY, France (AP) _ Controversial South Africa coach Philippe
Troussier appears almost certain to become the next manager of
English club Sheffield Wednesday following talks with chairman Dave
Richards.
	   Troussier is a known disciplinarian and has a reputation for a
fiery temper, having fallen foul of several football authorities
during the 10 years he has spent coaching in Africa.
	   But Sheffield Wednesday is now believed to see the 43-year-old
Frenchman as the one to take over from Ron Atkinson, whose contract
was not renewed at the end of last season.
	   Troussier confirmed on Wednesday he had received an offer from
the Owls.
	   ``Nothing's signed, but we have been talking and there's a very
good chance of things succeeding,'' Troussier said.
	   His contract with Bafana Bafana expires with the conclusion of
France '98, and Troussier has made it known he would like to work
in Europe following his decade in Africa.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Italian coach Cesare Maldini nearly
jumped to his feet when he saw Brazil's winning goal against
Scotland on a distant television screen during his news conference
in Bordeaux on Wednesday.
	   ``Brazil has scored!'' he shouted before answering the next
question.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SAINT-JEAN D'ARDIERES, France (AP) _ With nothing to do other
than soccer at their isolated training camp in southern France, the
U.S. players are making friends with the animals. And there's a lot
of them.
	   ``Peacocks, ducks, rosters, geese, deer, billy goats,'' forward
Brian McBride said, to name a few.
	   While they feed the animals, players haven't given them names.
	   ``That will probably be after we get back from Paris,'' he said,
laughing.
	   The team is also amusing itself by playing darts.
	   ``We've broken almost every single dart,'' McBride said. ``I
don't know if it's because people throw hard or we're no good at
darts.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Coach Cesare Maldini said he could not
see any family conflict in coaching his son Paolo on Italy's
national team.
	   ``He's a player, I'm the coach. We respect the roles. I'm proud
to be the coach of all Italian players, not only of Paolo,''
Maldini said on the eve of Italy's match with Chile.
	   Paolo Maldini, a 30-year-old veteran defender of AC Milan, is
Italy's captain.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Rush hour came early Wednesday as
Brazilians abandoned work to watch their team's first appearance in
this year's televised World Cup.
	   In front of the big hotels in Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana
district, tourists jostled with prostitutes and transvestites in an
effort to glimpse Brazil's match with Scotland on televisions at
beachside beer stands. Brazil won the game, 2-1.
	   The normally packed beaches were bare, and roads that were
jammed an hour before the game _ broadcast at 12:30 p.m. local time
(1430 GMT) _ emptied as it approached.
	   Half an hour before kickoff, Rio's downtown business district
was a ghost town except for random crowds clad in green and yellow
_ Brazil's national colors _ blowing on cheap plastic trumpets and
waving flags before large-screen TVs set up at several stores.

Kosovo rebels supported by cash and supplies from emigres

<TEXT>
	   BAJRAM CURRI, Albania (AP) _ The wad of Swiss francs was as big
as his fist. He waved both _ the money and clenched hand _ in the
direction of Kosovo as an old riverboat chugged towards the border.
	   ``You must have bullets and courage for victory. You can't buy
courage, but without money, there will be no bullets,'' growled
Ylber Malaj, a 45-year-old ethnic Albanian, who left the Serbian
province of Kosovo 20 years ago and emigrated to Switzerland.
	   Malaj is part of a distant, but vitally important front for the
separatist rebels battling Serbian forces in Kosovo. Ethnic
Albanian emigres in Europe and the United States are mobilizing
cash, supplies and a serious morale boost in the effort to turn the
Kosovo Liberation Army into a formidable new militia.
	   The aid pipeline runs mainly from Central Europe to Tirana and
then on to northeastern Albanian towns, such as Bajram Curri, named
for an Albanian hero who fought for Kosovo's independence in the
1920s.
	   Most money goes to buy weapons looted during last year's anarchy
in Albania: a Kalashnikov sells for 350 German marks (nearly dlrs
200). Other funds are given to Albanian families housing some of
the more than 10,000 refugees who have fled to Albania to escape
the fighting.
	   A Western diplomat in Albania who spoke on condition of
anonymity called the assistance ``a crucial element'' in
strengthening the KLA.
	   About 400,000 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo live in Germany. At
least 100,000 others are scattered through Europe, mainly in
Switzerland and Scandinavia.
	   The flow of outside help is welcomed by supporters of the KLA,
whose popularity has risen sharply in Kosovo since Serbian police
and soldiers began a crackdown in March.
	   It poses diplomatic problems for the government of Albania,
which is publicly committed to cutting off the flow of arms into
neighboring Kosovo, but in practice can do little to control it or
stop ethnic Albanians from funneling assistance.
	   This week, the Kosovo Albanians' government in exile announced
from its base in Germany that it would impose a war tax on kinfolk
working abroad, to fund the fight against Serbia.
	   Older emigres and their descendants in the United States are
also doing their share.
	   Muharrem Gocaj, 64, left Kosovo 20 years ago and owns a
restaurant and bar in Detroit. Every two weeks, he says, he gives
between dlrs 500 and 1,000 for the Albanian cause.
	   He's now back in Albania on his first visit since 1946, when he
trekked through the mountains with his mother from Kosovo _ much as
today's refugees do _ to his grandmother's house in the border
village of Tropoja.
	   ``Every Albanian should go back to Kosovo,'' he said. ``They
should buy guns here with the money they bring and go back to
fight.''
	   In Tropoja now, the emigres have quickly established themselves
as the early brokers of the separatist drive.
	   ``There are only two ways to support the war,'' said Bejrem
Mehmeti, who traveled from Austria last week. ``You can send money
to buy weapons or cross the border and fight. Both are equally
needed.''
	   A group of young Albanians from Europe last week set up a
council to receive refugees, organize food and returns for Kosovars
who want to go back.
	   Rustem Caca, 30, who lives in Germany, said supply depots have
been established around Germany with food, clothes and medicine to
ship to Kosovo or KLA guerrillas in Albania.

Argentina's army chief: Arrest of former dictator won't jeopardize
</HEADLINE>
civilians &QL; 
 &UR; By KEVIN GRAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Despite Argentina's history of
military rule, the arrest of a former dictator will not strain
relations between the armed forces and the civilian population, a
top army official said.
	   ``We maintain a close relationship,'' Juan Carlos Zabala, the
country's joint chief of staff, said Wednesday. ``We have proven
that in all the actions we have carried out.''
	   Zabala said he was surprised by the detention of Jorge Rafael
Videla on child kidnapping charges but indicated he would not
challenge the arrest.
	   Although democracy was restored in 1983, President Carlos
Menem's pardon of all middle-ranking and senior officers in 1990
has left an uneasy relationship between the military and the
general population.
	   Human rights groups, outraged by the pardon, have searched for
ways to circumvent the order and bring former military officials to
justice.
	   Tuesday's detention of Videla, who seized power in a 1976 coup,
reveals one of the loopholes in the pardon, which does not include
child kidnapping charges.
	   Videla was charged with ordering the kidnapping of children born
to parents who were killed during the 1976-83 dictatorship. He was
also charged with falsifying identity documents.
	   Videla, who has not commented on his arrest, faces his first
court hearing Thursday.
	   In Paris for the opening ceremonies of the World Cup, Menem said
he supported Videla's arrest.
	   ``All those who commit this type of crime must answer for it
before the courts,'' he said.
	   Federal Judge Roberto Marquevich, who ordered Videla's arrest,
said the former president could be tried for up to ``36 to 38
cases'' involving disappearances stemming from past military rule.
	   Speaking with reporters Wednesday, the judge would not discuss
those cases. Nor would he rule out the possibility of other
arrests.
	   ``I'm analyzing the cases but I'm not able to say much,''
Marquevich said. ``Other people may be called to testify.''
	   Videla's arrest follows an investigation into five child
kidnappings, including two children given to Norberto Bianco, a
former military doctor who fled to Paraguay after democracy was
restored. The children were born to parents who disappeared during
military rule.
	   Bianco and his wife Susana Wehrli were eventually extradited to
Argentina and jailed on kidnapping charges.
	   The two children have since married and now reside in Paraguay.
There was no information on the other three children mentioned in
the charges.
	   As a top military official during the dictatorship, Videla had
final authority over death squads that operated against political
opponents, mainly leftists, from 1976 to 1983.
	   The Argentine government says 9,000 people disappeared during
that period and are presumed dead; human rights groups put the
figure much higher, at 30,000.
	   Videla was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 for human rights
abuses during the dictatorship. But he was released under the 1990
amnesty.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The Spice Girls say there's no bad blood with Geri
Halliwell, the departed Ginger Spice.
	   ``If Geri walked through the door now we would all be like,
`Hello,''' Posh Spice Victoria Adams said Tuesday. ``It would be
like friends meeting up. It's not nasty, we've all said that. We
all love each other and we all love Geri.''
	   The four remaining Spices will tour the United States beginning
June 14 and hope to record the pop group's third album later this
year.
	   Ms. Halliwell dropped out May 31 because of ``differences
between us.''
	   ``Of course we've been in touch with her _ there's a lot of
things to sort out,'' Sporty Spice Melanie Chisholm said. ``We
really do wish her well _ we want her to succeed.''

	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Novelist Mordecai Richler is expected to remain
a few more days at the Montreal General Hospital where he is
recovering from surgery, a hospital spokeswoman said Wednesday.
	   ``It's too early to say (when he will be discharged),'' said
Chantal Beauregard. ``The operation went well and he is now
resting.''
	   Published reports have said Richler had a kidney operation but
Beauregard declined to discuss it. ``Mr. Richler and his family
have requested privacy at this time,'' she said, adding the author
will likely issue a statement in a few days.
	   Richler, 67, told the Montreal Gazette on Monday before the
operation that his general health was ``terrific'' and he expected
to be home in a week.
	   He said he needed something done about his kidney and that the
operation was pretty routine. He refused to be more specific.
	   Richler, noted for his biting satire in novels and articles, had
to cancel an appearance this week to receive the Stephen Leacock
Memorial Medal for Humor for his latest novel, Barney's Version.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince Harry is heading for the playing fields of
Eton, just like his big brother Prince William.
	   St. James's Palace said Wednesday that Harry, 13, was
``thrilled'' to pass the entrance examination for the famous
boarding school. Fees at Eton are about 15,000 pounds (dlrs 24,000)
a year per pupil.
	   Harry and William, 15, are the sons of Prince Charles and the
late Princess Diana.
	   William entered Eton three years ago.
	   The school is just across the River Thames from Windsor Castle,
a favorite weekend base for the princes' grandmother, Queen
Elizabeth II.

	   ALBANY, New York (AP) _ Snarling dogs aren't the only threats to
mail carriers. Just ask people in Albany who've watched a wild
turkey terrorizing their mailman.
	   Letters went undelivered several times over the past week, since
the mailman ran afoul of the bird. People in the Albany
neighborhood say they've seen the turkey pecking at the mail
truck's tires and chasing it down the street.
	   As soon as the truck pulls up, the intimidating turkey _ which
stands 24 inches (61 centimeters) to 30 inches (76 centimeters)
tall _ trots out and fans its tail feathers.
	   ``For the safety of the driver, he has been instructed not to
get out of the truck when the turkey is there,'' Postal Service
spokeswoman Mary Madonna said.
	   People who live along the street said they like having the
turkey around, even if it means having their mail service
disrupted.
	   The spokeswoman met Monday with residents to discuss what to do
about mail delivery. One possibility would be to put a row of
mailboxes at the end of the street.
	   ``They say neither rain, nor sleet nor dark of night will keep
them away,'' said resident Jim Palmer. ``I guess that doesn't
include turkeys.''

Canadian official says Canada is drug-producer, cites Vancouver HIV
</HEADLINE>
crisis &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Thanks to a flourishing marijuana
business, Canada has become an illicit drug exporter, a Canadian
official said. He said the Vancouver area is additionally facing a
major HIV crisis because of intravenous drug use.
	   Speaking Wednesday to the final session of the U.N. General
Assembly special session on drugs, Solicitor-General Andrew Scott
said Canada had developed into a major producer of cannabis,
``especially indoors.''
	   ``Indeed, we have become an exporting country,'' Scott said.
``Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug in Canada,
followed by cocaine and heroin with moderate use of synthetic
drugs.''
	   U.S. and Canadian officials believe marijuana harvesting has
become so lucrative that it now ranks as British Columbia's most
lucrative agricultural product _ with illegal revenues estimated at
anywhere from dlrs 400 million to more than dlrs 3 billion a year.
	   Scott said a high priority for Canada's anti-drug program was to
combat intravenous drug use and the resulting spread of HIV because
of the use of polluted needles.
	   ``In this regard, Canada is experiencing a particularly serious
health crisis in Vancouver, with a high level of overdose deaths
and one of the highest rates of HIV infections in developed
countries,'' Scott said.
	   The Vancouver-Richmond Health Board, in a study released last
October, estimated that as many as half of the 6,000 to 10,000 drug
addicts in the city have HIV, the virus that leads to AIDS.
	   Officials agreed last year to spend an additional dlrs 3.3
million for a needle exchange program.
	   In the past year, the U.S. Customs Service has nearly doubled
its enforcement effort along the northern border _ especially with
Washington State _ because of a surge of high quality marijuana
smuggled in from British Columbia.
	   U.S. officials said the Canadian product is so potent that it
can earn as much as dlrs 6,000 a pound in parts of California _ 10
times the typical price for marijuana from Mexico.
	   As a result of the crackdown in the West, U.S. officials say
Canadian growers are stepping up operations in Ontario to exploit
markets in New York, Michigan and New England.

More than one war on drugs, and the last one was disastrous
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ As world leaders talked this week about
how nations were losing the ``war on drugs,'' the head of the U.N.
narcotics board recalled Wednesday what happened the last time a
big war was fought over drugs.
	   Opium became legal in China after it lost the Opium Wars with
Britain, resulting in the addiction by millions of Chinese, Dr.
Hamid Ghodse told reporters.
	   Ghodse, the president of the International Narcotics Control
Board, raised the point Wednesday as the U.N. General Assembly
special session on drugs came to a close.
	   He was rejecting suggestions _ raised this week by some
delegations and special-interest groups _ that the war on drugs was
doing more harm than good and that drugs should be legalized.
	   The loss of the two Opium Wars was disastrous because it
``succeeded to legalize drugs in China,'' Ghodse said. An estimated
20 million people were addicted at the time, he said.
	   ``Therefore, we have already experienced this: that drugs become
legalized by the force of wars,'' he said, implying that the
reverse may become true someday and the drug epidemic would end.
	   Britain first went to war in 1842 after a Chinese official
seized opium imported by British merchants to finance lucrative
exports of Chinese tea.
	   Chinese forces were quickly defeated. The humiliated Qing
Dynasty was forced to hand over Hong Kong to Britain _ an enduring
wound to Chinese national pride until it regained the territory
last year.
	   On Monday, Chinese cabinet member Luo Gan reminded participants
at the U.N. session of the ``untold suffering'' China suffered from
drugs that were forced on the country by Western colonists.
	   ``We attach great importance to and are very much concerned
about the comeback of drugs in China,'' he said.
	   Ghodse also expressed his worry about the comeback of
opium-based drugs _ and the movements in parts of Europe towards
legalizing these drugs.
	   ``If we get heroin dens, the only difference from the opium dens
is that the heroin dens would be in more luxurious houses,'' he
said.

Japan's births hit record low, divorces at all-time high
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The average number of babies born in Japan dropped
to a record low last year while divorces hit an all-time high, a
Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare official said Thursday.
	   There were only 1.39 babies born per woman born in Japan in
1997, breaking a previous record low of 1.42 registered in 1995,
said the official, who declined to be named.
	   The ministry's statistics, compiled in an annual government
report, show that 1.19 million babies were born in 1997, or 14,874
less than in the previous year and the third-lowest total ever
recorded.
	   The report said the figures were partially a result of the
growing tendency of Japanese women to marry later in life and wait
longer to have children.
	   Also, 222,650 divorces, the most ever recorded, were registered
last year, surging to a a record high of 1.78 per 1,000 people from
1.66 the previous year.
	   Besides the increase in divorces, the number of marriages during
the year fell by nearly 20,000 to 775,080, the ministry said.
	   In addition to the low birthrates, Japan's 125 million people
have the world's longest average life spans. The country is
expected to displace Sweden by 2005 as home to the planet's oldest
population.
	   In 1997, a total of 913,398 Japanese died, an increase of 17,187
compared to the previous year.

Argentina's army chief: Detention of former dictator won't

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Despite Argentina's history of
military rule, the detention of a former dictator will not strain
relations between the armed forces and the civilian population, a
top army official said.
	   ``We maintain a close relationship,'' Juan Carlos Zabala, the
country's joint chief of staff, said Wednesday. ``We have proven
that in all the actions we have carried out.''
	   Zabala said he was surprised by the detention of Jorge Rafael
Videla on suspicion of child kidnapping under the military
dictatorship, but indicated he would not challenge the move.
	   Although democracy was restored in 1983, President Carlos
Menem's pardon of all middle-ranking and senior officers in 1990
has left an uneasy relationship between the military and the
general population.
	   Human rights groups, outraged by the pardon, have searched for
ways to circumvent the order and bring former military officials to
justice.
	   Tuesday's detention of Videla, who seized power in a 1976 coup,
reveals one of the loopholes in the pardon, which does not include
child kidnapping.
	   Videla is suspected of ordering the kidnapping of children born
to parents who were killed during the 1976-83 dictatorship. He was
also charged with falsifying identity documents.
	   Videla, who has not commented on the case, faces his first court
hearing Thursday.
	   In Paris for the opening ceremonies of the World Cup, Menem said
he supported Videla's detention.
	   ``All those who commit this type of crime must answer for it
before the courts,'' he said.
	   Federal Judge Roberto Marquevich, who ordered Videla's
detention, said the former president could be tried for up to ``36
to 38 cases'' involving disappearances stemming from past military
rule.
	   Speaking with reporters Wednesday, the judge would not discuss
those cases. Nor would he rule out the possibility that others may
be suspected.
	   ``I'm analyzing the cases but I'm not able to say much,''
Marquevich said. ``Other people may be called to testify.''
	   Videla's detention follows an investigation into five child
kidnappings, including two children given to Norberto Bianco, a
former military doctor who fled to Paraguay after democracy was
restored. The children were born to parents who disappeared during
military rule.
	   Bianco and his wife Susana Wehrli were eventually extradited to
Argentina and jailed on kidnapping charges.
	   The two children have since married and now reside in Paraguay.
There was no information on the other three children mentioned in
the charges.
	   As a top military official during the dictatorship, Videla had
final authority over death squads that operated against political
opponents, mainly leftists, from 1976 to 1983.
	   The Argentine government says 9,000 people disappeared during
that period and are presumed dead; human rights groups put the
figure much higher, at 30,000.
	   Videla was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 for human rights
abuses during the dictatorship. But he was released under the 1990
amnesty.

Kohl, Buzek to dedicate international youth center
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDRZEJ STYLINSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Eight years after a symbolic meeting of
Polish and German leaders that paved the way for reconciliation
between the two neighbors, they will meet again to open a youth
center dedicated to getting people to talk.
	   Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl are
to cut the ribbon Thursday at the International Center for Youth
Meetings in Krzyzowa, or Kreisau, as the small Silesian town is
called in German.
	   Kohl and Buzek are to meet Polish, German and Czech youth and
take part in an ecumenical service. They also plan to hold a
face-to-face meeting to discuss bilateral relations and European
integration.
	   Krzyzowa, which was part of Germany before 1945, was a
meeting-place for anti-Nazi resisters during World War II.
	   After the fall of the Iron Curtain, just as the Berlin Wall was
being dismantled, it became a symbolic place of Polish-German
reconciliation.
	   Kohl and postwar Poland's first non-communist prime minister,
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, embraced each other during a religious service
there. That meeting paved the way for a historic 1991 Polish-German
friendship treaty as well as for the the youth center project.
	   A Polish-German foundation, with some 30 million marks (dlrs 17
million) from German authorities, carried out renovation of the
estate, which once belonged to Count Hellmuth James von Moltke.
	   Von Moltke and a group of Germans who opposed the Nazis met in
Krzyzowa during the war to plan the ill-fated, 1944 attempt on
Hitler's life.
	   But they also discussed concepts for a postwar Europe with a
focus on cross-border integration as a way of overcoming
nationalistic feelings, the thinking that five decades later
brought opening of the European Union and NATO for former East Bloc
foes.
	   The conspirators were hanged and the rest of those living on the
estate were expelled after postwar borders of Poland were redrawn
and moved to the west. They were replaced by Poles from eastern
regions that became part of the Soviet Union after the war.
	   The center, which has been in operation since 1994, has 116
beds, a 220-seat multi-purpose hall and a gymnasium, and it has
played host to school and youth groups from around Europe as well
as Israel.
	   Eight years since the fall of communism, Polish German relations
are booming.
	   Focusing on cooperation from trade and defense to fighting last
summer's Oder River floods, both nations have done a lot to bury
the ghosts of World War II - the Nazis' brutal six-year occupation
and the postwar expulsion of millions of Germans.

New Zealand says needle exhange program effective in combatting
</HEADLINE>
AIDS &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ New Zealand's needle exchange program was
largely responsible for keeping HIV infection rates among the
lowest in the world, the country's customs chief said Wednesday.
	   John Delamere, who also serves as associate health minister,
said less than one percent of New Zealand's population was infected
with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
	   He attributed the low rate to a needle exchange program for
addicts, which was begun a decade ago before HIV ``had become
established within the injecting drug using community.''
	   ``Analysts believe that this timely response has helped prevent
the spread of HIV/AIDS amongst injecting drug users and into the
wider community,'' Delamere told the final session of the three-day
U.N. General Assembly special session on drugs.
	   Delamere noted that needle exchange, as well as programs to wean
addicts off heroin by giving them methadone, are widely opposed by
critics who believe they encourage drug abuse.
	   ``For me, the answer `well, it works,' seems to be the best
response to the critics, who I suspect would have us blindly march
down the road towards a `war on drugs,' a philosophy which many
agree hasn't worked,'' he added.
	   Those remarks contrast sharply with the prevailing view in many
developed countries, including the United States.
	   In April, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives
pushed through legislation that would permanently ban federal
funding for needle exchanges.
	   Democrats accused their Republican counterparts of being more
interested in scoring election-year political points than in
fighting illegal drugs. But White House drug policy chief Barry
McCaffrey said federal funding would jeopardize the battle against
drugs.
	   Delamere acknowledged that New Zealand had not been spared the
effects of the global drug epidemic. He said drug use was
especially prevelant among the country's indigenous Maori
population, of which he is a member.
	   He said drug control and education programs designed for the
mainstream population ``have often not provided effective for the
Maori.''

U.S. dollar climbs, Tokyo stocks decline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen Thursday
morning as traders bet that the Group of Seven industrialized
nations was unlikely to intervene to defend the yen. Tokyo stock
prices fell.
	   In morning trading, the dollar bought 141.44 yen, up 0.60 yen
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and just above its late New York level
of 141.43 yen overnight.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 126.62 points, or 0.83
percent, to 15,212.64 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On
Wednesday, the Nikkei sank 190.91 points, or 1.23 percent.
	   Currency traders had been looking to see if G-7 deputy finance
ministers who met in Paris on Wednesday would decide to support the
Japanese currency. But traders said statements from the meeting
signaled no change in policy on the yen.
	   Recent signs that Japan's economy is slowing, such as rising
unemployment and falling corporate profits, have hurt the yen.
	   Japanese officials, though, have warned that the yen may have
weakened excessively against the dollar, suggesting possible
yen-buying intervention.
	   On the Tokyo stock exchange, stocks opened lower led by sharp
drops in bank and securities shares amid worries about bad loans in
the Japanese financial system.
	   The weakness of the yen, which erodes the value of Japanese
stocks held by foreign investors, also hurt sentiment.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 11.72 points, or 0.98 percent, to 1,186.88. The
TOPIX fell 10.08 points, or 0.83 percent the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.200 percent early Thursday from Wednesday's close of
1.195 percent, driving its price down to 112.02 yen from 112.06
yen.

U.N. drug conference ends with agreement to cooperate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Wrapping up a three-day U.N. drug summit,
world leaders expressed broad agreement that combating the drug
trade requires a coordinated global campaign.
	   But the delegates from about 150 countries, who were to adjourn
the conference Wednesday night, were divided about how to wage the
drug war.
	   The summit was to end with participants endorsing a plan for
governments to work together to curb trafficking, reduce demand,
improve judicial cooperation, combat money-laundering and reduce
the illegal cultivation of narcotic crops by 2008.
	   However, the meeting underscored broad differences between
drug-producing countries of Latin America and Asia and the major
consumers _ including the United States _ on how best to direct
limited resources in the fight against drugs.
	   Speakers from Colombia, Myanmar, Mexico and other producers
applauded U.N. proposals to reduce illicit cultivation by providing
Third World farmers with financial incentives to stop growing opium
poppies, coca and cannabis.
	   Several developed countries, including Germany, Japan and
Australia, endorsed those plans. But few promised substantial, new
funds to pay for them, although Canada's solicitor general, Andy
Scott, said his government would consider additional payments.
	   U.S. drug czar Barry McCaffrey, speaking to reporters Monday,
avoided committing the United States to support the U.N. crop
substitution program, saying the global drug war required more than
``just funding for alternative economic development.''
	   Sandro Tucci, a U.N. spokesman, said the conference had
succeeded in convincing governments that reducing demand in rich
countries was a priority.
	   But some private drug research organizations expressed
disappointment that more was not said about ways to treat and
rehabilitate addicts.
	   ``Like the drug war itself, the U.N. drug summit was a
failure,'' said Dr. Ethan Nadelmann, director of the Lindesmith
Center. ``Rather than producing the intended unity, the drug summit
exposed deep divisions ... between drug war zealots who advocate
spending on a failed policy and the reformers who want new
approaches.''
	   Despite those divergent views, the conference showed a universal
belief that curbing drug use must be a major international goal in
the coming century.
	   Nearly all delegates warned of increasing drug use in their
countries, especially among the young. None called for legalization
of drugs.
	   Russia's deputy foreign minister, Yury Ushakov, said the number
of Russian addicts had risen dramatically since the collapse of the
Soviet Union, an observation repeated by leaders of other former
Soviet republics.
	   ``Two or three years ago, people in Kyrgyzstan had only a
theoretical idea what heroin is,'' said Kubanychbek Jumaliev,
president of the former Soviet Central Asian republic. ``Nowadays,
it has become one of the main drugs on the illegal market.''

New leader's promises draw denunciations from opposition

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Resistance to Nigeria's new military
leader mounted amid signs that he was too preoccupied with
consolidating his power base to focus on his vague promise to usher
in civilian rule.
	   Nigeria's boisterous opposition movement, denouncing Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar as nothing new, said Wednesday it planned to
challenge his appointment in court and called for a nationwide
strike for democracy.
	   Gani Fawehinmi, a Lagos attorney and one of the country's
best-known opposition activists, said he would file suit in the
Nigerian high court challenging Abubakar's appointment to replace
dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, who died Monday.
	   Fawehinmi said there was nothing in Nigerian law to say that a
chief of defense staff succeeds the head of state in Africa's most
populous nation.
	   ``Nigerians must intensify their struggle to end military
rule,'' Fawehinmi said.
	   The denunciations _ by an opposition tired of decades of
oppression _ followed a televised speech Tuesday by Abubakar, who
promised to proceed with a transition to civilian rule that Abacha
began. He gave no details on how that would happen.
	   ``The empty maiden address of Gen. Abubakar has confirmed that
there is no hope for Nigeria in Abacha's successor,'' said
Fawehinmi, speaking at a press conference on behalf of the umbrella
opposition group, the Joint Action Committee for Nigeria.
	   He said the group would go ahead with demonstrations in Lagos
planned for Friday, the fifth anniversary of annulled presidential
elections that were apparently going to be won by Moshood Abiola, a
billionaire businessman now in prison.
	   The group called on people to observe a nationwide 24-hour
strike, staying away from their jobs and keeping off the roads. It
also urged them not to recognize Abubakar's government.
	   It was not clear just how many people would heed the callsfor a
strike. Similar calls for demonstrations have sometimes resulted in
only a few hundred people turning out.
	   Abubakar, meanwhile, appeared to be taking care to avoid any
internal threats to his fledgling government.
	   Two members of his inner circle were placed under house arrest
in the capital, Abuja, two independent sources confirmed Wednesday,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   ``I don't see it getting better for now,'' said Clement Nwankwo,
head of the Constitutional Rights Project. He did add, though, that
pressure on Nigeria's opposition groups, which has been increasing
in recent months, may ease for a while.
	   Abacha had blatantly manipulated the system to ensure he would
be the only candidate in Aug. 1 presidential elections. The
transition was to be completed by Oct. 1.
	   Government opponents said they had few expectations of change in
a country whose economy is crushed despite its vast oil reserves.
	   Little in Nigeria functions these days, from the water supply to
the telephones. The only people who manage to live easily are those
who can afford to buy generators, truck in their own water and hire
security guards to fend off the rampant crime.

Air France: returning to normal; last unions vote

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ With a 10-day pilots' strike behind it, Air France
was beginning the tough job of winning back customers and erasing
losses run up from the pay dispute that lasted until the World
Cup's opening day.
	   A day after the surprise agreement, the carrier on Thursday
planned 40-50 percent of its flights and to return to normal by the
weekend.
	   The longest routes, including Hong Kong, Manila and
Johannesburg, were to be the last flights restored.
	   Jean-Cyril Spinetta, president of Air France, called the
agreement reached overnight Wednesday a good compromise. The main
pilots' union finally accepted the company's offer of stock in
exchange for pay.
	   But Spinetta said the strike had ``heavy'' consequences, costing
the company a billion francs (dlrs 166 million.)
	   ``Now we have to think of confidence, confidence in Air
France,'' he said.
	   It could have been worse, said Transport Minister Jean-Claude
Gayssot. Air France's future ``would have been put in grave danger
by the continuation of this conflict.''
	   Three smaller unions still on strike were to meet Thursday to
decide whether to pursue their job action.
	   In concessions to the pilots, the carrier said it would scrap a
two-tier salary scale, under which new pilots earned less than
their colleagues. The highly paid pilots felt that that system
undermined cockpit solidarity.
	   The pilots had been protesting 500 million francs (dlrs 83
million) in proposed salary cuts. Air France had said the cuts were
needed to provide capital to modernize the airline, which was saved
from bankruptcy in 1993 but reported profits in 1996 and 1997.
	   Air France said part of the agreement involved guaranteed
training for young pilots, at least part of which would be paid for
by the company. The salary-for-shares swap is voluntary.
	   As well as the airline strike, France has been hit in recent
days by walkouts by train drivers, baggage handlers, and some bus
services. There were no major walkouts Wednesday.

Seoul subway workers go on strike to press for pay hikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Seoul's unionized subway workers went
on strike Thursday after last-minute negotiations with management
on demands for pay hikes broke down.
	   But the walkout failed to disrupt the normal running of trains,
which were being operated by nonunion workers.
	   Management cautioned, however, that a prolonged strike could
cause the subway's normal three-minute interval between trains
during rush hours to be increased.
	   The Seoul subway's 9,000 unionized workers began the strike at 5
a.m. (2000 GMT Wednesday), demanding a 7.8 percent pay hike and a
reduction in work hours from the present 42 to 40 per week.
	   Management rejected the demands, saying that the subway
consistently loses money.
	   Sohn Jang-ho, head of the Seoul Subway Authority, reported
``some progress'' during overnight talks but refused to elaborate,
though he indicated the strike could end within the day.
	   The central government ruled the strike illegal because it was
launched while the case was under review by the government's labor
arbitration committee.
	   At management's request the government committee was to rule on
the case later Thursday. Under Korean law, a 15-day cooling-off
period is mandatory for a labor case under review by the committee.
	   The subway union has rejected the committee's role, accusing it
of siding with management. In past labor disputes, the union has
never honored the committee's role.

Report: Despite progress on key fronts, world still a risky place
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ED McCULLOUGH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Some bitter regional conflicts have
subsided. Global military spending continues to decline.
Once-mighty arsenals are being dismantled.
	   Yet the world remains a dangerous place.
	   That's a finding of the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute, which published its authoritative yearbook on Wednesday.
	   There were 25 major armed conflicts in 1997, strife in which at
least 1,000 people were killed. That's down from 27 the previous
year and 36 in 1989.
	   World military expenditure declined by about one-third from 1988
to 1997, when spending was estimated at 740 billion dollars. The
biggest cutbacks were made by the republics that made up the former
Soviet Union.
	   Among other positive signs, Russia and the United States are
ahead of schedule in taking apart strategic nuclear weapons.
	   The cease-fire in Northern Ireland curtailed the last major
armed conflict in Europe. And peace accords last year in Liberia,
Tajikistan, Bangladesh and Nicaragua are ``major successes,'' the
report stated.
	   Nevertheless, the authors of the SIPRI yearbook, which is
regarded as a definitive assessment of global security issues, were
solemn, not cheerful, as they presented the 29th edition at a news
conference.
	   The testing last month of nuclear devices by India and Pakistan
could lead to a disastrous confrontation, one expert said.
	   ``War is quite possible,'' said Eric Arnett, author of the
military research and development section of the yearbook. ``It's
also quite possible that nuclear weapons might be used.''
	   The neighboring Asian countries have fought three wars since
1947 _ two over Kashmir, which is divided between them and where
each side has already positioned thousands of troops.
	   Arnett said India appeared to have 20-30 nuclear warheads,
compared with 10-20 for Pakistan.
	   The next ``crisis'' with Iraq strongman Saddam Hussein may be
right around the corner. By ``late summer, early autumn,'' when
United Nations inspectors press ahead with their search for
biological weapons, Hussein likely will resist, said Peter Jones,
author of the report's section on the Middle East.
	   ``The United States and Britain ... are determined to see that
he does comply,'' Jones added. ``I do think we are building toward
a crisis.''
	   SIPRI noted that most conflicts since the end of the Cold War
occur within a single country rather than between nations; and
happen more often in ``failed'' authoritarian states rather than in
democratic, prosperous ones.
	   That should indicate to governments as they enter the 21st
century that true peace means more than countries arming themselves
so heavily that no one will attack them, the respected research
institute said.
	   ``The security agenda ahead must be founded on a new political
philosophy, encompassing a common, institutionalized system of
standards and shared values rather than concepts based on the
balance of power,'' it stated.
	   The institute called for the ``complete elimination of nuclear
weapons,'' though the report and comments from its authors
indicated that was unlikely to take place any time soon.
	   Peace prospects for the Middle East remain distant, for which
Jones blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benhamin Netanyahu.
	   ``Although there is ample blame for all the parties involved,
the conclusion cannot be escaped that Netanyahu's commitment to the
peace process has never been more than equivocal,'' he stated.

Rebels, state police clash in Chiapas; at least one policeman dead

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ In one of the
deadliest clashes since the early days of the Zapatista uprising,
six people believed to be Zapatista rebels and a police officer
were killed when the army tried to retake control of a town
sympathetic to the rebels in the southern state of Chiapas.
Fifty-two people were arrested.
	   Nine people were injured, including seven police officers. One
officer was wounded when a police helicopter was fired on and
forced to land.
	   Peace talks have been stalled for two years and tensions have
been rising between supporters of the government and those of the
Zapatista National Liberation Army, which staged a brief uprising
in 1994 in the name of Indian rights.
	   Clashes between the supporters of both sides have been
increasingly frequent, but military clashes involving the rebels
have been rare.
	   The state government said the raid in the municipality of El
Bosque, 25 miles (40 kms) north of San Cristobal, was intended to
capture criminal suspects and restore order to the area following
violence in recent months. They have used similar justifications
for other raids on rebel-supporting villages.
	   Details of the fighting remained unclear because state police
and soldiers prevented most foreign and national journalists from
getting near the scene.
	   Zapatista supporters said that security forces entered the
communities of Union Progreso and Chabajebal firing guns,
destroying houses and chasing after villagers.
	   The government said villagers had fired the first shots. Jose
Luis Zenteno, a public security officer, said he and several others
policemen were driving to search a house in Chabajebal when several
men _ wearing the ski masks used by Zapatista rebels _ opened fire
with automatic weapons. Zenteno said one officer was killed and
five were wounded in the 7 a.m. ambush.
	   Five of the six Zapatistas killed in fighting in Chabajebal wore
military-style uniforms similar to those used by Zapatistas, the
government said.
	   By late afternoon, officials said the fighting had stopped, the
communities were under government control and soldiers were combing
the mountains in search of rebels.
	   The fighting came a day after six government supporters were
ambushed in the village of Los Platanos. The government said it was
only the latest in a series of attacks that have killed three
people and injured 11 since April. The Zapatistas denied
responsibility for Tuesday's attack.
	   The government accused the Zapatistas of trying to trigger a
situation ``similar to that which occurred unfortunately in
Acteal,'' so they could blame the government and security forces.
Pro-government paramilitaries killed 45 people in the pro-Zapatista
village of Acteal in December, reportedly to avenge the killing of
the brother of a local official.
	   It said it had asked for the army's help in capturing 15
suspects wanted for crimes including homicide and robbery and to
``reestablish a state of law'' in the municipality.
	   Zapatista sympathizers had set up a rebel town council in El
Bosque 2 1/2 years ago. Members of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party had their own town council at a house a few
blocks away.
	   The two town councils appeared to coexist peacefully until
Wednesday.
	   Overall, supporters of the Zapatistas have set up 32 parallel
town councils _ most of them a symbolic presence _ since late 1994.
The government late last year began breaking them up, and 28 now
remain.

Head of World Bank urges Japan to shore up its economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SETH SUTEL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Adding his voice to a chorus of world finance
officials, World Bank President James Wolfensohn urged Japan to act
in a ``definitive way'' to shore up its economy.
	   Wolfensohn told a group of Japanese executives Wednesday night
that a recovery in their country was key to restoring growth in
struggling Asian economies like Thailand and Indonesia which rely
on Japan for trade and investment.
	   ``Japan has to react'' to its economic problems, Wolfensohn said
in a speech to the annual meeting of the Japan Society. ``Not just
for Japan, but because the world is coming to count on you now.''
	   Wolfensohn ticked off a list of woes ailing Japan, including
record joblessness, the drastic weakening of the yen against other
currencies, a crisis in the banking sector and waning confidence
among industry leaders.
	   Noting that Japan's massive dlrs 5.2 trillion economy dwarfs
those of its neighbors _ Indonesia's economy is just 5 percent the
size of Japan's _ Wolfensohn said it was important to consider the
strength of Japan's position in the region. ``Japan is the
locomotive ... and now it's not going well,'' he said.
	   ``So, small wonder that we look to Japan with concern ...
because they're our partners, and we're deeply concerned,'' he
said.
	   Wolfensohn struck a more conciliatory tone in his comments
directed at Tokyo compared to senior U.S. officials, some of whom
have used more stringent language in pressing Japan to make greater
efforts to strengthen its economy.
	   Last month, Japanese officials came under pressure at a summit
of world leaders in Birmingham, England to follow through on its
promises to stimulate its economy. A recent package of Japanese
stimulus measures has been criticized as coming up short, and on
Friday, Japan is expected to announce that its economy contracted
for two straight quarters, putting it into recession.
	   But Wolfensohn expressed confidence that Japan would come
through on its promises to get itself back on its feet _ and
hopefully its struggling Asian neighbors as well.
	   ``Japan has everything that is necessary to get it right,''
Wolfensohn said. ``It has the people, it has the education, it has
the resources _ and all it needs to do is act in a definitive
way.''
	   The World Bank, along with its sister organization, the
International Monetary Fund, makes loans to developing nations in
an effort to combat poverty and foster economic development.

Bit by byte, a cyborg future looms

 &UR; AP Photos NY329-330 &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS ALLBRITTON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Cyberspace Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ The three young men at the top of the stairs in
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Lab look pretty
weird.
	   Leonard Foner resembles a collision between an oversized kid and
a Nintendo machine. A chunky eyepiece, apparently scavenged from a
camcorder, protrudes from his left eye, supported by Terminator
sunglasses. A black vest girdled with circuits and computer
hardware wraps his upper body, and a hard drive nestles in the
small of his back.
	   His buddy, Thad Starner, sports clear plastic safety goggles and
carries his computer in a shoulder bag.
	   The third researcher, Brad Rhodes clutches a small keypad in his
left hand, and his fingers twitch furiously as he takes notes on a
miniature computer.
	   They belong to a group of graduate students who are researching
``wearables'': personal _ very personal _ computers small enough to
fit into eyeglasses and hip pouches but powerful enough to access
the world's information. This technology looks clunky and a little
intimidating today, but it promises to shrink, streamline and grow
more inconspicuous.
	   The researchers at MIT envision a digital paradise: instant
translation among the world's tongues, the ability to monitor or
even affect events anywhere in the world, a constant connection to
global conversations in cyberspace.
	   But by transcending the limits that nature imposed on our
all-too-human flesh, researchers at MIT and elsewhere find
themselves poking at the edges of fundamental questions.
	   The answers may change forever what it means to be human.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Powerful stuff, eh? Grand-cool visions of a Silicon Age. But is
it science or fiction? The root of the question lies in both.
	   The term cyborg, for cybernetic organism, was proposed in the
1960s as a solution to the harsh environment of space. It would be
much easier, Manfred E. Clynes and Nathan S. Kline believed, to
adapt an astronaut's body instead of protecting him from the
vacuum. Breathing in space is cumbersome, they wrote. ``One
proposed solution in the not too distant future is relatively
simple: Don't breathe!''
	   But the idea of artificial humans goes back farther. Back at
least to the Middle Ages when the Golem, a clay creature brought to
life by Jewish mysticism, defended the ghetto in Prague. And back
to 1818, when Mary Shelley wrote ``Frankenstein, or the Modern
Prometheus.''
	   It took Hollywood to bring cyborgs into their own as modern
bugaboos. RoboCop, Arnold Schwarzenegger's ``Terminator,'' the
chilling Borg Collective on ``Star Trek: The Next Generation,'' a
rakish collection of villains and flawed heroes respectively
gunning or pining for humanity.
	   In real life, ``cyborg'' can be applied to anyone with a
body-enhancing add-on. Do you have a titanium alloy knee joint, a
myoelectric arm, a pacemaker, breast implants, contact lenses, a
polio vaccination? Technically, you're a cyborg.
	   So perhaps the group at MIT that calls itself the 'borg is onto
something. Perhaps their explorations using chunky, clunky
electronics are a natural consequence of the increasingly common
merging of technology and flesh. As the Borg Collective announce:
``Your life, as it has been, is over. ... Prepare to be
assimilated.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   That's the joke of the 'borgs' name: a double pun on cyborg and
Star Trek. And they've taken the image of the fictional characters
to heart.
	   In small pouches, they carry their processing chips, hard
drives, wireless modems and batteries. They often have a miniature
video monitor _ sort of like a camcorder viewscreen _ affixed to
modified eyeglasses or suspended from a hat brim. Instead of a
keyboard or a mouse, a handheld keypad allows them to enter data
almost fast as someone can talk.
	   The wearable software can remind them of appointments, and let
them take notes and surf the Internet.
	   But the potential is much greater. While the handheld electronic
organizers of today can help schedule your life, those of the
future may help you live it.
	   Soon, says 'borg Brad Rhodes, the wearables will be able to
recognize speech and faces. And software he is developing, called a
``remembrance agent,'' will watch over you 24 hours a day, every
day, supplying you with the information you need in any given
situation.
	   Example: You recognize someone but can't remember her name. Your
wearable analyzes her face and scans a database of people you've
met. The machine makes a match and displays the dossier on a tiny
screen hanging in front of your eye or maybe whispers through tiny
speakers in your ears. Now you know her name, occupation and any
e-mail correspondence you may have had.
	   While you two talk, your wearable parses the chit-chat, tapping
into global databases via a wireless modem for data relevant to
your conversation. As you talk about how hot it's been lately, the
agent sifts through newspaper clippings feeding you the latest news
on, say, global warming.

	   Wearables may be only an interim step. As disk drives and
computer chips shrink and streamline, the next step may be to
implant tiny computer parts under the skin or behind the ears. The
electrical energy in your body could supply the power. Filings in
your teeth could be the antennae for your Internet connection,
which could pump the data to a heads-up display built into your
eyeglasses.
	   ``The line between human and computer at some point will become
completely blurred,'' predicted Alvin Toffler in his 1981 book
``The Third Wave.''
	   That kind of technology, admittedly, is years away, but the
implications are troubling. Hacking the body to install a computer
that becomes part of you, that grants instant access to the sum of
human knowledge... Well, it sounds almost godlike.
	   ``'Godlike' implies infinite comprehension,'' says MIT's Foner.
``I don't think we're getting there.''
	   Hans Moravec, however, can't wait. He's the director of the
Mobile Robot Laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University in
Pittsburgh, and in his 1988 book, ``Mind Children,'' he suggested
that in just 50 years, people would be downloading their minds into
infinitely better robot bodies. Imagine Homo Sapiens version 2.0,
the postbiological human.
	   ``I have faith in these computers,'' he wrote. ``You're going to
be more intelligent, you'll be able to do much more, understand
much more, go more places, not die _ all those things.''
	   At MIT and Carnegie Mellon, and throughout the United States
from Stanford in California to Columbia in New York, researchers
are investigating everything from genetic engineering to advanced
robotics. Companies such as Microsoft and Apple are hard at work
looking for ways to insinuate more computer technology into our
lives.
	   And while the students at MIT work on programming their external
computers, researchers around the world are busy learning the
language of our internal one.
	   The human genome project aims to map all 80,000 human genes in
DNA by 2005. Once that's done the notion of ``human'' may change
radically. As we take command of our evolutionary destiny, not only
will we deconstruct the human software, we will be able to
reconstruct it. Whether we use silicon or DNA, future humans might
be crafted by technology.
	   Which is just fine, as ``we're not really biological creatures
anymore,'' says Moravec. ``Most of what we pass on to our children
is culture, libraries.'' He pointed out that the thousands of genes
on human DNA only add up to two billion bits of data, ``and most
hard drives have 10 times that today.''
	   Alan Marcus, a professor of history at Iowa State University at
Ames, echoes the view of genes as small units of ``code,'' computer
jargon for computer commands. Our genes program us to react in
certain ways, as if they were small computer programs. And if so,
why not plug new genes into an organism in a different order and
get something entirely new? Why not program life like a computer?
If you could do that, would there be any difference between the
two?
	   ``Once you've reduced living matter to bits, if you will, and
once you think about programming living things just as you would
program nonliving things, then that division doesn't exist
anymore,'' says Marcus.

Defense ministers to seek plans for Kosovo intervention
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps previous to UPDATE with quotes from White House, US
leaning toward military exercises in Albania, Macedonia. &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ As Yugoslavia strengthens its forces in
embattled Kosovo province, NATO officials appear increasingly
likely to order military action to stop the violence.
	   NATO defense ministers were opening a two-day meeting in
Brussels on Thursday to discuss Kosovo. Ahead of the meeting, there
was a growing conviction that the only way of defusing the
situation could be through military force.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen acknowledged ``a general
consensus there should be accelerated planning'' and that ``all
NATO members feel an increased sense of urgency.''
	   ``There is a genuine concern throughout the region that if this
goes unchecked, it could have much wider implications than just
Kosovo,'' he said on Wednesday. Many fear a new, bigger Balkan war.
	   White House spokesman Mike McCurry said in Washington Wednesday
the goal was ``to clearly indicate that NATO will define and
project its interests in the Balkans in a way that reminds the
Belgrade authorities of how seriously we take the violence that has
occurred in Kosovo, directed against the Kosovar Albanians.''
	   McCurry said U.S. action should be seen as ``one that in concert
with the actions of other governments, particularly European Union
governments, can have an impact.''
	   More than 250 people have died in fighting between government
forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, the armed wing of the ethnic
Albanian independence movement. Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90
percent of the province's population, demand independence from
Serbia, the larger of the two republics in Yugoslavia.
	   The United States and its allies support autonomy for Kosovo but
oppose rebel demands for independence.
	   Also Wednesday, the six-nation Contact Group, which monitors
Yugoslavia, met in Paris to discuss ways to solve the Kosovo
crisis. The group planned to offer proposals to the Group of Eight
industrialized nations, set to meet Friday in London.
	   The Contact Group includes the United States, Russia and Western
European countries. It planned to propose a first ``phase of
persuasion,'' in which Russia would contact both Yugoslavia and the
Kosovo Albanians, said group's French representative Jacques Blot.
	   If Belgrade does not respond, the Contact Group would meet again
to carry out other measures agreed on, said Blot, who declined to
describe the options.
	   NATO ambassadors worked late Wednesday on detailed instructions
for the military, including a clear statement of the objective of
any intervention.
	   Also under debate were a series of proposed immediate measures,
including air maneuvers in the next few days over Albania and
Macedonia in a show of strength, establishing military training and
exercise centers, and using NATO transport to cope with refugee
flows.
	   McCurry said there had been discussions about the use of air
forces, something that should be taken up by NATO military experts.
	   The United States and the European Union have imposed economic
sanctions on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, but hold out
little hope they will result in a government pullback in Kosovo.
	   NATO military planners have for the past two weeks been studying
indirect options for pressuring Milosevic, including dispatching up
to 20,000 troops to Albania and Macedonia, reinforcing the existing
750-member U.N. force in Macedonia, and helping both countries
secure borders while dealing with refugees and arms smuggling.
	   The Clinton administration is signaling it wants NATO to
organize air exercises in Albania and Macedonia.
	   A U.S. official traveling with Cohen said the defense ministers
``are likely to endorse ... planning for air exercises in Albania
and Macedonia.'' The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
noted the details of the exercise will be worked out by NATO
military experts.
	   In London on Wednesday, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said
that military force is necessary for a diplomatic solution of the
Kosovo crisis.
	   Britain is leading an effort to win U.N. Security Council
approval for a resolution authorizing ``all necessary means'' to
deal with the situation in Kosovo. The United States is backing the
plan, but Russia has opposed it so far.

 &UR; Cure or not, many with arthritis believe in nutritional
supplements &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL Q. HANEY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Editor &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Suddenly hundreds of thousands, maybe even
millions, of Americans with arthritis are taking a combination of
obscure nutritional supplements. Whatever made these pills the
latest cure, it's certainly not the way their names roll off the
tongue.
	   Glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. Hard to imagine
marketing executives coming up with those tongue-twisters.
	   It's also not because a lot of arthritis specialists are pushing
them on their patients. Mention health store pills to most doctors,
and the response is likely to fall somewhere between a blank look
and a condescending smile.
	   The real reasons, it seems, are a cleverly titled book, a
hard-to-treat disease that afflicts 16 million Americans and that
most elusive and powerful of marketing forces, a good buzz on the
street. Or the golf course. Or wherever else men and women of a
certain age gather and talk about what's aching them.
	   Across the country, folks have seized on these over-the-counter
pills as a new way to ease throbbing knees and hands, even though
the opinion of the medical establishment is, to put it politely,
skeptical. Just how many of these people are truly finding relief
is impossible to say, but clearly the experience has made believers
of some.
	   Among them is Ralph Cushman, 49, a real estate lawyer in
Anchorage, Alaska. Cushman is the kind of guy who lives to hike and
fish. Those pleasures gradually grew difficult as old injuries
stiffened his knees with arthritis, making walking painful. On a
hunting trip two years ago, he got 500 feet (150 meters) up a
mountain and could go no farther.
	   ``It was heartbreaking.'' he recalled. ``Suddenly, I couldn't
deer hunt anymore. All the things I lived for were slipping away.''
	   His doctor told him nothing could be done. Take pain pills and
live with it. Cushman limped to a bookstore. There he found
something that, in his mind, changed his life.
	   ``The Arthritis Cure,'' written by Dr. Jason Theodosakis, lays
out a program of exercise, diet and glucosamine and chondroitin.
The book has sold more than 1.4 million copies since it came out
last year.
	   Cushman followed its directions. ``Within days, I realized it
was making a tremendous difference,'' he said. ``Suddenly I could
out-hike my boys rather than hollering for them to wait. There was
just no question this was working. I assure you, you cannot make
that kind of pain go away with a placebo.''
	   ``Placebo'' is just one of the words that comes up when
arthritis doctors get onto this subject. They correctly point out
that a belief something will work is often powerful medicine in
itself. Indeed, when researchers test possible arthritis drugs,
about 30 percent feel better even when they are in the comparison
group getting sugar pills. Some doctors suspect this may at least
partly explain why people find relief from glucosamine and
chondroitin.
	   ``Patients invest time and money in them and they want them to
work, so they are more likely to see a positive effect than a
negative one,'' said Dr. Jonathan Kay of the Lahey Clinic in
Burlington, Mass.
	   Osteoarthritis, by far the most common form of the disease,
develops when the cartilage that covers the ends of the bones in
the joints begins to break down. Eventually, bone rubs against
bone, causing pain and loss of movement.
	   Doctors' usual advice is exercise to strengthen the muscles
around the joints and weight loss to reduce some of the stress.
Mainstream practitioners also usually recommend anti-inflammatory
drugs. Among these are aspirin, Motrin and other other-the-counter
painkillers and a variety of prescription medicines.
	   But many patients suffer despite these pills, and steady use can
have serious side effects, such as stomach ulcers and liver damage.
According to one estimate, anti-inflammatory drugs contribute to
more than 7,000 deaths in the United States annually. Furthermore,
the medicines do nothing to slow the progression of arthritis.
	   Unlike these drugs, glucosamine (pronounced glue-COSE-uh-mean)
and chondroitin (conn-DROY-tin) are already present in the body as
building material of cartilage.
	   Proponents theorize that taking extra glucosamine stimulates new
cartilage production, while chondroitin slows its destruction. To
hear them tell it, these supplements not only relieve or eliminate
the pain, they can also stop and even reverse the disease. And they
do all this with no side effects.
	   To which many arthritis experts reply: Show us the proof.
	   Most studies of glucosamine and chondroitin were done several
years ago in Europe. In general, they suggest that the supplements
work about as well as over-the-counter painkillers in easing the
ache. In the test tube, they appear to stimulate and preserve
cartilage.
	   However, skeptics note these studies were small, not
particularly well done and didn't combine glucosamine and
chondroitin, which is the way most people now take them.
	   Dr. Doyt Conn, medical director of the Arthritis Foundation,
said the supplements appear to be safe, and they may indeed do some
good for some people, but his organization cannot recommend them
until there are better scientific data.
	   ``We have to be responsible to the public and give them what
reliable information there is to make a judgment,'' Conn said.
``Right now, I don't think that information is out there.''
	   Several U.S. studies are under way, sponsored by companies that
make the supplements. The National Institutes of Health is also
underwriting one, with results expected in about five years.

Largest-ever survey of the heavens about to start
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY301 &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL RECER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ The most ambitious mapping of the heavens ever
undertaken is about to start from a remote observatory in New
Mexico, using the most complex camera ever built.
	   The dlrs 77 million project, called the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey, will probe 40 times farther into the universe than any
earlier survey, taking pictures in three dimensions and in five
colors, astronomers announced here Monday.
	   When the survey is complete, it will provide an atlas of the
skies 100 times clearer than the star charts relied upon for
decades and will have pinpointed the location of more than 100
million galaxies.
	   Yet, the survey will produce images that anyone will be able to
view on a computer. One day, say the astronomers, schoolchildren
will be able to display on their computers the same images experts
use to study the heavens.
	   ``This is not just a telescope,'' said Jim Crocker of Johns
Hopkins University, one of nine organizations participating in the
project. ``This is a science factory.''
	   Members of the project team unfurled a 35-foot-long
(10.6-meter-long) photo swatch of the heavens taken during the
project's ``first light,'' the initial pictures taken by a new
telescope. The photo contained thousands upon thousands of stellar
objects in different colors.
	   ``What you see is 1 percent of one second of data from this
instrument,'' said Bruce Margon of the University of Washington,
the science director of the project. He said that by the time the
survey is finished, it will have collected 10 terabytes (10
followed by 13 zeros) of data. The amount of data will equal what
is now stored in the Library of Congress.
	   The goal is to completely map, in three dimensions, more than
half of the heavens, cataloging 100 million of the brightest
galaxies and 100,000 quasars. From its location at Apache Point,
New Mexico, north of White Sands, the telescope cannot see some of
the sky over the Southern Hemisphere.
	   For the galaxy catalog, the telescope will be able to detect
objects out to 2 billion light-years. For quasars, the most
energetic objects in the universe, the telescope will see out to 10
billion light-years. A light-year is the distance travels in one
year, or about 6 trillion miles.
	   ``For quasars, we get to the very end (of the universe), as deep
as the Hubble'' Space Telescope, said Neta Bahcall, a Princeton
astronomer and a member of the survey team.
	   The 2.5-meter (8.2-foot) telescope is teamed with a digital
camera that Mike Turner of Fermilab, one of the sponsoring
institutions, called ``the most complicated camera ever built.''
	   The camera includes 54 light amplifiers and is able to gather
more pixels of light than the human eye. In contrast to digital
cameras that capture images on tiny chips of silicon, the camera
includes a full square foot (0.09 square meter) of silicone.
	   Images, in digital form, flow from the camera into a computer
system at the rate of 8.5 million bytes a second, said Constance
Rockosi, a University of Chicago graduate student credited with
much of the key assembly work on the camera.
	   The system includes two spectrographs, instruments that break
down the wavelengths of light, that will be able to tell the
composition of objects, their speed of motion and their distance
from Earth.
	   Spectrographs have been used for decades by astronomers, but not
like this, said Crocker.
	   ``In the first two weeks, we will collect more spectra than all
of the other surveys in history,'' he said.
	   Margon said the current sky survey by astronomers is a
40-year-old collection of black-and-white photo plates taken at the
Palomar Observatory with a conventional astronomy camera.
	   The new survey will go out at least 40 times farther and will be
in five colors. ``This will be a permanent digital encyclopedia of
the sky,'' he said.
	   Eventually, the work will be contained on 200 CD ROM computer
disks and be available on the Internet. People will be able to slip
in a disk or connect to the Web site ``www.sdss.org'' and see high
definition views of the heavens.
	   ``For generations to come, many groups will be able to study
galaxies and clusters of galaxies,'' said Bahcall. ``With this
data, we'll be able to take a journey through the universe.''
	   The first light image of the survey was unveiled at the national
meeting of the American Astronomical Society.

Swiss official said Switzerland not heading toward drug
</HEADLINE>
legalization &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Switzerland's controversial program of
distributing heroin and other hard drugs to selected addicts does
not mean the country is heading toward legalizing drugs, the
country's vice president said.
	   ``I wish to repeat this loud and clear here: Switzerland is not
moving toward drug liberalization,'' Ruth Dreifuss told the closing
session of the three-day U.N. General Assembly special session on
drugs.
	   ``Quite the contrary,'' she added Wednesday. ``Heroin remains a
banned substance in Switzerland and it can only be prescribed with
special authorization from the Confederation in specialized
institutions.''
	   Last September, Swiss voters overwhelmingly endorsed their
government's liberal drug policies, including the controversial _
but seemingly successful _ state distribution of heroin.
	   Dreifuss said the results of studies indicated that the program
of ``medical presciption of drugs'' made it possible ``to reach
high-dependent drug addicts who had tried other forms of therapy
but without success. Their state of health has considerably
approved, as have their social situations.''
	   She said prescribing morphine and heroin to addicts was simply
one treatment option and ``many conditions need to be present for
such therapies so as not to cause more harm than good.''
	   ``Given the magnitude of these problems and aware that there is
no single solution to solve them, the government of Switzerland has
opted for a pragmatic, coherent policy to reduce drug addiction and
its negative consequences and combat organize crime,'' Dreifuss
added.
	   She said other elements of the Swiss program treatment,
education and strict law enforcement, especially in the control of
money-laundering and precursor drugs, which can be synthesized into
narcotics.
	   Nevertheless, the Swiss program has raised concern in
Switzerland and elsewhere in Europe that the country could emerge
as a ``drug island'' on the continent.
	   Swiss officials insist, however, that the program has reduced
drug deaths and allowed many addicts to break their dependency.
	   Results of a three-year study released in last year showed a big
drop in crime among addicts on the program; a huge improvement in
their health; an increase in the number of those with steady
housing and jobs; and promising signs that some would try to kick
the habit.
	   There are an estimated 30,000 addicts in Switzerland _ one of
the highest rates in Europe. But unlike many countries, the death
toll is falling.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ The Supreme Court Wednesday ordered
the extradition of a Peruvian woman accused of participating in
terrorist acts as a member of the Shining Path guerrilla group.
	   The court said Cecilia Rossana Nunez Chipana, alias ``Comrade
Ana,'' should be sent to Peru with the condition that she not be
executed, which is prohibited in Venezuela.
	   Venezuelan police arrested Nunez last February in an apartment
in downtown Caracas. Peruvian authorities claim she belongs to
Shining Path and was involved in a July 1992 car bomb that killed
21 people in a wealthy Lima neighborhood.

Brain transplants ease symptom resembling Huntington's disease in

monkeys &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Monkeys that were made clumsy by brain damage
showed significant recovery when they received transplants of
embryonic tissue to their brains, an encouraging result for
treating Huntington's disease with transplants.
	   Scientists have already started putting embryonic tissue into
the brains of some Huntington's patients to see if it can treat the
genetic disorder. Huntington's erodes concentration and memory and
causes twitching, clumsiness and difficulty in walking, speaking
and swallowing.
	   The new work is reported in the June issue of the journal Nature
Medicine by scientists at Cambridge University in England. They
damaged part of the brains of 12 marmosets by injecting quinolinic
acid. That made the monkeys very clumsy in one hand during a test
in which they grasped food from step-like shelves.
	   Six of the monkeys later received transplants of embryonic
monkey brain tissue to the damaged areas of their brains. That made
them much less clumsy in the food-grasping task for up to nine
months.
	   Studies of their brains showed the grafted tissue could survive
at least a year after transplant, without anti-rejection drugs.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Add age-related hearing loss to the list of
health problems cigarette smokers are more likely to face.
	   A five-year study of 3,753 middle-age and older people found
that smokers are 1.7 times as likely to have age-related hearing
loss as nonsmokers.
	   Lead researcher Karen Cruickshanks, associate professor of
ophthalmology and visual sciences at the University of Wisconsin
Medical School in Madison, said the findings suggest an association
between smoking and hearing loss but more study is needed to
determine if a direct cause-and-effect relationship exists.
	   Hearing loss may be a coincidence, Cruickshanks said Monday.
	   ``It's most likely that there are many factors that play a role
in the age-related loss of hearing, and possibly smoking is one of
them,'' she said.
	   The National Institute on Aging funded the study, published in
Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
	   The study, started in 1993, took place in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin,
using participants from a large population-based study on vision
and factors that might affect vision loss. Participants were ages
48 to 92.
	   The more people smoked, the study found, the greater their risk
of hearing loss: People who smoked an average of a pack a day for
40 years were 1.3 times as likely to have a hearing loss as those
who had smoked a pack a day for a decade.
	   Forty-six percent of those studied were nonsmokers, 39.3 percent
were ex-smokers and 14.7 percent were current smokers. Data was
incomplete for some of the original participants.
	   Of participants between the ages of 60 and 69, 35.3 percent of
nonsmokers suffered a hearing loss, 47.3 percent of ex-smokers and
56.4 percent of current smokers.
	   Hearing loss is estimated to affect 30 percent to 35 percent of
adults ages 65 to 75 years old in the United States.
	   The study defined hearing loss as an average loss of more than
25 decibels compared with normal hearing. People with this mild
form of hearing loss would have some trouble understanding
conversation when there is background noise.
	   The study accounted for several factors, including age,
occupational noise exposure and history of cardiovascular disease.
	   Dr. John Leonetti, a professor at Loyola University Medical
Center in Maywood who specializes in the study of ear-related
disorders, said doctors like himself already believe smoking can
cause hearing loss.
	   Leonetti, who was not involved in the study, advises patients to
avoid nicotine, caffeine and chocolate _ all things that can
constrict the body's small vessels.
	   ``I think it's important to get the word out ... that counseling
patients about smoking is important with respect to hearing loss,''
he said.

	   BOSTON (AP) _ Women run up 30 percent higher annual medical
bills than men do, but it's not necessarily because they're sicker.
	   A Canadian study found that women's higher medical costs can be
explained largely by the expense of pregnancy and childbirth as
well as uniquely female diseases.
	   Many studies have found that women use more medical resources,
and experts have wondered whether the explanation is that women are
more willing to seek care or that they actually get sick more
often.
	   The latest study, directed by Cameron A. Mustard of the
Institute for Work and Health in Toronto, was based on a review of
all 1.1 million people covered by provincial health insurance in
Manitoba in 1994. The results were published in Thursday's New
England Journal of Medicine.
	   Overall, women's bills averaged dlrs 1,164 per year, while men's
were dlrs 918. The figures are in Canadian dollars.
	   Twenty-two percent of women's health costs were for specifically
female conditions, while just 3 percent of men's health bills were
for male conditions, such as prostate treatment.

Sandinista chief ordered to court on rape charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ A judge has ordered former President
Daniel Ortega to appear in court to face charges he raped and
abused his stepdaughter.
	   Attorneys for Ortega, secretary-general of the leftist
Sandinista National Liberation Front, have claimed he has immunity
because he is a deputy in the National Legislature. But Managua
criminal judge Marta Quezada said Wednesday that claim was never
made in pretrial documents.
	   Ortega's lawyer, Ramon Rojas, said such a claim was unnecessary
because it is public knowledge that Ortega is a legislator. He said
Ortega would not be in contempt of court if he ignores the summons.
	   Zoilamerica Narvaez, 30, filed a complaint alleging that she had
been molested by her stepfather since she was 11 years old.
	   Ortega led the Sandinistas since before they overthrew dictator
Anastasio Somoza in 1979 and served as president from 1979 to 1989.
He has not responded publicly to Narvaez's allegations.
	   In her criminal complaint, Narvaez claimed Ortega had molested
her since she was 11. In her account, she said he raped her at age
15 and sometimes forced her to have sex with a third person while
he watched.
	   She said the sexual abuse continued after her marriage and the
birth of her two children, lasting until she went public with her
charges in March.
	   His wife and one of her sons has defended him, accusing Narvaez
of having mental problems.

U.N. drug conference ends with agreement to cooperate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with conference ending; adoption of resolutions &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Wrapping up a three-day U.N. drug summit,
world leaders approved proposals for combating the worldwide drug
epidemic through a coordinated global campaign.
	   ``The end of this meeting marks the start of a new chapter in
global drug control,'' the U.N.'s chief drug control officer, Pino
Arlacchi, told the delegates at the closing session on Wednesday.
``The drug control issue has not been raised to the top of the
world agenda.''
	   But the delegates from about 150 countries were divided about
how to wage the drug war. Singapore defended its policy of
mandatory executions for drug traffickers, while the Netherlands
and Switzerland promoted liberal approaches such as tolerating
``soft drugs'' and prescribing heroin to addicts to combat their
dependence.
	   The summit ended with participants endorsing a 31-page plan for
governments to work together to curb trafficking, reduce demand,
improve judicial cooperation, combat money-laundering and reduce
the illegal cultivation of narcotic crops by 2008.
	   It declared that drugs ``destroy lives and communities'' and
affirmed governments' commitment to reduce ``both the illicit
supply of and demand for drugs.''
	   However, the U.N. General Assembly special session on drugs
underscored broad differences between drug-producing countries of
Latin America and Asia and the major consumers _ including the
United States _ on how best to direct limited resources in the
fight against drugs.
	   Speakers from Colombia, Myanmar, Mexico and other producers
applauded U.N. proposals to reduce illicit cultivation by providing
Third World farmers with financial incentives to stop growing opium
poppies, coca and cannabis.
	   Several developed countries, including Germany, Japan and
Australia, endorsed those plans. But few promised substantial, new
funds to pay for them, although Canada's solicitor general, Andrew
Scott, said his government would consider additional payments.
	   U.S. drug czar Barry McCaffrey, speaking to reporters Monday,
avoided committing the United States to support the U.N. crop
substitution program, saying the global drug war required more than
``just funding for alternative economic development.''
	   ``There needs to be money,'' said Dr. Hamid Ghodse, president of
the International Narcotics Control Board. ``Regrettably, I didn't
hear any of the countries openly and frankly commit themselves to
any cash.''
	   Without such funds, Ghose said, ``all of this would be wasted.''
	   Sandro Tucci, a U.N. spokesman, said the conference had
succeeded in convincing governments that reducing demand in rich
countries was a priority.
	   But some private drug research organizations expressed
disappointment that more was not said about ways to treat and
rehabilitate addicts.
	   ``Like the drug war itself, the U.N. drug summit was a
failure,'' said Dr. Ethan Nadelmann, director of the Lindesmith
Center. ``Rather than producing the intended unity, the drug summit
exposed deep divisions ... between drug war zealots who advocate
spending on a failed policy and the reformers who want new
approaches.''
	   Despite those divergent views, the conference showed a universal
belief that curbing drug use must be a major international goal in
the coming century.
	   Nearly all delegates warned of increasing drug use in their
countries, especially among the young. None called for legalization
of drugs.
	   Russia's deputy foreign minister, Yury Ushakov, said the number
of Russian addicts had risen dramatically since the collapse of the
Soviet Union, an observation repeated by leaders of other former
Soviet republics.
	   ``Two or three years ago, people in Kyrgyzstan had only a
theoretical idea what heroin is,'' said Kubanychbek Jumaliev,
president of the former Soviet Central Asian republic. ``Nowadays,
it has become one of the main drugs on the illegal market.''

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ As Yugoslavia strengthens its forces in
embattled Kosovo province, NATO officials appear increasingly
likely to order military action to stop the violence.
	   NATO defense ministers were opening a two-day meeting in
Brussels on Thursday to discuss Kosovo. Ahead of the meeting, there
was a growing conviction that the only way of defusing the
situation could be through military force.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen acknowledged ``a general
consensus there should be accelerated planning'' and that ``all
NATO members feel an increased sense of urgency.''
	   ``There is a genuine concern throughout the region that if this
goes unchecked, it could have much wider implications than just
Kosovo,'' he said on Wednesday. Many fear a new, bigger Balkan war.
	   White House spokesman Mike McCurry said in Washington Wednesday
the goal was ``to clearly indicate that NATO will define and
project its interests in the Balkans in a way that reminds the
Belgrade authorities of how seriously we take the violence that has
occurred in Kosovo, directed against the Kosovar Albanians.''
	   McCurry said U.S. action should be seen as ``one that in concert
with the actions of other governments, particularly European Union
governments, can have an impact.''
	   More than 250 people have died in fighting between government
forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, the armed wing of the ethnic
Albanian independence movement. Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90
percent of the province's population, demand independence from
Serbia, the larger of the two republics in Yugoslavia.
	   The United States and its allies support autonomy for Kosovo but
oppose rebel demands for independence.
	   Also Wednesday, the six-nation Contact Group, which monitors
Yugoslavia, met in Paris to discuss ways to solve the Kosovo
crisis. The group planned to offer proposals to the Group of Eight
industrialized nations, set to meet Friday in London.
	   The Contact Group includes the United States, Russia and Western
European countries. It planned to propose a first ``phase of
persuasion,'' in which Russia would contact both Yugoslavia and the
Kosovo Albanians, said group's French representative Jacques Blot.
	   If Belgrade does not respond, the Contact Group would meet again
to carry out other measures agreed on, said Blot, who declined to
describe the options.
	   NATO ambassadors worked late Wednesday on detailed instructions
for the military, including a clear statement of the objective of
any intervention.
	   Also under debate were a series of proposed immediate measures,
including air maneuvers in the next few days over Albania and
Macedonia in a show of strength, establishing military training and
exercise centers, and using NATO transport to cope with refugee
flows.
	   McCurry said there had been discussions about the use of air
forces, something that should be taken up by NATO military experts.
	   The United States and the European Union have imposed economic
sanctions on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, but hold out
little hope they will result in a government pullback in Kosovo.
	   NATO military planners have for the past two weeks been studying
indirect options for pressuring Milosevic, including dispatching up
to 20,000 troops to Albania and Macedonia, reinforcing the existing
750-member U.N. force in Macedonia, and helping both countries
secure borders while dealing with refugees and arms smuggling.
	   The Clinton administration is signaling it wants NATO to
organize air exercises in Albania and Macedonia.
	   A U.S. official traveling with Cohen said the defense ministers
``are likely to endorse ... planning for air exercises in Albania
and Macedonia.'' The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
noted the details of the exercise will be worked out by NATO
military experts.
	   In London on Wednesday, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said
that military force is necessary for a diplomatic solution of the
Kosovo crisis.
	   Britain is leading an effort to win U.N. Security Council
approval for a resolution authorizing ``all necessary means'' to
deal with the situation in Kosovo. The United States is backing the
plan, but Russia has opposed it so far.

Elections for upper house of Japan's Parliament expected July 12
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Elections for Japan's upper house of Parliament
will take place July 12, an official said Thursday, in a vote
expected to serve as a referendum on Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's 2-year-old administration.
	   Parliament's decision Wednesday to extend its current session
until June 18 effectively means the polls must be held by July 12
under current law, said an upper house parliamentary affairs
official, who declined to be named.
	   The date must await formal approval from Japan's Cabinet, the
official added.
	   The polls will be the first upper house elections since
Hashimoto came to power in early 1996 and will give his Liberal
Democratic Party a chance to regain a majority in the body, which
it lost in 1989.
	   Defections from a weakened opposition allowed the conservative
LDP, long the dominant party in Parliament, to reclaim its majority
in the more powerful lower house last September for the first time
since 1993.
	   Every three years, half of the 252 seats in Japan's upper house,
known as the House of Councillors, are elected to six-year terms.
Barring an early dissolution of Parliament, lower house elections
will not be held until 2000.
	   The LDP led Japan from 1955 until 1993, when a short-lived
reformist coalition came to power.

U.S. dollar climbs to new seven-year high, Tokyo stocks fall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar climbed to a new seven-year high
against the yen Thursday morning amid continued uncertainty about
the Japanese and other Asian economies. Tokyo stock prices fell.
	   The dollar bought 141.76 yen, up 0.92 yen from late Wednesday in
Tokyo, to a level not seen since early June, 1991. In New York
overnight, the currency settled at 141.43 yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 274.77 points, or 1.79
percent, moving to 15,064.49 at the close of morning trading. On
Wednesday, the Nikkei sank 190.91 points, or 1.23 percent.
	   Currency traders said the dollar's rise was spurred by sharp
falls in share prices in Japan and Taiwan, leading to safe-haven
dollar-buying on rekindled fears of further financial turmoil in
Asia
	   ``The stock market falls in Japan and Taiwan highlighted the
sentiment that Asia is still unstable,'' said Shuji Takano,
assistant manager of foreign exchange at ABN-Amro Bank N.V.
	   Also contributing to the dollar's advance was lack of a firm
commitment to stem the yen's slide by the Group of Seven deputy
finance ministers who met in Paris on Wednesday, traders said.
	   Traders said statements from the meeting signaled no change in
G-7 policy on the yen.
	   Recent signs that Japan's economy is slowing, such as rising
unemployment and declining corporate profits, have hurt the yen.
	   Japanese officials, though, have warned that their currency may
have weakened excessively against the dollar, suggesting possible
yen-buying intervention.
	   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange continued to fall as
investors were discouraged by the continued weakening of the yen
against the dollar.
	   Among early losers were banking issues, which sold off on
renewed concerns about the bad loans saddling Japan's financial
system. Investors are concerned that banks' problem loans overseas
will swell due to the weakening of the yen, traders said.
	   The weakness of the yen, which erodes the value of Japanese
stocks held by foreign investors, also hurt sentiment.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 21.13 points, or 1.76 percent, to 1,177.47. The
TOPIX fell 10.08 points, or 0.83 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.245 percent from Wednesday's close of
1.195 percent, driving its price down to 111.68 yen from 112.06
yen.

Hong Kong Shares plunge to new lows
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Battered by the yen's weakness, Hong Kong
stocks fell to new lows Thursday morning as the benchmark index
lost 3.1 percent just minutes after the opening bell, hitting its
lowest level since Feb. 1995.
	   Analysts said there was no positive news on the horizon and the
market was seeking a new floor.
	   ``The market will test lower support levels to establish a firm
bottom,'' said Ben Kwong, an analyst at Dharmala Securities.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index opened down 97.79 points to
7,881.58, but immediately picked up the pace and started falling
sharply.
	   After 15 minutes of trading, the index was down 293.90 points to
7,685.47. It has moved as low as 7,673.25.
	   On Wednesday, the index fell 412.09 points, or 4.9 percent, to
7,979.37, a three-year low. It has lost 7.1 percent over the past
two sessions.
	   The Hong Kong market has been battered by the weak yen, which
has sent investors scurrying for safer markets, far away from Asia.
	   In morning trading in Tokyo, the U.S. dollar rose against the
yen as traders bet that the Group of Seven industrialized nations
was unlikely to intervene to defend the yen.
	   The dollar bought 141.44 yen, up 0.60 yen from late Wednesday in
Tokyo and just above its late New York level of 141.43 yen
overnight.
	   The yen's weakness has sent local interbank interest rates
soaring, which means higher costs for local firms.
	   The benchmark three-month Hong Kong interbank offered rate
jumped to 14 percent early Thursday from 11 percent late Wednesday.
	   The yen's weakness also has triggered fears of a devaluation of
the Chinese yuan, which would wreak havoc on Hong Kong's economy
and the ability of its government to defend the Hong Kong dollar's
peg to the U.S. currency.
	   Kwong said if the yen continues to weaken, pushing rates higher,
the market will likely fall sharply, he said.
	   He also said investors are looking to the government to offer
some new solutions for the dramatic decline in asset prices,
including property and equity prices, Kwong said.
	   ``The government may need to do more to restore market
confidence,'' he said.
	   Hong Kong's Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa insisted Wednesday the
government will keep its 14-year currency peg to the U.S. dollar,
despite increasing calls for action to help Hong Kong fight a
liquidity crunch.
	   He also ruled out further tax cuts or injecting government funds
to keep the financial markets from sliding further.

Train crash in southern Japan leaves 29 injured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Twenty nine people were injured when two train cars
collided Thursday on Japan's southern island of Shikoku, a police
spokesman said.
	   One female passenger suffered a broken leg in the collision,
according to a spokesman for the Kochi prefectural, or state,
police department. Twenty-eight others were taken to a nearby
hospital, although most received only mild injuries.
	   The accident involved two single-car trains run by Tosa Kuroshio
railway in Kochi prefecture, about 625 kilometers (391 miles)
southwest of Tokyo, said the spokesman, on condition of anonymity.
	   One train carrying 40 passengers had stopped on the track near
the town of Ogata due to a mechanical problem. The other was
dispatched to tow it to the nearest station but approached too fast
and was unable to stop before colliding with it.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai lawmakers have condemned officials
at a Bangkok homeless shelter who forced vagrant women to march
naked from their living quarters to communal showers, local papers
reported Thursday.
	   Members of the House of Representatives Committee on Justice and
Human Rights called on the Public Welfare Department, which
oversees the shelter, to punish officials responsible, The Nation
newspaper said.
	   Muk Sulaiman, a committee member, said several of the women had
petitioned the lawmakers to be transferred from the Thanyaburi
Rehabilitation Center in northern Bangkok because of the treatment,
according to The Nation.

Thai Customs officials find heroin smuggled in milk and juice cans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai Customs officials have made their
largest heroin seizure so far this year, finding 20 kilograms (44
pounds) of the drug in 16 milk and fruit juice cans being mailed to
Cameroon, the Bangkok Post reported Thursday.
	   The high-grade heroin, worth an estimated 6.4 million baht (dlrs
150,000), was discovered during an inspection at the Nana Post
office in Bangkok.
	   Customs officials said the heroin was contained in two parcels
dropped off at the post office on Wednesday. Police were
investigating the parcel's registered sender and recipient, the
Post said.
	   Neighboring Myanmar is one of the world's largest producers of
heroin, and Thailand is regarded as a major smuggling and
transshipment point for drugs.

Mariners stop Giants' streak
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ The longest winning streak in the majors
this year ended Wednesday when the San Francisco Giants lost 4-1 to
the Seattle Mariners, and the Giants may have lost a lot more than
a game.
	   David Segui drove in three runs for the Mariners, who broke
their own four-game losing streak and ended the Giants' 11-game
winning streak.
	   Right-hander Orel Hershiser (6-4), lwho had won his previous six
starts, left the game for San Francisco after being hit on the
wrist by a line drive, and Barry Bonds left the game with tightness
in his left calf. He was hit by a pitch in the leg earlier in the
game.
	   The two injuries came hours after the Giants placed second
baseman Jeff Kent on the disabled list with a sprained right knee.
He was hurt in Tuesday night's game against the Mariners.
	   Segui, who went 1-for-4 and had his average drop one point to
.341, had a two-run single in the first and an RBI groundout in the
third. Russ Davis added an RBI single in the fifth for Seattle.
	   Rey Sanchez had an RBI single in the fifth for the Giants.
	   Bill Swift (6-3) allowed one run on five hits in seven innings
for Seattle. Heathcliff Slocumb pitched the ninth for his first
save.
 &UR; Mets 3, Devil Rays 2 &QC; 
	   In New York, Al Leiter won his fourth straight start and the New
York Mets got two gift runs on five walks by Rick White in the
first inning for a win over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
	   Leiter (7-3) allowed one run and four hits with nine strikeouts
in six innings. The left-hander dropped his ERA to 1.70, second in
the NL to Atlanta's Greg Maddux.
	   The Mets got just four hits, but took advantage of White's
first-inning wildness and Butch Huskey's sixth-inning homer to win
for the 12th time in their last 14 home games.
	   Dennis Cook struck out the side in the eighth as the Mets
recorded a season-high 14 strikeouts. Mel Rojas allowed an RBI
double to Wade Boggs in the ninth before picking up his second
save.
 &UR; Astros 10, Tigers 3 &QC; 
	   In Detroit, Moises Alou and Carl Everett each had three RBIs and
Pete Schourek pitched seven solid innings as Houston completed a
three-game sweep of Detroit.
	   Everett went 4-for-5 with a two-run double and Alou hit a
two-run homer as the Astros won their fifth straight. Joe Oliver
homered for the Tigers, who have lost nine of 11 to fall a
season-worst 15 games under .500 (23-38).
	   Schourek (3-4), who had lost four of his previous five starts,
allowed one run and four hits, with four strikeouts and no walks.
 &UR; Blue Jays 4, Marlins 3, 10 innings &QC; 
	   In Miami, Jose Canseco hit two homers, including a solo shot in
the 10th inning, as Toronto avoided a three-game sweep.
	   The Marlins had won the two previous games on the final pitch,
including a 17-inning marathon Monday.
	   Canseco hit a 439-foot (132-meter) homer in the first inning
after Shawn Green singled. The RBIs were Canseco's first since May
25.
 &UR; Pirates 4, Indians 3, 11 innings &QC; 
	   In Cleveland, Jermaine Allensworth's RBI double off Jose Mesa in
the 11th gave Pittsburgh a victory over Cleveland.
	   Tony Womack had two hits, two RBIs and keyed the winning rally
with a bad-hop single off shortstop Omar Vizquel, who had a 70-game
errorless streak snapped earlier this season.
	   Lou Collier lined a one-out single off Mesa (3-2) and went to
third on Womack's one-hop smash to short. With the infield in,
Allensworth lined a double down the left-field line past a diving
Travis Fryman.
 &UR; Yankees 6, Expos 2 &QC; 
	   In Montreal, Hideki Irabu pitched six strong innings, Tino
Martinez homered and the New York Yankees won their season-high
ninth straight game.
	   Paul O'Neill doubled twice and singled for the Yankees,
extending the longest hitting streak of his career to 17 games.
	   Yankees center fielder Bernie Williams injured his right knee
sliding awkwardly into third base in the sixth inning. He played in
the field in the bottom of the sixth, then left the game.
	   Tim Raines, playing his first game in Montreal since leaving the
Expos after the 1990 season, stole the 800th base of his career. He
joined Rickey Henderson, Lou Brock and Ty Cobb as the only players
to reach the mark.
 &UR; Orioles 5, Phillies 2, 10 innings &QC; 
	   In Philadelphia, Rafael Palmeiro hit a tiebreaking single in the
10th inning to lift Baltimore over Philadelphia.
	   Jeff Reboulet opened the 10th with a double off Mark Leiter
(2-2). Brady Anderson followed with an infield single and Palmeiro
singled with one out. After Roberto Alomar grounded out, B.J.
Surhoff hit a two-run single.
	   Armando Benitez (2-1) pitched two innings for the victory.
 &UR; Red Sox 10, Braves 6 &QC; 
	   In Atlanta, John Valentin had his third two-homer game this
season, and Pedro Martinez survived another rocky start.
	   Valentin hit two-run homers in the first and third innings as
the expected duel between Martinez and Atlanta's Denny Neagle fell
apart.
	   Martinez (7-2) allowed four homers, including Andres Galarraga's
24th and 25th of the season. The 1997 NL Cy Young Award winner gave
up nine hits and six earned runs in 6 2-3 innings.
 &UR; Twins 5, Cubs 1 &QC; 
	   In Minneapolis, the Minnesota Twins put together six straight
two-out hits in a five-run first inning, carrying Mike Morgan to a
victory over the Chicago Cubs.
	   Todd Walker had a two-run single in the first as the Twins
handed the Cubs their second straight loss following a 10-game
winning streak.
	   The crowd of 15,086 was the smallest of the interleague series,
which drew 58,969 for the three games.

Police release detained opposition lawmaker

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian police Thursday released
an opposition member of Parliament four hours after detaining him
for speaking at a political rally banned by authorities, an
opposition party spokesman said.
	   Lim Guan Eng, deputy secretary-general of the Democratic Action
Party, was taken to the Petaling Jaya police station at about 10.30
p.m. (1330 GMT) Wednesday shortly after he spoke to 2,000
supporters.
	   Lim and three other detained party members were released early
Thursday.
	   ``We still don't know if he will have to appear in court or what
the charge against him is,'' said Y.C. Foo, Lim's secretary.
	   The three colleagues had apparently tussled with policemen who
were trying to cart away amplifiers and speakers used at the
political rally.
	   Police dispersed the crowd shortly after midnight. Several
scuffles broke out but no injuries were reported.
	   A police spokesman was not immediately available for comment.
	   ``With the government bent on establishing a police state, this
is the end of the freedom of expression in Malaysia,'' Lim said in
a telephone interview from the police station.
	   This is the fourth time police have shut down public meetings
over the past 10 days and the third time police have disbanded
opposition gatherings.
	   Dozens of organizations have decried it as an assault on civil
liberties and free speech.
	   At Wednesday's fund-raising dinner for Lim, who has been
sentenced to 18 months in prison for printing a pamphlet that
questioned Malaysia's political system, police in riot gear stood
watch. The gathering had not received approval from authorities.
	   A number of DAP leaders spoke during the dinner. Vehicles
clogged the road adjoining the field, where more than 60 dinner
tables had been placed for their supporters.
	   As the night continued, hundreds of people from the surrounding
neighborhoods also gathered to watch the spectacle. Shortly after
Lim began to speak, dozens of police in riot gear moved in to nab
him.
	   ``We're not criminals, we're not robbers, we're not even threat
to the nation,'' Lim's father, party secretary-general Lim Kit
Siang and the opposition leader in Parliament, shouted into the
microphone shortly after police led his son away.
	   ``In Indonesia, the people who have been muzzled for three
decades are beginning to experience a new freedom of expression,''
said Lim Sr. ``But in Malaysia, the government has suddenly become
afraid of the voice of the people.''

Australian casino drops plan to sue Malaysian lawmaker: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ An Australian casino has dropped
plans to sue a Malaysian lawmaker after he agreed to settle a
gambling debt of 4.8 million Malaysian ringgit (dlrs 1.2 million)
in installments, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Private investigators representing the casino in Perth said that
the member of parliament had paid up the first installment on
Wednesday, the New Straits Times reported.
	   ``We have got no further interest in the MP's case as he has
promised to pay the amount in due course,'' said Christopher White,
a private investigator working on behalf of the casino.
	   Lawsuits would, however, be filed against six other Malaysians
who owed the casino 2.4 million ringgit (dlrs 615,000), he said.
	   The debts were all incurred since 1994.
	   More than 100 Malaysian gamblers ran up debts totaling 60
million ringgit (dlrs 15 million) over the last four years in 10
casinos in Australia, a popular destination for rich Malaysians,
dailies had reported earlier.
	   In 1995, a Las Vegas casino sued a Malaysian businessman to
recover a dlrs 1.3 million gambling debt.

Mayer defeats Fleming at BTI Champions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RALEIGH, North Carolina (AP) _ Gene Mayer defeated Peter Fleming
6-3, 6-2 in the first round of the BTI Champions senior tennis
tournament Wednesday at the Raleigh Racquet Club to advance to a
quarterfinal meeting with top-seeded Jimmy Connors.
	   Eddie Dibbs also reached the quarterfinals with a 7-6 (8-6), 6-4
win over Guillermo Vilas.
	   Mayer, who won two French Open doubles titles during his career
on the men's tour, outlasted Fleming at the baseline to earn the
victory.
	   ``I played solid today,'' Mayer said. ``It's hot and muggy here
so it's hard to hit the ball big, but I'm pleased with the way I
played.''
	   Mayer and Connors have met twice on the senior tour, with
Connors winning both times.
	   The BTI Champions is the second event on the 1998-99 Nuveen
Tour.

Runaway ship found sailing off Russia's far eastern coast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A Russian ship that sailed away from
court-ordered custody with two South Korean captives aboard has
been spotted off Russia's far eastern coast, officials said
Thursday.
	   The 683-ton refrigerator ship Tibiya was found sailing off the
Russian island of Sakhalin, South Korean maritime police said,
quoting Russian officials.
	   The ship disappeared earlier this week from the port of Pusan on
South Korea's southeast coast, where it had been impounded by a
local court in a legal dispute over an unpaid debt.
	   ``The two Korean men are alive, and we are talking through
diplomatic channels to bring them home once the ship arrives at its
base in Magadan,'' a Russian fishing base in the Sea of Okhotsk,
said a police investigator, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   When the ship docked at Pusan on April 7 for repairs, a South
Korean dry dock company filed suit with a local court, seeking
payment of dlrs 1.5 million incurred for earlier repair work.
	   Court-hired private guards were posted on the ship to enforce a
court order to impound the ship. When it came time to replace the
guards on Monday, the ship was gone.
	   Chavshov Alexay, 36, the ship's Russian owner, was arrested
later at Kimhae airport near Pusan as he tried to leave South
Korea. He was accused of instructing his vessel's 18-man crew to
flee.

First government-sanctioned cannabis farm established
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED for release until 0930 GMT, time set by source &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's first government-sanctioned cannabis
farm has been established to grow marijuana for medical research
purposes, the company running it said Thursday.
	   A high perimeter fence surrounds the 4 million pound (dlrs 6.5
million) greenhouse complex run by GW Pharmaceuticals, the first
British research company to be granted government licenses for the
cultivation, storage and distribution of cannabis for medical
research.
	   Details of the facility's location and the security measures
protecting it are being kept secret to guard against theft, the
company said.
	   Initially, the complex will develop extracts of cannabis plants
grown under controlled conditions, but research investigate whether
the drug can be used safely to treat a range of illnesses and
investigating methods, other than smoking it, that patients can use
the drug.
	   ``There is a considerable body of evidence to suggest that
cannabis may have a number of medicinal uses, but there have been
very few systematic research programs or controlled clinical
trials,'' said Dr. Geoffrey Guy, founder of GW Pharmaceuticals,
which was set up specially to conduct government-sanctioned
cannabis research. ``Our aim will be to establish the medical
facts.''
	   The U.S. government announced last year that it is to spend up
to dlrs 1 million gathering scientific evidence on the
effectiveness of cannabis as a medical treatment.
	   California and Arizona voters have approved initiatives allowing
medical uses for marijuana.
	   Some research has suggested that the drug is useful in relieving
internal eye pressure in glaucoma; for controlling nausea in cancer
patients on chemotherapy, and for combating wasting, a severe
weight loss associated with AIDS and the HIV virus.

China reports rising exports, imports in first 5 months of year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's exports rose 8.6 percent in the first
five months of the year to dlrs 71.11 billion, while imports
increased 1.5 percent to dlrs 52.58 billion, according to figures
released by the Chinese General Administration of Customs.
	   However, exports for the month of May slid 1.5 percent from a
year ago to dlrs 14.93 billion and imports fell 3.8 percent to dlrs
11.29 billion, resulting in a surplus of dlrs 3.64 billion for the
month, the Xinhua News Agency reported late Wednesday.
	   According to the government, China's export growth for the
period continued to be hurt by the Asian financial crisis, while
weak domestic demand also took a bite out of imports during the
month of May.
	   China's trade surplus reached dlrs 18.53 billion during the
January-to-May period. Total trade volume during the period grew
5.4 percent to dlrs 123.7 billion.
	   Exports to the United States in January to May rose 18.1
percent, and the United States displaced Hong Kong as China's
second largest trading partner, according to the report.
