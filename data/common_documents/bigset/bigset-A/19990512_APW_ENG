<HEADLINE> Va. Gov. Commutes Death Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Four hours before he was to be executed  
Wednesday, a mentally ill man's life was spared when Gov. Jim 
Gilmore commuted his death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time Gilmore stopped the execution of a  
condemned inmate since he became governor more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Calvin Swann, 44, was sentenced to death for robbing and  
shooting a 62-year-old man in his Danville home in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	But defense lawyers argued that Swann's life should be spared  
because he suffers from schizophrenia. 
</P>
<P>
	Swann was committed to psychiatric hospitals more than 16 times,  
was treated repeatedly with anti-psychotic medications and was 
twice found incompetent by judges to stand trial, said his lawyer, 
John Howley. 
</P>
<P>
	Swann's brother, Clyde Swann, said he met with his brother on  
Tuesday and told him he was on the verge of being executed. 
</P>
<P>
	``His concern was getting some more cigarettes and candy and  
about his broken Walkman,'' Clyde Swann said. ``I don't think he 
knows what he's up against.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gilmore declined to intervene in any of the 21 other executions  
held since he took office in January 1998.

<HEADLINE> Democrats: Bush Too Busy for Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush's major proposals for $2.6  
billion in tax cuts and teacher pay raises are in trouble because 
the Republican is too busy running for president to take care of 
his legislative business at home, according to Democratic 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's ``absent'' leadership this session was among complaints  
leveled by about 30 Democratic legislators at a news conference 
Tuesday in Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if I'd say he's been missing in action, but it's  
been pretty close to that,'' Rep. Kevin Bailey, D-Houston, said. 
``He's a lot less involved than in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he will stay in Austin and won't begin campaigning for  
the Republican presidential nomination until after the end of the 
legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor has had about half the personal involvement in this  
legislative session that he had during the 1997 Legislature, 
according to a Houston Chronicle review of Bush's office calendars. 
</P>
<P>
	If bills on major issues on which Bush campaigned fail, that  
will give opponents of his presidential campaign cause to attack 
him as an ineffective leader. 
</P>
<P>
	The issues that face tough challenges include tax cuts, a  
requirement for girls to notify their parents before they can get 
an abortion, and vouchers that would allow parents to use public 
money to send their children to private school. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor vowed Tuesday to get most of what he asked for from  
the Legislature, including a ``significant'' tax cut. He noted that 
measures to lower the maximum alcohol level for drunken driving and 
to restrict Y2K lawsuits were on their way to his desk or about to 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a part of the Bush agenda that seems to be moving along  
quite nicely,'' said Bush. ``Most of the issues I campaigned on 
came out of the Senate, and there will be a moment of 
reconciliation (with the House.)'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, an education finance bill that recently came out of the  
Senate only delivered half of Bush's promised $2 billion property 
tax cut, with the rest set for teacher pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats in the House Education Committee do not believe there  
is enough money to pay for tax cuts and teacher pay increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Sadler, a Democrat and the panel's chairman, is awaiting a  
new state revenue estimate from Comptroller Carole Rylander. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Bush has been responsive. ``I've never been put off,''  
Sadler said. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor insists there's still plenty of time to get what he  
wants from this Legislature. He said he has no concern about 
whether the results of this session affect his presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's important for the work product of this session is that  
it is important for Texas,'' said Bush. ``We'll worry about the 
exploratory business later on. Right now, it's what's best for 
Texas.''

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Edge Higher / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices edged higher Wednesday, overcoming  
an early tumble sparked by the resignation of the well-regarded 
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1/8 point,  
or $1.25 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
	Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, spiked as high  
as 5.88 percent in the morning, but finished the day at 5.82 
percent, a shade below Tuesday's 5.83 percent. The yield is a key 
influence on the interest rates charged for many types of loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports of Rubin's long-rumored resignation, confirmed by the  
White House in the morning, initially tugged stocks and bonds lower 
as investors worried that the change would upset the delicate 
balance behind the economy's surprising resilience. 
</P>
<P>
	But the markets quickly recovered amid confidence that Lawrence  
Summers, Rubin's deputy and proposed successor, would pursue the 
same course. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were also relieved by the finish of this week's auctions  
of new debt securities by the Treasury, which sold $12 billion in 
10-year notes on Wednesday after selling $15 billion in 5-year 
notes on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were unchanged, while intermediate maturities rose 3/32 point, 
reported Bridge Telerate. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 4.58 percent as the  
discount fell 0.02 percentage point to 4.46 percent from late 
Tuesday. Six-month yields fell to 4.68 percent, as the discount 
fell 0.01 percentage point to 4.51 percent. One-year yields edged 
down to 4.75 percent as the discount fell 0.01 percentage point to 
4.53 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, remained unchanged at 4.69 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 3/32 to 122 17/32. The average yield to 
maturity eased to 5.34 percent from late Tuesday's 5.35 percent.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Official Releases Notes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Sydney Olympic Committee president  
Michael Knight has released personal notes on International Olympic 
Committee members made by Australian IOC member Phil Coles. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight did not seek IOC permission to give out 400-pages of  
previously confidential material today and justified his release by 
saying the documents had already been leaked to two media 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Personal details such as marital problems, perceived honesty,  
even matters such as smoking, eating and shopping habits, were 
documented by Coles and his partner Patricia Rosenbrock -- both 
members of Sydney's bid team. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC is investigating how the documents apparently found  
their way to Salt Lake City officials before the city's successful 
bid to host the 2002 Winter Games. Coles has denied passing them 
on. 
</P>
<P>
	Several IOC members covered by the notes have either been  
previously expelled by the IOC, resigned or died. 
</P>
<P>
	In one entry, Coles noted that the husband of Finnish member  
Pirjo Haggman needed work in forestry. Haggman resigned after 
husband Bjarne worked for Salt Lake City, following a 20-month 
forestry contract in Canada while Toronto was bidding for the 1996 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles' notes were made before Sydney won the 2000 Games.  
</P>
<P>
	In handwritten notes on 67 IOC members, Rosenbrock gives her  
suggestions on whether an IOC member would vote for or against Salt 
Lake City. It appears that her notes were written after Sydney won 
its bid but before the 1995 vote for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents went much further than voting predictions, and  
included characterizations of certain members, such as labelling 
Greek IOC member Lambis Nikolaou as being ``very temperamental -- 
emphasis on mental.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenbrock was also blunt about perceived weaknesses.  
</P>
<P>
	For example, she noted Alexandru Siperco, IOC member from  
Romania, was ``a little old and irritable,'' and Western Samoa's 
Seuili Paul Wallwork ``seems to have a bit of a chip on his 
shoulder, i.e. often seems a little unhappy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She noted that Lamine Kieta of Mali was ``more than prepared to  
take advantage of any expense allowance. Not to be trusted I 
believe -- but said he supports Salt Lake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenbrock found plenty of ``nice'' and ``honorable'' IOC  
members but also noticed other personal traits -- vanity, pride, 
desire. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles has been censured for receiving excessive hospitality from  
the Salt Lake bid and is under investigation on claims he received 
expensive jewelry from Athens' failed bid for the 1996 Summer 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight said he did not consider it necessary to ask for the  
IOC's permission to release the documents, despite the personal 
references made to many members. 
</P>
<P>
	``The material is already out there in full with two media  
organizations,'' he said. ``We took advice on how we could handle 
any (Freedom of Information) applications. The legal advice was if 
there was an FOI application, we'd have to hand the stuff over, so 
it's silly to prevaricate or procrastinate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, who has claimed a conspiracy working against him with the  
SOCOG board, took a shot at Knight over the release. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a typical Knight stunt probably,'' Coles said. ``He seems  
to have been wanting my head on a block for some time.''

<HEADLINE> Jackson Fined for Plagiarism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Michael Jackson has been ordered to face the music  
in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	An Italian judge ruled Tuesday that the superstar plagiarized  
Italian songwriter Al Bano when writing the song ``Will You Be 
There,'' which was featured on Jackson's 1991 album ``Dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Mario Frigenti fined Jackson a mere $2,200, which he  
immediately suspended. But he ordered Jackson to pay court costs, 
which could be considerable, Italian state TV reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Bano, a veteran songwriter and singer, claimed Jackson stole  
part of the musical motif of his song ``I Cigni di Balaka'' (The 
Swans of Balaka), produced in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	In a hearing in Rome two years ago, Jackson told the court that  
there was some similarity between the two songs, ``but it's 
completely coincidental.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the verdict was announced, a beaming Bano, whose real name  
is Albano Carrisi, invited Jackson to do a concert together and 
have the proceeds go to children from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for Jackson vowed to appeal the ruling.

<HEADLINE> FCC Decried on SBC-Ameritech Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate's top telecommunications lawmaker  
accused the Federal Communications Commission of unfairly handling 
its review of SBC Communications' planned merger with Ameritech 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Senate Commerce  
Committee, which has jurisdiction over the agency, in a letter 
Wednesday to FCC Chairman Bill Kennard said: ``You must do whatever 
is necessary to remove the institutional unfairness and prejudgment 
that has been permitted to taint this proceeding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, McCain was upset by recent comments made by Thomas  
Krattenmaker, an FCC staff member overseeing the commission's 
review. 
</P>
<P>
	Krattenmaker, at a public hearing on the merger last week, said  
the planned SBC-Ameritech merger, as now structured, ``flunks the 
public interest test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An FCC spokesman said Kennard, responding to McCain's letter,  
``expressed his full confidence in the expertise and integrity of 
the commission's professional staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krattenmaker also said that the commission's staff tentatively  
had concluded the merger should be rejected unless changes are made 
to address concerns that it would blunt competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC and the companies are trying to negotiate possible  
conditions that would be placed on the merger to address those 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain also complained that Robert Atkinson, another FCC staff  
member involved in the merger review, previously had worked for 
AT&AMP;T, which opposes the SBC-Ameritech merger. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T spokesman Jim McGann said Atkinson worked briefly for AT&AMP;T  
after it acquired Teleport Communications Group, which sells local 
phone service and data communications primarily to businesses. 
Atkinson left AT&AMP;T a couple of months ago to work for the FCC, 
McGann said. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC and Ameritech say their merger, approved by the Justice  
Department, is good for competition.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft May Buy Brit Cable Biz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. is talking with Cable &AMP; Wireless  
PLC about the possible purchase of the British company's cable TV 
business, The Wall Street Journal reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of Cable &AMP; Wireless, Britain's No. 2 telecommunications  
firm, confirmed that talks were under way with Microsoft, but 
refused to say whether the two sides were discussing such a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive Graham Wallace also refused to confirm that he  
had spoken Tuesday with Microsoft financial chief Greg Maffei. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal said Wallace and Maffei had talked about a deal in  
which Microsoft would buy 30 percent of Cable &AMP; Wireless 
Communications PLC for more than $4 billion. The newspaper 
attributed its report to unidentified people familar with the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do continually talk to Microsoft,'' Wallace said today.  
``That's just the way this business works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft officials in London could not immediately be reached  
for comment on the report. 
</P>
<P>
	If true, discussions about a possible cable-TV acquisition would  
mark a broadening of Microsoft's efforts to penetrate Britain's 
cable business. The U.S. software giant announced plans in January 
to invest $500 million in NTL Inc., Britain's third-largest cable 
operator. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its more recent $5 billion investment in AT&AMP;T,  
Microsoft agreed to swap stock for a 30 percent share in another 
British cable firm, Telewest Communications PLC. That share has 
been held by MediaOne Group Inc., which had agreed earlier to be 
acquired by AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	At stake is access to Britain's extensive cable network, which  
Microsoft and others hope to use to provide telephone, Internet and 
other services. Much of the British cable system uses fiber-optics, 
which allows for high-speed data transmission. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable &AMP; Wireless owns 53 percent of its cable-TV unit. It was  
already said to be discussing a possible merger of the unit's 
residential operations with those of Telewest. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's effort to take a minority stake in Cable &AMP; Wireless  
Communications is part of those merger talks, the Journal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace said he was optimistic that Britain's three main cable  
companies would eventually merge into one or two national cable 
operators.

<HEADLINE> Charges in Taping of College Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, Ill. (AP) -- A former coach and elementary school  
teacher was charged Wednesday with secretly videotaping college 
football players and others in a locker room last October at 
Eastern Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Coles County assistant state's attorney Roy Dent,  
Lance Schneiderman allegedly set up the camera in a locker room 
being used by members of the Southeast Missouri football team Oct. 
3 and videotaped players dressing and undressing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He set up the camera and then got in front of it to check out  
the sight line,'' said Dent, who didn't say where the camera was 
located. A number of people are naked on the tape, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A misdemeanor charge of unauthorized videotaping was filed  
Wednesday in Coles County Circuit Court. If convicted, Schneiderman 
faces up to 364 days in jail and a fine of up to $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Directory assistance had no listing for Schneiderman.  
</P>
<P>
	Schneiderman, 27, of Shumway, Ill., resigned last month as a  
sixth-grade teacher and athletic coach for Beecher City Unit 20 
School District, located west of Effingham. 
</P>
<P>
	He is being investigated for allegedly providing alcohol and  
pornographic material to junior high school students, said 
Effingham County State's Attorney Kevin Parker. Parker would not 
elaborate, other than to say that the pornographic material was not 
the videotape Schneiderman is accused of making in the college 
locker room.

<HEADLINE> L.A. County Pushes After-School Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Board of Supervisors got a standing ovation from a group of  
single mothers Tuesday after approving $74 million for free child 
care at 225 elementary schools with large numbers of children from 
families on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the best gifts that mothers throughout the city  
and the county can get for Mother's Day,'' said Margaret Prescod of 
the Every Mother is a Working Mother Network, which pushed for the 
program. ``It's more substantial than the flowers we get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 16,000 children could be enrolled in the program,  
which is funded by federal and state welfare grants. It will get 
under way this summer and expand through next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should really make life easier for so many people,'' said  
Lynn Bayer, director of the county's welfare department. ``The 
reality is that many of these children don't receive child care and 
go home to empty houses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, supervisors said, they hope to increase the funding  
to $120 million and expand it to include older children. 
</P>
<P>
	The program will concentrate on education rather than the  
after-school recreation some districts now offer. 
</P>
<P>
	While districts will work out the details, some concepts include  
helping children with their homework and test preparation, and 
giving them access to computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a real paradigm shift in terms of after-school  
programs,'' said Phil Kauble of the county Office of Education. 
</P>
<P>
	Affordable child care has been a concern since welfare reforms  
began forcing many recipients to work. The Los Angeles area lags 
behind other urban areas in available child care for poor working 
mothers.

<HEADLINE>  Chung Testifies Before House Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After Clinton donor Johnny Chung underwent  
four hours of questioning on Capitol Hill, he shook hands with Rep. 
Dan Burton and declared, ``Well Mr. Chairman, one down, 120 to 
go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to congressional staffers, Chung was referring Tuesday  
to the number of witnesses Burton says have refused to appear in 
the two-year House campaign fund-raising investigation, thwarting 
the efforts of Republicans to get first-hand testimony about the 
financing of the presidential campaign in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eighty people have taken the Fifth; a lot of people have left  
the country or stayed overseas,'' said Burton, R-Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the 120, former Little Rock restaurateur Charlie Trie,  
goes on trial in Arkansas next Monday, charged with obstructing a 
Senate probe into campaign fund-raising abuses by allegedly 
ordering a subordinate to get rid of subpoenaed documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing before Burton's Government Reform Committee, Chung  
said he was told by a Chinese banker that Trie had asked for $1 
million from the Chinese government for political donations. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung also testified that he was approached last year by a  
California businessman named Robert Luu who first threatened, then 
offered money if Chung would be uncooperative with the Justice 
Department investigation of campaign finance abuses. According to 
Chung, Luu said he was acting on behalf of a woman who had been the 
intermediary between Chung and the chief of Chinese military 
intelligence. The intelligence chief, Gen. Ji Sheng De, provided 
Chung $300,000, saying it should be used to re-elect President 
Clinton, Chung testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung testified that the FBI taped and photographed some of the  
conversations with Luu. 
</P>
<P>
	``Luu ... mentioned that he received money from Beijing'' and  
``Luu said they would give me money to take care of my legal 
expenses and my family and I could retire,'' said Chung. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung said Luu then introduced him to an attorney in San  
Gabriel, Calif., identified during the hearing as David Brockway. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lawyer gave me an example of someone who did not cooperate  
and how everyone around him was taken care of,'' Chung said. ``He 
said that this client was sentenced to a country club jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brockway, a Los Angeles defense attorney, said he met with Chung  
once last year at Luu's urging, but added that he's not connected 
with anyone in the Justice Department and never promised Chung 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chung is making this up,'' Brockway said in a telephone  
interview late Tuesday. ``He had already pleaded guilty so I said, 
'You don't need me.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Brockway said Luu works for him as an interpreter and described  
him as a Vietnamese refugee who has no connections with any Chinese 
officials. Luu could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Luu eventually grew suspicious in his conversations with Chung  
and Luu ``started making self-serving statements on the tapes and 
tried to distance himself from previous statements,'' said Chung. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung said that initially, Luu threatened that he should not  
cooperate with the FBI. ``The message was as follows: `If you keep 
your mouth shut, you and your family will be safe,''' Chung told 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung testified he felt uncomfortable channeling $300,000 from  
the Chinese chief of military intelligence into political 
contributions, so he spent most of it on business instead. A Senate 
Intelligence Committee report says the FBI traced $20,000 as 
political donations to the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung detailed how a 2 1/2-year political giving spree won him  
access to the White House for his well-heeled Chinese clients. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have mixed feelings about the president and the first lady,  
but I can't help but think that they used me as much as I used 
them,'' Chung said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung also alleged that a U.S. Embassy official in Beijing, who  
has since left the State Department, helped him get visas for 
dozens who wanted to visit the United States. Chung alleged he did 
financial favors for the official, Charles Parish, and took him to 
a Democratic fund-raiser and a private tour of the first lady's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department is investigating Parish, spokesman Maria  
Rudensky said.

	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- After chasing French skipper J.P.  
Mouligne three-quarters of the way around the world, British 
yachtsman Mike Garside finally beat his rival to a port in the 
Around Alone single-handed sailing race. 
</P>
<P>
	Garside won the fourth leg from Uruguay to Charleston on Tuesday  
but Mouligne, nearing the finish line, would still be the winner in 
the 50-foot yacht division. 
</P>
<P>
	Giovanni Soldini, who finished Saturday in a larger, 60-foot  
yacht, was the overall winner in record time. 
</P>
<P>
	Mouligne, whose Cray Valley slowed as it approached Charleston,  
telephoned his shore crew it was strange to be finishing a race 
that has consumed him for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're here safe, alive,'' Garside said after being greeted by  
several hundred people Tuesday Charleston's City Marina. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine publisher said he entered the race not for  
adventure, but to win. He did not, but did take a leg from 
Mouligne. 
</P>
<P>
	``The second time I made landfall in Charleston, I had been  
beaten in the Atlantic Alone by J.P. Mouligne, and I was mad that I 
didn't win,'' Garside said ``I didn't realize how presumptuous of 
me that was until I raced him halfway around the world. He is the 
best single-handed sailor in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garside, 54, sailed one of the most modern boats in the fleet  
but was not a typical sailor. 
</P>
<P>
	A former Special Forces officer, he had survived combat and a  
gunshot wound. While recovering, he read about long-distance 
sailing and decided to sail around the world with his family. 
</P>
<P>
	He took a one-week how-to course, then sailed around the world  
between 1980 and '82 -- the last time Garside had sailed before the 
Around Alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Although their relationship was a bit rocky at first, Garside  
and Mouligne came to respect each other. And Mouligne was the first 
to congratulate him via e-mail as Garside neared the finish on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Garside said he finally learned how to sail his boat, which he  
joked did not come with an instruction manual. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I learned about sailing I got from the Cray Valley Web  
site,'' he said. ``I'd read what J.P. said I'd done wrong and take 
notes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He plans to return to publishing and to continue sailing.  
</P>
<P>
	``I always knew I could win a leg,'' he said. ``I had the boat  
to do it. It's just that I wasn't up to the bloody job. But I've 
finally mastered the boat and I pushed it really, really hard.''

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- In its most important labor-law ruling in  
years, Mexico's supreme court has decided in favor of ``open shop'' 
rules at companies, allowing employees to belong to any union, or 
none at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tuesday ruling on four constitutional appeals, filed by two  
unions and two individual workers, sets precedent for state and 
federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling could affect the power long enjoyed by a handful of  
huge, pro-government unions that automatically register employees 
as members when they are hired and deduct union dues from their 
paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
	The court upheld a requirement that a union have a minimum of 20  
members, or meet other requirements to prove it represents at least 
some workers in a given industry. The ruling also upholds the 
rights of employees to quit -- or refuse to join -- a union. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling will take effect as soon as it is published in the  
official gazette. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandatory union membership has long discouraged the growth of  
independent unions here.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Workers have fixed an undersea  
sewage pipe that leaked tons of fetid waste onto Rio's prime 
beaches, but state and city officials can't agree whether the water 
now is safe. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's environmental secretariat took down ``no swimming''  
signs at Ipanema beach on Wednesday and put up new ones saying: 
``safe for swimming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a few feet away, a warning from Rio de Janeiro state's  
environmental agency Feema advised beachgoers to stay out of the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
	The city government says its measurement of fecal coliform  
bacteria in the water, a common gauge of raw sewage contamination, 
shows the water is safe except around Leme and Copacabana beaches 
and parts of Ipanema. 
</P>
<P>
	But state Environment Secretary Andre Correa says the city  
government has been ``too hasty.''

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- A gas canister used for cooking  
exploded Wednesday in a low-income Sao Paulo district, killing a 
family of four, the city's fire department said. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's press office said a couple and their two  
children were killed in the blast caused by a leak in the canister. 
It did not know what caused the leaking gas to explode. 
</P>
<P>
	The small concrete home was completely destroyed by the  
explosion.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A sister-in-law of former President Carlos  
Salinas de Gortari has dropped an appeal and paid a fine for her 
conviction on witness-tampering charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Paulina Castanon, wife of Salinas' brother Raul and a prominent  
socialite, dropped the appeal because she has hepatitis and needs 
to leave the country for medical treatment, she was quoted by local 
media as saying. She maintained she was innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge in the case had said he feared Castanon would not  
return if she were allowed to leave the country. Castanon said she 
had hepatitis C and was seeking a new treatment available only in 
Miami or Barcelona, Spain. A liver transplant would be the only 
treatment available in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Castanon was sentenced to three years in prison in 1997 for  
trying to get a witness to change his testimony in a murder case 
against her husband and lying to a judge about those attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, she paid a fine of $2,025, which exempts her from  
the prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Raul Salinas was sentenced in January to 50 years in prison for  
masterminding the 1994 murder of a political rival.

	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- The Guatemalan army denied on Wednesday  
accusations by a U.N. agency that it helped former paramilitaries 
escape from a jail after they were convicted in the 1993 murder of 
a farmworker. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12 ex-paramilitaries had been sentenced to 25 years for the  
killing, but in April an angry mob of their neighbors stormed the 
jail where they were being held, freed them and apparently helped 
them hide. 
</P>
<P>
	An army press statement said that at ``no point'' was there any  
act by the military to help the convicts flee. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the U.N. Mission to Guatemala said there is  
evidence the army helped the mob free the prisoners, and that this 
could represent a violation of peace accords signed in 1996 between 
the government and leftist rebels which ended Guatemala's 36-year 
civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the accords, the country's paramilitary Civilian  
Self-Defense Patrols were supposed to cut all military ties and 
disband. The paramilitary groups were formed in 1981 to assist the 
army in carrying out a brutal counterinsurgency campaign during the 
civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. report said soldiers dressed as civilians were seen in  
the mob and an army commander refused to dispatch troops to stop 
the mob.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Here are excerpts from editorials in newspapers in the United  
States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	May 12  
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times, on U.S.-China:  
</P>
<P>
	As if the war in Yugoslavia were not complicated enough,  
President Clinton must now deal with an infuriated China as he 
tries to fashion a political settlement in the Balkans. That is 
just one of several serious problems facing Mr. Clinton in the 
aftermath of last week's mistaken bombing of the Chinese Embassy in 
Belgrade. Another is China itself, which showed an ominously 
volatile side in its response to the accidental attack. In his six 
years as President, Mr. Clinton has not faced a more difficult set 
of foreign policy challenges. ... 

</P>
<P>
	May 11  
</P>
<P>
	The Bradenton (Fla.) Herald, on China embassy bombing:  
</P>
<P>
	Fears of a widening war in a region with a history for such  
unintended escalation spring from the mistaken bombing of the 
Chinese embassy in Belgrade by NATO aerial forces Friday night. ... 
</P>
<P>
	China! The last thing NATO needs is a confrontation with the  
world's most populous nation flush with newly acquired military 
technology and anxious to prove its status as a major player in 
global politics. ... Hopefully, President Clinton and his NATO 
allies will do all in their power to reassure the angry Chinese 
leaders that it was, indeed, only an ``isolated, tragic mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They should start by leveling on the reasons for the mistake.  
Military advisers said it was due to ``analytical misjudgment,'' 
rather than an errant missile guidance system or pilot error. ... 
</P>
<P>
	It is doubly sad that this error comes just as there were signs  
of a break in the Kosovo war. Yugoslavia's ally, Russia, had 
signaled willingness to consider an international security force in 
Kosovo to protect ethnic Albanians whom Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic has forcibly driven out ... 
</P>
<P>
	This ``error'' could tip the balance back in Milosevic's favor  
if he sees China as a new ally standing against the NATO forces. 
And then who knows where this war will lead as the world faces a 
chilling reminder of Sarajevo in 1914. 

</P>
<P>
	May 11  
</P>
<P>
	The Santa Fe New Mexican, on Chinese Embassy bombing:  
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Fu Manchu, that evil-genius character created by author Sax  
Rohmer, has made fools of the CIA again. 
</P>
<P>
	Imagine this scenario:  
</P>
<P>
	Sneaking into the NATO war room, the clever Chinese stole the  
bomb-target map of Belgrade. In its place he left a fake map 
showing the Chinese Embassy as the site of a Yugoslav 
arms-procurement office. A U.S. stealth bomber blew up the target 
with three bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hit what we were aiming for,'' a NATO official said. ``But  
we did not mean to hit the Chinese Embassy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fu Manchu, however, had a much grander purpose: For 10 years, he  
had been stealing nuclear bomb secrets from Los Alamos National 
Laboratory. He had been found out. U.S. public opinion had turned 
against him. He was threatened with subpoenas to testify before 
U.S. Congressional committees. His top-secret security clearance 
had been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	But, suddenly, Fu Manchu turned the tables. Today angry Chinese  
mobs riot around U.S. government offices in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	American tourists photographing the Great Wall of China face  
confiscation of their cameras. ... 

</P>
<P>
	May 8  
</P>
<P>
	The Oregonian, Portland, on Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	With the possible exception of Slobodan Milosevic, we doubt  
there is anyone in the world more eager to seize on a reasonable 
peace proposal for the Balkan conflict than Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	But the president should not leap too soon, and American  
policymakers and politicians should not settle for a peace 
agreement that is too ambiguous or compromises too much. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton should not, for example, accept any agreement that does  
not explicitly demand the removal of all Serbian and Yugoslav 
government forces from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Any peace agreement also must avoid the trap in which the  
international community became snared in neighboring Bosnia. There, 
international rivalries sabotaged the U.N. peacekeeping mission 
early on. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the United States is discussing a force ``with NATO at its  
core.'' As we have seen already, the phrase means different things 
to different people. 
</P>
<P>
	The central flaw in all of this -- the peace plan and the war  
that requires it -- is the fact that Milosevic still will be there 
when the war is over. 
</P>
<P>
	That suggests that, when all is said and done, this war will  
have accomplished a lot less than we might have hoped for. But the 
original, stated goal of NATO was to put an oppressed, dispossessed 
minority back into position to build its own future. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and NATO can still achieve that, but they must  
take care in making peace not to fritter away what they earned by 
making war. 

</P>
<P>
	May 10  
</P>
<P>
	Corpus Christi (Texas) Caller-Times, on Kosovar refugees:  
</P>
<P>
	The preparations for the arrival of Kosovar refugees at Fort  
Dix, N.J., had a peculiarly American touch. For people who had been 
evicted at gunpoint from their burning homes, seen their neighbors 
murdered and lived in unbearable squalor of a makeshift camp, the 
GIs installed toddler gates on the stairwells. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees are truly in America now -- but only temporarily,  
the Clinton administration insists. ``We will not let Mr. Milosevic 
succeed in keeping you out of your homes,'' first lady Hillary 
Clinton told the first 453 refugees, almost half of them children, 
of an expected 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	They would be going back, she promised, ``as soon as possible.''  
And, based on press interviews, most of them plan to -- for now. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The Kosovars are ethnic Albanian and Muslim from one of Europe's  
poorest and remotest regions. Other immigrant groups have succeeded 
despite similar handicaps; there's no reason to suppose the 
Kosovars will be any different. The government will try to ease 
them -- temporarily, of course -- into American society through 
English classes, job training, help with the rent and support from 
private groups. ... 
</P>
<P>
	If the Clinton administration is serious about the refugees  
being here only temporarily, it should hurry up and evict the Serb 
military in Kosovo. .. 

</P>
<P>
	May 11  
</P>
<P>
	The Des Moines (Iowa) Register, on Ken Starr:  
</P>
<P>
	If you're keeping score, independent counsel Ken Starr is 0 for  
2 in recent criminal prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest: a deadlocked jury in the trial of Julie Hiatt Steele  
on four charges of obstruction of justice and making false 
statements to federal investigators. Last month the prosecution of 
Whitewater figure Susan McDougal on obstruction charges foundered 
when a federal trial jury in Little Rock deadlocked on two counts 
and acquitted on a third. 
</P>
<P>
	It's possible to get the idea that Starr, who was appointed to  
look into Whitewater and later Clinton's sex life, decided to focus 
his prosecutorial firepower only on those minor figures who refused 
-- for whatever reason -- to testify as he wanted them to. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Was this the intent of the special-prosecutor statute? While  
certainly not candidates for citizen of the year, these women 
hardly deserved the full force of teams of prosecutors from Office 
of the Independent Counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	Just when it appears Starr should be about to close the books,  
he hauls another bit-part player before a federal jury. His 
prosecutors left the Steele trial last week muttering they were 
weighing the possibility of a retrial. 
</P>
<P>
	When will it end?  

</P>
<P>
	May 12  
</P>
<P>
	The News Tribune, Tacoma, Wash., on talk show award:  
</P>
<P>
	The cost of negligence can run to the millions -- in the case of  
television's ``The Jenny Jones Show,'' $25 million to be exact. 
That's what a Michigan jury awarded the family of Scott Amedure, a 
gay man who was later killed by Jonatahn Schmitz, another guest on 
the show. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz, who reportedly suffers from manic depression, hadn't  
been told by anyone on the show about Amedure's attraction for him. 
Amedure's sexual fantasy was replayed for Schmitz, who is 
heterosexual, and who reacted by burying his face in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure to tell guests in advance of issues that will be  
publicly discussed goes to the heart of tawdry, confrontational 
shows like ``Jenny Jones,'' where a guest's surprise is supposed to 
lead to anger, and these are the emotional staples counted on to 
drive ratings upward. 
</P>
<P>
	The show and others like it, are television at its lowest.  
Viewers who tune in feel good, because guests are made to feel so 
bad. But this sort of ``ambush'' approach by television producers 
also goes to the heart of the rule of negligence where risky and, 
in the case of Schmitz, destabilizing actions have consequences 
that are, or should have been predictable. That's what the verdict 
means. ... 

</P>
<P>
	May 6  
</P>
<P>
	The Charleston (W.Va.) Gazette, on minimum wage:  
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives are trotting out the same tired excuses as they  
try to battle President Clinton's proposal for a badly needed 
increase in America's minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't even matter to them that those same excuses were  
proven wrong by the last increase. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Republicans warned that raising the minimum wage would  
make low-skilled workers too expensive to hire, and employers would 
curtail such jobs. However, the United States now has the lowest 
unemployment level in decades. The jobless rate for 16- to 
24-year-olds -- those most likely to work at minimum wage -- is as 
low as it has been since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	By the way, adjusted for inflation, today's minimum wage is  
still worth 20 percent less than it was in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers, especially low-income ones, have not shared in the  
prosperity of the last two decades. Wages have climbed at a 
fraction of the rate of corporate profits and CEO compensation 
packages. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposed $1-an-hour boost would be a start.  
</P>
<P>
	This increase is especially important as more welfare recipients  
get thrown into the work force. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of these will be mothers with children to support. Doing  
that on a minimum-wage job is tough. The $1 increase, though puny, 
would certainly help. ... 

</P>
<P>
	May 4  
</P>
<P>
	Sandusky (Ohio) Register, on national dialogue about Colorado  
shootings: 
</P>
<P>
	We need to talk, says President Clinton.  
</P>
<P>
	We need to have another one of those national dialogues, to get  
to the root causes of tragedies of which Columbine High School was 
merely the bloodiest and most recent example. 
</P>
<P>
	That's nice. But we don't see anything substantive coming out of  
that sort of high-level ``summit'' by itself. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not a diatribe about the eroding moral foundations of  
our society, or a condemnation of parents who devote too much time 
to career or other concerns at the expense of nurturing. 
</P>
<P>
	But parents, notice your kids. Those precision computers between  
their ears still require the proper programming. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a program that's built little by little, with a tap here  
and a tap there, gently building a template of right and wrong 
against which these developing proto-adults will eventually be able 
to evaluate all the external influences you can't keep out anyway. 

</P>
<P>
	May 11  
</P>
<P>
	Aftonbladet, Stockholm, Sweden, on China-West relations:  
</P>
<P>
	China does not have the same dramatic need of the West today as  
does Russia. It is Americans and Europeans who need the Chinese 
market, which in time will be the biggest in the world, not the 
other way around. China has helped to save Western capitalist 
interests in Asia by skilfully avoiding being a victim of or an 
accelerator of the Asian economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	It's reasonable to accept that China simply feels itself deeply  
insulted and as with many in the West does not find NATO's 
explanation that ``we used an old map'' to be good enough. ... 

</P>
<P>
	May 10  
</P>
<P>
	Le Figaro, Paris, on NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in  
Belgrade: 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has committed a new tragic error in bombing the Chinese  
Embassy in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion of anti-American sentiment was carefully  
cultivated and encouraged by the Chinese authorities. For them, it 
is an opportunity. Their hope is, without doubt, to see the masses 
denounce wholeheartedly the ``imperialism'' of the United States in 
a sudden burst of patriotism resulting in a renewal of popular 
support behind its leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	But it would be unwise of China to underestimate the risks that  
come with unleashing hundreds of thousands of protesters throughout 
the country. Already, the opening to the West and notably to the 
United States, driven by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, is contested by 
even those inside the regime. The popular discontent could well 
backfire on him. 

</P>
<P>
	May 11  
</P>
<P>
	Corriere della Sera, Milan, Italy, on Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	While NATO, despite several mistakes, has ``smart bombs.''  
(Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic has political intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	For three days, the world's strongest alliance has been fighting  
against embarrassment, apologizing to Beijing for bombing its 
embassy in Belgrade, explaining that the omnipotent CIA did not 
have an updated map of the Serb capital. ... 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has shot itself in the foot, and it has once again prompted  
discussion about the diplomatic plan approved by the G-8. ... 
</P>
<P>
	So what is Milosevic doing? With perfect timing, he ...  
announces a partial withdrawal of his troops from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is brilliant. But it would be worth the effort to  
explore any other margins of flexibility that might exist with 
Belgrade, and any other opportunities which could put an end to 
this war, which seems to have worn out NATO more than the Serb 
dictator. ... 
</P>
<P>
	If NATO wants to avoid defeat, it has no alternative to  
solidarity. But it must pay China for its mistake ... and have the 
courage to return to politics with a clear plan, which seems to be 
missing for now. 

</P>
<P>
	May 11  
</P>
<P>
	The Express, London, on bombing of Chinese embassy in Belgrade:  
</P>
<P>
	The diplomatic fallout from the NATO bombing of China's Belgrade  
embassy continues to spread around the world. Relations between 
China and the West now have sunk so low that Britons are being 
warned not to visit China. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese demonstrators appear to have accepted their political  
leaders' line that the bombing was a disgraceful, aggressive, 
intentional assault on their nation. China's leaders know this to 
be untrue; the bombing was nothing more than a tragic error and the 
cynical pretense that it was an act of aggression is an attempt by 
Beijing to make as much capital out of the issue as possible. ... 
</P>
<P>
	... It would be humiliating, dangerous and disastrous for NATO's  
credibility if we were to backtrack now, without a settlement 
guaranteeing the security of the Kosovars -- and complete withdrawal 
of Serbian troops from Kosovo. The only sensible response to the 
latest shower of diplomatic flak is for NATO to step up its 
attacks.

	Frankfurter Rundschau, Frankfurt, Gemany, on China's reaction to  
the NATO bombing of the Chinese in Belgrade: 
</P>
<P>
	The sharp reaction of Beijing's to the mistaken NATO bombing is  
understandable. Also understandable is the rage and sadness of many 
Chinese about the bad luck. But this doesn't alone suffice to 
explain the surprising massiveness and weight of the protests in 
China. For many in the entire country who took to the streets the 
incident is only an excuse. Behind the tirades of hate and in part 
physical attacks against foreigners is a long suppressed 
nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
	For years Beijing's leadership has been hammering into its  
people an exaggerated and dangerous patriotism. Critique from the 
West about human rights violations have been played down by 
Beijing's propaganda machine as interfering in internal affairs. 
Spreading of western consumer goods and lifestyles are considered 
`cultural imperialism.' All aimed at one goal: China should remain 
weak and poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Beijing has ignited the dangerous mixture. It wasn't  
difficult to do. State media in China report that the bombing of 
the Chinese embassy was intentional. The people believe it, and it 
fits only too well into the Chinese leadership's vision. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The mass protests are to increase the moral pressure on the  
West. But emotionally whipped up, the protests could soon derail 
out of control. The game with the people's anger, that was last 
shown in 1989 on Tiananmen Square, is dangerous.

	Kathimerini, Athens, Greece, on bombing of Chinese embassy in

</P>
<P>
	Let's overturn reality and hypothesize that in one country of  
the world the American embassy is hit and missiles kill American 
citizens. Even if it involves an obvious mistake, even if the 
instigators of this attack humbly ask for forgiveness, we can 
accept as a definite given that those hurt would consider it their 
obvious right to retaliate, certainly in a violent way, to heal 
their prestige and to make an example. ... 
</P>
<P>
	If all the rest of the `mistakes' ... show how dark and  
bottomless the hole is in the psyche of those designing the 
slaughters like board games, then the bombing of the Chinese 
embassy in Belgrade happened in order to confirm in an undisputable 
way ... American hegemony and its already enacted monopoly of 
violence.

</P>
<P>
	Tages-Anzeiger, Zurich, Switzerland, on NATO bombing of Chinese  
embassy: 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't a misfired shot that hit the Chinese Embassy in  
Belgrade. NATO had targeted the mission of the People's Republic. 
By mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	According to CIA chief George Tenet, agents had supplied  
erroneous information. 
</P>
<P>
	So it was that the alliance reduced to ashes and rubble a  
building it thought was the Yugoslav arms procurement headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, it hit China's sore point: the nationalist  
pride of the Empire of the Middle, which was humiliated last 
century by Western colonial powers -- and still feels humiliated.

</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong Standard, Hong Kong, on NATO bombing of Chinese  
embassy: 
</P>
<P>
	Before more go amiss in this campaign it may be time for NATO  
and the Americans to consider winding it down altogether and 
returning to the negotiating table for a political solution. The 
bombing campaign, it is clear, has done nothing to diminish the 
defiance of the Serbs nor kicked them out of Kosovo. All it has 
done is to fill up the cemeteries. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack on the Chinese embassy is not likely to start World  
War III. It must, however, serves as a warning to Beijing and the 
People's Liberation Army of the need to build a modern, 
professional army equipped with the best that technology can offer. 
Not so much as to challenge the U.S. or NATO or even to overpower 
anyone in the neighborhood, but to make certain that China cannot 
and should not be pushed around.

	Mainichi Shimbun, Tokyo, on Middle East peace:  
</P>
<P>
	At the request of Chairman Arafat, the Palestinian Central  
Committee on April 29 officially postponed a declaration of 
statehood until June at the earliest. ... 
</P>
<P>
	There is no doubt that any agreement that ends a half-century of  
ethnic struggle will be accompanied by pain. But the peace 
negotiations have come this far because the public yearns for 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan and other members of the international community can help  
foster an environment conducive to peace by extending financial 
assistance to the Palestinians. In the end, however, peace will 
depend on decisions made by the Israelis and the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	There are some who believe that ethnic conflicts can only be  
resolved with military power. Witness the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization's bombing campaign against Yugoslavia. On the other 
hand, the Middle East peace process could become a model for 
solving ethnic conflicts through dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians kept the peace process alive by forgoing a  
declaration of statehood. No matter who becomes the next prime 
minister of Israel, the time has come for the Israeli people to 
respond in kind by clearly voicing their support for peace.

<HEADLINE> Night Lights May Ruin Kids' Vision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Children who sleep with a night light until age 2 may be as much  
as five times more likely to suffer from nearsightedness as they 
grow older than other youngsters, researchers reported today in the 
journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Genetic and environmental factors, such as nutrition and strain  
from television and computer screens, are thought to hurt people's 
vision. 
</P>
<P>
	But the study by scientists at the University of Pennsylvania  
and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia raises the possibility 
that too much light prompts the eyes to grow excessively and skews 
their natural focus during the first two years of life, when the 
eyes develop most rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just as the body needs to rest, this suggests that the eyes  
need a period of darkness,'' said ophthalmologist Dr. Graham Quinn, 
the study's lead author. 
</P>
<P>
	However, other experts dismissed the study as premature and  
incomplete, saying the researchers had failed to take into account 
obvious risk factors, such as heredity. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are other factors involved in childhood myopia, the most  
important of which is whether the parents are nearsighted or not,'' 
said myopia researcher Donald Mutti of the University of California 
at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	They also said the study is flawed because the researchers  
relied on information supplied by parents of nearsighted children 
after several years. Nor did they account for other, stronger 
sources of light that parents cannot control, such as a streetlight 
shining through a bedroom window. 
</P>
<P>
	A more reliable approach would be to conduct controlled  
experiments in the illuminated and darkened bedrooms of children, 
then check their vision several years later, the experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think a retrospective study based on a questionnaire  
is valid,'' said Dr. Robert Cykiert, an ophthalmologist at the New 
York University School of Medicine. ``They're grasping at straws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearsightedness results when the eye grows excessively and its  
shape is too long rather than perfectly round. This causes incoming 
light to converge in front of the retina instead of on it, making 
things blurry. 
</P>
<P>
	About one in four Americans is myopic. Children usually discover  
they are nearsighted when they have trouble seeing the blackboard. 
In most cases, myopia is corrected with glasses. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in life, nearsighted people are more likely to develop  
macular degeneration, detached retinas and other disorders that can 
lead to blindness. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia researchers asked the parents of 479 children  
who had been patients at the doctors' eye clinic to recall the 
lighting conditions in the youngsters' bedrooms between birth and 
age 2. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 172 of the children slept in darkness; 10 percent  
developed nearsightedness. A total of 232 slept with a night light; 
34 percent had become nearsighted. An additional 75 slept with a 
lamp on; 55 percent developed myopia. 
</P>
<P>
	Quinn acknowledged the study does not conclusively demonstrate  
that low light cause myopia, but he urged parents to provide 
sleeping infants and toddlers with a dark bedroom -- within reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want parents to overreact and start putting up  
blackout shades,'' he said. ``We don't want to think they have to 
change a diaper in the dark, and drop their baby because they can't 
see what they're doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other researchers said parents should wait for the results of  
follow-up research before tossing their night lights in the trash. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutti said: ``Do what is comfortable for your children in order  
to get them to sleep.

<HEADLINE> Brain Shocks Trigger Depression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Accidental electrical stimulation of the brain  
during medical treatment can trigger bouts of deep depression that 
come and go almost instantly, researchers reported today in the New 
England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	French doctors made the discovery while treating a woman with  
Parkinson's disease. They implanted electrodes deep in her brain in 
an attempt to stimulate the parts that malfunction in her disease. 
</P>
<P>
	To their surprise, they found that turning on one of these  
electrodes made the woman profoundly sad. She leaned to the right, 
started to cry and told of feeling of sad, guilty and useless. 
</P>
<P>
	``I no longer wish to live, to see anything, hear anything, feel  
anything,'' she told doctors. Asked if she felt pain, she replied, 
``No, I'm fed up with life. I've had enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ninety seconds after the doctors stopped the electrical  
stimulation, the woman's depression disappeared. Stimulating 
another electrode implanted nearby dramatically relieved the 
woman's Parkinson's disease, enabling her to give up taking her 
medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors asked if they could repeat their stimulation of the  
depression electrode while they videotaped her. The woman agreed, 
and twice more they triggered profound sadness. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Boulos-Paul Bejjani and others from INSERM, the French  
research organization, published the report. 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Stuart Yudofsky of Baylor  
College of Medicine in Houston wrote that the report ``raises 
fundamental and far-reaching questions about depression'' and the 
use of electrical treatments. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
	--Is depression hard-wired into the brain?  
</P>
<P>
	-Does depression carry some evolutionary advantage, such as  
intensifying grief in a way that helps hold families together? 
</P>
<P>
	--Can brain stimulation also trigger symptoms of mania, and would  
this be a possible treatment for depression? 
</P>
<P>
	--Could stimulation of other parts of the brain treat such  
disorders as alcoholism, drug abuse, aggression and violence?

<HEADLINE>  Chung Testifies Before House Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After Clinton donor Johnny Chung underwent  
four hours of questioning on Capitol Hill, he shook hands with Rep. 
Dan Burton and declared, ``Well Mr. Chairman, one down, 120 to 
go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to congressional staffers, Chung was referring Tuesday  
to the number of witnesses Burton says have refused to appear in 
the two-year House campaign fund-raising investigation, thwarting 
the efforts of Republicans to get first-hand testimony about the 
financing of the presidential campaign in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eighty people have taken the Fifth; a lot of people have left  
the country or stayed overseas,'' said Burton, R-Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the 120, former Little Rock restaurateur Charlie Trie,  
goes on trial in Arkansas next Monday, charged with obstructing a 
Senate probe into campaign fund-raising abuses by allegedly 
ordering a subordinate to get rid of subpoenaed documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing before Burton's Government Reform Committee, Chung  
said he was told by a Chinese banker that Trie had asked for $1 
million from the Chinese government for political donations. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung also testified that he was approached last year by a  
California businessman named Robert Luu who first threatened, then 
offered money if Chung would be uncooperative with the Justice 
Department investigation of campaign finance abuses. According to 
Chung, Luu said he was acting on behalf of a woman who had been the 
intermediary between Chung and the chief of Chinese military 
intelligence. The intelligence chief, Gen. Ji Sheng De, provided 
Chung $300,000, saying it should be used to re-elect President 
Clinton, Chung testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung testified that the FBI taped and photographed some of the  
conversations with Luu. 
</P>
<P>
	``Luu ... mentioned that he received money from Beijing'' and  
``Luu said they would give me money to take care of my legal 
expenses and my family and I could retire,'' said Chung. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung said Luu then introduced him to an attorney in San  
Gabriel, Calif., identified during the hearing as David Brockway. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lawyer gave me an example of someone who did not cooperate  
and how everyone around him was taken care of,'' Chung said. ``He 
said that this client was sentenced to a country club jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brockway, a Los Angeles defense attorney, said he met with Chung  
once last year at Luu's urging, but added that he's not connected 
with anyone in the Justice Department and never promised Chung 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chung is making this up,'' Brockway said in a telephone  
interview late Tuesday. ``He had already pleaded guilty so I said, 
'You don't need me.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Brockway said Luu works for him as an interpreter and described  
him as a Vietnamese refugee who has no connections with any Chinese 
officials. Luu could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Luu eventually grew suspicious in his conversations with Chung  
and Luu ``started making self-serving statements on the tapes and 
tried to distance himself from previous statements,'' said Chung. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung said that initially, Luu threatened that he should not  
cooperate with the FBI. ``The message was as follows: `If you keep 
your mouth shut, you and your family will be safe,''' Chung told 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung testified he felt uncomfortable channeling $300,000 from  
the Chinese chief of military intelligence into political 
contributions, so he spent most of it on business instead. A Senate 
Intelligence Committee report says the FBI traced $20,000 as 
political donations to the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung detailed how a 2 1/2-year political giving spree won him  
access to the White House for his well-heeled Chinese clients. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have mixed feelings about the president and the first lady,  
but I can't help but think that they used me as much as I used 
them,'' Chung said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung also alleged that a U.S. Embassy official in Beijing, who  
has since left the State Department, helped him get visas for 
dozens who wanted to visit the United States. Chung alleged he did 
financial favors for the official, Charles Parish, and took him to 
a Democratic fund-raiser and a private tour of the first lady's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department is investigating Parish, spokesman Maria  
Rudensky said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Air Exec Pledges $200M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Philippine Airlines chairman Lucio  
Tan has assured government officials he can raise $200 million in 
new capital for the rehabilitation of the troubled flag carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu told reporters Wednesday that  
it ``looks like there is finally a solution'' but added ``Until the 
money is in, we can't say it's done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under a recovery plan, the $200 million must be injected into  
the company by June 4. Tan, who owns 70 percent of the airline, has 
personally pledged $100 million and is trying to find an investor 
group to put up the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Tan, as the majority stockholder, has the right to infuse fresh  
capital into the airline over at least two other potential investor 
groups, Espiritu said. 
</P>
<P>
	Espiritu said Deutsche Lufthansa AG -- Europe's second-biggest  
carrier -- will manage the airline, which is mired in debts totaling 
$2.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it appears Lufthansa will take over management from a  
group of former Cathay Pacific executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Tan has been in Frankfurt where he has been negotiating with  
Lufthansa officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite objections from the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which holds  
16 percent of PAL's debt, the rehabilitation plan is expected to be 
approved later this month by the Philippine Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	European credit agencies owed around 40 percent of the total,  
however, wrote to the SEC earlier this week warning that their 
support for PAL should not be taken for granted, an official said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the agencies expressed concern in the letter about a  
recent management shakeup in which Tan reappointed himself chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Tan's move also angered the U.S. Ex-Im Bank, which withdrew its  
support for the rehabilitation plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Tan stepped down as chief executive only a few months ago under  
pressure from creditors, who wanted professional managers to run 
the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately from Tan, the government is also trying to encourage  
new investors to take an equity stake in PAL, and has said that 
Kuwaiti aviation interests are among several interested groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Espiritu said the government doesn't want state financing  
institutions which have stakes in PAL to plow fresh funds into the 
carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	While President Joseph Estrada has said there will be no  
government bailout, some officials have said the financing 
institutions might be given some leeway on this as an investment 
decision.

	HOUSTON (AP) -- For the second time in a year, a mistrial was  
declared in the federal conspiracy and bribery case against two 
current and one former city councilmen who allegedly accepted 
envelopes stuffed with cash. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge David Hittner declared a mistrial Wednesday  
after jurors failed to agree on a verdict for Councilmen John

Jurors deliberated for six days.

<HEADLINE> Venturi Is Presidents Cup Captain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- If the American team lacks enthusiasm about  
the next Presidents Cup, it won't come from the top. Ken Venturi 
was glowing Wednesday when he was introduced as U.S. captain for 
the 2000 matches. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be captain is something that was only made in dreams,''  
Venturi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Venturi, the 1964 U.S. Open champion and a golf analyst for CBS  
Sports for 31 years, will take charge of a team that looked 
lifeless in a 20 1/2-11 1/2 loss to the International team last year at 
Royal Melbourne in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is very enthusiastic about it,'' PGA Tour commissioner Tim  
Finchem said. ``I have to believe that will rub off on the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 matches will be played at the Robert Trent Jones Golf  
Club in Gainesville, Va., where the United States won the first two 
editions of the Presidents Cup. It's not far from where Venturi won 
his only major championship, at Congressional. 
</P>
<P>
	The International team is expected to announce its captain as  
soon as next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Finchem said he asked Venturi to be captain about two months  
ago, then told him to keep it a secret. That was no small task. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to hug him and kiss him,'' Venturi said. ``I  
can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Venturi follows Hale Irwin, Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus as  
captain of the Presidents Cup, which began in 1994 and was 
patterned after the Ryder Cup to give foreign players born outside 
Europe a chance to take part in team match play. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike those captains, Venturi has been removed from the game as  
a player for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not be a playing captain,'' Venturi joked, adding that  
he might add Gene Sarazen and Byron Nelson as his wild-card 
selections. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, he knows the tour and its players as well as anyone  
because of his work for CBS Sports since 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will be an incredible captain from the standpoint of having  
relationships and knowledge about the players,'' Finchem said. 
``You see Ken Venturi at a tour event, always out on the practice 
tee talking to the players, learning about what players are 
thinking about and taking a look at how they're playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Venturi already is getting strong endorsement from the players.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's pretty neat that Ken is our captain,'' Tiger  
Woods said. ``He knows us better than Arnold or Jack, because he 
sees us out here, he talks to us and he watches us play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Venturi's career already is one of the most successful in golf,  
even if he has just 14 victories. 
</P>
<P>
	He stammered so badly as a child that doctors told his mother he  
may never speak properly. Venturi overcame that to become perhaps 
the most popular golf analyst in television. He was honored by the 
PGA of American in April with the Lifetime Achievement Award in 
Journalism. 
</P>
<P>
	His career on the golf course lasted only 14 years because of  
Carpal-Tunnel Syndrome, but it was packed with achievements. 
</P>
<P>
	He nearly became the first amateur to win the Masters in 1956  
until an 80 in the final round left him one stroke behind Jack 
Burke Jr. Then at Congressional in 1964, he nearly collapsed from 
heat exhaustion in the 36-hole final but hung on to beat Tommy 
Jacobs by four strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Captaining the team is an honor that I can never, ever thank  
you enough for,'' Venturi told Finchem. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he winked at him.  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll bring it back home.''

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Leader Backs G-8 Peace Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova  
expressed backing Wednesday for a peace plan drawn up by western 
powers and Russia to resolve the crisis over Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Rugova met with German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, one of  
a number of sessions he has held with German and Italian leaders 
since Yugoslavia unexpectedly allowed him to leave the country May 
5. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief statement, Rugova repeated his call for Yugoslavia to  
withdraw its forces from Kosovo and accept an international force, 
including NATO troops, to supervise the return of refugees to 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the main goal was the return of the hundreds of  
thousands of refugees who have fled the Serb province for 
neighboring lands. ``I'm very saddened that Kosovo is practically 
empty,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rugova, who met with Pope John Paul II on Monday, said he  
supported the peace plan worked out last week in Bonn by the seven 
leading industrial nations and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan does not define the sort of international force to be  
deployed in Kosovo -- in deference to Russia's reluctance at seeing 
a NATO-led force. It also calls for Kosovo to remain part of 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	During their talks, Fischer urged Rugova to use his influence to  
bring the different factions of Kosovo Albanians to ``agree on 
political goals,'' the foreign minister's spokesman, Martin 
Erdmann, said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Kosovo Albanians have to speak with one voice so the  
international community will hear them,'' Fischer was quoted as 
telling Rugova. 
</P>
<P>
	Erdmann said Rugova and his family are taking temporary  
residence near Bonn for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army accused Rugova of  
being an ``emissary'' for Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and 
denounced him for not speaking out about the suffering of the 
Kosovo Albanians since he left Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after NATO bombing began March 24, Rugova met Milosevic.  
Serb TV showed the two men shaking and hands and also attributed 
statements to Rugova including an apparent call for the end to the 
NATO airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Western officials say he and his family had been under house  
arrest in Kosovo since the airstrikes began, and the KLA at the 
time dismissed the meeting as coerced. Since leaving Yugoslavia, 
Rugova has avoided commenting on either his reported detention or 
his meeting with Milosevic.

<HEADLINE> House Seeks Milosevic's Indictment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan congressional human rights  
commission says the Clinton administration is failing to gather 
usable war crimes evidence against Yugoslav leader Slobodan 
Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``In spite of all that has happened in Bosnia and now Kosovo,  
the United States administration still seems to cling to the idea 
that Milosevic is someone with whom we can cut a deal,'' Rep. Chris 
Smith, R-N.J., co-chairman of the congressional Helsinki 
Commission, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before NATO attacks on Kosovo, the House and Senate passed  
resolutions last year calling upon the Clinton administration to 
gather evidence for an indictment of Milosevic based on atrocities 
in Bosnia and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he plans to introduce another resolution to push for  
more aggressive legal action against the Yugoslav leader, Serb 
commanders and others for atrocities in Kosovo. He said 
administration officials have repeatedly told him they have no 
specific collection of evidence against Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Nina Bang-Jensen, special counsel for the independent Coalition  
for International Justice, which assists the U.N. Yugoslav war 
crimes tribunal in the Hague, Netherlands, told the commission at a 
hearing Tuesday that the tribunal's record so far on the Kosovo 
crisis has been disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
	She urged that immunity not be considered for Milosevic as part  
of any peace deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials have pledged full cooperation  
with the war crimes tribunal and say they are supporting efforts to 
gather evidence among Kosovo refugees against Serb military forces 
and police. 
</P>
<P>
	Alarmed by new talk of achieving peace in Kosovo by negotiating  
with Milosevic, Rep. Ben Cardin, D-Md., called for a 
``superindictment'' of the Serb leader under war crimes tribunal 
provisions that allow public announcement of an indictment. 
Currently, the Hague-based tribunal dealing with former Yugoslav 
states keeps its indictments secret until the accused is arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardin said there is bipartisan concern on Capitol Hill ``as to  
whether the Clinton administration is placing a high enough 
priority on assisting and making sure that the war crimes tribunal 
can carry out its mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cardin said the concern is increased by recent statements about  
a negotiated peace agreement.

<HEADLINE> Congress: How Much Cash for Kosovo? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House and Senate negotiators are driving  
toward giving President Clinton at least $4.9 billion more than he 
wanted for the air campaign against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	But first, lawmakers trying to wrap up a compromise wide-ranging  
spending bill will have to resolve disputes over mining 
regulations, Alaskan fishing and other issues. Bargainers from the 
two chambers planned to meet again today in hopes of shaking hands 
on a measure they want to zip through Congress this week. 
</P>
<P>
	While they were working on it, participants urged the White  
House to rethink its threat to veto the measure because of its 
excessive defense spending, cuts in domestic programs, and other 
provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration should wait to see what the product is,''  
said the House Appropriations Committee chairman, Rep. Bill Young, 
R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has asked for $6 billion for the bombing campaign  
against Yugoslavia. The House beefed that up to $13 billion last 
week, adding money for equipment, training, a pay raise for the 
troops and other items. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate never voted on a plan of its own. But during  
negotiations Tuesday, the Senate Appropriations Committee chairman, 
Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, offered $10.9 billion, knocking out $1 
billion the House approved to modernize overseas U.S. military 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
	In effect, that became the minimum figure Congress is likely to  
provide for the conflict and for a GOP-led effort to beef up U.S. 
armed forces at home and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate bargainers tentatively agreed to include $678  
million for refugees who have fled the province of Kosovo, $112 
million more than Clinton proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill contains nearly $1 billion to help Central America  
rebuild from recent natural disasters, particularly last fall's 
Hurricane Mitch, which devastated Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua 
and Costa Rica. Also sure to be included is aid to American farmers 
struggling because of plummeting prices for cotton, hogs and other 
commodities, and money to help the recovery from the recent 
Midwestern tornadoes and to buttress the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency's coffers for future disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the bargainers, House Speaker Dennis Hastert,  
R-Ill., and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told them 
to provide $11 billion for defense plus aid for natural disasters 
and farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders also said negotiators should drop provisions ``which  
add significantly to the cost'' of the compromise bill, such as new 
loan programs. They said other items should be retained, such as an 
administration-opposed provision that would bar the federal 
government from sharing the $246 billion settlement states have 
reached with the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, battles were being waged over provisions added by  
senators that include help for the steel, oil, gas, mining and 
ranching industries. 
</P>
<P>
	In a new one, Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said he would abandon  
an attempt to block the Interior Department from designating a 
protected habitat for the endangered silvery minnow, which lives in 
his state. After initially saying he would offer even broader 
language preventing the designation of new protected habitats for 
any species, he ran into objections from the White House and other 
senators and said he would pursue the prohibition in separate 
legislation later. 
</P>
<P>
	Pleas by House members to drop the items seemed to fall on ears  
that were all but deaf. 
</P>
<P>
	To one such request, Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., responded,  
``That great philosopher, Mae West, said, `Too much of anything is 
simply wonderful.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd is author of language that would provide $140 million to  
some steel companies hurt by low-cost foreign competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Especially numerous were fights over environmental provisions.  
Environmental groups said senators were using the must-pass bill to 
carry language that otherwise would not pass. And led by Rep. 
Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., House GOP moderates circulated a letter 
saying the provisions ``would be a serious procedural, political 
and policy mistake that could jeopardize passage of any conference 
report on the House floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fights included:  
</P>
<P>
	--An effort by Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., to block the Fish and  
Wildlife Service from listing the Alabama sturgeon as an endangered 
species. He says such a listing would restrict dredging in the 
state's waterways, threatening the timber industry and other 
industries that ship their products on barges. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., was trying to overturn a court  
ruling that mining companies can't expand their milling operations 
on public lands. Environmentalists complain those operations 
pollute water. The ruling affects the Crown Jewel gold mine in 
Gorton's state and other Western hard-rock mines. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, wants to prevent the National  
Park Service from phasing out commercial fishing in the waters off 
Glacier Bay National Park until courts decide the issue. 
Environmentalists say that could take years.

<HEADLINE> Chargers Sign Defensive End Fontenot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The San Diego Chargers signed six-year veteran  
defensive end Al Fontenot to a one-year contract today, filling one 
of their offseason needs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers turned to Fontenot after they had trouble  
re-signing end Marco Coleman, an unrestricted free agent. Signing 
Fontenot apparently won't close the door for Coleman, but likely 
would force him to take less money if he does decide to return to 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Fontenot spent the last two seasons with Indianapolis and his  
first four with Chicago. He has 17 1/2 sacks and 264 tackles in his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	He had 4 1/2 sacks in 1996, his final year with the Bears, and  
again in 1997, his first with the Colts. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, quarterback Mark Rypien visited the Chargers  
and, to no one's surprise, failed his physical exam. He underwent 
arthroscopic surgery on his right rotator cuff on Feb. 19. 
Nonetheless, he met with general manager Bobby Beathard, coach Mike 
Riley and offensive line coach Joe Bugel, who coached with the 
Washington Redskins when Rypien played for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctor felt, and rightly so, that I could use a little  
more range of motion,'' said Rypien, who expects to be fully healed 
in three to four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Rypien sat out last season due to his young son's terminal  
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like I told Bobby, my heart and mind are back in football,''  
Rypien said. ``I want to play again. Physically, I want to know if 
I can do it. I'm not there yet, but it's nice to know they have 
interest. They have Ryan (Leaf), Jim (Harbaugh) and Craig 
(Whelihan) still here. If I do come, it would be a chance to battle 
for a spot on the team.''

<HEADLINE> Nicklaus Playing Bell Atlantic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AVONDALE, Pa. (AP) -- Jack Nicklaus will play in the Senior PGA  
Tour's Bell Atlantic Classic next week, his first competitive round 
since undergoing hip surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus, 59, underwent replacement of his left hip in January,  
forcing him to miss his first Masters in 40 years. Doctors had 
predicted that the six-time Masters champion wouldn't be able to 
return to tournament golf for six months. 
</P>
<P>
	But doctors have said they are pleased with his rehabilitation,  
which has included playing 18 holes daily. 
</P>
<P>
	His appearance for the Bell Atlantic at Hartfeld National on May  
17-23 will be the first tournament Nicklaus has played in since 
shooting a 67 for a 13th-place tie in the Senior Open in July 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``This tournament works out well for me, as it relates to my  
return to competitive golf. ... I'm looking forward very much to 
playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus finished eighth in last year's Bell Atlantic  
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he plays, it's a huge deal,'' Fred Couples, a former  
Masters champion himself, said from Irving, Texas, where he's 
preparing for the Byron Nelson Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope he looks good walking,'' Couples said. ``The score is  
irrelevant. But I don't think people will fall down if he makes the 
cut. He wouldn't play if he didn't think he could win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Watson, who engaged Nicklaus in some of golf's most stirring  
showdowns in the 1970s, said he was ``happy for him. He was walking 
with a little limp when I saw him at Augusta. It doesn't surprise 
me what Jack does. He has a focus about him that's better than 
anyone else out here. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of the greatest to ever play the game, if not the  
greatest. To have that personality in the field makes that field 
more complete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very honored that we're the first event that he's  
playing, because not only does that mean a lot, but it's great for 
senior tour golf,'' said Mary Ann Saleski, a tournament 
spokeswoman. ``To watch Jack in another segment of his life just 
adds to the whole esteem of his career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a ceremonial appearance at Augusta National in April,  
Nicklaus said he hoped to play in the suburban Philadelphia 
tournament as a precursor to playing his Memorial Tournament on 
June 3-6 in Dublin, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would tell me how much I can walk and how much I could  
do,'' Nicklaus said at that time. ``I might play there and I might 
find out I can't play at the Memorial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Nicklaus became the oldest player to finish in the  
top 10 in the Masters, shooting a final-round, 4-under-par 68 to 
tie for sixth. But slowed by his hip problems, Nicklaus played only 
six senior tour events last year.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Sets Social Security Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans sought Wednesday to increase  
political pressure on Democrats on the Social Security issue by 
rushing toward a floor vote on legislation that would safeguard 
$1.8 trillion in budget surpluses for the retirement program. 
</P>
<P>
	House leaders ordered that the bill bypass the Budget Committee  
and Ways and Means committee and head directly to the floor next 
week to avoid any snags or chances for Democrats to push for 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats in the Senate have blocked a similar Social Security  
``lockbox'' bill, which Republicans say will prevent the money from 
being raided for non-emergency spending or tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. E. Clay Shaw, chairman of the Ways and Means panel on  
Social Security, told reporters that House passage was assured and 
should serve notice that Republicans are serious about working with 
President Clinton and congressional Democrats to ensure the 
program's future solvency. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has got to be a bipartisan effort,'' said Shaw, R-Fla.  
``One party cannot do it alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``lockbox'' proposal would create new legislative hurdles  
for any attempt to use $1.8 trillion in projected surpluses -- out 
of about $2.6 trillion total over the next decade -- for anything 
other than Social Security or Medicare. Both are in jeopardy of 
financial insolvency as the baby boom generation retires. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats heaped scorn on the proposal, which they said  
allows Congress too many loopholes to get at the money. They also 
said that skipping the committees demonstrates that the GOP isn't 
truly interested in Democratic support. 
</P>
<P>
	``They appear more interested in political stunts than actually  
saving Social Security,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, top 
Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Rangel and his fellow Ways and Means Democrats plan to meet  
Thursday afternoon with Clinton at the White House to map out a 
coordinated strategy for Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has outlined a detailed plan to restore the  
program, as have Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer of Texas and 
Shaw, but some GOP leaders say it's doubtful any deal can be 
reached. And House Democrats fear that Clinton might be tempted to 
negotiate with Republicans and leave them on the sidelines, as he 
has done on other high-profile issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to compare notes,'' said Rep. Sander Levin,  
D-Mich. ``We would prefer action if it is positive and appropriate, 
not action for its own sake. We're going to assess where we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said  
House passage of the Social Security ``lockbox'' would increase 
pressure on Democrats to drop their filibuster and that he hoped to 
try to revive the measure in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's being blocked by the Democrats. ... They're going to have  
to explain why,'' Lott told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Storm Victims Re-Establish Identity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOORE, Okla. (AP) -- Authorities issuing new driver's licenses to  
replace those lost in last week's tornadoes are taking a thumbprint 
from victims to make sure the new IDs are given to their rightful 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials are also quizzing people about their personal history  
and asking for other information to ensure impostors don't wind up 
with replacement birth certificates, homeowner's certificates or 
other crucial documents. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's information in that tornado that's been blown all over  
creation,'' state Department of Public Safety examiner Sabra Denton 
said Tuesday, staffing a driver's license office at the First 
Baptist Church in Moore, Okla. ``We're a compassionate outreach 
here, but we're still protecting the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For many victims, the twisters that killed 41 people in Oklahoma  
carried away nearly all of their vital papers. 
</P>
<P>
	In Midwest City, residents who ask for duplicate documents but  
have no ID are given a pop quiz to prove they were homeowners. 
Police records specialist Hazel Hamer takes out a map and asks them 
to point to where their houses once stood. 
</P>
<P>
	``We realize some people have lost everything,'' Hamer said.  
``We just go by the map and we check the utility records to make 
sure the name and address on the bills match the addresses people 
are giving us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Williamson of the state Department of Public Safety has  
processed applications for more than 100 driver's licenses over 
several days at the Moore church. 
</P>
<P>
	People have been offering everything from fishing licenses to  
American Association of Retired Persons membership cards to prove 
their identity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took a guy awhile ago who had his entire criminal booking  
record with his name and address on it,'' Williamson said. ``He got 
his license.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To guard against fraud, Williamson calls up driving histories  
and quizzes applicants about speeding tickets, maiden names or how 
long they have been driving. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone is asked to give a thumbprint, which scares away  
criminals and gives state investigators some key evidence if the 
license is used to commit fraud, Williamson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had some people come into the exam stations who change  
their stories or don't know all the answers,'' he said. ``They 
leave pretty quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa Hess, 24, hid in a cellar while the twisters destroyed  
her two-story Moore home. When she emerged, everything was gone, 
including the file box where she kept all her bank records and her 
two son's birth certificates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have my identification, I don't have my checkbook, I  
don't have my credit card,'' Mrs. Hess said. ``The only thing left 
at my house is the grill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kent and Kellie Taylor were among the lucky ones. Taylor had his  
driver's license in his pocket when he took cover in a closet with 
his children, ages 18 months and 9 years, as the tornado ripped 
away the roof of their three-bedroom home. 
</P>
<P>
	He should be able to quickly replace his marriage license and  
his children's birth certificates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I'm still married to him and I'm not going to let him  
forget that,'' Mrs. Taylor joked Tuesday, as the couple drove 
through the rubble that once was their neighborhood.

<HEADLINE>  MAC Names New Commissioner Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Rick Chryst, who handles marketing for the  
Atlantic Coast Conference, became the new commissioner of the 
Mid-American Conference on Tuesday, nine days after a Big East 
official backed out of the job. 
</P>
<P>
	An assistant commissioner with the ACC, Chryst said during a  
news conference he was unfazed by being the No. 2 pick of the MAC 
university presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm coming in here as excited as if this was a week ago  
Friday,'' Chryst said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom McElroy, senior associate commissioner of the Big East, was  
named to the MAC post on April 30. 
</P>
<P>
	But a couple of days later, McElroy opted out, saying the move  
would create a hardship on his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Chryst said he was convinced McElroy didn't reverse course  
because of some hidden negative about the MAC. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the job is exactly as when I started on this road,''  
applying for the MAC job about two months ago, Chryst said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm anxious to do the job, excited to do the job and proud to  
do the job,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio University president and chair of the MAC Council of  
Presidents Robert Glidden said Chryst's contract is a five-year 
deal at a ``presidential level'' salary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope this will be our last news conference -- at least for a  
month or so,'' Glidden said in a joking reference to the McElroy 
episode. 
</P>
<P>
	Chryst wouldn't go into details about his plans for the MAC,  
which is moving its headquarters from Toledo to Cleveland. But he 
said improving corporate sponsorship and creating workable 
schedules for the 13-school league that ensure opportunities for 
playing national games will be a couple of his priorities.

<HEADLINE> CEO Says Kodak Is Making Revival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Eastman Kodak Co. is climbing back to  
prosperity after ``falling into a deep chasm'' and being forced to 
chop 19,900 jobs last year, chief executive George Fisher told 
shareholders Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot have a year like 1997 again when we fell off the  
map,'' said Fisher, alluding to Kodak's laggard response to price 
wars with Japanese rival Fuji Photo Film Co. that tore into 
revenues and profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak is cutting $1.2 billion in costs and slashing about  
one-fifth of its worldwide payroll of 100,500 through the end of 
this year, moves that Fisher acknowledged had created a 
heavy-hearted climate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have put people through the ringer on restructuring,'' he  
told reporters at Kodak's annual meeting. ``Last year at this time 
our morale ... was the worst since I've been here.'' He joined the 
firm in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too bad that we had to let some people go. But once we've  
done that, people will begin to believe that not only the company's 
future is brighter but their future is brighter. That's the key to 
improving morale. We're working hard on it and I think we're making 
progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not back to where we're driving on all cylinders,''  
interjected Kodak president Dan Karp. But aggressive cost-cutting 
and focusing on innovation is making Kodak more competitive and 
driving growth, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's biggest photography company has seen a sharp rebound  
in sales and profits. Revenues rose 6 percent to $3.1 billion in 
the first quarter of 1999 after falling in eight previous quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak is projecting at least 10 percent annual growth in  
earnings-per-share and an 8-to-12 percent growth in sales annually 
through 2004.

stairwell, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Melvin Montack, 68, of Detroit was scheduled for treatment  
Thursday at St. John Northeast Community Hospital. A hospital

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel To Lower Trident Levels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Discouraged by a long Russian delay on an  
arms-reduction pact, the Senate Armed Services Committee was ready 
to support a plan for reducing the Navy's nuclear-missile sub fleet 
from 18 to 14, congressional officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the Trident submarines now armed with nuclear missiles  
would be refitted for other purposes under the plan expected to win 
the panel's backing as it works behind closed doors on a defense 
spending bill for fiscal 2000, said officials who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, the committee and its chairman, Sen. John Warner,  
R-Va., had resisted efforts to scale back the number of 
nuclear-missile carrying subs without parallel reductions by 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal legislation requires the United States to maintain an  
18-boat Trident force, the level agreed to under the Strategic Arms 
Reduction Treaty with Russia, known as START I. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy's long-range plan is to go to a force of 14  
nuclear-weapons-fitted subs, most likely with seven on each coast. 
But that plan assumed that the Russian parliament would approve the 
successor to START I, known as START II. 
</P>
<P>
	START II was approved by the United States and agreed to by  
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, but has languished before the 
Russian parliament for six years. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent worsening in U.S.-Russian relations caused by NATO  
airstrikes against Yugoslavia has made it even less likely that the 
Russian parliament will vote any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Adm. Jay Johnson, chief of Naval Operations, told the committee  
earlier this year that the Pentagon would like to use four of the 
Trident subs for non-nuclear purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon's views that 14 subs with nuclear weapons would be  
adequate were restated in a recent report to Congress, the 
congressional sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten Tridents are at Kings Bay, Ga., and eight are at Bangor,  
Wash., near Seattle.

<HEADLINE> Patriots Stadium Bill Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The New England Patriots could have a new stadium  
in Foxboro by 2001 under legislation proposed by Massachusetts 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide $70 million for roads, sewers and other  
utilities needed for the stadium, Gov. Paul Cellucci said. 
</P>
<P>
	The stadium is expected to cost $225 million and seat about  
68,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers said the bill could be discussed at a hearing by  
Monday and then passed by both House and Senate on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems as if the end zone is in reasonable sight,'' House  
Speaker Thomas Finneran said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawmakers said they had had no input from Patriots owner  
Robert Kraft on the bill but did work with the NFL on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure they didn't have two of their top guys sitting down  
with us ... for the fun of it. There's a reason why those people 
were there,'' Cellucci said. 
</P>
<P>
	Finneran defended the lack of contact with Kraft.  
</P>
<P>
	``Very rarely do you write legislation in which you ask people  
that might be affected for a complete and total sign off. Here's 
the legislation. If you don't like it, it's a free country you can 
do whatever you want. It's his team,'' Finneran said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patriots spokesman Stacey James had no comment and referred  
questions to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL called the bill an ``important step toward preserving  
the Patriots in Massachusetts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We will study the impact of the proposed legislation and look  
forward to working closely with state officials to resolve any 
remaining issues promptly and cooperatively,'' the league said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the collapse of their deal with Connecticut on April 30,  
the Patriots said they plan to ``stay in Massachusetts for a long 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state will receive $1.4 million per year to help offset the  
cost of the infrastructure improvements: $400,000 from off-site 
parking operators located within three miles of the stadium and $1 
million from the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was much more modest than the $380 million deal offered  
by Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Finneran: ``We all indicated with one voice to league  
officials, `You're not going to do any better. You're just not 
going to do any better in Massachusetts.'''

<HEADLINE> Canucks Sign Top Prospect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The Vancouver Canucks signed  
top prospect Bryan Allen, a defenseman, to a three-year contract 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but it was a  
contract -- with additional incentive clauses -- similar to the NHL 
rookie maximum $975,000-a-year offer that Allen rejected just prior 
to the preseason signing deadline last October. Allen was the 
Canucks' top pick and fourth player selected in last June's NHL 
entry draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bryan is rated as one of the best NHL prospects in the world.  
... '' Canucks president-general manager Brian Burke said. ``He's 
got a mean streak. He's mobile, he's hostile. ... He's going to be 
fine. He would've made the team coming out of training camp last 
year. We're very high on him. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite being hobbled by knee and shoulder injuries, Allen had a  
solid season as captain of the Ontario Hockey League's Oshawa 
Generals. In his third year as a junior, Allen recorded a 
career-high seven goals and 22 points in 37 games. He also played 
for Canada's national junior team which won the silver medal at 
last winter's World Junior Championships.

<HEADLINE> Night Lights May Ruin Kids' Vision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Children who sleep under the soft glow of a night light to keep  
the scary monsters away may be more likely to suffer a very real 
and lifelong problem -- nearsightedness. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and the Children's  
Hospital of Philadelphia say that youngsters who sleep in a dimly 
lighted room until age 2 may be as much as five times more likely 
to develop myopia, or nearsightedness, as they grow up. 
</P>
<P>
	Genetic and environmental factors, such as nutrition and  
eyestrain from television and computer screens, are thought to hurt 
people's vision. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia study raises the provocative new possibility  
that too much light prompts the eyes to grow excessively and skews 
their natural focus during the first two years of life, when the 
eyes develop most rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	The study of 479 children was published in Thursday's issue of  
the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just as the body needs to rest, this suggests that the eyes  
need a period of darkness,'' said ophthalmologist Dr. Graham E. 
Quinn, the study's lead author. 
</P>
<P>
	However, eye specialists from many institutions dismissed the  
study as premature and incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the researchers had failed to take into account  
obvious risk factors, such as heredity. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are other factors involved in childhood myopia, the most  
important of which is whether the parents are nearsighted or not,'' 
said myopia researcher Donald Mutti of the University of California 
at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, they said the study is flawed because the researchers  
relied on information supplied by the parents of nearsighted 
children after several years. Nor did they account for other, 
stronger sources of light that parents cannot control, such as a 
streetlight shining through a bedroom window. 
</P>
<P>
	A more reliable approach would be to conduct controlled  
experiments in the illuminated and darkened bedrooms of children, 
then check their vision several years later, the experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think a retrospective study based on a questionnaire  
is valid,'' said Dr. Robert Cykiert, an ophthalmologist at the New 
York University School of Medicine. ``They're grasping at straws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearsightedness results when the eye grows excessively and its  
shape is too long rather than perfectly round. This causes incoming 
light to converge in front of the retina instead of on it, making 
things blurry. 
</P>
<P>
	About one in four Americans is myopic. Children usually discover  
they are nearsighted when they have trouble seeing the blackboard. 
In most cases, myopia is corrected with glasses. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in life, nearsighted people are more likely to develop  
macular degeneration, detached retinas and other disorders that can 
lead to blindness. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia researchers asked the parents of children who  
had been patients at the doctors' eye clinic to recall the lighting 
conditions in the youngsters' bedrooms between birth and age 2. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 172 of the children slept in darkness; 10 percent  
developed nearsightedness. A total of 232 slept with a night light; 
34 percent had become nearsighted. An additional 75 slept with a 
lamp on; 55 percent developed myopia. 
</P>
<P>
	Quinn acknowledged the study does not conclusively demonstrate  
that low light cause myopia, but he urged parents to provide 
sleeping infants and toddlers with a dark bedroom -- within reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want parents to overreact and start putting up  
blackout shades,'' he said. ``We don't want to think they have to 
change a diaper in the dark, and drop their baby because they can't 
see what they're doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other researchers said parents should wait for the results of  
follow-up research before tossing their night lights in the trash. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutti said: ``Do what is comfortable for your children in order  
to get them to sleep.

<HEADLINE> ValuJet Crash Memorial Dedicated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVERGLADES NATIONAL PARK, Fla. (AP) -- With images of lost loved  
ones in hand, pinned to lapels or printed on T-shirts, about 150 
people attended a dedication ceremony for a memorial to those 
killed when a ValuJet plane crashed into a swamp three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is something very important for people to remember this  
tragedy,'' said Maria Latronico, of Boynton Beach, whose cousin 
Giuseppe Basunno died in the accident. She accompanied an aunt and 
uncle who traveled from Italy for Tuesday's ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	The monument with 110 concrete columns topped by pyramids rests  
on a grassy knoll a few yards from a levee. The columns, set apart 
in rows, represent each victim of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The columns are arranged on a triangular platform that points  
toward the crash site. A center aisle divides the rows, widening as 
the structure rises. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me the design is an allegory, the rise of the victim's  
souls and the fall of the fateful plane,'' said Lee Sawyer, a 
teacher whose parents died in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Chemical oxygen generators ignited in the cargo hold of ValuJet  
Flight 592, sending flames tearing through the floor of the 
passenger cabin. The DC-9 nose-dived into the swamp at 460 mph

<HEADLINE> Nets: Newark Good for State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Faced with three proposals on where the New  
Jersey Nets and Devils will play, Gov. Christie Whitman on 
Wednesday cautioned that an arena with just one team is unlikely to 
have her support. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman's remarks came a day after the Nets said they will move  
from the state-run Meadowlands sports complex to a new arena they 
hope to build in downtown Newark. 
</P>
<P>
	Without offering specifics, the Nets told Whitman and the  
Meadowlands leadership in a letter delivered Tuesday that their 
Newark plan is a good deal for taxpayers because it ``better 
enables the state to capitalize on existing investment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team made no announcement and did not release the letter,  
which was obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press. It was signed 
by one of the owners as well as the franchise's president. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman reiterated Wednesday that her goal is to keep the  
state's five professional teams in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where they stay in New Jersey is secondary to keeping them  
here,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	All now play at Meadowlands venues: The NFL's Giants and Jets,  
and the New York-New Jersey MetroStars of Major League Soccer in 
Giants Stadium; and the NBA's Nets and the NHL's Devils at 
Continental Airlines Arena. The complex also includes the 
Meadowlands race track. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which operates  
the Meadowlands, wants to build a new arena for the Nets and 
Devils. The leases for the Nets and Devils expire in 2007. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets would like both teams to play in Newark, but the Devils  
want to go it alone and build an arena in Hoboken. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman said the proposals are under review, but asserted ``that  
under nobody's scenario for a new arena have we seen finances that 
show it working unless two teams are there. We really need to have 
two teams in any arena that's built.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman said she would be meeting with Devils owner John  
McMullen shortly. She met Tuesday with Nets owners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets plan includes an arena as well as an office building,  
hotel and parking center on 40 acres in downtown Newark, and a 
stadium for the MetroStars. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman said if both the Nets and Devils leave, ``the  
Meadowlands can survive with or without the Continental Arena being 
a sport venue, a sports center.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sports authority and the teams agree the 18-year-old arena  
is outmoded, and cannot be refurbished to provide enough luxury 
boxes and other amenities that make money for teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets' letter provides no indication on when the team would  
leave the complex in East Rutherford. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor does it say whether the Nets have obtained financing for  
their $300 million plan, of which one-third would come from state 
taxpayers for transit improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	Nets president Michael Rowe on Wednesday discussed the  
Nets-Whitman meeting, saying the ownership is willing to be 
partners with the sports authority and the Devils to bring an arena 
to Newark. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll move heaven and earth to attempt to get that done,''  
Rowe said. ``We do not care who owns the arena. It could be the 
city, it could be the county, it could be the Devils.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Nets are ``a bit'' short of the funds needed, having  
secured $200 million so far, noting that figure includes the team 
foregoing some revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Acknowledging that the three competing plans have left ``a  
triangular impasse,'' Rowe stressed the Nets would work for a 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Bateman, chairman of the sports authority, said he doubted a  
single-sport arena is viable. 
</P>
<P>
	``If both franchises were to go to Newark, it could happen. If  
both don't go to Newark, it would not happen,'' Bateman said. ``I 
don't see the state operating or supporting two arenas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McMullen in December 1997 announced he will move his club to a  
hockey-only arena that includes theaters, restaurants and shops he 
plans to build in Hoboken for $270 million, of which just $30 
million would be from the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked Wednesday if he has arranged any financing, McMullen said,  
``I don't believe that's a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the sports authority announced plans for a privately  
financed $212 million arena for basketball and hockey at the 
Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
	The new arena would be next to Giants Stadium, while the  
existing home of the Nets and Devils would be demolished to make 
room for a privately financed, $165 million sports-themed complex.

<HEADLINE> Prospects Slip for Flag Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The decision of two wavering Democratic  
senators to oppose a flag burning ban has dampened the measure's 
prospects after their initial indecision had given the 
constitutional amendment its best chance at approval in years. 
</P>
<P>
	The amendment's supporters had begun to count North Dakota  
Democrats Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad two of the three additional 
Senate votes needed to cross the required two-thirds threshold. 
Instead, Dorgan and Conrad have introduced a long-shot alternative 
that would ban flag desecration in a statute, rather than a 
constitutional amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Senate leaders aim for a floor vote on the amendment  
before Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
	``A number of constitutional scholars have convinced me a  
statute can still be upheld by the Supreme Court,'' said Dorgan. 
The court has twice declared flag-burning laws unconstitutional 
abridgments of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators' decision ``hurts the situation,'' Judiciary  
Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said. ``It makes passage 
less likely.'' But Hatch said the amendment still would be brought 
to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel S. Wheeler, president of the Citizens Flag Alliance, said  
the Dorgan-Conrad pullout did not help the proposal's chances but 
held out the possibility of picking up votes from Democrats still 
undeclared. 
</P>
<P>
	Activists on both sides of the perennial debate said Dorgan and  
Conrad's announcement skirted what they had believed would be the 
amendment's best chance of congressional approval in years. Once an 
amendment obtains two-thirds majorities in both houses of Congress, 
three-fourths of the states -- 38 -- must ratify it before the 
measure becomes a part of the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said they won't give up on a measure they contend  
would provide needed protection of a symbol of American values. 
Opponents, who cheered the announcement by the North Dakota 
senators, insist the amendment would infringe on rights the flag 
symbolizes, such as free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just can't imagine that there is a compelling interest now  
in scaling back even a little on this very grand idea,'' the 
Constitution's Bill of Rights, said Paul Tash, executive editor of 
the St. Petersburg Times and chairman of the freedom of information 
committee of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. ``Based 
upon their announcement, we believe that the amendment will likely 
fail in the Senate, though by a very narrow margin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is a 17-word amendment that would allow Congress to ban  
flag desecration. It has repeatedly attained a two-thirds majority 
in the House but failed in the Senate the last time by three votes 
in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents gained a vote in last year's elections when former  
Ohio Gov. George Voinovich, a Republican amendment supporter, was 
elected to the seat held by retiring Sen. John Glenn, a Democratic 
opponent. They had hoped that Dorgan and Conrad would make up the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the two North Dakota senators are sponsoring the ``Flag  
Protection Act of 1999,'' which they tout as a court 
challenge-proof alternative to amending the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said Dorgan and Conrad's proposal is exactly what the  
constitutional amendment would enable Congress to pass. Without the 
amendment, Hatch said, the courts are likely to strike down any 
statutory version.

<HEADLINE> Police Kill Knife-Wielding Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. CLOUD, Minn. (AP) -- Police shot and killed a man after he  
yanked a bloody knife out of his chest and charged at officers with 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers responded Tuesday night to a call from a neighbor who  
said Kevin Hartwig showed up on his doorstep covered in blood and 
carrying a Bible. The neighbor told police that Hartwig, 33, said 
he had sacrificed his dog and that God made him do it. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartwig then returned to his home. When officers arrived,  
Hartwig came outside with the knife sticking out of his chest. 
Officers believe Hartwig had stabbed himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Police told him to leave the knife in his chest while waiting  
for an ambulance, but he pulled it out and charged ``in a rage,'' 
Capt. Len Smallwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	An officer fired and shot Hartwig in the chest, police said.

<HEADLINE> Monet Painting Auctioned for $12M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A day after a Cezanne still life drew $60.5  
million at auction, prices came down to earth at Sotheby's sale of 
Impressionist and modern art. 
</P>
<P>
	The total for Tuesday's session, which featured two Monets and a  
Degas pastel that didn't find a buyer, was -- at $55.6 million -- 
well under the price for the single Cezanne. 
</P>
<P>
	Monet's ``Haystack,'' an 1891 work that is one of a series, sold  
for $12 million, while ``Waterloo Bridge, Effect of Fog,'' an 
atmospheric London scene painted in 1899-1900, sold for $9.3 
million. The buyers were anonymous, as were the sellers. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 48 lots offered Tuesday, 18 failed to find buyers. Among  
them were a Degas pastel of a ballet dancer, a Toulouse-Lautrec 
portrait of a redheaded woman sitting in a garden and a striking 
Paul Klee painting titled ``Fire Source.'' The auction house had 
estimated that each would sell for between $6 million and $8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Diana Brooks, the president and chief executive officer of  
Sotheby's North America, said she expected several of the unsold 
works would quickly be sold privately. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's single-owner sale of artworks from the estate of  
socialite Betsey Cushing Whitney and her late husband, financier 
John Hay ``Jock'' Whitney, brought in $128.3 million as bidders 
snapped up all 50 of the lots offered. 
</P>
<P>
	The $60.5 million for the Cezanne was a record for the artist  
and the fourth-highest price ever paid for an artwork sold at 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
	All prices include Sotheby's commission of 15 percent of the  
first $50,000 and 10 percent of the rest.

the Daily News in the late 1960s that became a model for workers at 
other newspapers and magazines, said Barry Lipton, president of the 
New York Guild.

<HEADLINE> Seattle Hopes To Keep Vin Baker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle SuperSonics are sitting out the  
playoffs. They want to make sure they don't miss any more. 
</P>
<P>
	With that in mind, the Sonics will try to keep Vin Baker, a  
four-time All-Star power forward who can opt out of his contract 
and become a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want him to be back,'' team president and general manager  
Wally Walker said Wednesday. ``Vin's still not a free agent and he 
has to make a decision. But I think we're all assuming he will opt 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The overweight, out-of-condition Baker didn't expect the NBA  
lockout to end in time for a season to be played. When the lockout 
did end, he wasn't ready. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries caused him to miss 16 games and he averaged 13.8  
points, shot 45 percent from the field and 45 percent from the free 
throw line. For the first five years of his pro career, he averaged 
18.5 points, while shooting 50 percent from the floor and 63 
percent from the line. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the league's new basic agreement, the maximum the Sonics  
can pay Baker is $87 million for seven years. The team sounds 
willing to pay him that amount. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to him at long length yesterday,'' Walker said. ``Vin  
is disappointed in his season and he's a proud guy. He's down 
working out today getting ready for next season and he's going to 
bounce back strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sonics will judge Baker on what he did prior to this season.  
</P>
<P>
	``With Vin, you have to look at what he's done in his career,''  
Walker said. ``We know who he is. We know what kind of guy he is, 
what kind of player he is. He's going to get back to being one of 
the better inside players in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Baker not playing like the Baker of 1998, when he averaged  
19.2 points and the Sonics won 61 games, the team missed the 
playoffs for the first time since 1990, finishing ninth with a 
25-25 record. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker and coach Paul Westphal might be staking their jobs on  
Baker's future although team owner Barry Ackerley has said nothing 
publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, before the playoffs, Ackerley complained he didn't  
have a championship ring under coach George Karl. Despite having 
the best winning percentage of any coach in Seattle's history, Karl 
was fired after 6 1/2 seasons when the team was eliminated by the Los 
Angeles Lakers in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	If Baker stays in Seattle with All-Star point guard Gary Payton,  
who is under contract, the Sonics will have to make decisions on 
center Olden Polynice and forward Detlef Schrempf, who will become 
free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been speculation that the Sonics won't invite Polynice  
to return, but hope to bring back Schrempf in a reduced role.

<HEADLINE> Penguins Lead, Unhappy With Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Here's a surprise: The Pittsburgh Penguins,  
the lowest-seeded team in the Eastern Conference playoffs, are 
halfway home to playing for the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's another surprise: They don't act like it.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite a comeback 4-3 victory Tuesday over the Toronto Maple  
Leafs that gave the Penguins a 2-1 lead in their second-round 
series, the mood at Wednesday's practice was decidedly businesslike 
and serious. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it's because the Penguins sense they can't play Game 4  
Thursday at the Civic Arena like they did Game 3, when they 
admittedly were lucky to win amid a succession of mental mistakes, 
defensive lapses and disputed calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Kevin Constantine wouldn't even let his players talk to  
reporters following the optional practice, rushing them into a 
meeting room to watch, on video tape, the error of their ways. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, after a few players filtered back into the locker room,  
including star Jaromir Jagr, they were recalled for yet another 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Hey, who's ahead in this series?  
</P>
<P>
	Don't tell them, but the Penguins have won six playoff games  
this spring -- three more than the last two seasons combined -- and 
would unexpectedly reach the Stanley Cup finals by winning six 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played bad and we won,'' Jagr said. ``It was a strange  
game. I didn't know until we looked at the video that we played 
that bad. (Goaltender) Tom Barrasso really saved the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barrasso and a guy named Jagr, who was relatively pain-free for  
the first time since injuring his groin in the first game of the 
Penguins' first-round series against New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr had the tying goal in the third period and two assists and,  
for the first time in the series, the NHL scoring champion seemed 
to skate with most of his normal acceleration, power and 
maneuverability. 
</P>
<P>
	He also felt more confident after working on his shooting --  
specifically, his release and the angle of his shots -- on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way I was shooting before, I didn't have good wood on  
it,'' he said. ``I'm getting better now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So is his groin, a development he credits to an acupuncture  
treatment. He said he felt no pain within 20-25 minutes after 
undergoing the therapy Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	And if the NHL's most dynamic scorer and playmaker is feeling  
better about his game, the Maple Leafs must feel worse about their 
chances of rebounding in a series they could trail 3-1 before they 
return home for Game 5 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not just that they let defensemen Kevin Hatcher, Bobby  
Dollas and Jiri Slegr score three of the Penguins' four goals. It's 
also that goaltender Curtis Joseph, almost impenetrable while 
allowing just 12 goals in eight previous playoff games this spring, 
permitted goals on two of the Penguins' three shots in the third 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	``They made a couple of good shots to tie it and win it,''  
Joseph said. ``They were perfect shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One not-so-perfect shot, too -- Kevin Hatcher's second-period  
goal that was disputed by the Maple Leafs. There was a five-minute 
delay as the goal was reviewed, and Maple Leafs general manager Ken 
Dryden spent 45 minutes after the game debating the call. 
</P>
<P>
	But a super slow-motion replay shown by ESPN, not visible to  
reporters who were watching a different TV feed, showed the puck 
crossing the goal line alongside the near post before Joseph could 
snatch it back. 
</P>
<P>
	Dryden, as unhappy as he was, did not blame the loss on what  
coach Pat Quinn called a ``phantom goal,'' saying, ``We blew it 
ourselves in the third period by losing our poise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Maple Leafs also might be feeling the pressure of toting the  
entire weight of Canada's hockey world on their shoulders. They are 
the only Canadian team left playing in their country's national 
sport but, with two more losses, they will be gone, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played pretty well for most of the game,'' forward Kris  
King said. ``But if you have a couple of lapses, a team like this 
is going to capitalize.''

<HEADLINE> New Fall TV Schedules on the Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It happens next week, in the midst of May sweeps  
and season finales. 
</P>
<P>
	It's four days of pageantry, promises and good cheer from the  
major broadcast networks. It's television's grandest whoop-de-do. 
</P>
<P>
	But it isn't on television, and you can't see it. That, dear  
viewer, is because it isn't meant for you. 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't meant for TV writers, either, even though the networks  
kindly grant us admission to the glorious venues -- say, Carnegie 
Hall (where CBS will do its thing) or Lincoln Center's Avery Fisher 
Hall (home of the New York Philharmonic, where NBC will make 
beautiful music). 
</P>
<P>
	No, the networks' so-called ``upfront'' presentations are staged  
for a most exclusive and indispensable audience. For commercial 
TV's true constituency. For advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	But never fear, you won't be forgotten for a moment. Conspicuous  
in your absence, you will be foremost on everybody's mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Let's think of TV as a lake. Viewers are the fish.The  
advertisers bring the poles and the hooks. Networks have the bait -- 
their programming -- which, for a price, advertisers use to land 
your attention. 
</P>
<P>
	So what programming will hook you?  
</P>
<P>
	``Ours,'' each network will trumpet next week when, with fitting  
fanfare, it unveils its fall lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Loud, throbbing music! Smiling, live-and-in-person stars!  
Persuasive statistics! Rhapsodic network bosses! 
</P>
<P>
	Just flash back to last year:  
</P>
<P>
	``We're optimistic,'' piped UPN's boss.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're comfortable with who we are, we're excited about where  
we're going,'' trilled the CBS boss. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time ever, our upper-income skew surpassed one  
of the Big Four!,'' boomed the WB boss. And an ABC boss crowed 
about his own network's demographics, the sort of audience ``CBS 
longingly refers to as `them rich, smart city folks'.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the networks plan to say this year, here is when  
they'll say it: NBC on Monday; ABC and the WB on Tuesday; CBS on 
Wednesday; Fox and UPN on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago at the CBS upfront, a scarcely known comic  
headlining a new fall sitcom tickled advertisers by bidding them 
farewell. ``This is going to be my last year on the show,'' Ray 
Romano disclosed. ``We said it all in the pilot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now finishing his third hit season in ``Everybody Loves  
Raymond,'' Romano will be back next fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Other series sure to be renewed include ``ER,'' ``60 Minutes,''  
``NYPD Blue'' and ``X-Files.'' Duh. 
</P>
<P>
	But until each network makes its schedule official, other shows  
are left dangling. Will CBS' ``Diagnosis Murder'' get a reprieve? 
What about NBC's ``NewsRadio'' and ``Homicide: Life on the 
Street''? 
</P>
<P>
	And what about new series?  
</P>
<P>
	Some of those picks have already been made, or are all but  
certain. Expect a ``Law &AMP; Order'' spinoff about sex crimes on NBC, 
and a new Chris Carter thriller, ``Harsh Realm,'' on Fox. Chances 
are excellent for David E. Kelley's drama ``Snoops'' on ABC, and 
for a ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' spinoff on the WB. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, don't count on a new sitcom about a madcap team of TV  
execs trying to save their network from extinction -- although, with 
broadcasting's continued loss of viewers to its cable rivals, such 
a show might have the ring of truth. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as the TV landscape changes before all our eyes, there's a  
notable flurry of business-as-usual at the major networks. For 
instance, consider how program development conforms to an annual 
cycle (spring commitments, fall premieres) that no longer applies 
when new shows are launched all season long. 
</P>
<P>
	Producers call this system wasteful and burdensome. (Imagine  
making everyone renew drivers' licenses on the same day, instead of 
staggering the deadlines throughout the year.) Yet in lock step 
each January, the networks continue to order pilots by the dozens, 
all of which must be produced during the same frantic stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, around the first of May, they are dumped on network execs  
for their frenzied assessment lasting little more than a fortnight. 
It concludes next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Until then, producers and stars of prospective series (most of  
which you'll never know were ever in the running) sit and wait. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, when a series gets picked up for the schedule, the  
battle has only just begun. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, NBC proudly announced ``Encore! Encore!,'' starring  
film and Broadway favorite Nathan Lane. CBS welcomed romantic drama 
``To Have &AMP; To Hold,'' and Fox hailed sitcom newcomer Sue Costello. 
</P>
<P>
	Remember?  
</P>
<P>
	No?  
</P>
<P>
	See?  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	COSBY COMES TO DINNER: When Jordan Paladino finished his first  
appearance on ``Kids Say the Darndest Things'' earlier this season, 
he said good-bye to host Bill Cosby and invited him home to dinner. 
Now Cosby takes the youngster up on that offer and enjoys a 
home-cooked meal at the Paladino house on Friday's edition of 
``Kids,'' airing at 8 p.m. EDT on CBS. This episode also features a 
panel of two young boys and one girl from the Boston area 
discussing with Cosby what their parents do for a living and what 
they want to be when they grow up. One boy's career plan? To be 
King of the Jungle.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Mostly Up; Flat Vs. Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar was flat against the Japanese yen  
Wednesday after nearly recouping losses caused by the turmoil 
surrounding the resignation of Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose against the euro and other major currencies as  
the U.S. currency became a safe haven after Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin fired Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, damaging immediate 
prospects for peace in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0653 in late trading in New York, down  
from $1.0715 late Tuesday. The dollar edged lower to 120.95 
Japanese yen from 120.97 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rallied Wednesday morning as interest rates rose,  
giving traders reason to buy bonds and dollars, then weakened after 
the announcement that Rubin was leaving the Clinton administration. 
Rubin is widely considered the architect of the Clinton 
administration strategy that has helped the eight-year Wall Street 
boom. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had the enormous amount of volatility on Rubin's  
resignation and then that gave way to a dollar selloff, which 
negated the earlier dollar rally,'' said Dan Bernzweig, a foreign 
exchange trader at Bank Leumi USA. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrials fell as much as 213 points on the news  
before recovering to finish down about 27 points at the close. Bond 
prices fell before rising in the late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The market recovery was helped by news that Rubin's deputy,  
Lawrence Summers, would be nominated to replace the departing 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	``The expectation is that Summers will be a nice replacement,''  
Bernzweig said. ``Although Rubin has done a very good job, (his 
leaving) is not going to damage the U.S. dollar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro lost its fight Wednesday against the dollar  
as Yeltsin dumped his prime minister and Cabinet for the third time 
in a bit more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin also announced that Russia would halt its attempted  
mediation of the Kosovo crisis if its proposals were not heeded. 
NATO has been bombing Yugoslavia since late March. Europe is 
expected to bear the brunt of rebuilding the area once hostilities 
stop; the euro is the new currency of 11 European nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good efforts toward peace, which gave stability and  
strength to the euro, are now more remote,'' Bernzweig said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5056 Swiss francs,  
up from 1.5016, and 1.4592 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4530. The 
British pound fell to $1.6176 from $1.6234. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the euro's exchange rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8359  
German marks, up from 1.8255; 6.1576 French francs, up from 6.1237; 
and 1,818.18 Italian lire, up from 1,808.32.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Accuser Passed Lie Detector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After her initial lie detector test was  
inconclusive, a second FBI test found Kathleen Willey was truthful 
when she alleged that President Clinton made a sexual advance, 
according to newly released documents. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge unsealed the 1998 lie detector results this week  
after news organizations, including The Associated Press, went to 
court to challenge the secrecy surrounding them. 
</P>
<P>
	In a three-page report, an FBI polygraph unit chief, James K.  
Murphy, noted that a Sept. 9, 1998, lie detector test ``which 
focused on President Clinton's alleged behavior'' regarding Mrs. 
Willey was ``inconclusive.'' The first test was administered by the 
FBI in Richmond, Va., near Mrs. Willey's home. 
</P>
<P>
	In a second test six days later at the FBI polygraph unit in  
Washington, Mrs. Willey was asked, ``In November 1993 did the 
president place his hand on your breast?'' and ``Did President 
Clinton place your hand on his groin?'' Both times, Mrs. Willey 
answered ``yes,'' the FBI summary stated. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the opinion of this examiner that Ms. Willey was  
truthful'' when responding to those two questions, the FBI report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The polygraph questions did not address the issue of whether  
Clinton's alleged advance against Mrs. Willey was unwanted. Mrs. 
Willey says she rebuffed his alleged advance. Clinton denies making 
any sexual advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey was the chief prosecution witness for Independent  
Counsel Kenneth Starr's office in last week's obstruction trial of 
Julie Hiatt Steele, whose testimony conflicted with Mrs. Willey's 
account. The jury deadlocked in Ms. Steele's trial in Alexandria, 
Va. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Wednesday night on CNN's ``Larry King Live,''  
Mrs. Willey said ``I'd like to see'' the case ``retried.'' Of her 
testimony last week, she said, ``I've done it once. I guess I could 
do it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of her one-time friend Ms. Steele, Mrs. Willey said, ``I think  
she did try to obstruct justice'' by telling Starr's investigators 
a story that contradicted part of Mrs. Willey's account. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey failed one part of the first lie detector test  
relevant to that trial, regarding whether she provided details of 
the alleged incident to her friend Ms. Steele. 
</P>
<P>
	On the question of whether Mrs. Willey told her friend details  
of the encounter, ``physiological responses were noted,'' the 
examiner said, using language suggesting that Mrs. Willey was being 
deceptive. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI report noted that the polygraph examiner in Richmond  
questioned Mrs. Willey about her response in the first test. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ms. Willey explained during the post-polygraph interview that  
she was unsure as to exactly when she went to Julie Steele's 
residence and was relying on a refreshed recollection provided by 
Ms. Steele some time later,'' the FBI summary stated. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second test six days later, Mrs. Willey passed when she  
answered ``yes'' in response to two similar questions: 
</P>
<P>
	--''Before 1997 did you tell Julie Steele that the president came  
on to you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	--''In 1993 did you tell Julie Steele about an encounter with the  
president in his office?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI test concluded that ``it is the opinion of this examiner  
that Ms. Willey was again truthful when responding to the above 
listed questions during this test'' about Ms. Steele. 
</P>
<P>
	In the FBI report released by U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton,  
a third set of polygraph questions is blacked out because of an 
``ongoing investigation'' by Starr's office, the judge states in a 
court order. In that third series of questions, Mrs. Willey was 
also found to be ``truthful,'' the FBI report states. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI report noted that ``Ms. Willey has provided  
investigators with information concerning conversations she alleges 
to have had with Maryland developer and Democratic Party 
contributor Nathan Landow during which Landow ``is said to have 
suggested how she should testify in the Paula Jones suit'' against 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton released the lie detector results after he was directed  
by the federal appeals court in Richmond to reconsider his decision 
to keep certain documents in the Steele case secret.

<HEADLINE> Gun Control Skirmish in Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate debate over how to stop kids from  
killing is turning into a legislative shootout over gun control in 
the aftermath of the Columbine High School massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know ultimately it's going to devolve into a gun fight,''  
the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, 
told reporters Tuesday as the Senate took up a $5 billion measure 
designed to crack down on violent juvenile crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and Democrats readied a raft of amendments to the  
bill, which Hatch introduced long before the April 20 killings in 
Littleton, Colo. On a 54-44 vote, the Senate today rejected an 
amendment by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., that would have provided 
more money for youth violence prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House and many Democrats hope the Littleton violence  
will add impetus to their gun-control efforts, such as tightening 
restrictions on sales at gun shows and increasing the age for 
handgun possession from 18 to 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said that toughening penalties for gun violations by  
minors would act as a deterrent. Other Republicans, pointing to 
statistics showing a sharp decline in prosecutions for gun-related 
crimes, said enforcing current laws would be deterrent enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``Passing a law sounds good, but to really maximize our impact  
... we've got to prosecute the laws we've got,'' said Sen. Jeff 
Sessions, R-Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats said the guns themselves are too easily available  
to kids and advocated more than a half-dozen amendments that would 
make firearms tougher for the wrong people to acquire and use. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without guns, families in Littleton, Colo., would not be  
grieving, and 15 people would be alive today,'' Sen. Edward 
Kennedy, D-Mass, told the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch's bill would devote $1 billion annually for five years,  
including: 
</P>
<P>
	--$435 million for prevention programs.  
</P>
<P>
	--$450 million to states and localities to build detention  
centers, perform drug testing and improve record-keeping for young 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	--$75 million for grants to states to upgrade juvenile felony  
criminal record-keeping and to make those records available to a 
national database. 
</P>
<P>
	--$40 million for research of the effectiveness of juvenile  
delinquency prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and Democrats embraced the bill's provision to ban  
firearm ownership by those who committed a serious violent felony 
as juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Hatch's bill, children 14 and older could be prosecuted  
under federal laws as adults for serious violent felonies and drug 
offenses. If convicted, these teens would be required to serve the 
maximum sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican and Democratic aides said Senate passage of a  
provision to place gun shows under the law requiring an instant 
background check on anyone purchasing a gun at a licensed dealer 
was possible by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Republican sources speaking on condition of  
anonymity said GOP leaders were confident they had enough votes to 
block efforts to reinstitute a three-day waiting period for handgun 
purchases or to limit gun sales to one per month, as some Democrats 
want. Less clear was the outcome of any vote on the proposed 
increase in the age for handgun possession to 21. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, the Judiciary Committee chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde,  
R-Ill., opens hearings Thursday into the cultural causes of 
violence among kids, with some emphasis expected to be placed on 
violence in entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise in the Senate, GOP leaders have insisted that tougher  
gun laws wouldn't have prevented the tragedy in Littleton. Two 
students, Republicans say, violated 19 existing laws in their zeal 
to murder their classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have focused heavily on the role Hollywood plays in  
the minds of children. During the Senate's weekly GOP policy lunch 
on Tuesday, senators were shown clips of ``The Basketball 
Diaries,'' a movie in which a student mows down his classmates 
while his friends laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican senators planned their own amendments to Hatch's bill  
with this theme in mind. One GOP amendment to be considered before 
the gun debate opens, for example, would require the Federal Trade 
Commission to study Hollywood's marketing of violent movies to 
kids. Another would prohibit making violent movies on federal 
lands.

<HEADLINE> UAW Leader Critical of 'Dead' Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- United Auto Workers president Stephen P. Yokich  
called a major manufacturing proposal by General Motors Corp. a 
``dead'' issue today in pending national contract talks, and said 
its chief advocate at GM should be fired. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute over modular assembly may be a precursor to what  
could be contentious negotiations between GM and the UAW later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Modular assembly, which GM is promoting as a way to drastically  
cut its manufacturing costs, would allow the auto giant to use 
fewer UAW workers and rely more on independent suppliers to put 
together major parts clusters, or modules. 
</P>
<P>
	During a briefing with reporters, Yokich and vice president  
Richard Shoemaker harshly criticized GM's small-car manufacturing 
chief, Mark Hogan, for comments he made about the company's modular 
assembly plans at a manufacturing conference Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hogan reported that GM had selected the suppliers for 15 major  
parts modules that will be used for its next generation of small 
cars. He made it clear that GM was moving ahead with plans to build 
modular plants in Lansing and Lordstown, Ohio, even though it 
expected UAW opposition to delay its progress. 
</P>
<P>
	To the secretive UAW, Hogan's public statements were an insult.  
Yokich is loath to discuss negotiating positions and issues in the 
press, and expects automakers to be equally circumspect. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they should fire Mark Hogan, quite frankly, because he  
just can't keep his mouth shut,'' Yokich said. ``If they can't fire 
him, they should put a muzzle on him. I hope he understands that, 
because he is not helping General Motors or the UAW when it comes 
to these negotiations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yokich, who described modular assembly as an attack on job  
security, implied after the briefing that the union won't give in 
to GM on the issue. He noted comments in March by GM president G. 
Richard Wagoner Jr. that modular assembly was not the only way to 
cut manufacturing costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the issue's dead,'' Yokich said. ``I don't think it's  
going to be a big issue in negotiations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM said Hogan was unavailable for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	But GM spokesman Edd Snyder noted that Hogan also told the  
manufacturing conference that ``there is a positive role for the 
union in helping us work with our supply chain'' and that both 
sides were ``making progress toward a mutually beneficial 
solution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The triennial negotiations are scheduled to begin with the  
ceremonial handshakes June 14 at Ford Motor Co., June 15 with the 
Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler AG, and June 16 at GM. The talks 
do not typically move into high gear before late August; the 
current pacts expire Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Yokich insisted each company has ``serious issues'' to  
resolve with the UAW, most of the attention will be on GM's efforts 
to improve its long-contentious relationship with the union. 
</P>
<P>
	GM and the UAW also will have to sort out the employment terms  
for thousands of UAW workers at Delphi Automotive Systems Corp., 
the big parts maker that GM plans to spin off later this month. The 
UAW, which opposes the spinoff, expects Delphi workers will remain 
under GM's national agreement when the talks are completed, 
Shoemaker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yokich said job security will again be the major issue in the  
pending talks with all three automakers. The UAW has watched its 
ranks among the U.S. automakers steadily decline in the past decade 
as the automakers have become leaner and more efficient. At the 
same time, the union has failed to organize newer plants opened by 
Japanese and German automakers.

	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Chris Antley is back on top of the racing  
world, and the jockey who rode Charismatic to victory in the 
Kentucky Derby hopes to stay there for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been hectic,'' Antley said, ``but I'm enjoying every  
minute of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past two decades, Antley has enjoyed unrivaled success,  
but he's also endured failures that nearly wrecked his career 
several times. 
</P>
<P>
	Antley rode nine winners in one day in 1987, went 64 consecutive  
days with at least one victory in 1989, and now has two Derby wins 
-- Strike the Gold in 1991 was the first. On Saturday, he'll go for 
his first Preakness victory, which would then set up a Triple Crown 
chance in the Belmont Stakes June 5. 
</P>
<P>
	There were the lows, too: Drug, alcohol and weight problems, as  
well as bouts of depression. The 33-year-old Antley overcame each 
setback, but the latest was the toughest: He kept gaining weight, 
the easiest way for a jockey to put himself out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	He left racing in September 1997, and returned to his father's  
home in South Carolina. Antley tried everything he could to lose 
weight -- diet, exercise, pills, sitting in a hot box. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd go from cycle to cycle,'' Antley, who once weighed 147  
pounds, said. ``I'd go to Lasix (a diuretic) until it about killed 
me, then I would try to flip (self-induced vomiting) for a while 
until that bothered me. I never maintained anything properly. Maybe 
I wasn't able to make that strong commitment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, even though his father, Les, had encouraged him to find  
another job, the combination of running in the mornings and a 
strict non-carbohydrate diet began to work. Off went the pounds, 
the depressing days ended, and Antley was back on track. At least 
that was the plan when he returned to California. 
</P>
<P>
	``He showed up in February, came by the barn every day, and said  
`What can I do?' '' trainer D. Wayne Lukas, who trains Charismatic, 
said. ``We had nothing for him, because our work schedules are set 
early. But I knew he was trying very hard to get his career back on 
target.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Antley, now weighing about 114 pounds, traveled to the Fair  
Grounds in New Orleans to ride the Lukas-trained Mountain Range in 
the Risen Star Stakes. Lukas appreciated the favor. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before the April 10 Lexington Stakes at Keeneland, a race  
in which Charismatic would win and clinch his spot in the Derby, 
the trainer met Antley in the tunnel at Santa Anita Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said I'm going to run a nice horse in Lexington, and you're  
my choice to ride him (in the Derby), but I want you to watch 
him,'' Lukas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Antley remembered the conversation, and thought, ``Wouldn't it  
just be neat if I could ride in it?'' Then he called his father, 
telling him: ``I'm going to the Derby!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas said he chose Antley on a hunch.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Antley was a fit, thought he was hungry,'' Lukas  
said. ``He'd won a Derby, he's a great finisher, and he's very 
confident. He has a great coolness about him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Antley said winning the Derby had a different meaning the second  
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look back at Strike the Gold's race and my thoughts  
afterward seemed more of a blur,'' Antley said. ``Things went by 
fast, I had mixed emotions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Charismatic, at 31-1, approached the finish line at  
Churchill Downs on the first Saturday in May, Antley believed he 
had finally put his racing life back together. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember approaching the wire vividly, and I remember the  
warm feeling,'' Antley said. ``It wasn't a feeling of up and down 
joy. I felt a warm feeling, like finally things had come together. 
And I felt like a kid who's been out running around and his mother 
finally grabs him, and he felt safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Antley is safe from the drug and alcohol woes that got  
him suspended twice in 1988 and from the depression that plagued 
him throughout his weight woes. 
</P>
<P>
	Drew Mollica, Antley's agent on two occasions -- in the mid- and  
late 1980s, and for seven months in '97, calls Antley ``the Roy 
Hobbs of racing, a natural.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll make a nervous horse calm; a calm horse pumped up, a  
slow horse a fighter and he doesn't know how to check (briefly hold 
back),'' Mollica said. ``He's fearless, he's true-grit squared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he could regain the form that allowed him to ride a  
North American-leading 469 winners in 1985, Mollica replied: ``If 
he ever puts 100 percent focus into it, he'll have his statue put 
up next to Secretariat -- he's that good.''

<HEADLINE> Bobby Jones Beats Bobby Jones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Baseball is keeping up with the Joneses.  
</P>
<P>
	For the first time this century, starting pitchers with the same  
first and last names faced each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Jones of the Rockies pitched against Bobby Jones of the  
New York Mets on Tuesday night in a game Colorado won 8-5 at Coors 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very cool,'' said Rockies reliever Jerry Dipoto, a  
baseball historian of sorts. ``It's cool because obviously it 
happens once a millennium. Catch it while you can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The clash of the Joneses was the first matchup of same-name  
starters since Cincinnati's John B. Taylor met Chicago's John W. 
Taylor on April 16, 1899. 
</P>
<P>
	George H. Bradley of Boston and George W. Bradley of St. Louis  
started against each other twice in 1876 -- the National League's 
first season. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from their name and ability to throw a baseball, Bobby  
Mitchell Jones and Bobby Joseph Jones have little in common. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby M. is a feisty left-hander from New Jersey; Bobby J. is a  
laid-back right-hander from California. Bobby J. is 
broad-shouldered; Bobby M. is built more like a wiry point guard. 
</P>
<P>
	One is trying to make a name for himself with the Rockies. The  
other is a fixture in the Mets' starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great guy,'' New York's Jones said of his opponent.  
``He did compliment me and said I was the Bobby Jones that people 
referred to. I think it's just that I've been around longer than he 
has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More important than beating his namesake Tuesday, Bobby M.  
backed his claim that he belongs in Colorado's starting rotation. 
He was promoted from the bullpen after Jamey Wright was sent to 
Triple-A last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not here to prove anyone wrong,'' Jones (1-1) said. ``I  
know what I can do, and what I can do is keep this team in every 
game, pretty much. I can give this team a chance to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones gave up two runs -- one earned -- and four hits in five-plus  
innings. He walked two and struck out five before leaving after the 
Mets closed to 5-2 in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's Jones (3-1) was still in the game at that point, but  
had another disappointing start at Coors Field. He gave up eight 
runs and 10 hits in 5 1-3 innings. The eight earned runs matched a 
career-high. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care for pitching here. I'll be the first one to tell  
you that,'' said Bobby J., who has a 9.25 ERA in five starts in 
Denver. ``I'm a guy who relies on movement. You have to change your 
release point because pitches don't break like they do anywhere 
else. It makes it difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies and Mets play seven more games against each other  
this season. If Bobby M. can keep his spot with Colorado and both 
players remain healthy, there is a chance for a Jones vs. Jones 
sequel. 
</P>
<P>
	``When both ended up in the National League, at some point,  
you'd guess it was going to happen,'' Dipoto said. ``It's a neat 
thing, something that they can always remember.''

<HEADLINE> Sears To Unveil Appliance Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. is launching the  
largest-ever Web site for selling appliances online, hoping to use 
its name and muscle as the nation's largest department store to 
generate business and boost moribund sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Making good on a promise made in February, the retailer is  
attempting its largest foray to date into the growing e-commerce 
business by selling 2,000 major brands and models of everything 
from refrigerators to stoves to washers over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Customers are jazzed about the amount of control the Internet  
affords them -- for both research and buying,'' said Alice M. 
Peterson, vice president and general manager of Sears Online. ``In 
essence, they're time-starved and want us to make life simpler for 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning Thursday, the site -- www.Sears.com -- will allow users  
to search for a particular color, brand or size of appliance, check 
within a price range and determine if a pictured item is on sale. 
It also will link to a section on Craftsman tools, which have been 
previously available on the site. 
</P>
<P>
	The downside, however, is that the site does not provide  
independent ranking of products, relying instead on side-by-side 
comparisons. Customers who buy from Sears online also must pay the 
applicable state sales tax, a federal requirement -- which other 
online sites do not have -- because the retailer operates in all 50 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears' site is four times the size of the next largest  
competitor, ValueAmerica.com, and the retailer hopes to use its 
national presence to offer delivery within 24 to 48 hours of an 
online sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The potential for profit is enormous. Forrester Research Inc. of  
Cambridge, Mass., estimates that by 2003 about 6 percent of all 
appliances will be sold online. And the market for such big-ticket 
items will be $38 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts have expressed skepticism that Sears will see a  
large increase in sales from Internet shopping since many consumers 
like to examine the product firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
	But Peterson said focus group studies and other research found  
many consumers want to do preliminary fact-finding on a big-ticket 
item before going into the store. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that many more purchases currently are influenced by  
the Internet than are actually consummated,'' she said. ``But this 
gives consumers the choices they want and helps bring them into our 
stores to open the doors and turn the knobs on their final 
selections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An in-house study also found that Sears customers who did buy  
off the Internet made 27 percent more purchases in-store over the 
ensuing six-month period than customers who did not, Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	That could prove beneficial to the Hoffman Estates, Ill.-based  
company. Sears' sales have been bolstered recently by continued 
strong sales of big-ticket items and interest income from its 
store-owned credit card, while sales of clothing have flagged in 
the face of stiff competition from specialty and discount 
retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears is hoping to revitalize sluggish store sales with new  
lines of clothing and in-store displays aimed at younger audiences, 
price cuts of up to 15 percent on certain clothes and the 
introduction of dinnerware, flatware, gardening and other 
housewares. 
</P>
<P>
	The retailer also hopes to begin offering online electronics and  
other items in coming months, executives said.

<HEADLINE> Bucks Face Early Out in Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Despite trailing 0-2 in a best-of-5 series,  
Milwaukee Bucks coach George Karl is concentrating on the 
positives. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest negative turned into a positive was Tuesday night's  
108-107 overtime loss to the Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though we lost, I thought we gained some ground with our  
confidence. We respect them, we don't fear them, and we know we're 
going to have to play a good basketball game to beat them,'' Karl 
said after the Bucks practiced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're tired of losing to them, too,'' Karl added.  
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers are just one game away from winning the first-round  
series heading into Thursday night's game in Milwaukee. A Bucks 
victory would force Game 4 in Milwaukee on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing different than any other game,'' he said.  
``Every game is one game. We've got a game tomorrow and it's one 
game. And when we win it tomorrow, there will be one, too. It's a 
simple process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucks' nail-biting loss Tuesday night was a big improvement  
over their 110-88 loss Sunday in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers' Reggie Miller scored 30 points, but was 9-for-25  
from the field. So far in the series, Miller is 13-of-40 overall 
and 5-of-23 on 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what playoff basketball is all about,'' Miller said  
after Tuesday night's game. ``The intensity, the pressure, the big 
plays. And when you think a team is out of it, they come right back 
in it. Milwaukee really showed a lot of heart and guts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucks can expect the Pacers to play even harder Thursday,  
Indiana coach Larry Bird said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we'll play better,'' Bird said. ``We've got our hands  
full. They're going to shoot the ball better as the series goes on, 
and their young guys are going to keep gaining confidence. 
Hopefully, we'll go in there with the attitude to win the game and 
move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lead changed hands nine times Tuesday night as Milwaukee  
rallied from a 13-point first-half deficit and a six-point deficit 
in the final 36 seconds of regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've done a tremendous job of keeping the ball out of the  
post,'' said Rik Smits of the Pacers, who has been limited to 14 
points in two games. ``A lot of the time, they front me, then 
double-team when the ball gets in there. I try to take what I can 
get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the strong defense and Ray Allen's 25 points were not enough  
to give the Bucks a win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we all hung heads,'' Allen said. ``We talked about it  
today, about feeling the pain and agony of defeat. It's something 
that you have inside your heart that you never want. 
</P>
<P>
	``But when we go through those bad times, it makes us a great  
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After playing two games in the deafening Market Square Arena,  
the Bucks are looking forward to playing on their home court. 
</P>
<P>
	``The series isn't over,'' said Bucks forward Glenn Robinson.  
``They won at home, now they have to come to our home. I have plans 
to go back to Indiana.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucks are making their first playoff appearance since 1991.  
Their last playoff victory was in 1990, during a first-round series 
with Chicago.

<HEADLINE> NBC Changes Cargo in Miniseries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It's still dangerous. It's just not THAT  
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC is making a significant cargo change for its miniseries  
``Atomic Train,'' which begins this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The drama was being hastily edited to replace references to  
nuclear waste with the phrase ``hazardous waste,'' network 
spokeswoman Rebecca Marks said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The title will remain the same.  
</P>
<P>
	``Atomic Train,'' about a runaway Idaho-to-Denver train carrying  
a nuclear weapon and, originally, nuclear waste, did not accurately 
depict safeguards used in connection with such waste, Ms. Marks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although it (the miniseries) is fictitious, rather than be  
inaccurate about the transporting of material we decided to change 
the nature of the material,'' she said. Nuclear waste is moved in 
casks that are not shown in the film. 
</P>
<P>
	A tacked-on disclaimer will tell viewers the miniseries is not  
based on fact and that NBC does not ``suggest or imply in any way 
that these events could actually occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to change the film was strictly internal and no NBC  
executive had been contacted by any nuclear industry representative 
requesting changes, Ms. Marks said. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC itself has a relative in the business. General Electric, the  
network's parent company, includes the GE Nuclear Energy unit, 
which supplies parts and services for reactors. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Atomic Train,'' which stars Rob Lowe and airs Sunday and  
Monday, the wayward train crashes west of Denver. Fire detonates a 
Russian nuclear weapon placed on board by a disposal company 
contracted by the government to dispose of such weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	In reality, nuclear weapons are always transported by truck and  
are disarmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the network said it acted independently, the miniseries  
hasn't escaped criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no way something like this could happen,'' Energy  
Department spokesman Derek Scammell said. ``It is just not 
feasible. With all due respect to Hollywood, this is going to be a 
typical Hollywood movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to NBC, the president of the Idaho chapter of the  
Health Physics Society, which specializes in radiation safety, 
called the movie's premise wrong and asked NBC to add a disclaimer 
similar to that eventually adopted by the network. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuclear Energy Institute, which represents utilities with  
nuclear power plants, issued a ``containment strategy'' for 
reaction to the film. 
</P>
<P>
	The April 27 memo suggested an ``aggressive effort'' to provide  
industry employees, state regulators and elected officials with 
information to field any questions raised about transportation 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., a prominent opponent of nuclear  
waste transportation, said the film in its original version had an 
important message: Such waste represents a disaster waiting to 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are 50 million people in 43 states, living within a mile  
or less from nuclear shipment routes,'' Bryan said. ``I keep 
telling people, this is nuclear waste that would be laid at your 
doorstep.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Agrees on $11.6B for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional negotiators agreed Wednesday to  
provide $11.6 billion for the air assault on Yugoslavia and to 
boost overall defense spending, nearly doubling the amount 
President Clinton requested. 
</P>
<P>
	But the bill's fate began to seem questionable when bargaining  
that ran until nearly 1 a.m. in an otherwise empty Capitol saw 
testy negotiators approve amendments either opposed by the White 
House or likely to rankle other lawmakers. Negotiators agreed to 
meet again on Thursday amid fading hopes of sending the package to 
Clinton by week's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers' demands for favored items were so insistent that they  
drove an exasperated GOP Rep. Bill Young of Florida, chairman of 
the House Appropriations Committee and a 29-year House member, to 
say, ``I'm practicing for my next career, and that is refereeing in 
the World Wrestling Federation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The provisions legislators were trying -- and in some cases  
succeeding -- in adding to the package also drew the ire of the 
White House, which has already threatened to veto the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've warned them not to load up this legislation'' with added  
language, said Linda Ricci, spokeswoman for the White House budget 
office. She also said Congress should avoid ``harmful cuts in other 
programs'' to pay for parts of the package. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the agreed-upon measures opposed by the White House would  
prohibit the federal government from laying claim to any of the 
$246 billion from settlements that states have reached with the 
tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest chunk of the bill -- and the item with the strongest  
political appeal -- was the money for U.S. participation in NATO's 
bombing of Yugoslavia. Though lawmakers are divided over the wisdom 
of the attacks, even many opponents are reluctant to oppose funds 
for the troops in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do believe that this war was started frivolously and pursued  
incompetently,'' said Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash. ``But I do believe 
we've got to pay for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To the $6 billion Clinton sought for the confrontation over  
Kosovo, House-Senate bargainers agreed to add $1.8 billion for a 
troop pay raise that would begin in January; $2.5 billion for 
military operations and maintenance of equipment; $819 million to 
help Kosovo's refugees and the Balkan states sheltering them; plus 
additional funds to replace depleted bombs, purchase other weapons 
and recruit. 
</P>
<P>
	The bargainers also agreed to pare $1 billion the House approved  
to modernize overseas military bases to $475 million, and to 
provide $200 million for the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	The compromise also would include nearly $1 billion for recent  
natural disasters in the Caribbean, mostly to help Honduras, Costa 
Rica, El Salvador and Nicaragua rebound from last autumn's 
devastating Hurricane Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	There is also $100 million for Jordan; $566 million to help  
American farmers struggling because of badly sagging commodities 
prices; and $900 million for the costs of the recent tornadoes in 
the Midwest and for a cushion for future disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiators worked into the evening, attempting to heed orders  
by House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott, R-Miss., to complete their bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said bargainers had accepted  
her Senate-approved proposal to continue a moratorium through 
September against new Energy Department rules that would force oil 
and gas producers using federal lands to pay higher royalties to 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., won his attempt to delay the Interior  
Department from implementing stricter cleanup requirements for 
mining companies using federal lands. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, participants said bargainers would allow the  
government to spend up to $4.3 million more for reparations to 
people of Japanese descent who were deported or placed in camps 
during World War II, and who missed an earlier round of federal 
reparation payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., dropped an effort to prevent the  
Interior Department from setting aside stretches of the Rio Grande 
River to protect the endangered silvery minnow. 
</P>
<P>
	Bargainers accepted a Senate-passed provision by Hutchison to  
keep the federal government's hands off the tobacco settlements. 
They also accepted another by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., to provide 
$140 million to back $1 billion worth of loans for some small steel 
companies facing competition from low-priced imports. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar measure by Domenici to provide $125 million for $500  
million in loans to oil and gas companies was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas GOP Sens. Pat Roberts and Sam Brownback were denied a  
provision to forgive more than $200 million in interest and 
penalties owed by the state's natural gas producers who were ruled 
to have overcharged customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska's Republican Senate duo, Frank Murkowski and Senate  
Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, made a lengthy plea 
to block the National Park Service from phasing out commercial and 
subsistence fishing in Glacier Bay National Park. They accepted a 
compromise involving fishing restrictions in some areas and a $26 
million buyout for fish processors and others.

<HEADLINE> N.M. Suspect May Have Killed More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOCORRO, N.M. (AP) -- The girlfriend of a man charged with  
sexually torturing three women told police he may have killed as 
many as 14 people and buried their bodies in ravines and arroyos. 
</P>
<P>
	The information, which came in an interview with Cynthia Lea  
Hendy soon after her arrest, was released Wednesday by Deputy 
District Attorney Jim Yontz. 
</P>
<P>
	Hendy, 39, told police David Parker Ray, her boyfriend and  
co-defendant, disposed of the bodies in eastern New Mexico's Sierra 
County. 
</P>
<P>
	Details from Hendy's interview could explain why law enforcement  
officials mounted a massive effort after a woman, bleeding and 
wearing only a padlocked collar, fled Ray's mobile home in Elephant 
Butte on March 22. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 100 agents from the FBI and state police investigated  
the case in the first few weeks, following leads in 10 states and 
using ground-penetrating radar and dogs trained to locate human 
remains. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents combed arroyos in Sierra County and searched Elephant  
Butte Lake for bodies and other evidence. No bodies have been 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray's attorney, Jeff Rein, said Hendy's allegations came after  
she had worked out a deal with prosecutors that reduced both the 
number of charges she faced and her potential prison sentence -- 
from 198 years to as few as 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``She told them what they wanted to hear,'' Rein said. ``I think  
if they would have found any bodies after 45 days, we would have 
seen some charges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray, 59 faces 25 charges involving two women who accused him and  
Hendy of kidnapping and sexual torture. He waived a preliminary 
hearing on 12 additional charges related to a third woman who says 
she was kidnapped by Ray and his daughter Glenda Jean ``Jesse'' 
Ray, 32, in July 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Ray and his daughter have say they are innocent.

<HEADLINE> Sixers Seek Answer to Iverson Rules  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- He juked and dribbled and tried to find the  
slightest seam in the defense, attacking double-teams with his 
acrobatic moves. More often than not, it ended with Allen Iverson 
landing on the floor with a thud. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Daly, on a mission to stop the high-scoring Iverson,  
delved into his formidable memory bank and searched for a scheme 
that might help. He found it in a dusty old folder bearing a 
familiar name. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan.  
</P>
<P>
	A little retro-strategy by an old master has spiced up this  
first-round series between Daly's Orlando Magic and the 
Philadelphia 76ers. In Game 3 Thursday night in Philadelphia, the 
76ers will have to come up with an answer for Daly's latest 
masterpiece -- the ``Iverson Rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If we come out like we came out in Game 2, no one can beat  
us,'' said Orlando's Horace Grant, teeming with confidence after 
the Magic hounded, hammered and battered Iverson and held him to 13 
points in a 79-68 victory Tuesday night. ``We came out playing that 
tough-nosed defense that Chuck taught in Detroit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic tied the series at 1-1 with the same kind of physical  
play that helped Daly's ``Bad Boy'' Pistons twice defeat Jordan's 
Chicago Bulls on the way to NBA championships. Those tactics, which 
came to be known as the ``Jordan Rules,'' meant simply this: 
Wherever Jordan went, whether he had the ball or not, he would be 
greeted by numerous defenders, with arms and elbows flailing. 
</P>
<P>
	And a good pop under the chin, like the one Matt Harpring  
delivered to Iverson early in Game 2, is worth an occasional 
whistle as long as the message is sent. 
</P>
<P>
	That it was. On Wednesday, the Sixers said they got it -- loud  
and clear -- and promised retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to protect him,'' Sixers coach Larry Brown said of  
Iverson. ``I don't know if it's like hockey, but I guess it is. ... 
If they're going to hit him, we're going to hit them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly's Pistons got past Jordan's Bulls in 1988, '89 and '90 and  
went on to win two NBA titles. They frustrated His Airness with a 
physical battering that set the tone in playoff basketball for a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of rules have changed because of our physical play,''  
said Rick Mahorn, the baddest of the Bad Boys who now plays a 
reserve role with the Sixers. ``New York tried to implement it in 
their system a few years back where there was a no-layup rule. It's 
not a plan of having a massacre, but just playing hard within the 
rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson said he felt fine the day after his crash course in what  
Mahorn calls ``Bad Boy-ism.'' His only complaint was slight pain 
from a few jammed fingers -- the result of breaking so many falls. 
</P>
<P>
	Clutched in those fingers as he left practice was the videotape  
from Game 2, which Iverson took home to study. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think all of it was just good physical play that they were  
giving me,'' Iverson said. ``I guess they were trying to send me a 
message.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After losing homecourt advantage with a 104-90 loss in Game 1,  
the Magic took exception to Iverson's challenge to Penny Hardaway. 
Iverson exclaimed, ``Bring it on!'' when Hardaway announced his 
intentions to guard the NBA scoring champion one-on-one. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not enough you can say about the guy because he brings  
it,'' Orlando's Nick Anderson said. ``He told us to bring it, and 
we brought it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson downplayed his exchange with Hardaway, instead calling  
on his teammates to protect him Thursday night in Philadelphia's 
first home playoff game since they lost in the second round to the 
Bulls in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be crazy for me to go out there and give guys blows,  
because they probably wouldn't feel them anyway,'' said Iverson, 
who is 6 feet and weighs 165 pounds. ``But it's important for our 
big men to try to send a message to those guys and give their 
guards some shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mahorn, who has played only four minutes in the series, has  
never been afraid of trading shots with anyone. He loyally carried 
out Daly's orders in Detroit, and stands ready to enter the fray 
against his old coach on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just like coaches adapt to what they have, players adapt to  
what they need to get done,'' said Mahorn, grinning ever so 
slightly. ``If it comes time for me to get out there, then I'm 
going to use it wisely.''

<HEADLINE> Trinidad To Fight Hugo Pineda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Felix ``Tito'' Trinidad will fight  
Hugo Pineda on May 29. To listen to promoter Don King, you would 
think it was somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tito is going to destroy Oscar De La Hoya! Give me Oscar De La  
Hoya or give me death!'' King gushed Wednesday during a news 
conference called ostensibly to promote Trinidad's mandatory 
defense of his IBF welterweight title against Pineda. The venue is 
Trinidad's native Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya, the Californian with the WBC belt, is King's idea of  
a perfect match for Trinidad, and the promoter made it clear he 
wants to pursue a proposed Sept. 18 bout between the two. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we should take any other'' opponent, King said.  
</P>
<P>
	To keep fans' eyes on the prize, King is billing the Pineda  
fight as Trinidad's ``March to Destiny'' -- that destiny being De La 
Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, King admitted, the Pineda bout is a fight he never  
wanted. Vince Pettway, Trinidad's scheduled opponent, canceled 
because of an eye injury, and IBF rules forced King to replace him 
with Pineda, the second-ranked challenger, instead of Raul Frank, a 
boxer from his own stable. 
</P>
<P>
	Pineda has 36 victories, one loss and one draw with 27  
knockouts, but most of his bouts have been in his native Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad admitted he knows nothing about the fighter.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're going to get me some videotapes of him  
today,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad, 34-0 with 29 knockouts, defeated Pernell Whitaker in  
12 rounds at Madison Square Garden in New York City on Feb. 20. He 
said he planned to use what he learned fighting against the 
left-handed Whitaker against Pineda, another left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
	A more attractive opponent would be Ike Quartey, who lost a  
furious bout to De La Hoya by a split decision in February. But 
King accused Quartey's managers of avoiding a match with Trinidad 
in the hope of a De La Hoya rematch. 
</P>
<P>
	``They know they can get more money from a fight with De La  
Hoya,'' King said. ``That's why I want Oscar. The whole shebang is 
ours if we knock out Oscar De La Hoya.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There had been speculation that King might avoid putting  
Trinidad in such a high-stakes fight so soon after his other star, 
Evander Holyfield, narrowly avoided losing his heavyweight crown to 
Lennox Lewis with a controversial draw March 13. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, King's contract with the Showtime cable television  
channel and De La Hoya's contract with the HBO cable channel might 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	But with a Holyfield-Lewis rematch in the works for November,  
King said he had no qualms about putting Trinidad in the ring. And 
he said the HBO-Showtime issue was negotiable -- ``It's not a 
problem because I can handle it, I can handle it,'' King said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad's father and manager was more cautious, interrupting  
King twice during the news conference to warn he was unhappy with 
the $10 million offer from De La Hoya's promoter, Bob Arum. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Tito) has to be well paid,'' Felix Trinidad Sr. said. ``We  
have to defend the value of this great champion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King and Trinidad's father have clashed before, and in November  
the fighter lost a legal battle to sever his contract with the 
promoter. That lawsuit cost Trinidad a scheduled fight with 
Quartey. 
</P>
<P>
	Pineda turned pro at age 20 in 1991 and fought as a super  
featherweight before winning the WBA's Latin America super 
lightweight title in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	He lost a challenge for the IBF crown to Russian-born Konsta  
Tszyu in 1995 before moving up to welterweight and winning nine 
fights in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	The May 29 Trinidad-Pineda match at San Juan's Roberto Clemente  
Coliseum will share the card with a WBA featherweight fight between 
titlist Antonio Cermeno and former champion Fred Norwood. 
</P>
<P>
	The Norwood-Cermeno fight is a rematch of an April 3, 1998  
fight, also in Puerto Rico, that Cermeno lost by a decision.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft, Sony Make Music Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Sony Music Entertainment will begin selling music  
and videos online as well as in stores, marking the recording 
industry's latest attempt to cash in on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony Music's partnership with Microsoft Corp. is the latest in a  
flurry of deals as music publishers scramble to balance their 
desire for getting a piece of the exploding online music market 
with their fears of copyright piracy on the wide-open world of the 
Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers will be able to download music singles beginning this  
summer, when Microsoft's Windows Media 4.0 software becomes 
available, the companies said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement followed last week's disclosure by Universal  
Music Group, the world's largest music company, of a partnership 
with InterTrust Technologies Corp. to develop a system to let 
customers download music to their computers in a secure format that 
prevents mass copying. 
</P>
<P>
	``The CD is headed the way of the vinyl record,'' said analyst  
Mark Hardie of Forrest Research Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., who 
forecast a transition into ``something even more convenient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry has been on the album for about 40 years, and  
it's getting set to move off of that single-product orientation. 
It's going to take a lot of effort and will likely cause a great 
deal of pain, but it's going to happen,'' Hardie said. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance is expected to result in wider distribution and  
promotion for Sony and Microsoft's products, executives of both 
companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any opportunity for the consumer to purchase music in the  
physical or the virtual world should hopefully expand the market as 
a whole,'' Fred Ehrlich, Sony senior vice president and general 
manager for New Technology and Business Development. ``We know 
there is a demand out there for digital music right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Music singles will be priced at about the same cost as buying  
one in a store, Ehrlich said. The exact price will be set when the 
singles are ready to be released, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He emphasized that Sony no intention of circumventing retailers,  
who will be able to offer the digital singles through their own Web 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardie predicted that record stores were unlikely to disappear,  
but said their offerings were likely to evolve as technology 
develops. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brick-and-mortar retailers are going to have to figure out how  
to participate in digital delivery,'' he said. ``I expect they will 
pretty soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A three-minute song will take about five minutes to download  
using a 28.8 modem and Microsoft's Windows Media, said Will Poole, 
senior director of marketing and business development in 
Microsoft's streaming media division. It will take up just 1 1/2 
megabytes of space on a personal computer, compared with 10 
megabytes for the same amount of uncompressed audio, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new version of Windows Media will meet standards of the  
Secure Digital Music Initiative, which is designed to protect 
copyrights and ensure secure online transactions, Poole said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's one of the next frontiers for the industry as  
people talk about the convergence of the media and computer 
industries,'' said Microsoft's president, Steve Ballmer. ``To have 
the opportunity to work with a major company like Sony is very 
exciting for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Security has been a big obstacle for the music industry.  
</P>
<P>
	New technologies such as MP3, which gives near-CD quality to  
music downloaded from the Internet, have created a huge traffic in 
pirated music. Anyone with easily obtainable software and equipment 
can record music from a CD onto a computer and then give it away to 
millions of people by posting it on a Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 3, a day before Universal's announcement, RealNetworks,  
the Seattle-based maker of Internet audio and video software, 
unveiled plans for RealJukebox, a product designed to make it 
easier to download and play music on a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Ron Rappaport, of Zona Research in Redwood City, Calif.,  
wasn't surprised by the developments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a domino effect. Once one mover falls, the  
rest will follow,'' Rappaport said. ``Now they're in a position 
where they have to move and move fast, else their competition eats 
their lunch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sony Music Entertainment, headquartered in New York, has a  
catalog of more than 500,000 sound and video recordings, including 
artists such as Mariah Carey, Will Smith, Celine Dion and Ricky 
Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlich declined to say how many singles Sony sells annually,  
nor what percentage the company would offer digitally. 
</P>
<P>
	He emphasized that the deal was not exclusive, and Sony would  
continue to participate in a project with BMG Entertainment, EMI 
Recorded Music, Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group to 
offer entire albums online. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, based in Redmond, is the world's largest computer  
software publisher.

<HEADLINE> Salinger Love Letters To Be Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The woman who hides nothing -- writer Joyce  
Maynard -- is selling letters she received from the man who hides 
everything -- reclusive author J.D. Salinger. 
</P>
<P>
	The letters, to be auctioned at Sotheby's, are considered  
documents of the rarest sort from an author who has shunned 
publicity, sued to protect his privacy, and has not published 
anything in 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
	They are expected to sell for $60,000 to $80,000.  
</P>
<P>
	The 14 letters were written in 1972-73 when Salinger, author of  
``The Catcher in the Rye,'' had an affair with Ms. Maynard. He was 
53; she was 18 and dropped out of Yale University to live in the 
Cornish, N.H., house where he still resides. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Ms. Maynard published ``At Home in the World,'' in  
which she detailed her relationship with Salinger. 
</P>
<P>
	``My decision to sell these letters is not some kind of act of  
retribution against Salinger,'' she said Wednesday. ``It's a 
financial decision. I'd rather put my efforts to supporting my 
three children than to have a box of Salinger letters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Maynard, who is divorced, has a 21-year-old daughter in  
college and two teen-age sons. 
</P>
<P>
	Salinger initiated the correspondence after reading an article  
Ms. Maynard wrote for The New York Times Magazine in 1972 called 
``An 18-Year-Old Looks Back on Life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He praised the article and later provided a phone number. The  
first letters were signed ``Sincerely, J.D. Salinger''; later, they 
ended, ``Love, Jerry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salinger successfully sued to stop a biographer from quoting  
other letters he wrote, so Sotheby's is guarding the content of 
these. The catalogue description quotes only two or three words 
from the letters. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsha Malinowski, Sotheby's manuscript expert, described the  
correspondence as ``love letters -- that couldn't be more clear -- 
from a gentleman quite taken with an 18-year-old writer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letters also illuminate Salinger's obsession for privacy.  
``He warns her of the impending fame, to be careful of what happens 
when you go in front of the public eye,'' Ms. Malinowski said. 
</P>
<P>
	His topics range from movies and TV -- he liked Hitchcock and ``I  
Love Lucy'' -- to his writing routines and taking his children to 
sporting events. At one point, he wrote of feeling depressed and 
drained after socializing. 
</P>
<P>
	The correspondence stopped after Ms. Maynard moved in. The last  
note, sent after they split up, coldly answers her questions about 
homeopathic medicine, and states that her letter is just one in a 
pile he is answering. He signs off, ``It's late, kiddo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salinger cannot stop Ms. Maynard from selling the letters, which  
are to be auctioned June 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Salinger's agent, Phyllis Westberg, had no comment. His lawyer,  
Andrew Boose, did not return a call. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Maynard, who has written extensively about her life,  
including her divorce, her kids and her physical appearance, said 
she has no qualms about bringing attention to a man who doesn't 
want it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've made a very different life decision than the one Jerry  
Salinger made years ago,'' she said. ``I'm not uncomfortable 
talking about my experiences and my feelings. Neither do I feel 
someone else's decision to be private and secretive obligates me to 
live the same way.''

<HEADLINE> House OKs Bill Limiting Y2K Lawsuits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Wednesday to limit  
millennium-bug lawsuits -- a measure that businesses say is needed 
to avoid a year-2000 financial catastrophe. The White House sees it 
as slanted against consumers and deserving of a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, approved 236-190, would try to stem a potential  
flood of lawsuits arising from computer breakdowns by establishing 
a 90-day waiting period before suits can be filed, encouraging 
mediation, capping punitive damages and limiting class action 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reality today is that unbridled Y2K litigation is  
jeopardizing coordination and teamwork'' to fix computer problems, 
said Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., one of the chief sponsors of the 
bill. ``This adversarial mentality hampers private sector efforts 
to solve Y2K problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill has the strong backing of business groups and the high  
tech industry, which warn that problems arising from computers that 
misread the 2000 date could result in hundreds of billions of 
dollars in lawsuits, crippling the economy and undermining efforts 
to fix faulty computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Litigation could arise from computer glitches if businesses find  
they can't process credit cards and customer information records or 
lose money because of supply or power disruptions. Consumers might 
sue if there are problems in medical equipment or their access to 
prescription drugs. Backers of the legislation say they are only 
trying to stop frivolous, not legitimate claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a laser shot that goes after a problem that exists  
once every thousand years,'' said the bill's chief sponsor, Rep. 
Tom Davis, R-Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of  
Manufacturers, says the litigation bill has become a key vote by 
which the group will rate lawmakers' support for American 
businesses. ``It would be an entirely avoidable catastrophe if 
Congress didn't pass this bill and ended up swamping the economy in 
a tidal wave of litigation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the White House says President Clinton's senior advisers  
would urge him to veto the House bill in its present form because 
it goes too far in limiting the legal rights of those with 
legitimate complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, it said, ``may, in fact, decrease the incentives  
organizations have to assist customers and business partners to be 
ready for the transition to the next century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But two senior White House officials, presidential aide Bruce  
Lindsey and National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling, also 
wrote a letter to House Speaker Dennis Hastert on Tuesday stressing 
that they want to get a bill passed and outlining possible areas of 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, they wrote, wants to see the bill limited to  
commercial claims, exempting consumers. But they showed some 
flexibility on the issue of ``proportionate ability.'' Supporters 
want defendants to be liable only for their share of any damage, 
reducing the tendency of plaintiffs to go after companies with deep 
pockets. Consumer groups argue this would work to the disadvantage 
of lower income plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration has realized this is a train moving down  
the tracks,'' said Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``This will be one of the biggest 
accomplishments of the whole Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate is considering a bill that has been amended to meet  
some of the concerns of the administration. However, that bill was 
pulled from the Senate floor two weeks ago after the Republican 
leadership blocked a Democratic attempt to add extraneous issues, 
including a minimum wage hike, to the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, the current Senate bill, backed by Sens. John  
McCain, R-Ariz., Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., 
would exempt consumers and small businesses from punitive damage 
caps. It also does not have House language that gives defendants a 
``reasonable effort'' defense and limits the liability of corporate 
directors and officers to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House supported a House Democratic version that also  
has a 90-day cooling off period and limits plaintiffs from 
asserting claims for economic damages that are not covered by 
contract. But that bill took out the ``reasonable efforts'' 
defense, the punitive damage caps and officer caps. It lost on a 
largely partisan vote, 236-190. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to do something, but we don't need to take steps that  
will dismantle key protections for consumers and small 
businesses,'' Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri said. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 775.

<HEADLINE> Foods Giant ConAgra To Cut Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- In its second major restructuring move in  
three years, foods giant ConAgra Inc. plans to cut 7,000 jobs and 
close at least 15 production plants. 
</P>
<P>
	ConAgra said Wednesday it wants to reduce expenses and  
concentrate on selling its major food brands and other products. 
</P>
<P>
	Its 80 independent operating companies need to work more closely  
together, sharing sales tasks and buying products from each other, 
the Omaha-based company said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of our businesses can legitimately claim best-in-industry  
status, but others have significant room for improvement,'' said 
Bruce Rohde, chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst David Nelson of CS First Boston said the company had not  
grown much in the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a company that's having some problems and it's using this  
to strengthen'' its operations, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
	ConAgra, whose brands include Healthy Choice, La Choy and  
Butterball, also will close at least 70 storage, distribution and 
smaller processing facilities and shed about 20 small non-core 
businesses. Specific plant and business closings will not be 
identified until employees are notified, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the job cuts, including about 4,000 to be announced by  
May 30, will take place in the next few months, with others coming 
more than a year away, spokeswoman Lynn Phares said. The majority 
of workers probably will be laid off while others might find new 
jobs within the company, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort announced Wednesday is broader than a 1996  
restructuring that eliminated 6,300 jobs and overhauled 29 plants, 
because it involves the way ConAgra's businesses work together, Ms. 
Phares said. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling the restructuring plan ``Operation Overdrive,'' the  
company also wants to meet its long-standing goal of annual 14 
percent per share revenue growth. Last year, per share revenue grew 
1.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves will mean a pretax charge of $810 million over the  
next three years, starting with $420 million in fiscal year 1999's 
fourth quarter ending May 30, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	ConAgra, which owns businesses ranging from flour milling to  
frozen foods, said it wants to focus on more efficiently selling 
all its products, including beef and prepared foods to restaurants 
and its branded foods in grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fair to say this is a company-wide effort,'' Ms. Phares  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also will invest about $200 million and create new  
jobs over the next two years to get full value from its 
consolidation, Rohde said. 
</P>
<P>
	ConAgra employs 83,000 people at about 250 production plants and  
1,150 total locations. Its net income last year was $613.2 million, 
compared with $615 million the year before.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche Excellent Away From Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- For the Avalanche, the good news is they're right  
back in their series with Detroit. The bad news is they still must 
win in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche improved to 4-0 on the road during the playoffs  
with a 5-3 victory last night over Detroit. The Red Wings still 
lead the second-round series 2-1, but Colorado can pull even with a 
win Thursday in Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	And no matter what happens in Game 4, the series definitely  
returns to Colorado for a fifth game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche are just 1-4 at McNichols Arena, which will be  
replaced by the Pepsi Center next fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado center Dale Hunter can't figure out why his team is so  
much better on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had an answer, we'd bottle it and take it home with us,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even during the season, the Avalanche were slightly better on  
the road. They were 23-14-4 when traveling, 21-14-6 when in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit forward Wendel Clark, one of four key players the Red  
Wings picked up at the March 23 trading deadline, thinks some teams 
are more patient away from home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, in the playoffs, most teams are playing good -- if  
not better -- on the road than they are at home, anyway,'' Clark 
said. ``It's not just one team. I think it's the playoffs in 
general.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After scoring twice in the first period of Game 1 against  
Detroit, the Avalanche failed to score again for the next 122 
minutes, 44 seconds. Along the way, Detroit won the first game 3-2 
in overtime and took a 4-0 win in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	But all that frustration ended when Colorado had a two-man  
advantage and Claude Lemieux banged home a goal 11:00 into the 
first period Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Game 1, we played a good game,'' Colorado coach Bob Hartley  
said. ``The Red Wings got the final shot. I don't think we have to 
waste any energy on Game 2. It was a bad effort. We all know it. 
We've moved on. We were able to flush it from our system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It helped, too, that Bill Ranford, the backup Detroit  
goaltender, was suddenly coming unglued. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranford, the 1990 NHL playoff MVP with Edmonton, was starting  
his third straight game in goal in place of Chris Osgood, who is 
out with a sprained right knee. But the Avalanche scored on five of 
their first 23 shots and Ranford was replaced by Norm Maracle. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Wings coach Scotty Bowman most likely will start Ranford in  
Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's up to Scotty,'' Ranford said. ``I've been taking this  
day to day. I'm not getting caught up in that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings, seeking their third straight Stanley Cup  
championship, had won 11 straight playoff games -- including the 
last five last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, suddenly, they don't seem so invincible. And they certainly  
don't relish the prospect of wiping out whatever edge they had by 
winning the first two games. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is always pressure,'' Clark said. ``That's part of it  
and that's the exciting part of playoff hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't get to the second round and not expect to meet a  
good team to play against. Just because they were down 0-2, they 
weren't going to roll over and die. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is too much character and too many good players over in  
that dressing room to do that. We know we're in for a fight to win 
this series.''

<HEADLINE> Reds Option Boone To Minors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Cincinnati Reds optioned third baseman  
Aaron Boone to Triple-A Indianapolis following their 8-7 loss to 
Milwaukee on Wednesday night and called up left-handed reliever Ron 
Villone. 
</P>
<P>
	Boone was hitting only .218, but had a six-game hitting streak  
when demoted. He's been replaced at third by Mark Lewis, who has 
gone 3-for-15 in the last eight games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds decided to call up Villone, who was 2-0 with a 1.42 ERA  
in 18 relief appearances for Indianapolis, to add an 11th pitcher 
and give manager Jack McKeon a third left-hander in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds could have lost Villone if they didn't call him up by  
Saturday. A clause in his contract allowed him to choose free 
agency if he wasn't promoted by that date. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Reds are overloaded on outfielders, most of them  
don't have options left. That left Boone susceptible to demotion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, he'll go down and pick himself up again,'' McKeon  
said. ``He'll go down and play every day. Maybe that's what he 
needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he thinks he's struggling at the plate, Boone said, ``I  
don't know. I haven't played in a few days. I feel like I'm on the 
verge. I'm not locked in, but I feel like I'm close. I'm just going 
to go out and try to get in a groove and hope I'll be back real 
soon.''

<HEADLINE> IBM, Nintendo Team for New System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nintendo is enlisting help from IBM and the  
consumer electronics giant Matsushita to create the technology for 
its next-generation video game player, which will be packed with 
greater computing power to deliver crisper and more animated 
graphics. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Wednesday follows similar deals among other  
game makers in recent months as the industry moves toward adding 
more functions to game players such as Internet hookups and 
improved sound. 
</P>
<P>
	``The gaming machine is no longer going to be just a gaming  
machine,'' said Ryan Brock, an analyst at Access Media 
International in New York. ``Nintendo and others are creating 
platforms that will allow Internet access, information to be stored 
and maybe even word processing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new game player, called Dolphin, is expected to go on sale  
worldwide at the end of 2000 in time for the Christmas shopping 
season. The price was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	It will supersede the current top-of-the-line game player from  
the Japanese company, the Nintendo 64. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new alliance, IBM will make a custom computer chip for  
Nintendo's new console based on its PowerPC processor, which is 
currently used to power Apple's Macintosh computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The pact between IBM and Nintendo is valued at about $1 billion.  
The companies also plan to explore the use of IBM technology in 
other Nintendo products as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Matsushita, the world's largest maker of consumer  
electronics with brands such as Panasonic and Quasar, will make 
digital video disc drives for the new Nintendo game machine. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies did not release the financial terms of Nintendo's  
arrangement with Matsushita. 
</P>
<P>
	The DVD format is new for Nintendo, which has used specialized  
cartridges in previous versions of its game players. The 
cartridges, which are more expensive than CD-ROMs or DVDs, were a 
major reason why many game developers have abandoned Nintendo in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony Corp. uses CD-ROMs in its current PlayStation system. Its  
next-generation PlayStation will use DVDs. 
</P>
<P>
	Nintendo's alliance with IBM and Matsushita mark the latest  
example of a gaming company linking with technology firms to build 
a high-powered video system. Sony is aligned with Toshiba Corp. and 
Sega Enterprises Ltd. is working with Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Nintendo became the last of the three major video-game companies  
to unveil plans for its next generation system. Sega already 
released its new Dreamcast player in Japan and plans a U.S. launch 
in September, while Sony is expected to release its PlayStation II 
in Japan this year and in the United States by Christmas 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	All three are vying for a piece of the $6 billion video game  
player market. Sony currently accounts for about 60 percent of the 
U.S. market for video game machines with its PlayStation system, 
while Nintendo holds more than 30 percent with its Nintendo 64 
player. Sega has less than 5 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Deports Man for Nazi Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Indiana man who admitted serving in a  
Nazi-sponsored killing battalion during World War II left the 
United States permanently Wednesday for Lithuania, the Justice 
Department announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazys Ciurinskas, 81, who lived in Crown Point, Ind., left the  
country Wednesday afternoon by plane from Chicago, the department 
said. On April 15, U.S. Immigration Judge Anthony Petrone in 
Chicago had ordered Ciurinskas removed from this country based on 
his admitted participation in acts of Nazi-sponsored persecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Eli M. Rosenbaum, director of the department's Nazi-hunting  
Office of Special Investigations, said the removal order was part 
of a settlement agreement in which Ciurinskas admitted he was an 
armed member of the 2nd Lithuanian Schutzmannschaft (Protective 
Detachment) Battalion and concealed that service when he applied 
for a visa to enter the United States in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
	Ciurinskas also conceded he was subject to removal under a  
provision of U.S. law that requires removal of any alien who 
assisted Nazi persecution, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
	After a trial, a federal judge in Indiana revoked Ciurinskas'  
naturalized U.S. citizenship in 1997 because of his service in the 
2nd Battalion. The court noted that the battalion assisted the 
Nazis in 10 killing actions in Lithuania and Byelorussia, now 
Belarus, that murdered more than 19,000 Jewish men, women and 
children in the fall of 1941. The court concluded that Ciurinskas 
participated in at least one such action. 
</P>
<P>
	Ciurinskas is one of several members of the 2nd Battalion that  
the special investigations office has ousted from this country. Two 
other members of the 2nd Battalion have been ordered deported to 
Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
	Juozas Naujalis was ordered removed by the immigration court in  
Chicago in 1997, but is appealing his case to the U.S. Board of 
Immigration Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 2nd Battalion member, Antanas Mineikis of Gulfport,  
Fla., was deported to Lithuania in 1992 after admitting he drove 
multiple truckloads of civilian victims to mass shooting sites and 
observed their murders. ``I saw women and children shot,'' Mineikis 
admitted in a sworn statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Rosenbaum criticized Lithuania for dragging  
its feet in prosecuting two other major Nazi-collaborators that his 
office pursued in this country. Rosenbaum said then that the U.S. 
government has evidence that 91-year-old Aleksandras Lileikis had 
been feigning illness to avoid trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Lileikis, who lived for 40 years in Norwood, Mass., outside  
Boston, is accused of executing Jews for the Nazis while serving as 
head of security police in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius during 
the German occupation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenbaum's office got a U.S. District Court to revoke Lileikis'  
naturalized U.S. citizenship in 1996 and was moving to deport him 
when he returned to Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
	A Lithuanian medical panel also has said that 91-year-old Kazys  
Gimzauskas, who was Lileikis' wartime deputy, is too ill to stand 
trial. Gimzauskas fled to Lithuania from his home in St. 
Petersburg, Fla., in 1993. He, too, was stripped of his naturalized 
U.S. citizenship in a proceeding begun by Rosenbaum's office. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials said Wednesday that the Lithuanian trials of  
Lileikis and Gimzauskas remain stalled. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2nd battalion's killings in Lithuania and Byelorussia were  
``calculated and unspeakably brutal,'' Rosenbaum said. Captured 
wartime documents show the fall 1941 killing spree ``repulsed even 
the Nazis,'' Rosenbaum added.

<HEADLINE> Passage of Hate Crimes Bill Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A woman whose son died after a beating  
inflicted partly because he was gay says a bill extending civil 
rights protections to homosexuals may spare other families similar 
suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	The death last fall of Matthew Shepard, 21, a University of  
Wyoming college student, became a rallying point for gays 
nationwide who are seeking state and federal legislation to protect 
them from discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	An emotional Judy Shepard delivered the message to a Senate  
committee Tuesday as she described the late-night telephone call 
that informed her and her husband that their son had lapsed into a 
coma after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	While conceding the bill is not a ``cure-all,'' she said  
enacting it ``will send the message that this senseless violence is 
unacceptable and un-American. It will let perpetrators of hate 
violence know their actions will be punished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If even one family can avoid getting that phone call in the  
middle of the night because of this legislation, then it will be 
worth it,'' Mrs. Shepard added. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents say the bill is unnecessary because states have not  
avoided prosecuting such crimes. One of the two men charged in 
Shepard's death pleaded guilty to murder last month and was 
sentenced to two consecutive life terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics also say the bill itself would discriminate by creating  
special classes of victims such as gays, would greatly expand the 
federal government's power and jurisdiction and would have a 
``chilling effect'' on free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``While well-intentioned, a law like this could be greatly  
abused,'' said Robert Knight, senior director of cultural studies 
at the conservative Family Research Council, which opposes the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, sponsored Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Edward  
Kennedy, D-Mass., would add disability, gender and sexual 
orientation to federal civil rights law and make it easier for the 
Justice Department to investigate and prosecute. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton supports the measure.  
</P>
<P>
	Current federal law prohibits crimes based on race, color,  
religion or national origin. Eight states have no hate crimes laws. 
Laws in 21 states cover sexual orientation. Twenty-two state laws 
include gender, and 21 cover disability. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch asked for  
additional information on bias crimes after Deputy Attorney General 
Eric Holder said ``the data we have are inadequate.'' Hatch, 
R-Utah, also voiced reservations about Congress stepping into an 
arena reserved for states -- criminal prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI collects data from local police agencies. But Holder  
said the number is often underestimated because many victims don't 
report the offenses and police don't always recognize them as bias 
crimes or collect the information. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest FBI statistics show 8,049 reported hate crimes in  
1997. Of that, 1,102 incidents were motivated by the victim's 
sexual orientation, Holder said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said local and state authorities prosecute most hate crimes,  
and the Justice Department would intervene only in the rarest 
cases, such as when a local prosecutor is unable or unwilling to 
prosecute. Hatch asked for examples. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the states are doing the job, then what's the need for  
really broad legislation that basically may not be necessary under 
the circumstances?'' Hatch said. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 622.

<HEADLINE> Foot Cream Sheds Prescription </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lamisil Cream, the top-selling prescription  
medication for athlete's foot, on Tuesday began selling over the 
counter. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Lamisil cures athlete's foot with one week of treatment  
compared to four weeks for the competition, Swiss drugmaker 
Novartis predicts strong demand even though Lamisil Cream is $1 to 
$2 more expensive than leading over-the-counter products. 
</P>
<P>
	Novartis already markets the third-leading over-the-counter  
athlete's foot medication -- Desenex. Schering-Plough dominates the 
category with its No. 1 selling Lotrimin and No. 2 selling Tinactin 
brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Athlete's foot, or tinea pedis, is a fungus of the foot  
affecting about 10 percent of the U.S. population each year. The 
infection, characterized by an annoying itch typically between the 
fourth and fifth toes, is usually spread in showers and locker 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamisil Cream differs from other over-the-counter athlete's foot  
remedies because it actually kills the fungi that cause the 
infection, rather than only inhibiting fungal growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamisil Cream had $69.3 million in sales in 1998, according to  
Novartis. In comparison, Lotrimin had $57.7 million in sales for 
the 52-week period ended March 28, 1999, according to market data 
firm Information Resources Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamisil Cream also treats other fungus-related skin conditions.  
</P>
<P>
	``Lamisil does seem very effective and to work faster than other  
medications,'' said Dr. Darrell Rigel, president of the American 
Academy of Dermatology. 
</P>
<P>
	Novartis is taking the drug over the counter because its studies  
show 85 percent of consumers diagnose and treat the condition 
themselves. Lamisil was first introduced as a prescription product 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	A small tube of Lamisil Cream now sells for between $7.50 and  
$9, about a third of the prescription price. Novartis expects 
consumers to pay up to $2 more for Lamisil Cream because they only 
have to use a fourth as much as competing brands to get rid of 
their athlete's foot. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to gaining market share from rivals, Novartis hopes  
to attract the nearly 30 percent of athlete's foot sufferers who 
don't treat the ailment, said Barry Cohen, a Novartis marketing 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem with other athlete's foot medications is most  
consumers only take them for a few days and stop applying them once 
the itching stops, Cohen said. As a result, the consumer never 
completely overcomes the infection and the itching returns again 
and again. 
</P>
<P>
	``The beautiful part is that Lamisil is used the way consumers  
behave today,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Novartis will continue to sell Desenex, which comes in a powder  
form. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration approved the switch of Lamisil  
Cream to over the counter in March.

<HEADLINE> Constant Change for Timberwolves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- It's a real circus in the Target Center this  
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only are the Minnesota Timberwolves scrambling to tweak  
their game plan again as their first-round playoff series with San 
Antonio moves north, but they're being forced to work around the 
Shrine Circus, which booked the arena through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The circus will be dismantled and reassembled twice by Friday  
night, which is an appropriate backdrop for the Wolves, who have 
done much of the same thing throughout this truncated season. 
</P>
<P>
	Change worked wonders for Minnesota in its 80-71 upset of the  
Spurs in San Antonio on Tuesday night, which evened the best-of-5 
series at a game each. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did everything better than we did,'' Spurs center David  
Robinson said. ``They were better in every respect. We didn't shoot 
the ball, we didn't rebound, we didn't get loose balls, we didn't 
defend. We were bad offensively and didn't execute. Everything 
broke down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	You can credit the changes in the Timberwolves' execution and  
emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	After fading down the stretch in Game 1 when Terrell Brandon and  
Kevin Garnett got into foul trouble, the Wolves went with a bigger 
lineup and a more aggressive attitude in the rematch and both stars 
benefitted. 
</P>
<P>
	First, 6-11 center Dean Garrett replaced 6-7 forward Sam  
Mitchell in the starting lineup and helped hold Robinson to six 
shots and 11 points, and Mitchell was effective coming off the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
	The Timberwolves outrebounded the taller Spurs, Garnett was a  
force down the stretch, Brandon logged 47 minutes and the 
supporting cast made a spectacular debut, highlighted by Anthony 
Peeler's game-clinching 3-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you could see how our team focuses, you'd know it's playoff  
time,'' Garnett said. ``We eat, sleep and dream about the Spurs. 
The focus is there. I feel confident going home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So, why deviate from the successful shift in strategy?  
</P>
<P>
	``Because the Spurs are a veteran team and they're going to  
watch that film and figure out ways to stop us on both ends,'' said 
Brandon, who joined the team in a midseason trade from Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Besides, we didn't play a perfect ball game. We only scored 80  
points. We can do a lot of things better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota now has the homecourt advantage, but for the  
Timberwolves to join the 1994 Denver Nuggets as the only No. 8 
seeds ever to advance into the second round, they're going to have 
to be willing to change some more, coach Flip Saunders agreed after 
Wednesday's practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what the playoffs are: adjustments, adapting to  
different situations,'' Saunders said. ``That's when it is the most 
fun. I think our players, they expect that we're going to do 
different things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Timberwolves fed off Saunders' enthusiasm. He looked more  
like a traffic cop than a basketball coach on the sideline Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they see you show a sense of urgency, they're going to show  
that same sense of urgency,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders had to make sure his players didn't bask in their  
success for too long. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're a very good basketball team. There's a reason they're  
the No. 1 seed in the league and they got homecourt advantage,'' 
Saunders said. ``But we've got a lot more confidence now knowing 
it's 1-1. We're coming back home; we've played extremely well at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be very disappointed if we didn't have a sellout crowd, if  
our crowd isn't going crazy because this is another step in the 
evolution,'' Saunders added. ``Last year we won a playoff game, we 
took it to a Game 5, didn't win it. So, we've kind of knocked on 
the door. We're knocking on the door again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about time to open it and walk through it. We've got an  
opportunity to do that here at home.''

<HEADLINE> Tiger Refreshed, Ready for Nelson  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- To prepare for Part III of his third full  
year on the PGA Tour, Tiger Woods didn't touch a club for 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	He arrived for the GTE Byron Nelson Classic looking fresh and  
relaxed, no longer the No. 1 player in the world ranking but no 
less the star attraction. He wore a smile so wide that even the 
tournament host took notice Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like he's much more free,'' Nelson said. ``He's  
smiling more. But he's a 23-year-old kid. I think he'd like to go 
out there and beat somebody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If that's what he does when the Nelson Classic starts on the TPC  
at Las Colinas and Cottonwood Valley courses, Woods can likely 
attribute that to his break away from golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hung out with my friends and got away from the game,''  
Woods said. ``I was really burned out. Bay Hill was playing tough, 
The Players Championship was really hard, then the Masters and 
Hilton Head. Those are tough tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not so much the golf that wears you out, but the mental  
fatigue of grinding on these golf courses,'' he said. ``They were 
playing so difficult, you can't let up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods has broken 70 just once in his past 17 rounds, but history  
would indicate that this might be a good week to change that. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, the Nelson Classic has proven to be a birdie  
haven over the past four years. The worst winning score in that 
period was a 15-under 265 by Phil Mickelson in 1996 and by John 
Cook last year. The record of 263 belongs to Woods and Ernie Els. 
</P>
<P>
	A better harbinger for Woods is that three-week break.  
</P>
<P>
	When he won the Masters in 1997, Woods was so pooped he didn't  
even feel like celebrating his record-setting victory. He took four 
weeks off, showed up at Las Colinas and proceeded to tie Els' 
tournament record. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, he took a three-week break after the Masters and  
started the third phase of his season by winning the BellSouth 
Classic in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nelson field isn't as strong as the early commitments  
suggested. David Duval and Els decided not to play, and Vijay Singh 
also chose to sit this week out. Payne Stewart withdrew on Monday, 
saying he felt burned out. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it has 32 of the top 50 on the money list. That includes  
Fred Couples, who was in great position to win last year until 
hitting into the water on No. 17. Not in the money but still a 
featured attraction is Sergio Garcia, the 19-year-old British 
Amateur champion who turned pro last month in Spain and tied for 
25th in the Peugeot Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Other past champions include Nick Price and Tom Watson, who  
defends next week in Colonial but hasn't broken par in his last 14 
rounds on tour. 
</P>
<P>
	What might help Woods more than being refreshed to reverting to  
the form from the first part of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	During the West Coast swing, Woods won in San Diego and finished  
in the top five in five of his six tournaments. He only had one 
round over par during that stretch, a 78 on a nasty, windy day at 
Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Since leaving California after his quarterfinal loss in the  
Match Play Championship, Woods has yet to get into serious, Sunday 
contention. 
</P>
<P>
	His scoring average has been nearly three strokes higher since  
then, and a lot of it has to do with putting. Woods is ranked 102nd 
in putting, and his average of 29.69 putts per round puts him 162nd 
out of 188 players. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Masters, he took the second-most putts (126) but still  
tied for 18th, nine strokes back of Jose Maria Olazabal. 
</P>
<P>
	As always, Woods says it's a matter of staying patient.  
</P>
<P>
	He says he putts by feel, lining up putts from all possible  
angles but ultimately relying on his hunch before he pulls the 
trigger. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what it's going to do generally, but I go by my feel,''  
he said. ``That's how I putted at Augusta -- when I played pretty 
good there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:* Woods said his father, Earl, began radiation treatment  
for prostate cancer two weeks ago and is doing well. ``They caught 
it very early. He's doing great.'' ... Even though Ben Crenshaw 
withdrew because of the death of his father, he still took time to 
call Byron Nelson to apologize. ``It was nice of him to call,'' 
Nelson said. ``That just shows what he thinks of me and the 
tournament.''

<HEADLINE> Retailer Unveils Appliance Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Forget the softer side. Sears is now hoping  
customers will come see its cyber side. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest department store chain today began selling  
2,000 major brands and models of appliances over the Internet, 
becoming the first brick-and-mortar retailer seeking to cash in on 
the big-ticket items over the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``Customers are jazzed about the amount of control the Internet  
affords them -- for both research and buying,'' said Alice M. 
Peterson, vice president and general manager of Sears Online. ``In 
essence, they're time-starved and want us to make life simpler for 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The site -- www.Sears.com -- can walk a user through the various  
options, including the ability to narrow the search to a particular 
color, brand or size, check within a price range and determine if a 
pictured item is on sale. It also provides links to sales of Sears' 
Craftsman tool line and Part Direct store. 
</P>
<P>
	The downside, however, is that the site does not provide  
independent ranking of products, relying instead on side-by-side 
comparisons. Customers who buy online also must pay the applicable 
state sales tax, a federal requirement other online sites do not 
have because the retailer operates in all 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears' site is four times the size of the next largest  
competitor, ValueAmerica.com, and the retailer hopes to use its 
national presence to offer delivery within 24 to 48 hours of an 
online sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The potential for profit is enormous. Forrester Research Inc. of  
Cambridge, Mass., estimates that by the year 2003, 6 percent of all 
appliances will be sold online. And the market for such big-ticket 
items will be $38 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts have expressed skepticism that Sears will see a  
large increase in incremental sales from Internet shopping for 
big-ticket items because many consumers like to examine the product 
in person. 
</P>
<P>
	But Peterson said focus group studies and other research of its  
earlier offerings found many consumers want to do preliminary 
fact-finding on a big-ticket item before going into the store to be 
bothered by sales staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that many more purchases currently are influenced by  
the Internet than are actually consummated,'' she said. ``But this 
gives consumers the choices they want and helps bring them into our 
stores to open the doors and turn the knobs on their final 
selections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An in-house study also found that Sears customers who did buy  
off the Internet made 27 percent more purchases in-store over the 
ensuing six-month period than customers who did not, Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	That could prove beneficial to the Hoffman Estates, Ill.-based  
company. Sears sales have been bolstered recently by continued 
strong sales of big-ticket items and interest income from its 
store-owned credit card, while sales of clothing have lagged in the 
face of stiff competition from specialty retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears is hoping to revitalize sluggish sales at its department  
stores with new lines of clothing and in-store displays aimed at 
younger audiences, price cuts of up to 15 percent on certain 
clothes, the introduction of dinnerware, flatware, gardening and 
other housewares and new credit card promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	The retailer also hopes to begin offering online electronics and  
other items in coming months, executives said.

<HEADLINE> White House Letterer Dies at Age 91 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- C. Earl Leslie, who worked in the White House  
social office to hand letter everything from inaugural invitations 
to historic documents, died of cancer May 6 in Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Leslie mastered the art of engrossing -- a form of lettering  
commonly used in the Middle Ages -- at a young age and moved here in 
1933 to be secretary to then-Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes. He 
moved to the White House two years later, where he served during 
the administrations of Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Dwight 
Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
	Leslie's work varied from the proclamation of German surrender  
in World War II to place cards for state dinners. Leslie, who 
served as assistant chief of the White House's social office, was 
sometimes called upon by the Secret Service as a hand-writing 
expert. 
</P>
<P>
	Leslie continued engrossing independently for 20 years after  
leaving the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., Leslie learned his lettering  
technique at age 13 before joining his father and brother in their 
art studio. He is survived by a daughter, a granddaughter, a 
brother and a sister.

<HEADLINE> Congress Agrees on $11.6B for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional negotiators agreed Wednesday to  
provide $11.6 billion for the air assault on Yugoslavia and to 
boost overall defense spending, nearly doubling the amount 
President Clinton requested. 
</P>
<P>
	But ongoing disputes over items ranging from fishing in Alaska's  
Glacier Bay to taxpayer assistance for some U.S. steel companies 
was hindering completion of the package, which House and Senate 
leaders want to send to Clinton by week's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers' demands for favored items were so insistent that they  
drove an exasperated GOP Rep. Bill Young of Florida, chairman of 
the House Appropriations Committee and a 29-year House member, to 
say, ``I'm practicing for my next career, and that is refereeing in 
the World Wrestling Federation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The provisions legislators were trying -- and in some cases  
succeeding -- in adding to the package also drew the ire of the 
White House, which has already threatened to veto the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've warned them not to load up this legislation'' with added  
language, said Linda Ricci, spokeswoman for the White House budget 
office. She also said Congress should avoid ``harmful cuts in other 
programs'' to pay for parts of the package. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the agreed-upon measures opposed by the White House would  
prohibit the federal government from laying claim to any of the 
$246 billion from settlements that states have reached with the 
tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest chunk of the bill -- and the item with the strongest  
political appeal -- was the money for U.S. participation in NATO's 
bombing of Yugoslavia. Though lawmakers are divided over the wisdom 
of the attacks, even many opponents are reluctant to oppose funds 
for the troops in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do believe that this war was started frivolously and pursued  
incompetently,'' said Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash. ``But I do believe 
we've got to pay for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To the $6 billion Clinton sought for the confrontation over  
Kosovo, House-Senate bargainers agreed to add $1.8 billion for a 
troop pay raise that would begin in January; $2.5 billion for 
military operations and maintenance of equipment; $678 million to 
help Kosovo's refugees and the Balkan states sheltering them; plus 
additional funds to replace depleted bombs, purchase other weapons 
and recruit. 
</P>
<P>
	The bargainers also agreed to pare $1 billion the House approved  
to modernize overseas military bases to $475 million, and to 
provide $200 million for the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	The compromise also would include nearly $1 billion for recent  
natural disasters in the Caribbean, mostly to help Honduras, Costa 
Rica, El Salvador and Nicaragua rebound from last autumn's 
devastating Hurricane Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	There is also $100 million for Jordan; $566 million to help  
American farmers struggling because of badly sagging commodities 
prices; and $900 million for the costs of the recent tornadoes in 
the Midwest and for a cushion for future disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiators worked into the evening, attempting to heed orders  
by House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott, R-Miss., to complete their bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said bargainers had accepted  
her Senate-approved proposal to continue a moratorium through 
September against new Energy Department rules that would force oil 
and gas producers using federal lands to pay higher royalties to 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., won his attempt to delay the Interior  
Department from implementing stricter cleanup requirements for 
mining companies using federal lands. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, participants said bargainers would allow the  
government to spend up to $4.3 million more for reparations to 
people of Japanese descent who were deported or placed in camps 
during World War II, and who missed an earlier round of federal 
reparation payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., dropped an effort to prevent the  
Interior Department from setting aside stretches of the Rio Grande 
River to protect the endangered silvery minnow. 
</P>
<P>
	Bargainers accepted a Senate-passed provision by Hutchison to  
keep the federal government's hands off the tobacco settlements. 
They also accepted another by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., to provide 
$140 million to back $1 billion worth of loans for some small steel 
companies facing competition from low-priced imports. 
</P>
<P>
	But key differences remained.  
</P>
<P>
	Kansas GOP Sens. Pat Roberts and Sam Brownback were pushing a  
provision to forgive more than $200 million in interest and 
penalties owed by the state's natural gas producers who were ruled 
to have overcharged customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska's Republican Senate duo, Frank Murkowski and Senate  
Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, made a lengthy plea 
to block the National Park Service from phasing out commercial and 
subsistence fishing in Glacier Bay National Park.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Forces Cross Albania Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAJRAM CURRI, Albania (AP) -- In one of their deepest  
cross-border incursions so far, Yugoslav soldiers stormed two 
northern Albanian villages in an offensive aimed at cutting supply 
lines of the Kosovo rebels, international observers said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Word of the fighting came with NATO Secretary-General Javier  
Solana announcing that that U.S. Apache helicopters would see 
action ``very soon'' in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conflict is not going to be sent into Albania,'' Solana  
said in the Albanian capital of Tirana. ``I want to reassure the 
people of this country that NATO will not tolerate any action 
against this country stemming from the presence of NATO forces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs and the rebels clashed throughout the day Tuesday and  
late into the night. There was only sporadic shelling along the 
border Wednesday, and it appeared the Yugoslav forces had pulled 
back to their side of the frontier, the observers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelling is a daily routine along the border, and the Yugoslav  
forces have made brief, periodic forays across the Albanian border 
in hot pursuit of KLA rebels. But Tuesday's fighting was unusually 
heavy, observers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army controls small parcels of  
southwestern Kosovo and has been funneling fighters and weapons 
into other parts of the embattled province. But the rebels have 
been outgunned by the much more powerful Yugoslav army. 
</P>
<P>
	Artillery shells exploded on both sides of the Kosovo-Albanian  
border, sending up columns of gray smoke visible from the Albanian 
town of Bajram Curri, only six miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the deepest penetration (by Yugoslav forces) and the  
longest we have seen,'' Pier Gonggrijp, head of the Bajram Curri 
office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, 
said Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 Yugoslav troops occupied the border village of Perroi i  
Thanes, about a half-mile inside Albania, said Pier Gonggrijp, a 
local official of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe, citing witnesses at the border. About 50 Yugoslav soldiers 
clashed with KLA forces and took the border village of Kasaj, 
Gonggrijp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty wounded KLA fighters were hospitalized in Bajram Curri on  
Tuesday, and KLA sources said three others were killed in the 
fighting. There was no word on Yugoslav casualties.

<HEADLINE> Internet Cos. Get New Report Card </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the government poised to admonish them  
for poor performance, companies on the Internet are preparing for a 
new report card grading their efforts to protect the personal 
details they collect about consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry-funded survey of roughly 360 Internet sites will  
gauge whether businesses are doing better than last summer, when a 
similar government study found that only 14 percent of sites 
adequately warned how companies used private information they 
collected about customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to show what level of progress has been made,''  
said Harold McGraw III, chief executive officer for the McGraw-Hill 
Cos. ``Last year, less than 14 percent, that doesn't speak very 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report, expected to be released today, will help define the  
role the federal government will play in regulating parts of the 
Internet, the worldwide computer network used by roughly 100 
million Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission, expected to recommend to Congress  
this summer whether new Internet privacy laws are needed, has said 
it wanted to see results from the study before making any 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy groups complain that the online industry has done a poor  
job on its own protecting the details it collects about customers, 
such as names, postal and e-mail addresses and even likes and 
dislikes. Some Web sites sell the information to third-party 
advertisers and others. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House, with the industry's support, has agreed so far  
to allow companies to develop their own guidelines because of 
concerns that federal intervention could stifle the growth of 
electronic commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Clinton administration has taken a carrot-and-stick  
approach. Last summer, Vice President Al Gore warned executives 
that unless the industry takes adequate measures to protect 
consumer privacy, ``we will be obliged to take action ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People who don't use the Internet frequently cite privacy  
concerns as their primary reason for staying off line. The issue 
has taken on growing significance as more companies have begun 
selling products over the Internet, expected eventually to carry 
billions of dollars in transactions daily. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the numbers, there's going to be an argument over  
whether self-regulation is succeeding or whether legislation is 
necessary,'' predicted Jerry Berman, executive director of the 
Washington-based Center for Democracy and Technology. ``The 
question on the table is, is progress being made?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harriet Pearson of IBM, one of the companies that helped pay for  
the study, said nearly all the 100 most popular sites on the Web 
now explain what information is collected and how it's used, up 
from 71 percent of those biggest sites identified in last year's 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	But among Web sites of all sizes, large and small, IBM and  
others argued that merely doubling the number of sites with 
adequate privacy notices from last year's 14 percent would 
represent substantial progress. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a company, we're hoping to see the privacy surveys show  
that companies doing e-business are making significant strides, 
making the Internet a well-lit highway safe for consumers to 
travel,'' Pearson said. ``Is it going to be perfect? No, but it 
will be close to perfect for the top-traveled sites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics complained that the latest study, which was not  
expected to include recommendations about whether new laws are 
needed, didn't measure whether a Web site's privacy policy was 
sufficient, but just looked to see whether one existed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is not whether there's a privacy policy, but  
is there privacy protection?'' said Marc Rotenberg, director of the 
Electronic Privacy Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the largest companies on the Web, including IBM, America  
Online, Microsoft, Compaq and eBay, paid a total of $60,000 for the 
study, conducted by Georgetown University business professor Mary 
J. Culnan.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Up in Hawaii Landslide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAUULA, Hawaii (AP) -- Divers plan to search a deep pool at the  
base of a 90-foot waterfall for the body of a California woman 
missing since a Mother's Day landslide showered tons of boulders on 
holiday hikers. 
</P>
<P>
	The death toll from Sunday's landslide in Sacred Falls State  
Park increased to seven Tuesday when Mark Johnson of Los Angeles 
died of his injuries. The missing woman, who is presumed dead, 
would bring the toll to eight. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 29, was among dozens of hikers sunning themselves near  
the waterfall in one of Hawaii's most dramatic hiking spots when 
boulders, some the size of small cars, came crashing down. His 
24-year-old sister, Jenifer, was also killed by the landslide. 
</P>
<P>
	The Johnsons are not related to the missing Sarah Johnson, 24,  
of Hayward, Calif. Officials believe her body may be pinned under a 
boulder in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
	Divers will search within a few days, said Timothy Johns,  
director of the state Department of Land and Natural Resources. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Johnson, a Navy veteran, was scheduled to graduate Monday  
from Chaminade University. He spent the last three years as a 
radioman first class at Barbers Point Naval Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve people, including five children, remained hospitalized  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Geoffrey Scott, chief resident at University of California,  
Irvine, Medical Center's head and neck surgery department, recalled 
Tuesday how he, his wife and two young children were just 50 yards 
from the falls when the landslide started. 
</P>
<P>
	At first they mistook the roar for a flash flood. But when no  
water followed, the Scotts moved closer to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst images of the worst horror movie you could imagine  
pale in comparison,'' Scott said. ``There were bodies throughout 
the area. Some had severe trauma and there were severed body 
parts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The surgeon and other bystanders began lifting the injured out  
of an area littered with rocks, trees and debris. They carried 
about 10 people to safety but, fearing more landslides, they had to 
leave two behind.

<HEADLINE> Only Judge Can Allow Penguins' Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- If the Pittsburgh Penguins are to become the  
Portland Penguins, the road to Oregon must first pass through a 
U.S. bankruptcy judge's office, not that of NHL commissioner Gary 
Bettman. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the hardened stance taken recently by the NHL, one  
designed to accelerate the Penguins' bankruptcy proceedings, 
Bettman concedes the league can't move them unless Judge Bernard 
Markovitz's allows it. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, league officials suggested the NHL could disband or  
relocate the team if the 1999-2000 season was approaching and the 
Penguins' case was not resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Lemieux group is moving at an appropriate rate of speed,''  
said Bettman, who is attending the Maple Leafs-Penguins playoff 
series. ``These are complicated issues, and the bankruptcy judge is 
doing what he believes is in the best interests of the bankruptcy 
proceedings. I learned long ago never to disagree with a judge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Especially one who controls the fate of one of only two NHL  
franchises in a top-25 United States TV market -- St. Louis is the 
other -- without winter competition from an NBA franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven months ago, shortly after the Penguins filed for Chapter  
11 protection, the NHL agreed to a court order that it would not 
seek to vacate the franchise while the Penguins were in bankruptcy. 
Markovitz also has ruled that the Penguins' arena lease, which runs 
through 2007, is binding. 
</P>
<P>
	Markovitz on Tuesday rejected the NHL's request to move up the  
creditors' vote on Lemieux's bid from June 24. But he did agree to 
hear the league's request that its own plan move forward at the 
same pace as Lemieux's. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL plan, which Bettman said is strictly a backup in case  
Lemieux's bid falters, calls for the Penguins to be sold for $85 
million to an out-of-town owner -- presumably, Seattle Seahawks 
owner Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder -- in time to relocate 
for next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like to have the Penguins reorganize in Pittsburgh,  
but if that doesn't work, we have to look at the alternatives: Is 
there a buyer who is prepared to take the franchise on very short 
notice for next season?'' Bettman said. ``Taking a club at the end 
of June, to start selling tickets and get up and running for the 
start of next season would be no picnic for anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, who also owns the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers, said he  
has not made a specific bid for the Penguins. But he did not deny 
being interested in putting an NHL franchise into the nearly new 
Rose Garden arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Another bankruptcy judge, M. Bruce McCullough, said the NHL is  
working on three schedules for next season: one with the Penguins 
in Pittsburgh, another with them on the West Coast, presumably 
Portland, and a third without them. 
</P>
<P>
	If nothing else, the news that a deep-pockets owner is willing  
to relocate the Penguins immediately caused a rumble Wednesday not 
only in Pittsburgh, but in the state capital of Harrisburg. 
</P>
<P>
	With much of the Penguins' financial mess blamed on an  
unfavorable arena lease that management firm SMG has refused to 
renegotiate, City Council president Bob O'Connor again raised the 
possibility of using eminent domain to reclaim the arena. City 
Council decided Tuesday to delay exploring any such action for now. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor said he met briefly with Bettman at Tuesday's playoff  
game to discuss the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best thing is to keep the team here,'' O'Connor said.  
``There is a history and tradition here that can't be duplicated 
elsewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Harrisburg, Gov. Tom Ridge, who shepherded the funding  
package for four new stadiums in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia 
through the Legislature three months ago, said he is amenable to 
discussing a new arena once new local Penguins ownership is in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately, city and state government officials believe a new  
arena to replace the 38-year-old Civic Arena would be an easier 
sell to taxpayers than the stadiums, because it would be used 
year-around for concerts, circuses and meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had one conversation with ... Gary Bettman, and I told  
him that after the legal matters have been resolved that I 
anticipate, given the age of the (Civic Arena), that they will be 
looking for some public assistance, and we would be open to that 
discussion,'' Ridge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Kevin Constantine said the Penguins' history of attracting  
big crowds and fielding competitive teams should not be overlooked. 
The Penguins have played to about 90 percent of arena capacity 
while reaching the Stanley Cup playoffs each year since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's so much fun in this town because of hockey, it would  
be a shame to not have it in Pittsburgh,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Arnett Signs With Internet Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Veteran correspondent Peter Arnett, who ended  
his 18-year association with CNN last month, has landed a job with 
a new Internet broadcaster that specializes in international news. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnett will do interviews with major international leaders for  
foreigntv.com, a media service that was started by Al Primo, a 
television consultant who pioneered ``Eyewitness News'' for local 
TV. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll do about one interview per month and also advise Primo in  
setting up bureaus in cities around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnett and CNN parted ways nine months after he narrated an  
ill-fated report charging the U.S. military used nerve gas on 
American defectors during the Vietnam War. CNN later retracted the 
story and disciplined Arnett. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnett, who won a Pulitzer Prize for The Associated Press for  
his Vietnam coverage, said the Internet venture reminded him of CNN 
in its early days. He had no immediate plans for a return to 
broadcast TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really feel that CNN is the state of the art in covering  
action news,'' he said. ``To try to go against them would be a 
little foolhardy and I would feel slightly ridiculous.''

<HEADLINE>  UCLA's Davis To Enter NBA Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- UCLA point guard Baron Davis and his  
surgically repaired left knee are headed to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NBA is calling and I think I'm ready for the challenge,''  
Davis said Wednesday in announcing he would forgo his final two 
years of eligibility to enter the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do have the ability to make an impact and I want that  
challenge,'' he said. ``This has been a lifelong dream for me. I 
feel it's time to be challenged at the highest level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, a 6-foot-2 1/2 sophomore, averaged 15.9 points, 5.1 assists  
and 2.5 steals for the Bruins last season. He missed the first four 
games while recovering from a knee injury that occurred during the 
1998 NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``My injury put things in perspective,'' he said. ``I don't  
think it played that big of a part (in his decision) ... I just 
felt at this point in my life, with the way my knee is now it's at 
full strength, that it can only get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a freshman, before injuring his knee, Davis averaged 11.7  
points, 4.0 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 2.4 steals. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, 20, said he decided two days ago to enter the draft.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was still going back and forth. It's a hard decision,'' he  
said. ``It's not about money because money can't buy all the 
experiences I had here, all the laughs and all the crying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a campus news conference, Davis was flanked by his  
grandmother, who raised him, and his sister, his brother-in-law and 
Lavin. Davis said he promised his grandmother he would eventually 
earn a college degree. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins had a 46-18 record in Davis' two seasons, with  
third-place finishes in the Pacific-10 Conference both years. UCLA 
reached the final 16 of the NCAA tournament when Davis was a 
freshman, but lost to Detroit in the first round this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of my dreams along the way was to win a national  
championship, and it kind of hurts my heart that I will have to 
leave that behind,'' he said. ``I wanted to be known as one of the 
greatest point guards ever to play at UCLA. I didn't hang any 
(national) banners, so it's kind of hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA coach Steve Lavin said he talked to scouts and NBA  
officials, including Jerry West of the Lakers and Elgin Baylor of 
the Clippers, and they told him Davis could go as high as a No. 2 
pick and most likely no lower than a No. 6 pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question he's a lottery-level pick,'' Lavin said.  
``Baron was a very gifted, special player that you could go a 
lifetime as a coach and maybe only have a handful of players who 
are at Baron Davis' level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis named the hometown Lakers and Clippers as the two teams  
he'd like to play for. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of want to get thrown to the fire at a young age,''  
Davis said. ``I know that going up against guys like Stephon 
(Marbury), Allen Iverson and Jason Kidd night in and night out is 
going to do nothing but make me better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis informed his teammates Tuesday night that he was leaving.  
Several of them attended the news conference, and said they would 
miss Davis' emotional floor leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``The playmaking ability Baron brought us is not going to be  
there,'' said forward Sean Farnham, who will be a senior. ``Baron 
is one of those players that come along every so often, but few and 
far between. He gave us unbelievable excitement.''

<HEADLINE>  Pollin To Sell Washington Capitals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Abe Pollin is passing the torch to a  
computer-marketing whiz, giving the nation's capital a 
new-generation owner for the NHL's Capitals and, eventually, the 
NBA's Wizards and the MCI Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying he wanted to spend ``a little less time in sports, and a  
little more time doing things for folks who are less fortunate,'' 
Pollin said Wednesday he is selling the Capitals, plus a minority 
interest in Washington Sports &AMP; Entertainment -- which owns the 
Wizards, the MCI Center and US Airways Arena -- to a partnership 
headed by America Online executive Ted Leonsis. 
</P>
<P>
	``And someday when I decide to call it quits,'' Pollin said,  
``he will have first and last crack to own it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leonsis, along with local entrepreneur Jonathan Ledecky and  
Capitals president Dick Patrick, is making an initial investment of 
about $200 million in the sale. About $85 million of that is the 
price for the money-losing Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollin, accompanied by his wife and two sons, said he started  
looking for a buyer a year ago because he ``wanted to go out on 
top'' after the Capitals made their first-ever appearance in the 
Stanley Cup finals. With his sons expressing no interest in leaving 
their careers to take over his business, the 75-year-old executive 
said he agonized over the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not want a repeat of the mess that the Redskins went  
through in their transition,'' Pollin said. ``We were talked to by 
a lot of people, met with a lot of people and there was one person 
who stood out among all of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that more and more teams are sold to corporations, Pollin  
said he wanted someone who would be an active member of the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would never sell to a corporation,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	With the free time and money he gains from selling the Capitals,  
Pollin plans to do more charity work. One of his first duties will 
be chairing a UNICEF relief effort for Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	He remains in charge of the Wizards and his $200 million  
downtown arena, which opened in December 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to stress here and now that I am not retiring.'' he  
said. ``My goal is to bring another NBA championship to Washington 
and we're not going to quit until we do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leonsis, 43, is president of AOL Interactive Properties Group,  
an arm of AOL that describes itself as the ``leading online content 
programmer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is a 1977 graduate of Georgetown and has been labeled by The  
Wall Street Journal as ``one of the Web world's most influential 
players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing I know how to do is bring customers in,''  
Leonsis said. ``When I joined AOL (in 1994), we had 800,000 
members. When I moved to my new position, we had 8 million. So I 
understand the power of marketing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the sale is approved by NHL owners, who next meet June 22,  
Patrick would continue as president of the Capitals and assume more 
of the day-to-day operation of the club. He said he plans to retain 
general manager George McPhee and coach Ron Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dick is in charge of the Capitals,'' Leonsis said. ``And I'll  
be the fat guy with the cigar in the owners' box yelling and 
screaming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new owners plan to aggressively market the teams on the  
Internet. Ledecky promised a web strategy that will be ``at the 
cutting edge'' for major sports teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Ledecky is chairman of Building One Services Corp., one of  
America's largest facilities maintenance companies. He is the 
group's number-cruncher. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no secret the Capitals have been losing money for  
years,'' Ledecky said. ``We want to put a winning product on the 
ice, but at the same time we have to make the numbers work because 
that's the way teams have gotten into trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ledecky said the group has set aside extra money beyond the $200  
million rebuild the Capitals into a contender. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have one mission -- to etch our names on the Stanley Cup,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the sale came as another NHL club, the bankrupt  
Pittsburgh Penguins, is close to being sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The Capitals would be the second of three major sports team  
sales expected this year in Washington. The NFL most likely will 
approve the sale of the Redskins to another local marketing 
upstart, 34-year-old Daniel Snyder, later this month. D.C. United 
of Major League Soccer is also on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on everything we've heard, preliminarily, we are not  
anticipating any problems,'' NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said of 
the Capitals sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollin purchased the Wizards, then known as the Baltimore  
Bullets, in 1964 and became sole owner in 1968. He built his first 
arena, the Capital Centre in Landover, Md., in 1973 and moved his 
NBA team there. The Capitals, Pollin's expansion NHL franchise, 
opened play there a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	This season for Pollin could be summed up in one word: losing.  
The Capitals and Wizards both missed the playoffs for the first 
time since 1980-81. The Capitals, just one season after making the 
finals, finished 31-45-6.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Park Death Ruled a Homicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The death of a magazine executive who had  
apparently gone jogging in Central Park has been ruled a homicide, 
making it the park's first this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Herman, a 33-year-old Fortune magazine advertising  
manager, was found lying face down in dirt on Monday morning by a 
man walking his dog near 69th Street, a couple of blocks north of 
the Central Park zoo. 
</P>
<P>
	While Herman had had medical problems in the past, medical  
examiners say the 6-foot, 185-pound man died of neck compression, 
possibly by being placed in a chokehold. There were no finger marks 
on his neck, but police said bruises marked Herman's lower neck, 
upper chest and arms. He also had bloodshot eyes, which can result 
from chest compression. 
</P>
<P>
	Herman had undergone brain surgery several years ago and last  
month, was hospitalized for three weeks last month with tremors. 
</P>
<P>
	A park visitor first noticed Herman lying on the grass Sunday  
evening, but from her vantage point a distance away it just looked 
like a jogger perhaps sprawled out for a snooze. She told police 
she saw a man in his 40s standing nearby, and police said today 
they hoped to question him. 
</P>
<P>
	Police initially thought Herman died of a heart attack while  
jogging because there were no obvious signs of a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said robbery did not appear to be a motive.  
Herman's keys, tape player and watch remained on his body, and his 
wallet was found in his undisturbed West 57th Street apartment, 
along with an uneaten dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had taken out something to eat with the intention of having  
it when he came back,'' Deputy Inspector Joseph Reznick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Herman's body was identified on Tuesday after his parents  
contacted authorities to say they were unable to reach him. His 
father last saw him Sunday at 6:30 p.m. as he dropped him off 
following a Mother's Day visit in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow Fortune executives said they were baffled by Herman's  
death. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a person here who didn't think he was the nicest  
guy on the face of the Earth,'' said Jolene Sykes, the magazine's 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Compared with last year, overall crime is down in Central Park.  
By this time in 1998, there were 40 crimes reported, including one 
killing. So far this year, there have been 10 robberies and two 
assaults in addition to Herman's killing.

<HEADLINE> Landslide Reminds of Hawaii Dangers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAUULA, Hawaii (AP) -- The guidebooks go on and on about Hawaii's  
volcanic peaks and crystal-blue waters. They don't always mention 
their inherent danger. 
</P>
<P>
	In the postcard-pretty environs of the island chain, the dream  
vacations of several tourists each year end in death. 
</P>
<P>
	They are battered by pounding winter surf, attacked by  
man-eating tiger sharks, steamed to death in a volcano or buried 
under giant rocks -- as happened to dozens of visitors Sunday at 
Sacred Falls State Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``They come here to fulfill their fantasies,'' said Capt. Ken  
Rust of Honolulu's water safety division. ``But they are unaware of 
the hazards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven people are confirmed dead from the landslide, another is  
missing and presumed dead. Twelve people remain hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten people have died at Sacred Falls from landslides and flash  
floods since 1970, yet it remains one of the island's most popular 
tourist attractions with 56,000 annual visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``People think it won't happen to them,'' Rust said.  
</P>
<P>
	For example, more swimmers are injured at Sandy Beach in eastern  
Honolulu than at any beach in the state despite 30 warning signs 
fixed in the sand and ocean conditions posted daily by lifeguards. 
Waves break close to the shoreline, driving body surfers into the 
ocean floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors, military personnel assigned to the islands and locals  
often underestimate the dangers of snorkeling, surfing, Jet Ski 
rides, kayak trips, hiking and biking in the islands. And those 
dangers can be glossed over by tour companies fighting for market 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think tourist brochures should list all the recent  
problems that people may face,'' Gov. Ben Cayetano said Tuesday. 
``We want to demonstrate the positive side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With more than 6 million annual visitors to the islands, tourism  
is Hawaii's No. 1 industry. Tourists spend about $11 billion a 
year, generating a quarter of its tax revenues and a third of its 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Consequently, tourist deaths are not uncommon. Just recently:  
</P>
<P>
	--A 29-year-old Californian was killed by a shark off Maui while  
kayaking with her husband. He accused the kayak rental company of 
not warning them enough about the dangers of ocean paddling. 
</P>
<P>
	--A 31-year-old man from Washington state drowned while swimming  
off Kauai with his fiancee. 
</P>
<P>
	--A 44-year-old Japanese woman was killed when her Jet Ski was  
broadsided by another. The accident prompted state officials to 
consider changes in safety rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not Disneyland,'' said Janet Babb, who offers tours of  
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island. ``It's hard to 
convince people that this is Mother Nature and we can't control 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Babb's tours explore the wonders of Kilauea Volcano, which  
has been erupting almost constantly since January 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, five people have died in the park, including a local  
man who fell into 2,000-degree lava and a Colorado woman who became 
trapped in a steam vent near the volcano's crater. Park ranger 
Mardi Lane said both had disregarded signs indicating the area was 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The overwhelming majority of people who visit the park take  
our warnings seriously,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Ms. Babb stopped taking people to see the lava flow  
entering the ocean because of the dangers from molten rock, 
poisonous sulphuric acid or an earthquake. Plus, she avoids any 
potential liability. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor said Hawaii's selling point is the outdoors, which  
cannot be tamed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are always things that happen in nature that may pose  
some risk to people,'' Cayetano said. ``The risk-taking is part of 
going to see how nature operates.''

<HEADLINE> NYC To Pay $5M Over Strip Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The city is trying to settle a lawsuit filed on  
behalf of more 60,000 people who claim they were illegally 
strip-searched after being arrested for minor offenses, and if 
previous cases are any indication the cash payout could be 
staggering. 
</P>
<P>
	The magnitude of the problem for New York became clear when a  
federal jury ordered it to pay more than $5 million to just one 
such victim. 
</P>
<P>
	A class-action lawsuit charges that at least 63,000 other people  
-- and perhaps as many as twice that number -- were illegally 
strip-searched by jail guards in 1996 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the city ordered an end to the practice, 10 years after  
a federal appeals court ruled that strip searches of people charged 
with minor offenses are unconstitutional unless authorities have 
reason to believe they are hiding weapons or other contraband. 
</P>
<P>
	City lawyers are trying to settle the lawsuit, though they would  
not reveal specific settlement amounts being discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a federal jury in New York City awarded a woman  
strip-searched by jail guards $5 million in punitive damages and 
$19,600 for pain and suffering and medical expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the $5 million verdict  
will probably be overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pretty certain that the ultimate amount the city will  
have to pay is going to be in the range of $25,000, which is a far 
cry from $5 million,'' Giuliani said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers handling the class action lawsuit said that even if that  
$5 million punitive damages award is overturned, her $19,600 
compensatory award would be a good gauge of what a jury might award 
each of their 63,000 clients. 
</P>
<P>
	The city also recently agreed to pay $25,000 each to four  
Fordham University students who were strip-searched by police. 
</P>
<P>
	If each of the 63,000 people in the class-action suit is awarded  
$20,000, the city's total bill would be more than $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani said the searches took place without the knowledge of  
senior Corrections Department officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a situation that was going on, and when it was found  
out about, it was ended,'' he said. ``There are people that are 
entitled to some degree of compensation for it, but they are not 
entitled to win the lottery over it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew D. Brinckerhoff, one of the lawyers handling the  
class-action lawsuit, said he found it hard to believe that city 
officials were unaware that strip searches were being conducted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is shocking neglect if they didn't know,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The searches, said Lorna Goodman, a spokeswoman for the city's  
legal department, occurred after a shift in job functions between 
police officers and jail guards. The guards, accustomed to 
conducting such searches of inmates, did not realize it was illegal 
to strip-search people who had not been arraigned, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was not a policy, this was a mistake,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	According to an affidavit filed last year by Edward Reilly,  
chief of the Corrections Department, the strip searches were deemed 
necessary for security reasons.

<HEADLINE> Satellite Clocks Could Be 2nd Snafu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- By now everyone knows about computers and  
midnight, Dec. 31. But what's going to happen on Aug. 21? 
</P>
<P>
	That's when computer clocks roll over in the Global Positioning  
System, the network of satellites that keeps ships and nuclear 
missiles on course and provides precise time measurements for 
computer networks and public utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	A joint congressional subcommittee held a hearing Wednesday to  
assess the potential impact. It heard that while the military and 
space communities are ready for the adjustment, consumers and small 
businesses may be the hardest hit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Global Positioning System is made up of 24 orbiting  
satellites that allow anyone with a GPS receiver to pinpoint their 
position on Earth. The satellites keep track of dates by measuring 
the number of weeks elapsed since Jan. 5-6, 1980. Every 1,024 
weeks, the timer will reset to zero, which will occur for the first 
time as Aug. 21 turns to Aug. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``The satellites will not fall out of the sky, they will not  
lose their power,'' Keith Rhodes, technical director in the Office 
of the Chief Scientist at the General Accounting Office, told 
members of the House Science and Government Reform committees. 
``The problem will be on the ground, with what you hold in your 
hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Handheld receivers such as those popular with mountaineers,  
sailors and some motorists are ``probably going to have a problem'' 
if they are more than five years old, Rhodes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also vulnerable are small computer networks that rely on GPS  
time signals, a desirable form of time measurement because they are 
accurate to within three-billionths of a second. 
</P>
<P>
	More widespread computer problems are expected a little more  
than four months later, when the calendar changes from Dec. 31, 
1999, to Jan. 1, 2000 -- the Y2K witching hour. Many computers 
originally programmed to recognize only the last two digits of a 
year will not work properly beginning Jan. 1, 2000, when some 
machines will assume it is 1900 and could therefore malfunction.

<HEADLINE>  Pollin To Sell Washington Capitals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Abe Pollin is passing the torch to a  
computer-marketing whiz, giving the nation's capital a 
new-generation owner for the NHL's Capitals and, eventually, the 
NBA's Wizards and the MCI Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying he wanted to spend ``a little less time in sports, and a  
little more time doing things for folks who are less fortunate,'' 
Pollin said Wednesday he is selling the Capitals, plus a minority 
interest in Washington Sports &AMP; Entertainment -- which owns the 
Wizards, the MCI Center and US Airways Arena -- to a partnership 
headed by America Online executive Ted Leonsis. 
</P>
<P>
	``And someday when I decide to call it quits,'' Pollin said,  
``he will have first and last crack to own it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leonsis, along with local entrepreneur Jonathan Ledecky and  
Capitals president Dick Patrick, is making an initial investment of 
about $200 million in the sale. About $85 million of that is the 
price for the money-losing Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollin, accompanied by his wife and two sons, said he started  
looking for a buyer a year ago because he ``wanted to go out on 
top'' after the Capitals made their first-ever appearance in the 
Stanley Cup finals. With his sons expressing no interest in leaving 
their careers to take over his business, the 75-year-old executive 
said he agonized over the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not want a repeat of the mess that the Redskins went  
through in their transition,'' Pollin said. ``We were talked to by 
a lot of people, met with a lot of people and there was one person 
who stood out among all of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that more and more teams are sold to corporations, Pollin  
said he wanted someone who would be an active member of the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would never sell to a corporation,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	With the free time and money he gains from selling the Capitals,  
Pollin plans to do more charity work. One of his first duties will 
be chairing a UNICEF relief effort for Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	He remains in charge of the Wizards and his $200 million  
downtown arena, which opened in December 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to stress here and now that I am not retiring.'' he  
said. ``My goal is to bring another NBA championship to Washington 
and we're not going to quit until we do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leonsis, 43, is president of AOL Interactive Properties Group,  
an arm of AOL that describes itself as the ``leading online content 
programmer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is a 1977 graduate of Georgetown and has been labeled by The  
Wall Street Journal as ``one of the Web world's most influential 
players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing I know how to do is bring customers in,''  
Leonsis said. ``When I joined AOL (in 1994), we had 800,000 
members. When I moved to my new position, we had 8 million. So I 
understand the power of marketing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the sale is approved by NHL owners, who next meet June 22,  
Patrick would continue as president of the Capitals and assume more 
of the day-to-day operation of the club. He said he plans to retain 
general manager George McPhee and coach Ron Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dick is in charge of the Capitals,'' Leonsis said. ``And I'll  
be the fat guy with the cigar in the owners' box yelling and 
screaming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new owners plan to aggressively market the teams on the  
Internet. Ledecky promised a web strategy that will be ``at the 
cutting edge'' for major sports teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Ledecky is chairman of Building One Services Corp., one of  
America's largest facilities maintenance companies. He is the 
group's number-cruncher. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no secret the Capitals have been losing money for  
years,'' Ledecky said. ``We want to put a winning product on the 
ice, but at the same time we have to make the numbers work because 
that's the way teams have gotten into trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ledecky said the group has set aside extra money beyond the $200  
million rebuild the Capitals into a contender. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have one mission -- to etch our names on the Stanley Cup,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the sale came as another NHL club, the bankrupt  
Pittsburgh Penguins, is close to being sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The Capitals would be the second of three major sports team  
sales expected this year in Washington. The NFL most likely will 
approve the sale of the Redskins to another local marketing 
upstart, 34-year-old Daniel Snyder, later this month. D.C. United 
of Major League Soccer is also on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on everything we've heard, preliminarily, we are not  
anticipating any problems,'' NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said of 
the Capitals sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollin purchased the Wizards, then known as the Baltimore  
Bullets, in 1964 and became sole owner in 1968. He built his first 
arena, the Capital Centre in Landover, Md., in 1973 and moved his 
NBA team there. The Capitals, Pollin's expansion NHL franchise, 
opened play there a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	This season for Pollin could be summed up in one word: losing.  
The Capitals and Wizards both missed the playoffs for the first 
time since 1980-81. The Capitals, just one season after making the 
finals, finished 31-45-6.

<HEADLINE> Russia Demands End to NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin warned today that Russia  
may pull out of Yugoslav peace efforts if its proposals are not 
taken into consideration, Russian news agencies reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The weight of the threat was unclear, as the announcement came  
on a day of political turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours earlier, Yeltsin fired Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,  
igniting a major political crisis -- and the day before impeachment 
proceedings against Yeltsin were scheduled to begin in Russia's 
parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Primakov's dismissal is likely to have serious implications for  
the Kosovo crisis. Russia's internal political problems could 
distract the Kremlin's efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the 
Balkan conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not taking part in this war, it is not our country that  
started it,'' Yeltsin said before Russia's Security Council today, 
the ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people obviously aren't understanding our repeated  
proposals'' for solving the crisis around the Yugoslav province of 
Kosovo, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has opposed NATO's airstrikes on Yugoslavia but has  
sought to mediate a political solution, sending envoys shuttling 
around Europe for talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said there is little  
hope of finding a quick political solution if NATO persists in its 
airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov lashed out at NATO's insistence that it will continue its  
strikes as he began talks with Deputy Secretary of State Strobe 
Talbott, who is seeking Moscow's support for a negotiated deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This does not benefit the negotiating process. If the NATO  
military leadership pursues this course, all efforts aimed at 
seeking a political settlement might become futile,'' Ivanov said. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbott said NATO's strategy on Kosovo had not changed despite  
Russia's insistence that successful negotiations can't take place 
unless NATO bombing halts. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting with Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, Talbott said  
NATO's position is ``clear and firm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Talbott said he and Ivanov also discussed a peace plan worked  
out by the seven leading industrial nations and Russia earlier this 
month in Bonn. The two made no major breakthroughs. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Ivanov said there was a chance that the talks with  
Talbott could produce a breakthrough. He said the two sides would 
try to work out a common approach on a Kosovo settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin discussed the Kosovo situation today with his special  
envoy on the problem, ex-premier Viktor Chernomyrdin, to see if 
there was any way to advance the diplomatic process. Talbott was to 
meet later with Chernomyrdin. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and NATO want Moscow to back their demands on  
ending the conflict. Moscow backs a peacekeeping force for Kosovo 
and the return of refugees, but has not agreed to NATO's demand for 
the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces from the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has demanded a halt to the NATO attacks despite the  
alliance's insistence that it will not stop until Belgrade meets 
its basic demands. 
</P>
<P>
	French President Jacques Chirac was due to arrive in Moscow  
later today. Kosovo was expected to top the agenda of his talks 
with Russian leaders, including Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin hinted that Russia and China might coordinate their  
attempts to solve the crisis, but would offer no more details. He 
did, however, say that China might take part in a U.N. peacekeeping 
force in Kosovo, if the Yugoslav government agrees to such a force.

<HEADLINE> US Ambassador Leaves China Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- A relieved Ambassador James Sasser left the  
glass-strewn U.S. Embassy this morning as days of anti-American 
protests ended, and Chinese citizens wept as the remains of three 
journalists killed in the NATO bombing in Belgrade were brought 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Escorted by several embassy staff members, Sasser walked across  
the debris-covered embassy driveway and through the compound's 
gates for the first time since protests began Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's terrific to be outside,'' said Sasser, his relief  
tempered by ``great sadness'' about the deaths in the bombing of 
the Chinese embassy in the Yugoslav capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we need to give our Chinese friends a day of grief,  
and then we can move on and discuss with them how to mend this 
situation,'' Sasser said. 
</P>
<P>
	While leaving the embassy, Sasser walked past a wreath of paper  
flowers -- a traditional symbol of mourning -- and piles of rocks and 
plastic bottles left by protesters. Red and blue paint spattered 
the front of the embassy, its broken windows boarded up. The bent, 
paint-bombed eagle-emblazoned national emblem was gone from the 
gate, removed by embassy workers. 
</P>
<P>
	His departure was unexpected. On Tuesday, hundreds of protesters  
hurled concrete chunks and abuse at the embassy for a fourth day in 
a row. Sasser said in an interview Tuesday night he was staying put 
and warned that the return to Beijing of the bombing victims' 
remains could touch off more unrest. 
</P>
<P>
	But streets around the embassy district were quiet today. Police  
checked identity papers and turned people away from the entrance to 
seven-block protest route that snaked past the U.S. and British 
embassies. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of Chinese lined streets from the airport today to  
watch a motorcade of buses, ambulances and cars carrying the 
remains of the three journalists killed and the more than 20 
embassy employees wounded in Friday's bombing in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese officials have hailed the dead as martyrs and heroes.  
Relatives and others cried as family members of the dead walked 
onto a red carpet at the airport tarmac in a solemn procession with 
Chinese soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	The relatives carried three large photographs of the dead  
decorated with black ribbons. The father who lost both his daughter 
and son-in-law in the attack carried two boxes of remains. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Hu Jintao -- and 1,000 invited school children,  
workers and soldiers -- greeted the relatives and the wounded 
diplomats in a ceremony broadcast live on television. Hu also held 
the bandaged hand of a man lying on a hospital gurney, his head and 
eyes covered by gauze. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to express sincere sympathy on behalf of the central  
authorities,'' state television showed Hu saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's bombing killed Shao Yunhuan, 48, of the official Xinhua  
News Agency, and Xu Xinghu, 31, and his wife, Zhu Ying, 27, both of 
the Guangming Daily, a national newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Hu and four other members of the  
senior Communist leadership went first to Xinhua and then to 
Guangming Daily to pay their respects. They bowed three times 
before portraits of the dead journalists and conveyed condolences 
to their families, state media reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Flags on government buildings and in Beijing's central Tiananmen  
Square were lowered to half-staff, as were the American flags at 
the U.S. Embassy and consulates and the national flags of other 
diplomatic missions throughout China. 
</P>
<P>
	Military police ringed the German Embassy. German Chancellor  
Gerhard Schroeder arrived earlier today for a one-day trip aimed at 
urging China to support a peace plan for Yugoslavia despite the 
bombing of its embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	Protests, at their most virulent on Sunday, dwindled Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	A few people continued to express outrage at the attack, but  
said they would await the U.S. and NATO response to China's demands 
for an investigation and punishment of those responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States has no right to be the international  
policeman,'' said Wang Wei, a university student who had protested 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Angered by Friday's bombing, Chinese have protested in 20 cities  
in the largest demonstrations since the Tiananmen Square democracy 
protests 10 years ago. Protesters have thrown gas and stink bombs 
at the U.S. Embassy and set fire to the U.S. consul's residence in 
Chengdu. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no feelings of anger at all,'' Sasser said. ``Many of  
us who were here and who talked to our Chinese friends can 
understand their feelings of anguish and grief and for some a 
feeling of rage that this occurred. It was indeed a terrible, 
terrible tragic mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sasser underscored U.S. intentions to pursue better relations --  
despite China's decision to roll back some hard-won gains. To 
protest the bombing, China suspended contacts with the United 
States on military relations, human rights arms control and other 
security issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese leaders have refused to condemn the protests, which were  
abetted by party-run organizations and biased coverage in the 
state-controlled media. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports of U.S. and NATO apologies, some of which were made  
shortly after the bombing, first appeared in the Chinese media on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	National newspapers reported today that Chinese found the words  
of regret ``were not the open and just apology demanded by the 
Chinese government.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	LUCEDALE, Miss. (AP) -- Buffalo Bills receiver Eric Moulds must  
serve a 30-day jail term for contempt of court for delaying child 
support payments, George County Chancery Court records show. 
</P>
<P>
	Moulds, a former Mississippi State standout and the Bills top  
draft choice in 1996, was accused of failing to make the payments 
to support his 8-year-old son for a three-year period. 
</P>
<P>
	Chancery Judge Pat Watts Jr. imposed a 90-day sentence during  
Tuesday's hearing, but suspended 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were not asking that he be put in jail, but pay punitive  
damages,'' said Robert Shepard, the attorney for Bridget Bradley, 
the child's mother. ``But the judge said that was an option he 
could not do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moulds was booked into the George County Jail Tuesday and  
released on $2,500 bond later that afternoon. He is appealing the 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Court officials said Moulds gave his address as West Seneca,  
N.Y., a suburb of Buffalo. However, there was no telephone listing 
for the athlete in that city. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard said that while Moulds was attending Mississippi State  
he was ordered to pay $50 a week in child support to his son, 
provide his income tax returns to Bradley and provide medical and 
dental insurance to the boy as soon as he was financially able to 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mrs. Bradley wanted the income tax returns so the amount of  
child support could be adjusted, since Mr. Moulds was paying the 
minimum in child support as a student,'' Shepard said. 
</P>
<P>
	But from 1996-1998, years in which Moulds was getting more than  
$1 million a year from the Bills, he only paid $350 in child 
support and failed to provide medical insurance or tax returns, 
Shepard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moulds paid all of the back child support and complied with the  
other arrangements on Jan. 7, a few days before he was to go to 
court over the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard said he decided to seek punitive damages, to show Moulds  
``you can't wait until the last minute to pay these sorts of 
things. For three years, my client and her son didn't have money 
that was owed them, when he more than had the ability to pay it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case was Mould's second run-in with legal problems since  
turning pro. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Moulds pleaded guilty in Buffalo to harassment after he  
was charged with attacking his former girlfriend and a Buffalo 
State College student. 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, Buffalo City Judge Robert Russell fined Moulds  
$540 and ordered him to perform 80 hours of community service.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Lower at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks slipped at midday Thursday  
following news U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin will step down. 
The dollar was higher against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 52.54 points,  
or 0.31 percent, ending the morning session at 16,894.82. On 
Wednesday, the average rose 204.18 points, or 1.22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.10 yen at midday, up 0.24 yen from late  
Wednesday in Tokyo and also higher than its late New York level of 
120.95 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss in the Tokyo Stock Exchange was limited in part because  
many players consider the choice of Rubin's successor, Deputy 
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, as signaling continuity rather 
than divergence in U.S. financial policies, said Tsuyoshi 
Nomaguchi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	President Bill Clinton announced Wednesday that he would  
nominate Summers, a former Harvard University professor who has 
worked closely with Rubin, as his third Treasury secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock market sentiment in Tokyo was also hurt after Russian  
President Boris Yeltsin on Wednesday dismissed his prime minister, 
Yevgeny Primakov, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 6.51 points, or 0.48 percent, to 1,354.64. 
The TOPIX closed up 5.33 points, or 0.39 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar was moving little after gaining  
ground on dollar-buying prompted by a belief that Rubin's successor 
may maintain a strong dollar policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday morning, Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's vice finance  
minister for international affairs, said he doesn't expect any 
change in U.S. foreign exchange policy because of Rubin's 
departure, expected around July 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will continue on course. They have a very strong team,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro declined because of Primakov's dismissal.  
The currency was traded at 128.94 yen at midday, down from 129.15 
yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.350 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.340 percent, driving 
its price down to 101.33 yen from 101.42 yen.

<HEADLINE>  Treasury Secretary Rubin Resigning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, idolized on  
Wall Street for the policies many credit with spurring the record 
U.S. economic boom, is stepping down. President Clinton said he 
will nominate Rubin's deputy, Lawrence Summers, to succeed him. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in a Rose Garden ceremony, said Rubin has been  
acclaimed as the most effective treasury secretary since Alexander 
Hamilton, the first man to hold the job. Clinton said that acclaim 
has been ``well-deserved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I will miss his cool head and steady hand,'' Clinton said.  
``He cares very deeply about the impact of abstract economics on 
ordinary people. I can tell you that for all these years, he has 
always been one of the administration's most powerful advocates for 
the poor and for our cities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also lavished praise on Summers, a former Harvard  
University professor who oversaw the administration's efforts to 
stem the Asian financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is brilliant, able, a critical part of our economic team  
during the entire life of this administration -- therefore, deeply 
knowledgeable, more than ready to steer our nation through the 
strong and sometimes turbulent currents of the new economy,'' the 
president said. ``Rarely has any individual been so well-prepared 
to become secretary of the Treasury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president announced the changes at a ceremony attended by  
members of his Cabinet and the Congress. Federal Reserve Chairman 
Alan Greenspan joined in. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin appeared bemused by the attention and applause. He twitted  
Clinton about the president's habitual tardiness, showing up 15 
minutes late for today's ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Summing up his service, Rubin said, ``It's been a truly  
extraordinary experience.'' He said that Clinton and Vice President 
Al Gore ``have repositioned our country with respect to fiscal 
discipline, with respect to leadership on international economic 
issues that are so critical to economic well-being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said it was hard for him to leave, because of his  
commitment to the administration. But he said his 6 1/2 years in 
Washington had been ``all consuming'' and that it was time to 
return to his home in New York. He said he would leave his job 
around July 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuart Eizenstat, an undersecretary at the State Department, was  
chosen by Clinton to replace Summers as second in command at 
Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said he expected that the administration ``will not miss a  
beat'' on the economy with the new team named by the president. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 200 points  
when news of Rubin's resignation first was reported but quickly 
recovered most of that ground and closed down 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, a former investment banker, and Federal Reserve Chairman  
Alan Greenspan were widely credited by Wall Street and business 
leaders with the policies that set the U.S. economy on its longest 
peacetime expansion in history. 
</P>
<P>
	When Clinton took office, unemployment was at 6.9 percent, the  
nation's budget deficit was at $255 billion and the Dow Jones 
industrial average was below 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Unemployment now is at 4.3 percent, the nation will have a  
budget surplus this year and the market recently topped 11,000 for 
the first time, creating new wealth for millions of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, 73, a Republican whose term as Fed chairman ends in  
June 2000, is thought to want a fourth four-year term. Rubin has 
long been considered a candidate to replace him if, instead, 
Greenspan chooses to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has been one of the most effective secretaries of the  
Treasury in this nation's history,'' Greenspan said in a statement 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Rubin fought with Republican leaders in Congress during  
a 1997 budget fight that shut down the federal government, many 
Republicans also praised him as the administration's voice for 
spending restraint. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of all the officials in the Clinton administration, he has had  
more credibility with me, and I think with Congress, than any other 
official,'' the Senate Banking Committee chairman, Sen. Phil Gramm, 
R-Texas, said today. ``He will certainly be missed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the top Democrat on the House  
Ways and Means Committee, said Rubin often repaired frayed ties 
when Clinton appeared to bypass Democrats and negotiate directly 
with the GOP on taxes or welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the man,'' Rangel said. ``Thank God during all these  
times we knew we had someone we could depend on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he foresaw no  
problems with the Senate confirming Summers as Rubin's successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin's departure was not unexpected. It has long been rumored  
that the former investment banker, who made $26 million in private 
life with the investment firm of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. the year 
before joining the administration in 1993, wanted to return to 
private life. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Judith, has never moved to Washington, living in New  
York City throughout his term in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said Rubin, 60, discussed his decision  
with Clinton ``within the past week'' and said Rubin's decision was 
fueled solely by his desire to return to private life. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin had considered leaving sooner, but not during the Monica  
Lewinsky scandal, said one official familiar with his thinking. The 
official said Rubin is expected to stay at Treasury through July. 
</P>
<P>
	Before taking over at Treasury in 1995, succeeding former Sen.  
Lloyd Bentsen, Rubin headed Clinton's National Economic Council, 
with the task of creating harmony among more than a dozen agencies 
that advise the president on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining the Clinton administration, Rubin had spent  
nearly his entire career inside Goldman, Sachs, one of Wall 
Street's most powerful money machines. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the company in 1966, and became a young star in risk  
arbitrage -- speculating on the stocks of companies subject to 
takeover attempts. He later ran the firm's stock and bond trading 
departments, and revived its commodities subsidiary. He became 
co-chairman of the company in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with his strong business ties, Rubin proudly proclaims his  
Democratic heritage. He said it comes from his grandfather, a 
leader in a machine-style Brooklyn political club.

<HEADLINE> Tourism Helping Bolivian Mine Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POTOSI, Bolivia (AP) -- Miguel Angel Delgadillo helps a group of  
German tourists put on hard hats, rubber boots and jackets, then 
hands them a carbon lamp. Chewing coca leaf, he leads then into the 
Grito de Piedra mine. 
</P>
<P>
	After an hour of crouching, jumping over deep holes and avoiding  
protruding rocks, Delgadillo and the tourists arrive in front of 
the ``Tio'' statue, the devilish-looking protector of the Cerro 
Rico -- Rich Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Here, he tells the visitors about the legends of the mountain  
that once made Potosi a wealthy city by churning out silver, tin 
and zinc. And he talks about the tough life and harsh working 
conditions that have claimed the lives of countless miners over the 
centuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourism in this colonial-era city of 130,000 people has taken a  
welcome twist -- struggling miners cooperatives are augmenting their 
incomes by cashing in on the growing number of vacationers who are 
looking for something different. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, visitors came to Potosi to see the imposing Spanish  
Mint and the beautiful churches with gold-leafed altars and 
elaborately carved stone facades. But today, the main attraction is 
the chance to view some of the 30 miles of shafts where miners eke 
out livings digging with hand tools, sometimes working 24-hour 
shifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 65,000 tourists visited Potosi, and most paid from  
$24 to $40 for an underground tour. The number of visitors is 
expected to increase by around 10 percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going into this mine is like going back centuries and seeing  
how the miners have worked under such difficult conditions,'' said 
Kurt Rabe, a German tourist. 
</P>
<P>
	The miners, whose earnings generally run about $15 to $35 a  
week, are delighted. ``For us, tourism represents a new source of 
income,'' said Delgadillo. 
</P>
<P>
	Miners cooperatives took over the Cerro Rico shafts after the  
Bolivian government abandoned money-losing state mines in the 
mid-1980s, laying off tens of thousands of workers. 
</P>
<P>
	But with their inefficient operations, the cooperatives have  
fared no better -- only 850, with 12,000 members, survive from the 
5,000 co-ops registered in 1985 and many are expected to fold soon. 
Only one mine in the mountain, the Pailaviri, is operated by a 
private company that uses modern technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Delgadillo and other miners lead tourists through dark and humid  
tunnels and descend on hand-cranked elevators into shafts where 
miners work in loincloths because temperatures can rise to 95 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the stops is where miners daily pay homage to the Tio,  
the devil responsible for keeping them safe. Miners, and 
adventuresome tourists, sprinkle coca leaves on the statue and chew 
a few of the stimulant leaves. 
</P>
<P>
	The miners take the Tio seriously and warn their visitors that  
those who do not believe in the Tio or make fun of it will be 
cursed. 
</P>
<P>
	According to one of the legends they recount, a young miner  
insulted the Tio after hours of drinking liquor during a 
celebration. As he left the mine, the shaft caved in and the miner 
was swallowed up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even today, this mountain, the source of so much wealth,  
continues to claim the lives of my fellow miners,'' Delgadillo 
said. ``But until tourism brought in additional income, mining was 
what sustained us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Potosi was decreed an ``imperial city'' by King Charles V of  
Spain in 1553 -- 57 years before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth 
Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1650, Potosi was the largest city in the Americas, with a  
population of 160,000. It was renowned for its silver mines, 
magnificent architecture, churches glistening with gold, and 
theaters featuring the best of European production. 
</P>
<P>
	The echoes of its fabulous colonial past can still be seen in  
its churches and in privates houses with wooden balconies looking 
over the narrow, winding streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Among several fine museums is Casa de la Moneda, or Mint, which  
has served as a mint, fortress and prison since it was built in 
1572. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the city's residents, dressed in fine, hand-woven wool  
garments, carry on the cultural traditions of their Quechua Indian 
ancestors. Others, wearing modern clothing, are the Creole 
descendants of Spaniards and other Indians who were lured to Potosi 
by the mines. 
</P>
<P>
	Potosi is nestled at the foot of the Cerro Rico on a plateau  
13,400 feet above sea level, surrounded by mountains and valleys 
that are part of the eastern edge of the Andes.

<HEADLINE> Memphis Hospital Announces Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- St. Jude Children's Research Hospital  
announced a $1 billion expansion plan Wednesday that will allow its 
scientists to research rare genetic and infectious diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	With the expansion, to be completed in six or seven years, the  
hospital will add the Children's Infection Defense Center and the 
Pediatric Genetic Diseases Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The infection center, while continuing the hospital's work on  
bone marrow transplantation, will focus on finding vaccines and new 
therapies for such diseases as AIDS, pneumonia, tuberculosis and 
cholera. 
</P>
<P>
	The other new center will search for genetic causes and  
treatments for problems such as sickle cell anemia, brittle bone 
disease, hemophilia and inherited immune deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Jude patients are admitted regardless of their ability to  
pay. Richard Shadyac, executive director of St. Jude's fund-raising 
arm, said the hospital has already raised a good portion of the $1 
billion.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Billboards Come Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A convenience store chain announced today  
that it will take down cigarette billboards in five states that 
critics said violated a 46-state agreement with the tobacco 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Wawa Food Markets said in a statement that although the  
settlement's ban on tobacco billboard advertising did not include 
retailers, the chain was discontinuing the practice voluntarily 
because it created ``confusion in the marketplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Barg, a medical newsletter publisher who heads the  
antismoking group Tobacco Free Education and Action Coalition for 
Health, said Wawa's decision may have been prompted by plans for a 
demonstration at a Wawa billboard that was to be filmed by ABC's 
``Good Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barg said he was glad the signs were coming down but unhappy  
that their legality remained unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wawa is painting this as a purely voluntary action on their  
part,'' he said. ``If that is not clarified by the attorney general 
and the tobacco companies, then that gives license to other 
retailers who are less responsible to do this advertising, totally 
negating the billboard advertising provisions of the settlement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania Attorney General Mike Fisher praised Wawa's  
decision, which he said followed discussions he had with a company 
vice president, whom he did not identify. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Fisher said he was committed to enforcing the tobacco  
settlement's ban on billboard advertising, he stopped short of 
saying that the ban applies to retailers. ``The cooperation of 
responsible retailers like Wawa helps in that goal,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco industry settlement with 46 states required  
cigarette companies to strip the Marlboro man and other cigarette 
symbols from billboards by April 23. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wawa, a privately-held chain of nearly 500 stores in  
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia, 
continued to feature a bright red pack of Marlboros with the words 
``$2.19 for limited time only,'' on many of its highway billboards. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher said 100 billboards in the five states, including about  
40 in Pennsylvania, were expected to be removed within about 10 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognize that our continued use of tobacco billboards  
created confusion in the marketplace,'' Wawa said in its statement. 
``Following discussions with the attorney general ... and 
evaluating consumer response, we voluntarily decided to discontinue 
our long-standing practice of tobacco billboard advertising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barg said ``Good Morning America'' called him after an  
Associated Press story last week described Wawa's plans to continue 
advertising cigarettes on billboards. He said he was interviewed by 
the television show on Wednesday and had planned a demonstration 
Thursday at a Wawa billboard in Manayunk. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to try to mark this occasion of the first major  
test of the tobacco settlement and try to establish clearly that 
this is not purely a matter of voluntary restraint, but something 
that violates the settlement,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> SEC Targets Internet Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators have charged 18 people and  
eight companies with using the Internet to defraud investors, in a 
third nationwide ``sweep'' against online investment scams. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the action  
Wednesday, alleging that 14 separate schemes deceived investors 
around the world by selling bogus securities over the Internet. All 
told, the investors lost around $2.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegedly fraudulent investments included interests in gold  
mines, computer software, prefabricated hospitals in Turkey and a 
product described as a new way of processing gold. Eight of the 
cases involved the sale of so-called ``prime bank'' notes, what the 
SEC said were nonexistent securities promoted as being 
high-yielding, risk-free investments. 
</P>
<P>
	The market watchdog agency made the allegations in eight civil  
lawsuits and six administrative actions. All 14 cases involved 
people allegedly selling or marketing phony securities using the 
World Wide Web and making ``outrageous'' promises to investors, 
such as annual returns exceeding 100 percent or even 2000 percent 
of an initial investment. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC also charged several individuals with acting as  
unregistered brokers and selling unregistered securities. 
</P>
<P>
	In some of the cases, the agency said its 200-member Internet  
surveillance team discovered the questionable offerings before any 
securities were sold, preventing any potential investors from 
losing money. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is in many respects a pre-emptive strike,'' SEC  
Enforcement Director Richard Walker told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Smith, director of the SEC's Office of Investor Education  
and Assistance, said, ``People spend more time choosing a computer 
than they spend researching Internet investments. Investors can 
take their own pre-emptive strikes against Internet fraud simply by 
checking out investments before they buy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC was seeking civil fines and court orders against the  
investment promoters and companies, compelling them to refrain from 
the allegedly fraudulent activity. In two of the cases, federal 
judges have granted temporary restraining orders against the 
promoters and companies. One of the cases was settled, with the 
person charged neither admitting nor denying wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The actions were seemingly mild, but the regulators' options are  
limited. They do not have legal authority to shut down investment 
promoters' Web sites, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	The civil enforcement actions were brought by SEC's headquarters  
in Washington and by its offices in Atlanta; Boston; Denver; Fort 
Worth, Texas; New York; Philadelphia and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The actions were the latest moves in a nationwide crackdown  
against investment fraud in cyberspace started by the SEC last 
October. In ``sweeps'' in October and February, the agency targeted 
people promoting legitimate stocks over the Internet who don't 
disclose they are paid to do so by the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Such stock promotions are known as ``touting.'' Stock touting is  
not illegal in and of itself, but any compensation received from 
the companies must be fully disclosed, including the nature and 
amount of payment in cash or stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker said Wednesday that as a result of the SEC's previous  
action, disclosure by Internet touters has been ``substantially 
enhanced'' but is still not ``perfect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., chairman of a Senate Appropriations  
subcommittee, recently proposed increasing the SEC's budget, now at 
$337.4 million, by $5.5 million next year to fight investment fraud 
over the Internet. That would bring the agency's funding to the 
level requested by the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cops won't catch every crook in cyberspace, so investors  
need to watch out for themselves,'' said Peter Hildreth, president 
of the North American Securities Administrators Association, which 
represents state securities regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regulators will not allow con artists and charlatans to hijack  
... (the Internet) and turn it into the electronic equivalent of a 
restroom wall,'' he added.

<HEADLINE>  Treasury Secretary Rubin Resigning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, idolized on  
Wall Street for the policies many credit with spurring the record 
U.S. economic boom, is stepping down. President Clinton said he 
will nominate Rubin's deputy, Lawrence Summers, to succeed him. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in a Rose Garden ceremony, said Rubin has been  
acclaimed as the most effective treasury secretary since Alexander 
Hamilton, the first man to hold the job. Clinton said that acclaim 
has been ``well-deserved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I will miss his cool head and steady hand,'' Clinton said.  
``He cares very deeply about the impact of abstract economics on 
ordinary people. I can tell you that for all these years, he has 
always been one of the administration's most powerful advocates for 
the poor and for our cities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also lavished praise on Summers, a former Harvard  
University professor who oversaw the administration's efforts to 
stem the Asian financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is brilliant, able, a critical part of our economic team  
during the entire life of this administration -- therefore, deeply 
knowledgeable, more than ready to steer our nation through the 
strong and sometimes turbulent currents of the new economy,'' the 
president said. ``Rarely has any individual been so well-prepared 
to become secretary of the Treasury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president announced the changes at a ceremony attended by  
members of his Cabinet and the Congress. Federal Reserve Chairman 
Alan Greenspan joined in. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin appeared bemused by the attention and applause. He twitted  
Clinton about the president's habitual tardiness, showing up 15 
minutes late for today's ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Summing up his service, Rubin said, ``It's been a truly  
extraordinary experience.'' He said that Clinton and Vice President 
Al Gore ``have repositioned our country with respect to fiscal 
discipline, with respect to leadership on international economic 
issues that are so critical to economic well-being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said it was hard for him to leave, because of his  
commitment to the administration. But he said his 6 1/2 years in 
Washington had been ``all consuming'' and that it was time to 
return to his home in New York. He said he would leave his job 
around July 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuart Eizenstat, an undersecretary at the State Department, was  
chosen by Clinton to replace Summers as second in command at 
Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said he expected that the administration ``will not miss a  
beat'' on the economy with the new team named by the president. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 200 points  
when news of Rubin's resignation first was reported but quickly 
recovered most of that ground and closed down 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, a former investment banker, and Federal Reserve Chairman  
Alan Greenspan were widely credited by Wall Street and business 
leaders with the policies that set the U.S. economy on its longest 
peacetime expansion in history. 
</P>
<P>
	When Clinton took office, unemployment was at 6.9 percent, the  
nation's budget deficit was at $255 billion and the Dow Jones 
industrial average was below 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Unemployment now is at 4.3 percent, the nation will have a  
budget surplus this year and the market recently topped 11,000 for 
the first time, creating new wealth for millions of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, 73, a Republican whose term as Fed chairman ends in  
June 2000, is thought to want a fourth four-year term. Rubin has 
long been considered a candidate to replace him if, instead, 
Greenspan chooses to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has been one of the most effective secretaries of the  
Treasury in this nation's history,'' Greenspan said in a statement 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Rubin fought with Republican leaders in Congress during  
a 1997 budget fight that shut down the federal government, many 
Republicans also praised him as the administration's voice for 
spending restraint. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of all the officials in the Clinton administration, he has had  
more credibility with me, and I think with Congress, than any other 
official,'' the Senate Banking Committee chairman, Sen. Phil Gramm, 
R-Texas, said today. ``He will certainly be missed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the top Democrat on the House  
Ways and Means Committee, said Rubin often repaired frayed ties 
when Clinton appeared to bypass Democrats and negotiate directly 
with the GOP on taxes or welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the man,'' Rangel said. ``Thank God during all these  
times we knew we had someone we could depend on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he foresaw no  
problems with the Senate confirming Summers as Rubin's successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin's departure was not unexpected. It has long been rumored  
that the former investment banker, who made $26 million in private 
life with the investment firm of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. the year 
before joining the administration in 1993, wanted to return to 
private life. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Judith, has never moved to Washington, living in New  
York City throughout his term in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said Rubin, 60, discussed his decision  
with Clinton ``within the past week'' and said Rubin's decision was 
fueled solely by his desire to return to private life. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin had considered leaving sooner, but not during the Monica  
Lewinsky scandal, said one official familiar with his thinking. The 
official said Rubin is expected to stay at Treasury through July. 
</P>
<P>
	Before taking over at Treasury in 1995, succeeding former Sen.  
Lloyd Bentsen, Rubin headed Clinton's National Economic Council, 
with the task of creating harmony among more than a dozen agencies 
that advise the president on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining the Clinton administration, Rubin had spent  
nearly his entire career inside Goldman, Sachs, one of Wall 
Street's most powerful money machines. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the company in 1966, and became a young star in risk  
arbitrage -- speculating on the stocks of companies subject to 
takeover attempts. He later ran the firm's stock and bond trading 
departments, and revived its commodities subsidiary. He became 
co-chairman of the company in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with his strong business ties, Rubin proudly proclaims his  
Democratic heritage. He said it comes from his grandfather, a 
leader in a machine-style Brooklyn political club.

	Negotiators Agree on Kosovo Funds  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional negotiators agreed today to  
provide $11.6 billion for the air assault on Yugoslavia and to 
boost overall defense spending, nearly doubling the amount 
President Clinton requested. But disputes over lawmakers' demands 
for favored items were holding up the bill. The biggest chunk of 
the bill -- and the item with the strongest political appeal -- was 
the money for U.S. participation in NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia. 
Clinton sought $6 billion, but negotiators added $5.6 billion for a 
troop pay raise, equipment maintenance, refugee assistance and 
weapons purchases.

	US Remains Firm on China, WTO Entry  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Clinton administration will remain firm  
on requirements for China's entry to the World Trade Organization 
while seeking to ease tensions caused by the accidental bombing of 
the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia, Commerce Secretary William Daley 
said today. The bombing has complicated negotiations, but there are 
no plans to back off concessions won during negotiations before 
Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to Washington last month or demands that 
China further open its markets. NATO officials blamed the bombing 
mistake on outdated maps.

	Treasury Secretary To Resign  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who helped  
spur the national economy into an unprecedented expansion, 
announced his resignation today. President Clinton said he would 
nominate Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, a former 
Harvard professor, as his third Treasury secretary. Rubin told 
reporters after the announcement that he has not made any decision 
on what position he will take after leaving the administration.

	Gun-Show Restrictions Rejected  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled Senate rejected  
restrictions on sales at gun shows today in Congress' first vote on 
gun control since last month's shooting spree in a Colorado high 
school. Instead, on a vote of 53-45, the Senate supported voluntary 
background checks on private sales at gun shows. The developments 
marked a defeat for gun control advocates, who had claimed the 
shooting at Columbine High School would give their cause momentum. 
Instead, their plan was killed 51-47.

	RIO RANCHO, N.M. (AP) -- An associate of Dr. Jack Kevorkian is  
under investigation in the death of a 54-year-old woman who had 
multiple sclerosis. Police said today that evidence relating to the 
woman's death has been recovered from Dr. Georges Reding's home 
near Galesburg, Mich. Reding was arrested last year with Kevorkian 
when the pair dropped off a body at a suburban Detroit hospital. 
Reding was found innocent of charges he interfered with police and 
resisted arrest.

	Berlin Airlift Anniversary Marked  
</P>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Allied air power overcame the Soviet blockade of  
West Berlin 50 years ago and will carry NATO through to victory in 
its fight over Kosovo, the British defense minister said today. At 
a ceremony marking the anniversary, George Robertson said the 
airlift to ``save a free Berlin'' showed ``that our armed forces 
can and should be a real force for good in the world. That is our 
clear and unmistakable message'' in the current campaign in Kosovo, 
he said. Later, he said that NATO's air campaign alone would force 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to accept the alliance's 
conditions to end the conflict.

	Knicks Crush Heat 97-73  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Knicks unleashed one of the most  
dominant flurries imaginable tonight, using an incredible 32-2 run 
to take control of the game -- and their first-round series -- in 
defeating the Miami Heat 97-73. The victory gave the Knicks a 2-1 
lead in the best-of-5 series and left Miami on the brink of 
first-round elimination at New York's hands for the second-straight 
season. A multi-pronged offense boosted the Knicks as Latrell 
Sprewell scored 20 off the bench, Allan Houston had 18, Patrick 
Ewing 15 and Marcus Camby 13.

final 51 minutes as the Buffalo Sabres skated to a 3-2 playoff win 
over the Bruins tonight. Rhett Warrener knocked in his own rebound 
to tie the game at 6:44 of the third period. Ward connected 2:54 
later as the Sabres took a 2-1 lead in the best-of-7 Eastern 
Conference semifinal series. Vaclav Varada passed from the side of 
the net to Ward in the slot and he scored from short range.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Wednesday he is  
nominating Prudence Bushnell, the ambassador and Africa expert 
wounded when terrorists bombed the U.S. Embassy in Kenya, to be 
U.S. ambassador to Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
	Bushnell, a career diplomat with 11 years' experience working in  
Africa or on Africa issues, must be confirmed by the Senate. 
</P>

	She served in Senegal and India before taking over as U.S.  
ambassador to Kenya in August 1996. Bushnell was among 5,000 people 
wounded last Aug. 7 when a bomb exploded at the embassy in downtown 
Nairobi, killing 213 people, including 12 Americans.

<HEADLINE> Americans Gear Up for Summer Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Temperatures won't be the only thing rising  
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans will travel in record numbers this year, despite an  
increase in gas, airline and car rental prices, according to an 
industry survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Vacationers plan to take 271 million trips this summer, a 4  
percent increase from last year, the Travel Industry Association of 
America said Tuesday in its annual forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we have the perfect recipe for a healthy summer  
travel season -- low inflation, rock-bottom unemployment and high 
consumer confidence,'' said Suzanne Cook, the group's senior vice 
president for research. ``Throw in a surging stock market and you 
have the makings for a robust summer travel season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to a survey the group conducted in April with AAA,  
American travelers intend to take more time off this year but spend 
less money doing it. They also plan to take just as many trips, if 
not more, than they did last year. A ``trip'' is considered any 
journey at least 100 miles from home. 
</P>
<P>
	The hot spots for vacationers remain the same. Most people -- 76  
percent -- plan to head to the beach or lake. Sixty-eight percent 
will visit a city and 45 percent a historic site and 42 percent 
have camping plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The travel industry group said more Americans are going to  
family reunions and casinos, while fewer plan to go fishing or 
attend cultural events. 
</P>
<P>
	Most people plan to reach their summer getaway by car.  
</P>
<P>
	Eighty-four percent of those surveyed said they plan to use an  
automobile to get places, despite rising gasoline prices. The 
current national average for regular unleaded fuel, $1.16 per 
gallon, is up 6 cents from last May and prices should continue to 
rise, but that probably won't change any minds, said Jack Mannix, 
an AAA spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we've seen historically is, Americans feel a sense of  
entitlement to a vacation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once in a while, what we do see is, if there is a price  
increase and people do want to economize because of that, they may 
go a little less distance, they may stay a little shorter period of 
time, but we don't anticipate a big impact from that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rising jet fuel prices also are likely to lead to higher air  
fares, but 13 percent of Americans still plan to travel by air this 
summer. That's a 3 percent increase over last year. 
</P>
<P>
	On average, those surveyed expect to spend $956 and 8.5 nights  
on their longest trip, down from the $972 and eight nights they 
spent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida continues to be Americans' top vacation spot, followed  
by California, Hawaii, Colorado and Texas. New York, Nevada, 
Arizona, Washington state and the District of Columbia were the 
other top 10 destination states. 
</P>
<P>
	The summer vacation season will be jump-started by Memorial Day  
weekend. AAA and the industry group expect a record 33.3 million 
Americans to travel during that holiday, a 4 percent increase over 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Travel Industry Association of America represents more than  
2,000 travel-related organizations, including tourism offices, 
visitor bureaus, hotels, airlines and cruise companies.

<HEADLINE> Fla. School Prayer Policy Thrown Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A Florida school system's policy allowing prayers  
during graduation ceremonies if students vote to have them violates 
constitutional protections of freedom of religion, a panel of 
federal appeals judges ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-1 decision by a panel of the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of  
Appeals overturns a lower court's ruling that students have a First 
Amendment right to pray at graduation, although schools can't force 
them to. 
</P>
<P>
	The Duval County, Fla., school system adopted a policy allowing  
high school students to select by majority vote a graduation 
message to be delivered by a student. Those messages -- often 
prayers -- could not be censored by school officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court ruled Tuesday that graduation ceremonies are  
still controlled by the schools, and graduating students who object 
to the prayers have no alternative but to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hold that the Duval County school system's policy coerces  
objecting students to participate in prayer,'' Chief Judge Joseph 
W. Hatchett wrote in the majority opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	In a dissenting opinion, Judge Stanley Marcus argued that the  
majority wrongly interprets the Supreme Court's ban on school 
prayer ``by somehow transforming a private speaker into a state 
actor and a student's message into the state establishment of 
religion.''

<HEADLINE> Eizenstat May Be No. 2 at Treasury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As a top economic affairs aide at the State  
Department, Stuart Eizenstat has been handed his share of 
controversial issues -- investment in Cuba by U.S. allies, Nazi 
gold, the use of sanctions as a tool of foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he is moving on to the No. 2 slot at the Treasury Department  
after two hectic years at State. 
</P>
<P>
	Pending Senate confirmation, Eizenstat will replace Deputy  
Secretary Larry Summers, who was tapped to succeed outgoing 
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury job will the fourth senior position for Eizenstat  
in the Clinton administration. In addition to his service at State, 
he was undersecretary of commerce for international trade and U.S. 
ambassador to the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Eizenstat, 56, first came to national attention in the late  
1970s as President Carter's chief adviser for domestic policy. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his most difficult assignments as undersecretary of state  
was to explain to allied countries legislation approved in 1996 
designed to punish foreign firms that invested in property in Cuba 
that had been confiscated from U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mexico, protesters tried to pelt Eizenstat with eggs.  
Everywhere Eizenstat went, Europe included, the reception was cool, 
prompting his State Department colleagues to facetiously dub the 
mission a ``victory tour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was sort of a boiling cauldron to get into,'' Eizenstat  
observed at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Issues left over from the Nazi era have consumed much of  
Eizenstat's considerable energies at State. Indeed, when worked 
leaked out Wednesday of his impending reassignment to Treasury, he 
was in discussions with German officials on an effort to settle 
claims by former Nazi-era slave laborers. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Eizenstat was the point man in an investigation into  
outside support for the Nazi military during World War II. The 
report concluded that trade with neutral nations helped feed the 
German war machine for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Desler, who worked for Eizenstat at Commerce and State,  
recalled Wednesday the ``tenacity and indefatigable perseverance'' 
with which Eizenstat fought for an international climate change 
treaty in Tokyo in 1997. During three days of talks, Eizenstat may 
have had four hours sleep, Desler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the pressure of the difficult assignments handed him,  
Desler said he never saw him lose his temper and always treated his 
staff with kindness. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's perhaps the most gracious boss I've ever worked for,''  
Desler said.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Bill Sparks Fights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House-Senate negotiators are driving toward  
giving President Clinton at least $4.9 billion more than he wanted 
for the air campaign against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	But first, lawmakers trying to wrap up a compromise wide-ranging  
spending bill will have to resolve disputes over mining 
regulations, Alaskan fishing and other issues. Bargainers from the 
two chambers planned to meet again today in hopes of shaking hands 
on a measure they want to zip through Congress this week. 
</P>
<P>
	While they were working on it, participants urged the White  
House to rethink its threat to veto the measure because of its 
excessive defense spending, cuts in domestic programs, and other 
provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration should wait to see what the product is,''  
said House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has asked for $6 billion for the bombing campaign  
against Yugoslavia. The House beefed that up to $13 billion last 
week, adding money for equipment, training, a pay raise for the 
troops and other items. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate never voted on a plan of its own. But during  
negotiations Tuesday, Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted 
Stevens, R-Alaska, offered $10.9 billion, knocking out $1 billion 
the House approved to modernize overseas U.S. military bases. 
</P>
<P>
	In effect, that became the minimum figure Congress is likely to  
provide for the conflict and for a GOP-led effort to beef up U.S. 
armed forces at home and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	House-Senate bargainers tentatively agreed to include $678  
million for refugees who have fled the province of Kosovo, $112 
million more than Clinton proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill contains nearly $1 billion to help Central America  
rebuild from recent natural disasters, particularly last fall's 
Hurricane Mitch, which devastated Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua 
and Costa Rica. Also sure to be included is aid to American farmers 
struggling because of plummeting prices for cotton, hogs and other 
commodities, and money to help the recovery from the recent 
Midwestern tornadoes and to buttress the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency's coffers for future disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond that, battles are being waged over provisions added by  
senators that include help for the steel, oil, gas, mining and 
ranching industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Pleas by House members to drop the items seemed to fall on ears  
that were all but deaf. 
</P>
<P>
	To one such request, Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., responded,  
``That great philosopher, Mae West, said, 'Too much of anything is 
simply wonderful.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd is author of language that would provide $140 million to  
some steel companies hurt by low-cost foreign competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Especially numerous were fights over environmental provisions.  
Environmental groups said senators were using the must-pass bill to 
carry language that otherwise would not pass. And led by Rep. 
Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., House GOP moderates circulated a letter 
saying the provisions ``would be a serious procedural, political 
and policy mistake that could jeopardize passage of any conference 
report on the House floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fights included:  
</P>
<P>
	--An effort by Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., to block the Fish and  
Wildlife Service from listing the Alabama sturgeon as an endangered 
species. He says such a listing would restrict dredging in the 
state's waterways, threatening the timber industry and other 
industries that ship their products on barges. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., was trying overturn a court ruling  
that mining companies can't expand their milling operations on 
public lands. Environmentalists complain those operations pollute 
water. The ruling affects the Crown Jewel gold mine in Gorton's 
state and other Western hard-rock mines. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, wants to prevent the National  
Park Service from phasing out commercial fishing in the waters off 
Glacier Bay National Park until courts decide the issue. 
Environmentalists say that could take years. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Night Lights May Ruin Kids' Vision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Children who sleep under the soft glow of a night light to keep  
the scary monsters away may be more likely to suffer a very real 
and lifelong problem -- nearsightedness. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and the Children's  
Hospital of Philadelphia say that youngsters who sleep in a dimly 
lighted room until age 2 may be as much as five times more likely 
to develop myopia, or nearsightedness, as they grow up. 
</P>
<P>
	Genetic and environmental factors, such as nutrition and  
eyestrain from television and computer screens, are thought to hurt 
people's vision. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia study raises the provocative new possibility  
that too much light prompts the eyes to grow excessively and skews 
their natural focus during the first two years of life, when the 
eyes develop most rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	The study of 479 children was published in Thursday's issue of  
the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just as the body needs to rest, this suggests that the eyes  
need a period of darkness,'' said opthamologist Dr. Graham E. 
Quinn, the study's lead author. 
</P>
<P>
	However, eye specialists from many institutions dismissed the  
study as premature and incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the researchers had failed to take into account  
obvious risk factors, such as heredity. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are other factors involved in childhood myopia, the most  
important of which is whether the parents are nearsighted or not,'' 
said myopia researcher Donald Mutti of the University of California 
at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, they said the study is flawed because the researchers  
relied on information supplied by the parents of nearsighted 
children after several years. Nor did they account for other, 
stronger sources of light that parents cannot control, such as a 
streetlight shining through a bedroom window. 
</P>
<P>
	A more reliable approach would be to conduct controlled  
experiments in the illuminated and darkened bedrooms of children, 
then check their vision several years later, the experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think a retrospective study based on a questionnaire  
is valid,'' said Dr. Robert Cykiert, an opthamologist at the New 
York University School of Medicine. ``They're grasping at straws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearsightedness results when the eye grows excessively and its  
shape is too long rather than perfectly round. This causes incoming 
light to converge in front of the retina instead of on it, making 
things blurry. 
</P>
<P>
	About one in four Americans is myopic. Children usually discover  
they are nearsighted when they have trouble seeing the blackboard. 
In most cases, myopia is corrected with glasses. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in life, nearsighted people are more likely to develop  
macular degeneration, detached retinas and other disorders that can 
lead to blindness. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia researchers asked the parents of children who  
had been patients at the doctors' eye clinic to recall the lighting 
conditions in the youngsters' bedrooms between birth and age 2. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 172 of the children slept in darkness; 10 percent  
developed nearsightedness. A total of 232 slept with a night light; 
34 percent had become nearsighted. An additional 75 slept with a 
lamp on; 55 percent developed myopia. 
</P>
<P>
	Quinn acknowledged the study does not conclusively demonstrate  
that low light cause myopia, but he urged parents to provide 
sleeping infants and toddlers with a dark bedroom -- within reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want parents to overreact and start putting up  
blackout shades,'' he said. ``We don't want to think they have to 
change a diaper in the dark, and drop their baby because they can't 
see what they're doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other researchers said parents should wait for the results of  
follow-up research before tossing their night lights in the trash. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutti said: ``Do what is comfortable for your children in order  
to get them to sleep.

<HEADLINE> Ill. Town Sues Gangs for Damages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CICERO, Ill. (AP) -- The Chicago suburb that passed a law exiling  
gang members is trying to empty their pockets on their way out of 
town. 
</P>
<P>
	Cicero, a blue-collar community of 70,000 that was once the base  
of Al Capone's bootlegging empire, is suing members of two street 
gangs, claiming they owe more than $11 million for the emotional 
distress and property damage inflicted on the town and its 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
	A second lawsuit also seeks to have hundreds of gang members  
declared public nuisances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's pretty clear this is the most extreme kind of  
nuisance you can get,'' Barry Pechter, Cicero's town attorney, said 
of gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits filed Tuesday name as defendants the Latin Kings  
and Noble Knights -- considered the two most active gangs in town -- 
along with 294 of their members known by nicknames like ``Capone'' 
and ``Bat Man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Cicero adopted an extraordinary ordinance aimed at  
running gang members out of town. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the law, believed to be the first of its kind in the  
nation, those involved in illegal gang activity have to promise not 
to do it again. If they refuse or go back on their word, they have 
60 days to leave Cicero or face a $500-a-day fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be punch two and three against the gang  
members,'' Betty Loren-Maltese, Cicero's town president, said of 
the lawsuits. ``They haven't seen punches four or five.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the claims for damages, the suits also seek court orders  
barring gang members from all sorts of activities, including 
``gathering or appearing anywhere in public'' with other 
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Chicago office of the American Civil Liberties  
Union, who criticized the ordinance approved last month as 
unconstitutional, declined to comment on the lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	But University of Chicago law Professor Stephen Schulhofer said  
government attempts to control gang activities have the potential 
to collide with basic freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone blocks the public way or breaks some law, they  
should be arrested,'' he said. ``What you worry about is when 
something like this gives (the town) the power to sweep every Latin 
kid off the street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Latin Kings are a mostly Hispanic. The Noble Knights are  
predominately white.

<HEADLINE> DeBartolo York Wants Suit Dismissal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Denise DeBartolo York has asked a federal  
judge in Ohio to dismiss a lawsuit her brother filed against her 
for breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
	York and the family-held Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. sued Edward  
DeBartolo Jr. in April, demanding he repay $94 million to the 
company. It also sought to oust DeBartolo from any management role 
with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The siblings each own a 50 percent stake in the family business,  
a Youngstown, Ohio-based real estate development firm that is also 
the nominal owner of the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo responded a week later with a $150 million lawsuit  
alleging that York reneged on a deal to turn the team over to him 
as part of an August 1998 agreement. That deal would have divided 
the assets of their jointly owned business, with DeBartolo gaining 
sole possession of the team in return for $350 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In her request for dismissal filed Wednesday, York said certain  
conditions of their deal were not met, rendering it null and void. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``spin-off'' deal would have given DeBartolo control of the  
49ers and York control over the remaining assets of the 
corporation. The conditions included the Internal Revenue Service 
declaring the transaction tax-free for both DeBartolo and the 
corporation and the NFL approving DeBartolo's ownership of the 
49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS said it couldn't rule because the NFL suspended  
DeBartolo from managing the 49ers, and the NFL said it doesn't give 
preapproval to anyone, York spokesman Sam Singer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She had no control over the IRS not issuing a ruling, she had  
no control over the NFL not giving preapproval, so she didn't 
breach her contract with Eddie,'' Singer said.

<HEADLINE> Worm Enzyme May Help Extend Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scientists have found an enzyme in worms that helps them live  
longer -- a discovery that raises hopes of finding treatments for 
Alzheimer's and other human diseases associated with aging. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step is to determine whether a similar enzyme exists in  
humans. 
</P>
<P>
	The finding ``gets us closer to understanding what's involved in  
the aging process and where we can intervene,'' said Anna 
McCormick, a biochemist at the National Institute on Aging. 
</P>
<P>
	The research was led by biologist Martin Chalfie at Columbia  
University. The findings were published in Thursday's issue of the 
journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers studied a nearly microscopic roundworm known as  
Caenorhabditis elegans. When it is well-fed, it survives only about 
three weeks, but it can withstand food shortages in a larval state 
for at least two months. Several genes in this worm were already 
linked to the larva's longer life, but their mechanism wasn't 
known. 
</P>
<P>
	The research team from Columbia and Dartmouth College identified  
an enzyme known as a cytosolic catalase that seems to act as a 
central agent in allowing some worms to live longer. 
</P>
<P>
	When the normal gene that makes the enzyme, ctl-1, is removed,  
the worms die sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers argue that cytosolic catalase allows longer life  
by performing a function it was already known to serve: blocking 
cell damage caused by oxygen compounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Such oxidative damage -- analogous to metal rusting -- is already  
implicated in human aging and diseases like Alzheimer's, Lou 
Gehrig's and Parkinson's. Vitamin E, an antioxidant, is now used to 
prevent heart attacks and treat Alzheimer's in some patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery of the catalase gene bolsters the theory that  
oxidative damage is central to both aging and its diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	The worm gene ``should give impetus to people working on the  
human genes to try to look for things like this,'' Chalfie said. It 
may eventually be possible to protect human nerve cells by boosting 
catalase with a drug, McCormick suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegfried Hakimi, a McGill University biologist who also studies  
life span in roundworms, said researchers should now seek to 
establish if higher levels of cytosolic catalase alone will make 
worms live longer, not just block cell damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Johnson, a University of Colorado geneticist who also works  
with roundworms, cautioned that their life-extending mechanisms may 
ultimately have limited relevance to human disease. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said researchers have made roundworms live five times  
longer with genetic manipulations. Johnson thinks such work 
suggests that people can also live longer with the right drug -- or 
mix of drugs -- in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure how much of a magic bullet it will be. I think it  
will be a variety of bullets,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Close Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks rose Wednesday on an overnight rise  
on Wall Street and investment in companies that have recently made 
bullish announcements. The U.S. dollar was lower against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 204.18  
points, or 1.22 percent, to finish the day at 16,947.36. On 
Tuesday, the average closed down 233.83 points, or 1.38 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.86 yen, down 0.02 yen from late Tuesday in  
Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 120.97 yen 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices bounced back, following  
Tuesday's gains in New York, where the Dow Jones industrial average 
jumped 18.90 to 11,026.15, just shy of its record high close of 
11,031.59 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in a number of technology companies, including Sony,  
Softbank and long-distance telephone carrier DDI, posted strong 
gains following a rise in their counterparts in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was supported by remarks from Okiharu Yasuoka, a  
member of the ruling Liberal Democrats, suggesting that the party 
would consider an extra budget. 
</P>
<P>
	But the government's continued vagueness on additional economic  
stimulus measures kept many investors on the sidelines and directed 
buyers toward companies that have been the focus of upbeat news. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Nintendo Co. and Matsushita Electric Industries Ltd.  
rose sharply on reports they will tie up to develop advanced game 
consoles. 
</P>
<P>
	Takeda Chemical Industries shares jumped after it said it would  
market a new drug to treat AIDS, and Taisho Pharmaceuticals posted 
hefty gains on news it will sell a U.S.-developed hair-growth 
stimulant in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei average moved as high as 17,104.49 during the  
morning, but profit-taking by domestic investors in the afternoon 
knocked the market off its early highs. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 5.33 points, or 0.39 percent, to 1,361.15. The 
TOPIX closed down 18.04 points, or 1.31 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 648.77 million shares, down from 727.60 million shares 
Tuesday. Advancing issues outnumbered retreaters 740 to 478, while 
105 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar slipped as selling of the  
greenback by Japanese exporters offset buying by Japanese 
institutional investors amid an absence of market-moving news. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dollar/yen rate has mostly been determined by Japanese  
investors and exporters recently,'' said Hirokazu Note, assistant 
general manager of foreign exchange at Sumitomo Bank. ``But they 
mostly balance each other out, leaving the dollar range-bound 
between 119.50 yen and 121.50 yen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yasuoka's comments on plans for an extra budget failed to boost  
the yen as traders awaited more concrete proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 120.60 yen and 121.10 yen in  
Wednesday's trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro remained under pressure due to continued unrest in  
Kosovo. It was quoted at 129.15 yen in morning trading, down from 
130.90 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 212 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.340 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.355 percent, 
driving its price up to 101.42 yen from 101.28 yen.

<HEADLINE> Sponsor: Public Wary on Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Public confidence in Olympic sponsors has  
dropped dramatically since the Salt Lake scandal, and the future of 
the games is threatened unless reforms are made quickly, the leader 
of one top sponsor said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	David D'Alessandro, president and chief operations officer of  
John Hancock, said three company surveys in recent weeks found 20 
percent of those questioned ``have now lost faith in not only the 
Olympics but in the companies that sponsor the Olympics and their 
products. That's a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another 30 percent to 40 percent of the 500 people surveyed said  
they ``certainly have lost some respect for the Olympics,'' said 
D'Alessandro, whose company pays more than $40 million for a berth 
in the International Olympic Committee's highest-level sponsorship 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 3 percent to 4 percent said they were more likely to buy an  
Olympic sponsor's product, the surveys found. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's really troubling is you have 20 percent who say, `I no  
longer think as highly of your company because you sponsor the 
Olympics and I'm seriously considering not buying your product,''' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings departed abruptly from previous Hancock surveys,  
which showed the public favored the company because of its Olympic 
role. 
</P>
<P>
	In canvassing just after the Winter Olympics in Nagano in  
February 1998, 30 percent of those questioned were ``more inclined 
to buy our products at that time because of the Olympics,'' 
D'Alessandro said in a telephone interview. Those surveys found the 
Olympics caused a negative response of just 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you put $40 million into this type of venture, you don't  
expect it to go the other way on you,'' he said. ``You're spending 
money to club yourself over the head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hancock figures were the first released by a high-level  
sponsor that showed a direct impact from the Salt Lake scandal, 
which revealed a pattern of lavish favors and influence peddling 
and has spawned two criminal investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Olympic Committee samplings earlier found a ``dramatic and  
alarming decline'' of 6 percentage points in positive feelings 
about the Olympics, to 32 percent, since the scandal broke. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro has been the most publicly persistent corporate  
critic of the IOC since the $1 million scheme to buy votes in Salt 
Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games was revealed late 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	He also has removed the Olympic rings from the company's annual  
report, billboards and stationery, and pulled out of negotiations 
for $20 million in ads during Olympic telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston company has received ``thousands of letters telling  
us we are doing the right thing by standing up,'' D'Alessandro 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And he maintained his stance Wednesday, questioning the makeup  
of IOC 2000, a reform task force appointed by committee president 
Juan Antonio Samaranch that bloated from a planned 24 members in 
March to 80 members -- including 44 IOC delegates -- when it was 
announced last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have now loaded your reform committee with people who have  
Olympic DNA, and clearly the offspring of that union will be as 
cross-eyed as the other results you've brought so far,'' 
D'Alessandro said. ``There is clearly a lack of leadership there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also accused Samaranch and other IOC leaders of ``trying to  
hide behind the athletes, and trying to hold themselves up to the 
ideals of the Olympics, and yet acting in a manner that is totally 
noblesse oblige.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors made a ``smart move'' Tuesday with its $1 billion  
Olympic promotion campaign that included direct aid to U.S. 
athletes, D'Alessandro said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we really want to worry about here is getting our teams  
to the Olympics,'' he said, noting that Hancock has 
direct-sponsorship programs with gymnastics and figure skating. 
</P>
<P>
	Such support programs will grow, he said, unless the IOC  
changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until the money train is disrupted, you will not have true  
reform,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC 2000 is not scheduled to present its recommendations until  
November, a year after the scandal broke. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his criticism, D'Alessandro said Hancock will honor its  
Olympic contract that runs through the 2000 Games in Sydney. He is 
undecided whether to sign up for the next IOC program that would go 
through at least 2004, although he had ``preliminary indications'' 
the IOC might not invite Hancock back. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to see the Olympic movement `get it,''' he said.  
``We'd like to see them save themselves and we think they should 
have more time to do that. But their many false starts just aren't 
encouraging. ... We can effect more positive change by staying in 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro also said his company had not asked for discounts  
on its sponsorship because of the scandal and would not accept a 
discount if offered one. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would be a case of situational ethics and discounts based  
on degrees of honesty,'' he said. ``We would never go down that 
path. It's either worth it or it's not worth it.''

<HEADLINE>  Treasury Secretary Rubin Resigning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Robert Rubin, praised as one of the most  
successful Treasury secretaries in history, will step down from his 
post in July with the national economy in an unprecedented 
expansion and the badly shaken global economy apparently on the 
mend. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton announced Wednesday that he would nominate  
Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, a former Harvard 
professor who has worked closely with Rubin, as his third Treasury 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Parting applause was plentiful for Rubin -- and there was also a  
positive reception for Summers. The stock market tumbled at the 
first reports of Rubin's departure, but that quickly turned around. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he agreed with the assessment of some that Rubin  
had proved to be the nation's most effective Treasury secretary 
since Alexander Hamilton, the first to hold the post. Rubin had 
stayed on longer than he had planned, at Clinton's urging. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to joke that Bob Rubin came to Washington to help me  
save the middle class and he'd stayed so long that by the time he 
left, he'd be one of them,'' Clinton told a Rose Garden audience of 
Cabinet officials, members of Congress and Federal Reserve Chairman 
Alan Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
	There was little chance of that. Rubin, who made $26.5 million  
as co-chairman of Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. the year before he joined the 
administration, replied that Clinton had always found that joke 
``about my becoming a member of the middle class a lot funnier than 
I have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has worked hard for months to prepare Wall  
Street for the switchover, and analysts said they expected no 
change in economic policies. Summers was a key administration 
troubleshooter in the recent 20-month global currency crisis, 
earning plaudits for his handling of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers, Rubin and Greenspan were all pictured on the cover of  
Time Magazine in a photo labeled, ``The Committee to Save the 
World.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, speaking to reporters after the White House announcement,  
said that he had not made any decision on what position he will 
take after leaving the administration this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea. I honest to goodness have no idea,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rubin has been rumored as a possible replacement for Greenspan  
if the 73-year-old Fed chairman decides he does not want a fourth 
term when his current term expires in June 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers should have little trouble winning Senate confirmation  
although tough questions were expected from critics of the 
administration's decision to support the International Monetary 
Fund as it assembled more than $100 billion in emergency bailout 
packages during the recent global currency crisis that leveled 
economies from Asia to Russia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	While the administration's support of the IMF has been  
criticized, Rubin and Summers, working together with Greenspan, 
have won high marks for keeping the global crisis from derailing 
the high-flying U.S. economy, which is now in its ninth year of 
uninterrupted growth, a record unmatched in peacetime. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also announced the nomination of Stuart Eizenstat, an  
undersecretary of state, to Summers' post as the No. 2 official at 
Treasury. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Treasury Secretary Rubin Resigning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Robert Rubin, praised as one of the most  
successful Treasury secretaries in history, will step down from his 
post in July with the national economy in an unprecedented 
expansion and the badly shaken global economy apparently on the 
mend. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton announced Wednesday that he would nominate  
Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, a former Harvard 
professor who has worked closely with Rubin, as his third Treasury 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Parting applause was plentiful for Rubin -- and there was also a  
positive reception for Summers. The stock market tumbled at the 
first reports of Rubin's departure, but that quickly turned around. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he agreed with the assessment of some that Rubin  
had proved to be the nation's most effective Treasury secretary 
since Alexander Hamilton, the first to hold the post. Rubin had 
stayed on longer than he had planned, at Clinton's urging. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to joke that Bob Rubin came to Washington to help me  
save the middle class and he'd stayed so long that by the time he 
left, he'd be one of them,'' Clinton told a Rose Garden audience of 
Cabinet officials, members of Congress and Federal Reserve Chairman 
Alan Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
	There was little chance of that. Rubin, who made $26.5 million  
as co-chairman of Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. the year before he joined the 
administration, replied that Clinton had always found that joke 
``about my becoming a member of the middle class a lot funnier than 
I have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has worked hard for months to prepare Wall  
Street for the switchover, and analysts said they expected no 
change in economic policies. Summers was a key administration 
troubleshooter in the recent 20-month global currency crisis, 
earning plaudits for his handling of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers, Rubin and Greenspan were all pictured on the cover of  
Time Magazine in a photo labeled, ``The Committee to Save the 
World.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, speaking to reporters after the White House announcement,  
said that he had not made any decision on what position he will 
take after leaving the administration this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea. I honest to goodness have no idea,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rubin has been rumored as a possible replacement for Greenspan  
if the 73-year-old Fed chairman decides he does not want a fourth 
term when his current term expires in June 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers should have little trouble winning Senate confirmation  
although tough questions were expected from critics of the 
administration's decision to support the International Monetary 
Fund as it assembled more than $100 billion in emergency bailout 
packages during the recent global currency crisis that leveled 
economies from Asia to Russia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	While the administration's support of the IMF has been  
criticized, Rubin and Summers, working together with Greenspan, 
have won high marks for keeping the global crisis from derailing 
the high-flying U.S. economy, which is now in its ninth year of 
uninterrupted growth, a record unmatched in peacetime. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also announced the nomination of Stuart Eizenstat, an  
undersecretary of state, to Summers' post as the No. 2 official at 
Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott told reporters he saw no  
problems with the Senate confirming Summers, and Sen. William Roth, 
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which must approve the 
nomination, said his panel had a ``good working relationship'' with 
Summers.

<HEADLINE> Memorials for Crash Victims Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- On the nation's roadsides, after the twisted metal  
from a fatal wreck is cleared, a mound of flowers, a marker or a 
little cross is often erected -- a makeshift memorial to tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Chizook wants to replace those temporary reminders with  
something more permanent. The Massachusetts resident is proposing 
signs emblazoned with the names of car crash victims, and the dates 
they were killed, along the state's highways. 
</P>
<P>
	While such tributes may seem like grim distractions to some, to  
Chizook they would serve as a powerful reminder of the dangers the 
lurk along the highway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just that message that you get from a uniform placard  
alongside the road to recognize and know that someone died here, I 
think that's sufficient to take your foot off the gas,'' said 
Chizook, who lives in Tyngsboro, Mass., about 30 miles northwest of 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of roadside memorials has sparked debate not only in  
Massachusetts, but in other states. In Virginia, measures to have 
the state install roadside memorials were proposed earlier this 
year, but failed to get approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than assume responsibility for roadside memorials, some  
states, such as California, ban them outright. Texas allows them 
with some restrictions. Illinois officials discourage them. 
</P>
<P>
	James Keaton, chairman of the national Alliance for Traffic  
Safety, said roadside memorials pose a hazard and might actually 
lead to more highway deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we put memorials up at every location on our highways and  
byways where a fatality or serious injury has occurred, are we 
potentially obstructing the clear view and right way of motorists 
and road users?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Keaton said his organization, made up of safety experts, has not  
officially taken a stand on roadside memorials, but would probably 
lean against supporting them. 
</P>
<P>
	John Carlisle, Massachusetts Highway Department spokesman, had  
similar concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``A roadway speckled with various roadway memorials could pose a  
safety problem. It could have the potential to compound a situation 
that's already tragic,'' Carlisle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Makeshift memorials are common in countries such as Italy and  
Greece. And in the Republic of Ireland, the government marks the 
place of fatal accidents with a warning sign emblazoned with a 
black dot and the words ``Traffic Black Spot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts has no bans or detailed guidelines on makeshift  
memorials. Localities have their own policies. Last year, in 
Pembroke, Mass., officials rejected a man's request to erect a 
white cross where his son died in a crash the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Chizook said Massachusetts could design some sort of uniform  
markers made of reflective material, so they could be seen at 
night. His local legislator, Rep. Colleen Garry was receptive to 
the idea, and has filed a bill on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	Also receptive was Rep. Joseph Sullivan, state House chairman of  
the Transportation Committee. He and Garry said they would, 
however, seek the permission of the victims' families to prevent 
causing them further pain. 
</P>
<P>
	A competing piece of legislation would limit the time makeshift  
memorials could remain to 30 days. It would also require a permit 
to erect such a display. 
</P>
<P>
	Chizook said one of the unofficial memorials he passes on  
Interstate 495 near Lowell, Mass., is dedicated to Raymond 
Bergeron, a Department of Public Works employee who was struck and 
killed a week before his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does serve as a very poignant reminder how easy it is to be  
killed, even on a straight stretch of 70 mile-an-hour roadway,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Military Satellite Declared Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Nearly two weeks after its botched  
launch, an $800 million military satellite has been declared dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force said Wednesday that the Milstar communication  
satellite will never reach its intended 22,300-mile-high orbit or 
serve any purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite poses no threat to other spacecraft in its  
lopsided orbit, said Air Force spokesman Aaron Renenger. It could 
remain in orbit for hundreds of years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Milstar was launched into the wrong orbit April 30 by a  
Titan IV rocket. It was the third consecutive failure for the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation is continuing. The trade journal Aviation Week  
&AMP; Space Technology reported this week that the problem may have 
been inaccurate computer software loaded into the rocket's upper 
stage.

<HEADLINE> Dole Opposes Concealed Weapons Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole believes she's found her  
silver-bullet issue in the Republican presidential campaign: guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The former American Red Cross president is using a string of  
moderate positions on gun control to distinguish herself from 
front-runner George W. Bush and the rest of the GOP field. 
</P>
<P>
	She told a women's group Tuesday night that she doesn't think  
Americans should be allowed to carry concealed weapons and that she 
backs a mandatory requirement to sell child safety locks with guns. 
</P>
<P>
	On both issues, she disagrees with the 10 other GOP hopefuls.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think police work is hard enough already,'' she said. ``No  
one should make it harder. I think it's wrong to let people carry 
concealed weapons.'' Mrs. Dole said the issue should be left for 
states to decide. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the remarks moved Mrs. Dole squarely in the political  
middle on the contentious gun-control issue, leaving GOP 
consultants debating whether conservative primary voters will 
accept the stance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is odd. It's certainly attention-getting for the national  
media,'' Republican consultant Michael Hudome said. ``But it 
probably won't work in a Republican primary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Scott Reed, who managed the 1996 presidential campaign  
of Mrs. Dole's husband, Bob Dole, called it a wise strategy. ``She 
is differentiating herself from the front-runner and attracting a 
coalition back to the GOP -- a coalition made up of women and 
mothers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks after the Colorado high school shooting, Republican  
presidential candidates are staking out territory on guns and 
school violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than Bush and Mrs. Dole, no GOP candidate supports further  
legislation to restrict access to guns. Typical of the rest of the 
field is Gary Bauer, the conservative activist who says the 
shootings are the result of deeper social problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and Mrs. Dole already have said they support the federal  
bans on assault weapons and armor-piercing bullets. Mrs. Dole 
unveiled those stances in a New Hampshire gathering of presidential 
hopefuls, drawing a cool reception from activists. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, as Texas governor, signed into law a measure allowing  
state residents to get a license to carry a concealed weapon; it 
requires training and a background check. 
</P>
<P>
	``Governor Bush has a record of doing in office what he says he  
will do on the campaign trail,'' spokeswoman Karen Hughes said, a 
subtle reference to the fact that Mrs. Dole has never held elective 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know many women and men in Texas who have gone through the  
training and who have a license and who feel safer because of that 
legislation -- particularly women who travel or work late at 
night,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole's campaign believes there is growing support for her  
position on guns -- even among GOP voters -- and they are betting 
that she will get credit for taking a tough stand even if their 
polls are wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the right thing to do, and I won't shy away from the  
tough issues, even if some in my party don't like it,'' Mrs. Dole 
said.

<HEADLINE> Students Differ on Gun-Control Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Florida high school students Melissa Coronado  
and Denise Kolb have their differences over gun laws. Kolb, 18, 
wants to see Congress pass stricter laws to keep guns out of the 
hands of teens. Coronado, 16, wants police and courts to be harder 
on the kids who break existing laws. 
</P>
<P>
	They both think teen violence was a problem long before the  
April 20 Columbine High School massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad that it took an incredible tragedy like this to raise  
concerns,'' said Kolb, a senior at South Dade Senior High School in 
Homestead, Fla., speaking after a discussion of gun laws Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 120 students from high schools nationwide attended the  
meeting as part of a yearly civic education program held in 
Washington by the Close Up Foundation, a nonprofit group. The talk 
was one of few national, public forums for young people to address 
gun laws. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, they heard from Robert Walker, president of Handgun  
Control Inc., and Glen Caroline, director of the grassroots 
division of the National Rifle Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker told the students that new laws are needed to close what  
he called loopholes allowing underage teens and criminals to buy 
handguns and illegal weapons from unlicensed dealers at gun shows. 
Only licensed dealers do background and identification checks, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to treat guns like cars,'' Walker said.  
</P>
<P>
	Caroline countered by saying there are more than 20,000 federal,  
state and city gun laws that are woefully under-enforced. Congress 
should concentrate on giving more funds to law enforcement agencies 
and gun-safety education programs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA, a gun industry lobbying group, has been criticized for  
holding a convention in Denver a week after the shooting in nearby 
Littleton. Two students, whose weapons included two illegal 
sawed-off shotguns, killed 12 classmates and a teacher before 
committing suicide. Investigators believe at least some of those 
weapons were purchased at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gun shows are a horrendous idea,'' said Kolb. ``There's no way  
you should be able to sell and buy guns at free will at a table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Megan Dreisbach, a 17-year-old sophomore from Kingwood Regional  
High School in Wolfesboro, N.H., said, ``My dad hunts. ... But an 
incident like Littleton makes you wonder what happens when you 
allow guns into the hands of people our age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Cummings, a 17-year-old junior who attends Katahdin High  
School in Sherman Station, Maine, believes gun ownership is a right 
that shouldn't be compromised. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grew up in a rural area,'' he said. ``Hunting is like a big  
deal. You have to look at the problem for what it is and not blame 
guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coronado, a junior at South Dade, also doesn't believe more laws  
are the answer: 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that I can't buy a gun, but if some kids really want  
guns there's nothing stopping them. It's just like drugs.''

<HEADLINE> Giants' Strahan Wants New Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Now that the New York Giants have  
given linebacker Jessie Armstead his due, two-time Pro Bowl 
defensive end Michael Strahan wants his. 
</P>
<P>
	Strahan, whose contract expires at the end of the 1999 season,  
said Wednesday that he would like to have a new contract in place 
before the Giants start training camp in late July. 
</P>
<P>
	While Strahan would not say how much money he wants, it's likely  
he would want to be among the NFL's highest-paid defensive ends. 
That would earn him between $6 million and $7 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	``Football is a business and I am not making any demands,''  
Strahan said. ``I'm not saying I'm not going to do this and that 
and I'm not coming to minicamp. I'll be here in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
	``But at the same time, when it comes to the contract, fair is  
fair,'' he added. ``Let's get it done and make it fair to both 
sides, that's all I want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstead, who like Strahan earned his second straight Pro Bowl  
selection last season, was given a seven-year, $33 million contract 
that included a $6 million signing bonus earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've already heard all the jokes, we could do this if Strahan  
didn't want all the money,'' Strahan quipped. ``Strahan hasn't 
asked for one penny yet so no one knows what I want. Pretty soon, 
everyone will find out, and I don't want to hear you guys saying, 
`You want that much.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Giants general manager Ernie Accorsi said he has spoken with  
Tony Agnone, Strahan's agent, but they have not started serious 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Strahan had a career-high 15 sacks last season, one more than in  
1997 when the Giants won the NFC East. He also had 67 tackles, two 
forced fumbles and an interception that he returned for a touchdown 
last season, his sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Giants can't reach a contract agreement with Strahan,  
they would probably make him a franchise player, meaning they could 
match any offer he received in free agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be here, I want to stay here,'' Strahan said.  
``We're going to see what happens. I'm not saying I want to go 
anywhere or be traded. I just want to win games. I think we can win 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strahan has been miffed at some teammates of late for failing to  
attend the team's off-season workout programs after the Giants 
posted an 8-8 record last season and missed the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody needs to do what it takes to win,'' he said. ``You  
don't win by showing up in July at training camp and saying `I'm 
here, I'm ready.'''

<HEADLINE> Grateful Dead To Allow MP3 Trades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Grateful Dead will allow fans to trade  
MP3 digital versions of the band's unreleased concert recordings 
over the Internet, as long as they don't try to make a buck in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted to control this now rather than when the cow got  
out of the barn,'' said Grateful Dead attorney Eric Doney. 
</P>
<P>
	He thinks online Deadheads will police themselves enough to  
ensure that only noncopyrighted MP3 files are made available. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came Tuesday, after the band discovered a Web  
site that posted MP3 versions of live recordings. The site's owners 
also received revenues from ads. After a brief legal standoff, the 
site's operator removed links to the songs. 
</P>

	Treasury Secretary Rubin Resigns  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, idolized on  
Wall Street for the policies many credit with spurring the record 
U.S. economic boom, is stepping down. President Clinton said he 
will nominate Rubin's deputy, Lawrence Summers, to succeed him. 
Clinton said he will miss Rubin's ``cool head and steady hand.'' 
But he said of Summers, ``Rarely has any individual been so 
well-prepared to become secretary of the Treasury.'' Stuart 
Eizenstat, an undersecretary at the State Department, was chosen by 
Clinton to replace Summers as second in command at Treasury.

	Yeltsin Fires Prime Minister  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia was plunged into a political crisis today  
when President Boris Yeltsin dismissed the prime minister and 
Cabinet for the third time in little more than a year. The sacking 
of Yevgeny Primakov, announced by Yeltsin in a speech on national 
television, appeared timed as a pre-emptive strike on parliament, 
which was to begin impeachment proceedings against Yeltsin 
tomorrow. Yeltsin named a close ally, Interior Minister Sergei 
Stepashin, as acting prime minister. Stepashin's appointment 
appeared to have little chance of approval in the Duma, the lower 
house of parliament.

	NATO Warplanes Pound Yugoslavia

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Allied warplanes pounded Yugoslav  
bridges and airfields in what NATO described today as its busiest 
bombing day of the seven-week-old air campaign. Serb media reported 
dozens of the attacks were on mainly civilian targets. Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic, in a message congratulating the armed 
forces, acknowledged for the first time in the 50-day campaign that 
Serb military have been killed. He gave no figures. Earlier, Tanjug 
said two people crossing a bridge in Vladicin Han were killed and 
five others were hurt when NATO bombed the Serbian town's 
residential district -- bringing to at least seven the number of 
civilians killed since yesterday.

	More U.S. Reservists Activated

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Air Force and Navy activated 2,173 more  
reservists and 35 attack planes and refueling aircraft today to 
support an expansion of NATO's air campaign against Yugoslavia. The 
call-ups, authorized under a plan announced by the Defense 
Secretary William Cohen last week, bring to 4,409 the number of 
reservists ordered to active duty for the Yugoslavia crisis. 
President Clinton has authorized the Pentagon to activate as many 
as 33,102 reservists.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House web site reopened today, a day  
after officials took it down because of an attack by computer 
hackers. Spokesman Joe Lockhart said only that the Web site was 
made unavailable because of ``problems with people trying to get 
into the system.'' The opening page of the site was altered briefly 
overnight Sunday to show a black Web page with the names of the 
hacker organizations claiming responsibility, along with messages, 
``Your box was own3d'' and ``Stop all the war.'' White House 
computers automatically detected the altered page and removed it 
within minutes.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two and a half months after the release of  
``Monica's Story,'' the former White House intern's bestseller has 
joined the ranks of the ``remaindered,'' books offered at a big 
discount. ``Monica's Story'' came out in early March, the day after 
Barbara Walters interviewed Ms. Lewinsky on national television. 
According to the publisher, the book has sold about half a million

	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Curt Schilling became the National League's  
first six-game winner, pitching his second straight complete game 
as the Philadelphia Phillies overcame a four-run deficit to beat 
the St. Louis Cardinals 8-4 today. Schilling (6-1) fell behind 4-0

It was McGwire's eighth homer of the season and 465th of his 
career, tying Dave Winfield for 19th place on the career list. 
Schilling allowed seven hits, struck out five and walked none in 
his third complete game of the season, tops in the majors.

	Congress Agrees on $11.6B for Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional negotiators agreed today to  
provide $11.6 billion for the attacks on Yugoslavia and to boost 
overall defense spending, nearly doubling the amount President 
Clinton requested. But disputes over items including fishing in 
Alaska's Glacier Bay and taxpayer assistance for some U.S. steel 
companies were hindering completion of the package, which leaders 
want to send to Clinton by week's end. The biggest chunk of the 
bill was for U.S. participation in the NATO bombing. Though 
lawmakers are divided over the attacks, many opponents are 
reluctant to oppose funds for troops in the field.

	NATO Reports Busiest Day of Attacks  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO struck bridges, airfields, and  
destroyed MiG fighters on the ground in its busiest day of attacks 
against Yugoslavia, the allies said today. NATO reported a record 
327 sorties that resulted in airstrikes against Yugoslavia 
yesterday and early today -- the greatest number since the campaign 
began March 24. Both sides reported particularly heavy NATO 
bombardments in Kosovo. Meanwhile, President Slobodan Milosevic for 
the first time acknowledged military casualties, saying ``many'' 
had died.

	Senate Rejects Gun-Show Restrictions  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled Senate supported a  
system of voluntary background checks at guns shows today after 
rejecting a measure that would require instant checks for such 
private sales. Gun control advocates had claimed that last month's 
shooting spree at a Colorado high school would give their cause 
fresh momentum. Instead, their plan was killed on a 51-47 vote. 
Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, who is a member of the National Rifle 
Association board, said that his voluntary plan contained 
incentives to entice private collectors to conduct checks, 
including limited protection from liability.

	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia was plunged into political crisis today

to impeach him. The sacking of Yevgeny Primakov was the third time 
in just over a year that Yeltsin has ousted a premier. Yeltsin 
named Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin as acting prime minister. 
Stepashin, 47, previously commanded tens of thousands of troops and

unsealed the results this week after news organizations, including 
The Associated Press, challenged the secrecy surrounding them. The 
polygraph questions did not address the issue of whether Clinton's 
alleged advance was unwanted. Mrs. Willey says she rebuffed 
Clinton, who denies making any sexual advance.

	Brain Shocks Trigger Depression

	BOSTON (AP) -- Electrical stimulation of the brain can trigger  
bouts of deep depression that come and go almost instantly. French 
doctors made the discovery while treating a woman with Parkinson's 
disease. They implanted electrodes in her brain to stimulate the 
parts that malfunction in her disease but found that turning on one 
electrode made her profoundly sad. The depression disappeared after 
the stimulation ended. Researchers say the discovery raises the 
possibility that brain stimulation could aid in treating 
depression, addiction and aggression.

<HEADLINE> Steel Wire Rod Imports Vote Splits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) --The U.S. International Trade Commission reached  
a split decision Wednesday on whether steel wire rod imported from 
Japan and other countries is hurting U.S. producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the six commissioners found that steel wire rod is  
being imported into the United States in such increased quantities 
as to pose a serious threat to the domestic industry. The other 
three commissioners concluded just the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the ITC, the findings now will be forwarded to  
President Clinton, who can consider either determination as the 
commission's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission will hold a hearing on remedy on June 8 and will  
forward any recommendations to the president by mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
	Steel wire rod is used in fasteners, medical and dental  
instruments and other products. 
</P>
<P>
	United Steelworkers of America and a number of U.S. steel  
manufacturers filed the initial complaint against Japan and other 
countries.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Considers China WTO Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- When Nora Yeung's foreign customers sought to  
eliminate her Hong Kong-based trading company as the middleman for 
purchasing gifts and stationery from mainland Chinese 
manufacturers, she started to worry. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't take her clients long, however, to realize how much  
easier it was to buy their products through her company, Planet 
Earth Inc., instead of doing it on their own in China. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of the day, they all came back and didn't actually  
do business with those companies,'' Yeung said. ``It's the trust 
factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The difficulties that confront foreign companies in China have  
helped many traders in Hong Kong make their fortunes, but the cash 
is not pouring in like it used to. Some worry the flow could ebb 
even more with China's anticipated entry to the World Trade 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	That may not happen anytime soon. NATO's bombing of the Chinese  
Embassy in Yugoslavia resulted in angry protests and has strained 
U.S.-Chinese relations. That could make it difficult for China's 
leaders to make new and unpopular market-opening pledges to gain 
entry to the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	The day China does enter the organization, Hong Kong will  
certainly take some blows as some foreign companies bypass this 
expensive trading center and cut their deals in China on their own, 
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	For China, WTO membership would give it the chance to boost  
exports, but would also pry open its markets to foreign 
competition. Hong Kong could see its traders lose some business to 
China, even though they also likely would benefit in the long run 
by having a much bigger market to pursue on the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the short-term losers could be Hong Kong's crucial import  
and export trade, which employs 14 percent of the work force. The 
bulk of that business is re-exports, in which goods are imported 
and then re-exported to other countries, sometimes with 
improvements made here such as packaging. 
</P>
<P>
	Re-export trade with China accounts for 94 percent of the $148  
billion in goods that pass through Hong Kong each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Stationery dealer Yeung, for example, imports products from  
China and sends them directly to Hong Kong's ports, which offer 
more flexible schedules and often cheaper rates to the United 
States than Chinese ports. 
</P>
<P>
	The value of Chinese goods re-exported through Hong Kong, which  
has already been falling -- down 12.4 percent in March compared with 
March 1998 -- could slip even more. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the territory of 6.8 million people is more likely  
to benefit from the trickle-down effect of an overall increase in 
business between China and foreign partners. 
</P>
<P>
	China's external trade could double to $600 billion within 5  
years of joining WTO, estimates Fred Hu, an economist who follows 
China for investment bank Goldman Sachs Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Hong Kong gets a slice of that,'' he said, ``Hong Kong will  
stand to gain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until the WTO talks wrap up, estimates for Hong Kong's potential  
gains are hard to make, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite some shifts to China, many companies maintain Hong Kong  
as a base where they can also get top quality financial and legal 
services, said Bill Galvin, Hong Kong-based director of Kurt Salmon 
Associates Inc., which advises consumer firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the WTO agreement secures greater access to China's  
financial sector, Hong Kong banks won't lose clients to Chinese 
banks, said Robin Hammond, regional banking analyst for Paribas 
Asia Equity Ltd. Instead, Hammond predicts the local banks will 
instead find more opportunities in China. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a long process to get the Chinese banks up to Western  
standards,'' Hammond said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, as Chinese companies become more savvy, some old Hong  
Kong trading companies are expanding into consulting and other 
services to stay one step ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hong Kong is not just a middleman,'' asserted Edward Leung,  
chief economist for the Trade Development Council. ``Hong Kong 
provides a one-stop shop of supporting services and will not be 
easily replaced by any city in China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And until Chinese companies can prove they're up to par, foreign  
companies will still need Hong Kong, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of foreigners are still reluctant to go into China,''  
Yeung said. ``They might visit a factory once, but they'd rather 
pay you to do it.''

<HEADLINE> House Seeks To Limit Y2K Lawsuits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House neared a vote Wednesday on a bill to  
limit millennium-bug lawsuits -- a measure that businesses say is 
needed to avoid a year-2000 financial catastrophe. The White House 
sees it as slanted against consumers and deserving of a 
presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would try to stem a potential flood of lawsuits  
arising from computer breakdowns by establishing a 90-day waiting 
period before lawsuits can be filed, encouraging mediation, capping 
punitive damage and limiting class action lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reality today is that unbridled Y2K litigation is  
jeopardizing coordination and teamwork'' to fix computer problems, 
said Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., one of the chief sponsors of the 
bill. ``This adversarial mentality hampers private sector efforts 
to solve Y2K problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill has the strong backing of business groups and the high  
tech industry, who warn that the problem arising from computers 
that misread the 2000 date could result in hundreds of billions of 
dollars in lawsuits, crippling the economy and undermining efforts 
to fix faulty computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Litigation could arise from computer glitches if businesses find  
they can't process credit cards and customer information records or 
lose money because of supply or power disruptions. Consumers might 
sue if there are problems in medical equipment or their access to 
prescription drugs. Backers of the legislation say they are only 
trying to stop frivolous, not legitimate claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of  
Manufacturers, says the litigation bill has become a key vote by 
which the group will rate lawmakers' support for American 
businesses. ``It would be an entirely avoidable catastrophe if 
Congress didn't pass this bill and ended up swamping the economy in 
a tidal wave of litigation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the White House says President Clinton's senior advisors  
would advise him to veto the House bill in its present form because 
it goes too far in limiting the legal rights of those with 
legitimate complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, it said, ``may, in fact, decrease the incentives  
organizations have to assist customers and business partners to be 
ready for the transition to the next century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But two senior White House officials, presidential aide Bruce  
Lindsey and National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling, also 
wrote a letter to House Speaker Dennis Hastert Tuesday stressing 
that they want to get a bill passed and outlining possible areas of 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, they wrote, wants to see the bill limited to  
commercial claims, exempting consumers. But they showed some 
flexibility on the issue of ``proportionate ability.'' Supporters 
want defendants to be liable only for their share of any damage, 
reducing the tendency of plaintiffs to go after companies with deep 
pockets, but consumer groups argue that this would work to the 
disadvantage of lower income plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration has realized this is a train moving down  
the tracks,'' said Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``This will be one of the biggest 
accomplishments of the whole Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate is considering a bill that has been amended to meet  
some of the concerns of the administration. However, that bill was 
pulled from the Senate floor two weeks ago after the Republican 
leadership blocked a Democratic attempt to add extraneous issues, 
including a minimum wage hike, to the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, the current Senate bill, backed by Sens. John  
McCain, R-Ariz., Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., 
would exempt consumers and small businesses from punitive damage 
caps. It also does not have House language that gives defendants a 
``reasonable effort'' defense and limits the liability of corporate 
directors and officers to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House supports a House Democratic version that also  
has a 90-day cooling off period and limits plaintiffs from 
asserting claims for economic damages that are not covered by 
contract. But it takes out the ``reasonable efforts'' defense, the 
punitive damage caps and officer caps. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to do something, but we don't need to take steps that  
will dismantle key protections for consumers and small 
businesses,'' Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri said. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 775.

<HEADLINE> Only Judge Can Allow Penguins' Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- If the Pittsburgh Penguins are to become the  
Portland Penguins, the road to Oregon must first pass through a 
U.S. bankruptcy judge's office, not that of NHL commissioner Gary 
Bettman. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the hardened stance taken recently by the NHL, one  
designed to accelerate the Penguins' bankruptcy proceedings, 
Bettman concedes the league can't move them unless Judge Bernard 
Markovitz's allows it. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, league officials suggested the NHL could disband or  
relocate the team if the 1999-2000 season was approaching and the 
Penguins' case was not resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Lemieux group is moving at an appropriate rate of speed,''  
said Bettman, who is attending the Maple Leafs-Penguins playoff 
series. ``These are complicated issues, and the bankruptcy judge is 
doing what he believes is in the best interests of the bankruptcy 
proceedings. I learned long ago never to disagree with a judge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Especially one who controls the fate of one of only two NHL  
franchises that competes in a major U.S. market -- St. Louis is the 
other -- without winter competition from an NBA franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven months ago, shortly after the Penguins filed for Chapter  
11 protection, the NHL agreed to a court order that it would not 
seek to vacate the franchise while the Penguins were in bankruptcy. 
Markovitz also has ruled that the Penguins' arena lease, which runs 
through 2007, is binding. 
</P>
<P>
	Markovitz on Tuesday rejected the NHL's request to move up the  
creditors' vote on Lemieux's bid from June 24. But he did agree to 
hear the league's request that its own plan move forward at the 
same pace as Lemieux's. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL plan, which Bettman said is strictly a backup in case  
Lemieux's bid falters, calls for the Penguins to be sold for $85 
million to an out-of-town owner -- presumably, Seattle Seahawks 
owner Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder -- in time to relocate 
for next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like to have the Penguins reorganize in Pittsburgh,  
but if that doesn't work, we have to look at the alternatives: Is 
there a buyer who is prepared to take the franchise on very short 
notice for next season?'' Bettman said. ``Taking a club at the end 
of June, to start selling tickets and get up and running for the 
start of next season would be no picnic for anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, who also owns the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers, said he  
has not made a specific bid for the Penguins. But he did not deny 
being interested in putting an NHL franchise into the nearly new 
Rose Garden arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Another bankruptcy judge, M. Bruce McCullough, said the NHL is  
working on three schedules for next season: one with the Penguins 
in Pittsburgh, another with them on the West Coast, presumably 
Portland, and a third without them. 
</P>
<P>
	If nothing else, the news that a deep-pockets owner is willing  
to relocate the Penguins immediately caused a rumble Wednesday not 
only in Pittsburgh, but in the state capital of Harrisburg. 
</P>
<P>
	With much of the Penguins' financial mess blamed on an  
unfavorable arena lease that management firm SMG has refused to 
renegotiate, City Council president Bob O'Connor again raised the 
possibility of using eminent domain to reclaim the arena. City 
Council decided Tuesday to delay exploring any such action for now. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor said he met briefly with Bettman at Tuesday's playoff  
game to discuss the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best thing is to keep the team here,'' O'Connor said.  
``There is a history and tradition here that can't be duplicated 
elsewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Harrisburg, Gov. Tom Ridge, who shepherded the funding  
package for four new stadiums in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia 
through the Legislature three months ago, said he is amenable to 
discussing a new arena once new local Penguins ownership is in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately, city and state government officials believe a new  
arena to replace the 38-year-old Civic Arena would be an easier 
sell to taxpayers than the stadiums, because it would be used 
year-around for concerts, circuses and meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had one conversation with ... Gary Bettman, and I told  
him that after the legal matters have been resolved that I 
anticipate, given the age of the (Civic Arena), that they will be 
looking for some public assistance, and we would be open to that 
discussion,'' Ridge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Kevin Constantine said the Penguins' history of attracting  
big crowds and fielding competitive teams should not be overlooked. 
The Penguins have played to about 90 percent of arena capacity 
while reaching the Stanley Cup playoffs each year since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's so much fun in this town because of hockey, it would  
be a shame to not have it in Pittsburgh,'' he said.

	DENVER (AP) -- Eight days after shipping one of their two best  
young pitchers to Triple-A, the Colorado Rockies demoted the other,

	Taking Thomson's place on the major league roster will be  
outfielder Derrick Gibson, not another pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked who would move up in the rotation to replace Thomson,  
Leyland said, ``Nobody. We don't need anybody for a while. I'll 
need a fifth starter next Tuesday. I'll announce that at a later 
date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the fifth starter would come from the current Rockies  
staff, Leyland said, ``No, it will not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the fifth starter would come from Colorado Springs or  
via trade, he said, ``I'm not discussing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Immediate speculation centered on Arizona's Andy Benes, Kansas  
City's Kevin Appier, Minnesota's Brad Radke and Oakland's Kenny 
Rogers. All are either in the final year of contracts or are 
looking to be unloaded by teams seeking to reduce payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	Left-hander Bobby Jones came out of the Rockies' bullpen to take  
over Wright's starting job, but there are no other starting 
candidates on the staff and few prospects are ready for big-league 
duty at Colorado Springs. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomson allowed six runs and eight hits in 2 2-3 innings as the  
Rockies lost to the New York Mets 10-5 Wednesday. His record fell 
to 0-5 and his ERA ballooned to 11.84. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland said his conversation with Thomson was ``almost a  
duplicate of what we talked to Jamey about. He's got to get a feel 
for pitching, he's got to tighten up his slider, and he's got to 
get a better changeup. Right now, everything is hard and he can't 
get hitters off his hard stuff. When you can't get big-league 
hitters off of something hard, you're going to get roughed up. It's 
that simple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland emphasized that both Thomson and Wright have bright  
futures with the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not punishment,'' he said after the Thomson move. ``We  
like him a lot. He's a big league pitcher in the future. At this 
particular time, he's not a big league pitcher. To be honest with 
you, it's not fair to John Thomson to put him out there right now. 
The poor guy is 0-5 and his earned-run average is very high, 
obviously. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him the same thing I told Jamey. If Jamey Wright and  
John Thomson don't in the not-too-distant future come through for 
us, we're going to be hurting unless we go out and get somebody, 
because we don't have a lot of depth. So we're counting on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomson, 25, started 27 games for the Rockies in 1997 and 26 in  
1998, going 7-9 with a 4.71 ERA in '97 and 8-11 with a 4.81 ERA 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of knew it was coming if I didn't turn it around,''  
Thomson said. ``I agree with everything he said. I wouldn't send 
myself out there the way I've been throwing. I've been terrible. If 
I knew what was wrong, I would fix it. I would have fixed it 
yesterday or two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say I'm not upset about it, because you work so hard  
to get here. But it's what's right for the team right now. It's not 
fair to put the team in the hole 6-0.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The nation's first stadium built  
specifically for major professional soccer opens Saturday in a city 
known more for Woody Hayes and his ``three yards and a cloud of 
dust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A capacity crowd of 22,500 will watch the Columbus Crew play the  
New England Revolution in the state-of-the-art stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Some seats are as close as 8 feet from the field. Fans can get a  
close-up of the action on a mammoth video screen. The tilted banks 
of lights at each corner and the open-air loges -- with bars and TVs 
-- give the stadium a European feel. 
</P>
<P>
	All this in a city of about 700,000 people who usually build  
their social calendars around Ohio State football each fall. 
</P>
<P>
	For the moment, Columbus' pro sports market belongs exclusively  
to Major League Soccer. An NHL expansion franchise, the Blue 
Jackets, won't begin playing until 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The soccer team, with its stark logo of construction workers,  
has gained a foothold in this white-collar market. The new stadium 
has features that should expand the fan base beyond those who 
revere Hayes, the late coach of the Buckeyes from 1951-78. 
</P>
<P>
	Tailgating will be encouraged at a huge party patio, where bands  
will play before and after games. Tents will hold catered parties 
for corporations and fans. Inside the stadium, an entertainment 
area features sports-related video games. 
</P>
<P>
	There also will be beer. That couldn't be sold at the team's  
previous home, Ohio Stadium, which is on the campus. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I don't believe because we serve beer someone will come  
out to the new stadium, I do believe that if we didn't serve beer, 
some people might not come,'' Crew president and general manager 
Jamey Rootes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Crew had to move out of cavernous Ohio Stadium -- where an  
average of 93,000 fans pay $34 a seat to watch football games -- 
when the university began renovating the 77-year-old structure. 
</P>
<P>
	In its first three seasons there, the Crew averaged 12,200 a  
game. Even with dividers to cluster fans into tighter formations, 
the crowds looked and sounded small. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a little bit tough connecting with the fans at Ohio  
Stadium,'' midfielder Brian Maisonneuve said. ``The best thing 
about this stadium is that the fans will be right on top of us, and 
the crowd noise will be that much louder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the new facility's $25 million pricetag was picked up by  
Crew owner Lamar Hunt and his partners after voters repeatedly 
refused to finance a soccer stadium downtown and in the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt, also the owner of the NFL's Chiefs and the MLS' Wizards,  
said the site at the state fairgrounds was ideal. There was no need 
to build parking lots, access roads or freeway ramps. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all existed for the fairgrounds that have been at that  
location for over 100 years,'' Hunt said. ``We have a location 
that's on an interstate freeway with 148,000 cars per day going 
by.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Painted the Crew's yellow, black and silver colors, the stadium  
adds an air of permanence to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans have responded. Season-ticket sales are up 60 percent to a  
total of 8,500 and Saturday's game has been sold out for weeks. The 
average ticket price is $14. 
</P>
<P>
	The team says sponsorship revenues, approaching $1 million, have  
topped last season's total. It has sold all 30 of its luxury boxes, 
some priced at $13,770 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	While awaiting completion of the 10-month project, the Crew --  
which won just four road games all last season -- had to open with 
seven straight away games. 
</P>
<P>
	But behind stars such as Stern John, who had a league-high 26  
goals last year, and national team member Brian McBride, the team 
won five times and leads the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The stadium will be the site of next year's MLS All-Star game  
and the 2001 league championship. The U.S. Soccer Federation would 
like the men's and women's national teams to play there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can definitely see it being a big part of the World Cup  
qualifiers,'' McBride said. ``This would be a great place to have 
that type of game.''

<HEADLINE> King Family Claims Rights to Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s estate has no  
right to claim ownership of footage depicting the civil rights 
leader delivering his ``I Have a Dream'' speech, says a lawyer for 
CBS News. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd Abrams argued Tuesday before a three-judge panel of the  
11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that organizers of the Aug. 28, 
1963, rally at the Lincoln Memorial placed no limits on how the 
speech should be used. 
</P>
<P>
	King's family is asking the appeals court to rule that the  
speech is private property and that CBS should have to pay for 
using the footage in a documentary the network sold on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Joseph Beck argued that the speech is King's most  
important work and he would not have wanted it used for commercial 
purposes without his approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wouldn't have authorized this. He wouldn't have given away  
his most valuable work,'' Beck said, with King's widow, Coretta 
Scott King, and son Dexter King sitting a few rows behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine minutes of the 16-minute speech, which became a powerful  
symbol of the civil rights movement, were used in ``The 20th 
Century with Mike Wallace.'' The King estate sued in 1996, seeking 
to stop CBS from using the footage. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge William O'Kelley ruled last July that King  
forfeited any copyright interest when he distributed advance copies 
to reporters without copyright notice, placed no restrictions on 
what use could be made of the speech and generally encouraged its 
distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	King and event organizers ``begged the press to come and cover  
this event,'' Abrams said. The speech ``was what Dr. King called, 
`A living petition to the public and the Congress.' It was directed 
at everyone,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The King family appealed that ruling to the 11th Circuit.  
</P>
<P>
	The three-judge panel's questions Tuesday centered on the  
advance copies and the publication of the speech in a Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
	The King estate says the slain leader applied for a copyright of  
the speech on Sept. 30, 1963, a few days after the SCLC printed it 
in the newsletter. The judges questioned whether King, who headed 
the SCLC, authorized putting the speech in the newsletter without 
copyright notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard for me to believe that Dr. King didn't know what was  
in that newsletter,'' said circuit court judge R. Lanier Anderson, 
III. 
</P>
<P>
	Beck said ruling in favor of the King family would protect the  
speech from ``greedy'' people who would charge nonprofit 
organizations and schools to use the footage. CBS charges $1,000 
for schools to use 30 seconds of footage from the speech, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A ruling in favor of CBS would put the work -- and other public  
events, such as rock concerts, in the public domain, Beck said. 
``People could use 'I Have a Dream' to sell automobiles.''

<HEADLINE> Internet Companies Get New Report Card </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the government poised to admonish them  
for poor performance, companies on the Internet are preparing for a 
new report card grading their efforts to protect the personal 
details they collect about consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry-funded survey of roughly 360 Internet sites will  
gauge whether businesses are doing better than last summer, when a 
similar government study found that only 14 percent of sites 
adequately warned how companies used private information they 
collected about customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to show what level of progress has been made,''  
said Harold McGraw III, chief executive officer for the McGraw-Hill 
Cos. ``Last year, less than 14 percent, that doesn't speak very 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report, expected to be released today, will help define the  
role the federal government will play in regulating parts of the 
Internet, the worldwide computer network used by roughly 100 
million Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission, expected to recommend to Congress  
this summer whether new Internet privacy laws are needed, has said 
it wanted to see results from the study before making any 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy groups complain that the online industry has done a poor  
job on its own protecting the details it collects about customers, 
such as names, postal and e-mail addresses and even likes and 
dislikes. Some Web sites sell the information to third-party 
advertisers and others. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House, with the industry's support, has agreed so far  
to allow companies to develop their own guidelines because of 
concerns that federal intervention could stifle the growth of 
electronic commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Clinton administration has taken a carrot-and-stick  
approach. Last summer, Vice President Al Gore warned executives 
that unless the industry takes adequate measures to protect 
consumer privacy, ``we will be obliged to take action ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People who don't use the Internet frequently cite privacy  
concerns as their primary reason for staying off line. The issue 
has taken on growing significance as more companies have begun 
selling products over the Internet, expected eventually to carry 
billions of dollars in transactions daily. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the numbers, there's going to be an argument over  
whether self-regulation is succeeding or whether legislation is 
necessary,'' predicted Jerry Berman, executive director of the 
Washington-based Center for Democracy and Technology. ``The 
question on the table is, is progress being made?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harriet Pearson of IBM, one of the companies that helped pay for  
the study, said nearly all the 100 most popular sites on the Web 
now explain what information is collected and how it's used, up 
from 71 percent of those biggest sites identified in last year's 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	But among Web sites of all sizes, large and small, IBM and  
others argued that merely doubling the number of sites with 
adequate privacy notices from last year's 14 percent would 
represent substantial progress. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a company, we're hoping to see the privacy surveys show  
that companies doing e-business are making significant strides, 
making the Internet a well-lit highway safe for consumers to 
travel,'' Pearson said. ``Is it going to be perfect? No, but it 
will be close to perfect for the top-traveled sites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics complained that the latest study, which was not  
expected to include recommendations about whether new laws are 
needed, didn't measure whether a Web site's privacy policy was 
sufficient, but just looked to see whether one existed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is not whether there's a privacy policy, but  
is there privacy protection?'' said Marc Rotenberg, director of the 
Electronic Privacy Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the largest companies on the Web, including IBM, America  
Online, Microsoft, Compaq and eBay, paid a total of $60,000 for the 
study, conducted by Georgetown University business professor Mary 
J. Culnan.

<HEADLINE> Senators Criticize DOE in Spy Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department should have searched the  
personal computer of a suspected spy at the Los Alamos weapons lab 
even if it jeopardized the case in court, several senators said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Protection of nuclear secrets was more important than  
prosecution, suggested Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska. ``If we 
can't convict, we can sure stop the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murkowski questioned the Energy Department's general counsel as  
to why the computer of Taiwan-born scientist Wen Ho Lee was not 
searched after lab officials offered such a search as early as 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Anne Sullivan, the DOE's general counsel, said the FBI had  
advised such a search could jeopardize their investigation and that 
a search would violate Lee's privacy and likely make the evidence 
unusable in court. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear we had the authority ... to search,'' Sullivan told  
the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said if the department proceeded with the search over  
the FBI's objections, ``We would have subjected ourselves to 
another criticism. That we compromised their ability to conduct an 
investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murkowski had publicly wanted to question officials of the FBI  
and the Justice Department, but he said they declined to appear and 
would limit their testimony to a closed session because of security 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we should have initiated the search,'' agreed Sen.  
Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, who was fired March 8, has been under investigation by the  
FBI since 1996 for possible espionage. He has not been charged with 
a crime and through his lawyer has said he never provided secrets 
to anyone including China. 
</P>
<P>
	When Lee's unsecured computer was searched in early March,  
investigators found he had removed more than 1,000 files of 
top-secret computer codes that he allegedly transferred from the 
lab's highly secure computer system in 1994-95, according to 
government officials. Investigators have not determined whether any 
of those files left the Los Alamos lab in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 10 congressional committees are investigating security  
lapses at the DOE weapons labs, including Los Alamos, where the 
espionage investigation involving Lee has been the primary focus. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, in announcing a broad  
restructuring of the department's security program on Tuesday, said 
he hoped naming a new ``security czar'' would avoid some of the 
confusion that marked the Lee investigation. Richardson has said it 
was a mistake that Lee, because of communication breakdowns, was 
not removed earlier from access to top-secret weapons material. 
</P>
<P>
	At times, the widely dispersed security structure resulted in  
unclear lines of authority and confusion and communications lapses, 
Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson has moved on several fronts to try to assure Congress  
his department should continue to control the nation's prestigious 
weapons research labs and that the lab structure not undergo major 
change as some lawmakers have suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can demonstrate that the labs are accountable to us. We run  
the labs,'' Richardson said in a meeting with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	But the growing espionage controversy that has centered on the  
Los Alamos lab, where the first atomic bomb was made more than a 
half century ago, has raised questions about whether private 
contractors should manage the labs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some lawmakers have suggested the nuclear weapons labs ought to  
be brought under direct government management and perhaps under 
another department. The debate mirrors arguments, which were 
revived several years ago, over whether all nuclear weapons 
programs should not be shifted to the Defense Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Historically, the research labs have flaunted their autonomy,  
cultivated strong allies in Congress and resisted control -- on 
security matters or anything else -- from the Energy Department in 
Washington. They have been viewed by some as semiautonomous 
fiefdoms managed by private contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	Since its inception, Los Alamos, as well as the Lawrence  
Livermore National Laboratory in California, has been managed by 
the University of California. Sandia National Laboratories, also in 
New Mexico, is managed by a subsidiary of the Lockheed Martin Corp.

<HEADLINE> Kevorkian Associate Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO RANCHO, N.M. (AP) -- Police are investigating an associate of  
Dr. Jack Kevorkian about a woman who apparently suffered from 
multiple sclerosis and died from an overdose of the sedative 
pentobarbitol. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a death here that was caused by a poison -- a poison  
that has to be administered,'' said District Attorney Mike Runnels. 
``You can't take pentobarbitol by accident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Brennan's body was found in her Rio Rancho home nearly  
nine months ago by a neighbor who had been tending to her. 
</P>
<P>
	After her family raised questions about her death, police began  
an investigation that ultimately led them to Dr. Georges Reding's 
home near Galesburg, Mich. 
</P>

	Evidence relating to her death was recovered at his home, along  
with numerous files that include apparent medical records for 
patients from across the country, police said Wednesday.

	``There are a lot of circumstances to investigate,'' Runnels  
said. ``There will be charges filed if there's an indication that

	No charges have been filed against Reding. A 1963 New Mexico law  
prohibits assisted suicide, which is a fourth-degree felony 
punishable by 18 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Reding, 74, was arrested last year with Kevorkian when the pair  
dropped off a body at a suburban Detroit hospital. Reding was 
acquitted of charges he interfered with police and resisted arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian was sentenced last month to 10 to 25 years in prison  
for second-degree murder in the nationally televised injection 
death last September of Thomas Youk, a Lou Gehrig's disease 
patient. 
</P>
<P>
	According to toxicology reports, Ms. Brennan died of an overdose  
of pentobarbitol. Authorities said she had apparently suffered from 
multiple sclerosis, an often-crippling nerve disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Schwartz, a Michigan-based attorney who has defended  
both Reding and Kevorkian, said Reding was being harassed by 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that they've gotten Dr. Kevorkian, they've decided they're  
going to go after his colleague,'' Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Runnels said investigators had no idea when they began the  
investigation eight months ago that it would led to Reding. 
</P>
<P>
	``To say it's harassment is absurd,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Kevorkian Associate Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO RANCHO, N.M. (AP) -- An associate of Dr. Jack Kevorkian is  
under investigation in the death of a 54-year-old woman who had 
been suffering from multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Rio Rancho police said Wednesday that evidence relating to the  
woman's death has been recovered from Dr. Georges Reding's home 
near Galesburg, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Police also found numerous files and documents, including  
apparent medical records for patients from across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said no charges have been filed against the  
74-year-old Reding. A 1963 New Mexico law prohibits assisted 
suicide, which is a felony punishable by 18 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of circumstances to investigate,'' Sandoval  
County District Attorney Mike Runnels said Wednesday. ``There will 
be charges filed if there's an indication that we have a crime 
committed here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reding, a retired psychiatrist, was arrested last year with  
Kevorkian when the pair dropped off a body at a suburban Detroit 
hospital. Reding was found innocent of charges he interfered with 
police and resisted arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian was sentenced last month to 10 to 25 years in prison  
for second-degree murder in the nationally televised injection 
death last September of Thomas Youk, a Lou Gehrig's disease 
patient. 
</P>
<P>
	According to toxicology reports, Donna Brennan died Aug. 30,  
1998 in Rio Rancho of an overdose of pentobarbital, a sedative that 
can be lethal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Brennan had apparently suffered much of her adult life from  
multiple sclerosis, an often-crippling nerve disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities first believed the woman died of natural causes. But  
her family contacted Rio Rancho police shortly after her death and 
asked for an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Michael Schwartz, who has defended both Reding and  
Kevorkian, said Reding was being harassed by authorities. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays Pitcher Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Tampa Bay Devil Rays pitcher Jim  
Mecir fractured his right elbow when he tripped during batting 
practice Wednesday and will miss the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays' primary setup man fell while running after a  
ball prior the Tampa Bay's 9-4 loss to the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
	Mecir, 0-1 with 2.61 ERA in 17 games, will have a pin inserted  
into his throwing elbow Thursday by Dr. James Andrews in Birmingham 
Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim's an important part of the ballclub,'' Tampa Bay manager  
Larry Rothschild said. ``He's picked up some huge innings for us. 
Last year, he was the guy who kept it together in a lot of 
situations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents are hitting just .205 against Mecir, who has given up  
15 hits and seven runs -- six earned -- in 20 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay also placed reliever Albie Lopez on the 15-day  
disabled list Wednesday with a left oblique strain and activated 
infielder Aaron Ledesman (dislocated left thumb) from the DL. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays optioned right-hander Eddie Gaillard to Triple-A  
Durham. Tampa Bay, looking to add left-handed pitching depth, will 
make two roster additions on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Man Has Third Foot Removed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITTIER, Calif. (AP) -- Jose Maria Lopez spent most of his 33  
years hiding a third foot that protruded from his left ankle. He 
would cut his shoe at the heel and wear baggy pants to cover the 
6-inch appendage. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the foot was inside his left leg, Lopez had to swing his  
right leg around the growth to avoid hitting it when he walked. 
</P>
<P>
	He now has just two feet, thanks to a surgeon who teamed up with  
Whittier Hospital Medical Center to amputate the defect free of 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has changed my life completely and I'm feeling fantastic,''  
said Lopez, a stable hand who wants to be a horse trainer. ``For a 
long time I've wanted to buy boots and now I can do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez, who works as a hot-walker at Santa Anita Park, cooling  
down horses that have just run, was born in Mexico, where a doctor 
told his family the extra foot was a bad omen from God and his leg 
would have to be amputated at the hip. He learned to live with the 
foot instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Michael O'Shea removed the foot -- which had a fully  
developed ankle, a heel and four toes -- during a 70-minute 
operation in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The cast came off four weeks later. Lopez said it is still  
strange walking around without the foot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I think I have it and I swing my leg out and I say,  
`Oh I don't have it,''' he said.

<HEADLINE> George Jones Pleads Guilty to DWI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) -- Country star George Jones pleaded guilty  
Wednesday to drunken driving for an accident that nearly killed 
him, and he promised to get help for his drinking problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll get my mind straight,'' Jones vowed after Judge Donald P.  
Harris approved a plea bargain calling for a $550 fine but no jail 
time. ``I think there will be no more problems at all out of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 67, pleaded guilty to driving while impaired and  
violating the open container law. A reckless driving charge will be 
dismissed in a year if he completes alcohol counseling and stays 
out of trouble. He keeps his license. 
</P>
<P>
	The country singer nearly died after his sport utility vehicle  
slammed into a bridge near his home outside Nashville on March 6. 
His liver was severely cut and his right lung was punctured, but he 
made a remarkable recovery and went home from the hospital after 13 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't remember much about the day of the accident, but I do  
know that I was drinking and obviously my driving was impaired,'' 
Jones said after the court session. ``I did wrong that day and I 
take full responsibility for what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones has a well-documented history of alcohol and drug abuse.  
He pleaded guilty to two drunken driving charges in 1982. He was 
ordered to perform a benefit concert. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said he had been sober for 12 years before the accident,  
having only an occasional glass of wine with dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Truthfully, the struggle never ends and I will get treatment  
to help me cope better,'' he said. ``I came very close to death and 
I know the Lord works in mysterious ways and he spared me. I can 
only believe that he still has work for me to do here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney General Ron Davis said prosecutors struck a  
plea bargain because it would have been hard to convict Jones. He 
said the star got no preferential treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very difficult case factually because the  
investigation from the Highway Patrol contained a lot of 
contradictory evidence and information,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	A half-empty pint of vodka was found in Jones' vehicle, but  
Trooper Michael Sprawling said there was no indication alcohol 
played a role. Sprawling said Jones crashed because he was talking 
on a cellular phone and not paying attention to the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Davis said, Jones stopped to help a motorist at a rest  
area minutes before the crash, and the motorist noticed no sign of 
intoxication. Several emergency workers who responded to the crash 
also said they did not detect alcohol on Jones, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, whose new album is due out in June, said he is eager to  
get back to singing and may take the stage again next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones has had more than 140 records on the charts during his  
nearly 40-year career, including classics like ``He Stopped Loving 
Her Today'' and ``A Good Year for the Roses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was married to Tammy Wynette for six years, and the pair were  
known as ``The King and Queen of Country Music.'' She died last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones has been married to Nancy Jones since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Move Members Mark Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Fourteen years after police destroyed 61  
homes in what a grand jury later called ``an epic of governmental 
incompetence,'' some residents complain the rebuilt houses are 
cursed. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 13, 1985, a police helicopter dropped a satchel bomb on  
the roof of a row house where members of MOVE had been blaring 
their anti-government messages. 
</P>
<P>
	MOVE -- a mostly black group whose members adopted the surname  
Africa, ate raw food, espoused equality with animals and preached 
against technology -- had been seeking the release of nine members 
convicted of killing a police officer in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	A gunfight broke out as police, acting on complaints from  
neighbors, tried to serve arrest warrants on four of the members. 
</P>
<P>
	During the assault, police dropped the homemade bomb to open a  
hole for tear gas. It missed and started a fire that killed 11 
people, including five children, and leveled 61 homes in West 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	City taxpayers have spent more than $36 million to rebuild the  
houses, settle claims by the estates of dead MOVE members and pay 
other expenses. But the houses continue to be plagued with 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Then-Mayor Wilson Goode had vowed to get people home by  
Christmas, less than eight months after the bombing, but the hurry 
may have compromised the construction. 
</P>
<P>
	After inspecting the houses two years ago, the U.S. Army Corps  
of Engineers estimated further repairs would cost at least $1.6 
million. The inspection itself cost $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The corps found evidence of a rush job. Stairways weren't where  
the design drawings put them, and living-room closets and half 
baths weren't there at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators reported that the vast majority of problems  
resulted from ``design and/or construction deficiencies.'' They 
include cracking bricks, deteriorating siding, faulty roofs, 
improper electrical wiring, and substandard windows and sliding 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to stop being in the home-repair business,'' said Noel  
Eisenstat, executive director of the city's Redevelopment 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Mayor Edward G. Rendell hope to complete the major  
repairs, as prescribed by the Army Corps, then make cash 
settlements with homeowners over smaller problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to get this work done quickly and well, and have these  
complaints addressed,'' said Kevin Feeley, Rendell's spokesman. 
Officials think repairs can be wrapped up before Rendell leaves 
office in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents are understandably skeptical.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I see them come out and start, that's when I believe  
them,'' Thomas Mapp told The Philadelphia Inquirer on Tuesday. ``I 
really don't believe them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The original developer of the houses, Ernest A. Edwards Jr., was  
convicted of stealing more than $137,000 from the project and 
served about seven years in prison. He now makes monthly 
restitution payments of $600 to the city. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, a city grand jury called the 1985 confrontation ``an  
epic of governmental incompetence,'' but found no basis for 
criminal charges against city officials or police. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, MOVE operates a World Wide Web site from a West  
Philadelphia home.

<HEADLINE> TheStreet.com Up 216 Pct. in IPO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The latest success story in the still-buoyant  
market for new Internet stocks: TheStreet.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of the Internet news service soared 216 percent in the  
company's initial public offering Tuesday, rising from its opening 
price of $19 to close at $60 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The stock 
rose as high as $73 at one point, as 13.5 million shares changed 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
	The offering convinced analysts that, despite a few flat  
Internet IPOs in recent weeks, money managers and investors are 
still willing to pay up for Web-related companies with strong brand 
names or ties to blue-chip businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	TheStreet.com is the brainchild of James J. Cramer, a hedge fund  
manager who founded the site in 1996. Cramer is a tireless and 
prolific promoter, supplementing his daily columns on TheStreet.com 
with appearances on cable news channel CNBC and guest columns in 
Time magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	The site itself has become a favorite of Wall Street traders  
with its chatty, sometimes irreverent stock market commentary. On 
Tuesday, the headline ``Net Stocks Discover There's Something About 
Mary,'' topped a story on the influence of Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter analyst Mary Meeker. 
</P>
<P>
	``James Cramer is the trader crowd's apostle,'' said Gail  
Bronson, an analyst for IPO Monitor.com. ``He tells it as he sees 
it, no holds barred.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TheStreet.com also benefited from its association with  
high-profile backers like the New York Times Co., which bought a 
minority stake in February, and News Corp., which agreed last week 
to invest $7.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Several market watchers said that as new issues of Internet  
stocks continue to flood the market, money managers and investors 
may be applying tougher standards to the stocks they add to their 
portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is starting to focus on winners,'' said Ken  
Fleming, a research analyst at Renaissance Capital Corp. ``For 
these companies, that means big names, premier underwriters and 
good backers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One thing it still doesn't mean is profits. In 1998,  
TheStreet.com lost $16.4 million on revenue of $4.6 million. In 
this year's first quarter, the company lost $7.2 million on revenue 
of less than $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many of its Web-based rivals, the company has opted to  
spend heavily to develop its content and attract subscribers and 
advertisers, in the hope of building profits down the line. 
</P>
<P>
	Subscriptions are on the rise, with 51,000 at the end of March,  
up from 32,000 at the end of December. Subscribers pay $99.95 a 
year, or $9.95 per month, although 5,500 signed on in last year's 
fourth quarter through a deal that exchanged subscriptions for 
frequent flier miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Cramer's name, and his willingness to tout his  
business, enticed many investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marketing, marketing, marketing,'' Bronson said. ``It's the  
critical factor for a successful Internet IPO.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleming said companies with strong, recognizable brand names are  
likely to dominate the IPO market in the months to come, naming 
Barnesandnoble.com, the online wing of the big bookseller, as the 
next hot offering. Its pricing has not yet been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	TheStreet.com's big first day couldn't touch the debut of rival  
MarketWatch.com, which posted a stunning 474 percent gain when it 
hit the market in January. Analysts said MarketWatch benefited from 
its alliance with the CBS television network. 
</P>
<P>
	Cramer's media ventures have not always been smooth. CNBC  
suspended him from one show last December after questions arose 
about whether he was commenting on a stock and trying to trade on 
it at the same time. He denied the charge, which came from Internet 
company WavePhore Inc.

<HEADLINE> Congress Agrees on $11.6B for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional negotiators agreed Wednesday to  
provide $11.6 billion for the air assault on Yugoslavia and to 
boost overall defense spending, nearly doubling the amount 
President Clinton requested. 
</P>
<P>
	But ongoing disputes over items ranging from fishing in Alaska's  
Glacier Bay to taxpayer assistance for some U.S. steel companies 
was hindering completion of the package, which House and Senate 
leaders want to send to Clinton by week's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers' demands for favored items were so insistent that they  
drove an exasperated GOP Rep. Bill Young of Florida, chairman of 
the House Appropriations Committee and a 29-year House member, to 
say, ``I'm practicing for my next career, and that is refereeing in 
the World Wrestling Federation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The provisions legislators were trying -- and in some cases  
succeeding -- in adding to the package also drew the ire of the 
White House, which has already threatened to veto the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've warned them not to load up this legislation'' with added  
language, said Linda Ricci, spokeswoman for the White House budget 
office. She also said Congress should avoid ``harmful cuts in other 
programs'' to pay for parts of the package. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the agreed-upon measures opposed by the White House would  
prohibit the federal government from laying claim to any of the 
$246 billion from settlements that states have reached with the 
tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest chunk of the bill -- and the item with the strongest  
political appeal -- was the money for U.S. participation in NATO's 
bombing of Yugoslavia. Though lawmakers are divided over the wisdom 
of the attacks, even many opponents are reluctant to oppose funds 
for the troops in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do believe that this war was started frivolously and pursued  
incompetently,'' said Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash. ``But I do believe 
we've got to pay for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To the $6 billion Clinton sought for the confrontation over  
Kosovo, House-Senate bargainers agreed to add $1.8 billion for a 
troop pay raise that would begin in January; $2.5 billion for 
military operations and maintenance of equipment; $678 million to 
help Kosovo's refugees and the Balkan states sheltering them; plus 
additional funds to replace depleted bombs, purchase other weapons 
and recruit. 
</P>
<P>
	The bargainers also agreed to pare $1 billion the House approved  
to modernize overseas military bases to $475 million, and to 
provide $200 million for the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	The compromise also would include nearly $1 billion for recent  
natural disasters in the Caribbean, mostly to help Honduras, Costa 
Rica, El Salvador and Nicaragua rebound from last autumn's 
devastating Hurricane Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	There is also $100 million for Jordan; $566 million to help  
American farmers struggling because of badly sagging commodities 
prices; and $900 million for the costs of the recent tornadoes in 
the Midwest and for a cushion for future disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiators worked into the evening, attempting to heed orders  
by House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott, R-Miss., to complete their bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said bargainers had accepted  
her Senate-approved proposal to continue a moratorium through 
September against new Energy Department rules that would force oil 
and gas producers using federal lands to pay higher royalties to 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., won his attempt to delay the Interior  
Department from implementing stricter cleanup requirements for 
mining companies using federal lands. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, participants said bargainers would allow the  
government to spend up to $4.3 million more for reparations to 
people of Japanese descent who were deported or placed in camps 
during World War II, and who missed an earlier round of federal 
reparation payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., dropped an effort to prevent the  
Interior Department from setting aside stretches of the Rio Grande 
River to protect the endangered silvery minnow. 
</P>
<P>
	Bargainers accepted a Senate-passed provision by Hutchison to  
keep the federal government's hands off the tobacco settlements. 
They also appeared ready to accept another by Sen. Robert Byrd, 
D-W.Va., to provide $140 million to back $1 billion worth of loans 
for some small steel companies facing competition from low-priced 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
	But key differences remained.  
</P>
<P>
	Kansas GOP Sens. Pat Roberts and Sam Brownback were pushing a  
provision to forgive more than $200 million in interest and 
penalties owed by the state's natural gas producers who were ruled 
to have overcharged customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska's Republican Senate duo, Frank Murkowski and Senate  
Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, made a lengthy plea 
to block the National Park Service from phasing out commercial and 
subsistence fishing in Glacier Bay National Park.

<HEADLINE> Joan Chen Not on Screen in Latest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- At the edge of the Chinese province of  
Sichuan near the lonely steppes of Tibet, the seemingly endless 
grasslands sway with every breeze and the setting sun casts an 
eerie glow that can tingle your spine. 
</P>
<P>
	Joan Chen stood on those plains three years ago and realized she  
couldn't direct her first film -- ``Xiu Xiu: The Sent Down Girl'' -- 
anywhere but there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think when I made the choice to film this story, it was also  
a very aesthetic choice, under this piece of sky and horizon,'' she 
said. ``There are certain landscapes that inspire us and Tibet was 
one of those places.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The film is the story of Xiu Xiu, a teen-ager who, like some 7  
million other ``educated youth'' in China, was sent down from the 
cities to the countryside to learn from the peasantry during the 
Cultural Revolution. She instead suffers from the brutality of men 
with power. 
</P>
<P>
	The English-subtitled film won for best picture at Taiwan's  
Golden Horse Awards and best dramatic feature at last year's Ft. 
Lauderdale Film Festival. It begins nationwide release this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen never received permission to shoot from Chinese  
authorities. After the film debuted at last year's Berlin Film 
Festival, Beijing banned Chen from working in China for one year 
and ordered her to pay a fine of 10 percent of the movie's $1 
million budget. 
</P>
<P>
	This is a dramatic turnabout for the 38-year-old Chen, known as  
Hollywood's exotic Chinese paramour -- from a romp as Anne Heche's 
sexy plaything in the poorly received ``Wild Side'' to the spoiled, 
opium-addicted empress in the Oscar-winning ``The Last Emperor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her cherry-red lips, smooth voice and dark eyes made her a  
natural for Hollywood, a fill-in-the-blank Asian beauty for any 
project. But her expectations for herself made her yearn for 
something more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't even know that was typecasting,'' Chen said recently  
from Vancouver, British Columbia, where she had been filming a 
cable TV movie. ``I just thought that's what American people 
wanted. I accepted things as being strange. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought, 'OK, that's how they want a Chinese to look. That's  
how they want me to behave.' I tried to give that to them. I didn't 
want to fight or anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Shanghai-born actress was tapped for stardom by no less than  
Jiang Qing, wife of Mao Tse-tung, who needed a gun-savvy girl to 
play a guerrilla in a propaganda movie about the Communists' Long 
March. She chose Chen, who was on her high school's rifle team. 
</P>
<P>
	Expectations soared as she studied acting at the Shanghai Film  
Studio. At 15, she was called ``the young Elizabeth Taylor of 
China.'' At 19, she won the nation's top acting prize for playing a 
revolutionary's daughter in pre-Mao China in ``Little Flower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chen left China for the United States in 1981 to study  
filmmaking at California State University, Northridge, and also to 
escape her celebrity back home. 
</P>
<P>
	In America, ``it was exhilarating because nobody would be  
crowding around me, nobody knew me,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen made ends meet during college by working as a hostess at a  
Los Angeles-area restaurant. ``Friends had no idea I was a movie 
star in China because I was so poor,'' she said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	Things were slow until she was seen walking across a parking lot  
by director Dino De Laurentiis, who cast her in the lead Asian role 
in his 1985 TV movie ``Tai-Pan.'' Roles in good and bad projects 
followed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going through that bad experience affirmed my love of film and  
filmmaking,'' Chen said. ``I wanted to demand more from myself and 
wanted to widen my horizons for my career. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's how this film was made.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Xiu Xiu'' came to fruition from friend Yan Geling's 1995 novel  
``Tian Yu.'' Chen produced the film and co-wrote the screenplay 
with Yan. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Chen was the title character's age during the Cultural  
Revolution, she was never ``sent down.'' She views the film as a 
tribute to others who were. 
</P>
<P>
	``The project is many different things to me,'' she said. ``Most  
importantly, it's a commemoration and the loss of innocence of my 
generation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Predictably, Chinese censors frowned when they saw the  
screenplay and wanted changes made. Chen refused and started 
filming without a permit in the spring of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just wasn't right because I wouldn't be revising the script  
to improve a film. I'd be revising it to just get a permit,'' she 
said. ``... I had limitations already. I didn't want to limit 
myself further to get this permit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conditions were harsh. The location was at the 13,000-foot level  
with the closest airport a two-day drive away. When crew members 
weren't looking over their shoulders for Chinese authorities who 
might confiscate their equipment and kill the project, they were 
searching for places to hide film negatives before they were flown 
to the United States for processing. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything was paid for with cash stuffed inside backpacks  
carried by twitchy line producers. 
</P>
<P>
	The thin air made breathing difficult, and the crew was  
subjected to a diet that consisted almost exclusively of yak meat. 
Showers were rare. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, she always believed the ordeal was worth it.  
</P>
<P>
	``I now understand why they call it virgin work,'' she said.  
``It's like a first love, the first time you undress, in a way. 
You're in awe of that emotional power. It was very beautiful, very 
memorable.''

<P>
	The Hang Seng Index rose 138.60 points, or 1.1 percent, closing

<HEADLINE> RJR Sharholders Meet Before Spinoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- The separation of RJR Nabisco's food  
and domestic tobacco businesses will return tidy profits to 
shareholders in both companies, chairman Steven F. Goldstone said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone told me today, `All's well that ends well,' '' he told  
reporters following what amounted to RJR Nabisco's last 
shareholders meeting. ``We now have two companies that are in very 
good shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In March, RJR Nabisco announced its intention to spin off its  
U.S. cigarette business from its food interests after selling its 
international tobacco business for nearly $8 billion to Japan 
Tobacco Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR said the international tobacco sale was completed Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	The spinoff of the domestic tobacco business, which makes  
Winston, Camel and Salem cigarettes, is expected to be completed by 
June 15, Goldstone said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is second only to Philip Morris Cos. Inc., maker of Marlboro.  
</P>
<P>
	None of the moves required shareholder approval. The meeting  
drew about 200 shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing more relaxed than he has been at previous shareholders  
meetings, Goldstone said he could understand why one speaker 
described the meeting as a wake. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people are nostalgic about this company,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	RJR Nabisco was acquired just over a decade ago for about $25  
billion in the biggest leveraged buyout at that time. The deal 
capped one of the wildest corporate bidding wars of the junk 
bond-fueled 1980s and was chronicled on the book ``Barbarians at 
the Gate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to its tobacco business, RJR owns an 80.6 percent  
stake in Nabisco Holdings Corp., which makes Oreo cookies, Ritz 
crackers and Planters nuts. That is all RJR will own after the 
domestic tobacco spinoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates of a split-up of the tobacco and food interests argued  
the market was undervaluing the food business because of its 
connection with the potential liabilities of the tobacco 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	With the spinoff of the tobacco business, Goldstone said,  
Nabisco shareholders won't have to worry about lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``As time goes along, Nabisco shareholders won't be thinking  
about litigation,'' he said. ``They'll be thinking about Oreos and 
Chips Ahoy!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstone will remain with Nabisco as chairman while James M.  
Kilts will remain as president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	As a separate publicly-traded company, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco  
will have the financial muscle to continue to defend itself in 
tobacco lawsuits, Goldstone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders will have one share in each separate company when  
the spinoff is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	Several anti-smoking speakers addressed Goldstone during the  
30-minute question-and-answer session. Shareholders overwhelmingly 
rejected two shareholder proposals: one on tobacco advertising and 
youth and the second dealing with cigarette smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders also elected a company-backed slate of nine  
directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholder Carl Icahn had nominated his own slate to challenge  
the RJR nominees but withdrew it late last month. Icahn wanted RJR 
to spin off the food holdings rather than the domestic tobacco 
business. But he dropped his proxy contest after several large 
shareholders told him they supported management's spinoff plan as 
the quickest way to divide the company. 
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks, R.J. Reynolds chief executive Andrew J.  
Schindler said he was looking forward to the challenge of running 
the tobacco business as a separate entity. 
</P>
<P>
	He said cigarette consumption is declining, with estimates for  
1999 indicating U.S. consumption will fall as much as 8.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the industry is facing more lawsuits and political  
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	``We intend to be as resilient and competitive as possible in  
this new environment,'' Schindler said. ``We'll fight hard to 
maintain our market position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of RJR closed up 37 1/2 cents, at $28.75, on the New York  
Stock Exchange, while shares of Nabisco were off 6 1/4 cents, at 
$42.12 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Cyclist Denies Drug Use Confession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French cyclist Richard Virenque on Wednesday denied  
he had confessed to taking drugs, but cast doubt on his future in 
the sport, saying he felt drained. 
</P>
<P>
	Judicial officials were quoted a day earlier as saying that  
Virenque told a judge investigating drug use that he had taken 
substances supplied by Bertrand Sainz, one of five people being 
investigated for involvement in what has been described as a 
drug-supplying network. 
</P>
<P>
	The Le Monde newspaper on Wednesday also said it had learned  
that Virenque had admitted to drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	But the former Festina cyclist, who now rides for Italy's Polti  
team, said Sainz had prescribed vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
	Virenque was at the center of last year's Tour de France doping  
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike other Festina riders, he has continually denied he  
knowingly took banned substances. He has previously threatened to 
quit cycling over drug abuse allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, he said he needed time to think over his future.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm aware there's a problem in the sport ... but must Richard  
Virenque quit so there's no longer a doping problem? I don't 
know,'' he said in an interview with television channel TF1. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to have a long talk with my wife and we'll see at a  
later date, but today I feel drained.'' 
</P>
<P>
	World Cup leader Frank Vandenbroucke on Tuesday acknowledged  
taking medical products from Sainz, but said he thought they were 
homeopathic substances. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, two Spanish cycling teams, ONCE and Banesto, denied  
published reports that they may skip this year's Tour de France. 
Both said they intend taking part in the cycling's premier event.

	CUTTING CULINARY COSTS: If your corporate travel managers clutch  
when they see the meal tab from your business trips, it may be time 
to cut back. The consulting firm Runzheimer International, which 
notes that meals are the third-biggest business travel expense 
after airfare and lodging, has some suggestions. First, don't eat 
in hotel dining rooms or airport terminals, which tend to have a 
huge markup. If you're staying in the suburbs and have access to a 
car, there are plenty of moderate and lower priced restaurants to 
choose from. Another idea is to find out where local residents eat; 
they probably know where to get decent food at a good price. And do 
some research about cheaper places to eat before you leave home. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	DINER DREAMS: For many people, a diner is the place to go for  
eggs-over-easy, blue-plate specials and mugs of coffee. For others, 
it's not just an eatery; it's a reminder of another era and a way 
to grab hold of fond memories. Really serious diner enthusiasts 
have their own convention, called Diner-Rama, that includes three 
days of eating, talking and field trips. This year's Diner-Rama is 
being held June 18-21 in Parsippany, N.J., and will include visits 
to companies that make diners and a day-long tour of notable nearby 
diners. But the American Diner Museum, which sponsors the 
convention, says it's not all fun -- it includes a seminar about 
operating a diner that will let wannabe owners know that a lot of 
hard work comes along with the nostalgia.

	HOME EQUITY LOANS: Bank One, trying to find out more about  
Americans' borrowing preferences, says it found that many 
homeowners don't understand the tax advantages of home equity 
loans. The nation's fifth-largest bank says it commissioned a 
survey in which 40 percent of the 723 responding homeowners did not 
know that the interest on home equity loans is usually tax 
deductible for people who itemize deductions on their tax returns. 
That lack of knowledge may be contributing to the fact that 28 
percent of the homeowners said they have used home equity loans or 
lines of credits, while 66 percent have taken out auto loans and 58 
percent have received personal loans. The interest on auto and 
personal loans is not tax-deductible.

<HEADLINE> Giants RB Trying Cancer Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- There are times when LeShon Johnson  
is talking that he just has to stop and swallow hard, searching the 
recesses of his mouth for a touch of saliva for his parched lips 
and throat. 
</P>
<P>
	Until a year ago, the New York Giants running back didn't have  
that problem. Then came the cancer, the chemotherapy and finally 
the radiation, which dried out his saliva glands, at least 
temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
	It's something Johnson can endure, after already having endured  
working to get back on the football field for another shot at 
playing in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, I'm just so excited right now,'' Johnson said Wednesday  
after going through his second day of a minicamp for Giants 
veterans. ``The main thing is I've joined the team again. It's 
great being around my teammates and going out there playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About this time last year, life was more uncertain. Doctors  
found a tumor the size of a grapefruit in his chest while taking a 
routine X-ray prior to last year's minicamp. 
</P>
<P>
	What make the discovery remarkable was that Johnson was the  
picture of health. He was a 27-year-old who had just signed with 
the Giants as a free agent, and he might have been one of the 
best-conditioned athletes on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson insists he never asked `Why me?'  
</P>
<P>
	``I was thinking more about playing again and getting healthy,''  
Johnson said, every once and while sticking out his tongue to try 
to wet his lips. ``I felt God was on my side, but playing again was 
the biggest thing. I didn't know if I could come back again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson really wasn't sure until treatment ended in late  
January. 
</P>
<P>
	The chemo wasn't that bad. He had trouble keeping food down  
after the first few doses, but he later was able to eat and work 
out after a session. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28 straight days of radiation were a lot tougher. The  
sessions only lasted five minutes but the after effects left him 
drained almost the entire month of January, a period which included 
his 28th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty bad, but it's only as bad as you make it,'' said  
Johnson, who broke into the NFL in 1994 with Green Bay. ``You can 
sit and feel sorry for yourself and let it get you down, or you can 
go out and do the things that you were doing before you found out 
you were sick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The one thing Johnson had working for him was his wife and two  
children. They were there all the time, watching cartoons with him 
and giving him the `Oh, Dad' comments when he flipped televisions 
stations just to get an occasional glimpse of a football game. He 
never watched too long, though, because it was frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just by having kids, that takes your mind off a lot of things  
and makes you feel a lot better,'' Johnson said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
	Talking about football makes Johnson smile even wider, and that  
smile hasn't left his face working out this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Catching swing passes out of the backfield in 7-on-7 drills,  
Johnson has looked very quick, apparently just as fast as before 
the cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has got some serious wheels,'' quarterback Kent Graham  
said. ``He'll hit that hole 150 mph and he'll break some big ones. 
It's exciting to see him out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next step will be full contact and that first big hit.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm waiting to give one,'' Johnson said. ``I love contact and  
I just can't wait to go out there and lower my head and punish 
somebody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is still six pounds under his playing weight of 212, but  
he expects to be ready for the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't wait for that day when I run through the tunnel in my  
blue uniform and play and I hear: `LeShon Johnson on the carry.' I 
can't wait for it to happen.''

<HEADLINE> Lakers Set To Eliminate Rockets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Houston Rockets have been in this spot  
before, and the Los Angeles Lakers know it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not over yet, we realize that,'' Glen Rice said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers routed the Rockets 110-98 to take a 2-0 lead Tuesday  
in their best-of-5 series. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Rockets have an 11-4 record in playoff elimination games  
under coach Rudy Tomjanovich. Their next test comes in Game 3 
Thursday night at Compaq Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that we still haven't done anything,'' Rice said.  
``It's going to be a dog fight in Houston. I'm sure their fans are 
going to be behind them 110 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, they realize that their backs are against the wall,  
so they are going to come out fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston's resiliency is well documented. In their championship  
years of 1994 and 1995, they were down 2-0 each year to the Phoenix 
Suns in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	But those comebacks were in best-of-7 series. The Rockets have  
no margin for error this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Should the Rockets add to their comeback history, they would be  
the sixth team in NBA history to recover from an 0-2 start in a 
best-of-5 series. Denver did it most recently against Seattle in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to panic. I've been in worse situations than  
this,'' Charles Barkley said. ``We just got to go home and win, 
plain and simple. They did what they had to do. That's what home 
court is all about. We just got to go home and win one and then win 
two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets are looking more to Game 1 for inspiration. Two late  
defensive plays by the Lakers helped them to a 101-100 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Game 1 is a lot more indicative of how well we can play  
against this team,'' Barkley said. ``That was a costly loss, but 
this was just a blowout.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers have won six games in a row, including their last  
four games of the regular season. In fact, the Rockets are the last 
team to beat the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that when we go out there together and play aggressive  
defense and stop them from doing the things that they want to do, 
the sky is the limit,'' Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers again showed defensive power in Game 2. They allowed  
the Rockets only 12 first-quarter points. Hakeem Olajuwon and 
Scottie Pippen were not factors. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Defeat Expected on Flag Burning Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Backers of a proposed constitutional amendment  
to ban flag burning said Tuesday the decision of two wavering 
Democratic senators to oppose it has dampened its prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	North Dakota Democrats Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad raised  
proponents' hopes this year by retreating from their opposition to 
the amendment and declaring themselves undecided. The amendments' 
supporters began to consider them two of three additional Senate 
votes needed to cross the required two-thirds threshold. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Senate leaders aim for a floor vote before Memorial  
Day. Dorgan and Conrad announced they would vote against amending 
the Constitution and offer a long-shot alternative that would ban 
flag desecration in a statute instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``A number of constitutional scholars have convinced me a  
statute can still be upheld by the Supreme Court,'' said Dorgan. 
The court has twice declared flag-burning laws unconstitutional 
abridgments of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators' decision ``hurts the situation,'' Judiciary  
Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said. ``It makes passage 
less likely.'' But Hatch said the amendment still would be brought 
to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel S. Wheeler, president of the Citizens Flag Alliance, said  
the Dorgan-Conrad pullout did not help the proposal's chances but 
held out the possibility of picking up votes from Democrats still 
undeclared. 
</P>
<P>
	Activists on both sides of the perennial debate said Dorgan and  
Conrad's announcement skirted what they had believed would be the 
amendment's best chance of congressional approval in years. Once an 
amendment obtains two-thirds majorities in both houses of Congress, 
three-fourths of the states -- 38 -- must ratify it before the 
measure becomes a part of the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said they won't give up on a measure they contend  
would provide needed protection of a symbol of American values. 
Opponents, who cheered the announcement by the North Dakota 
senators, insist the amendment would infringe on rights the flag 
symbolizes such as free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just can't imagine that there is a compelling interest now  
in scaling back even a little on this very grand idea,'' the 
Constitution's Bill of Rights, said Paul Tash, executive editor of 
the St. Petersburg Times and chairman of the freedom of information 
committee of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. ``Based 
upon their announcement, we believe that the amendment will likely 
fail in the Senate, though by a very narrow margin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is a 17-word amendment that would allow Congress to ban  
flag desecration. It has repeatedly attained a two-thirds majority 
in the House but failed in the Senate the last time by three votes 
in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents gained a vote in last year's elections when former  
Ohio Gov. George Voinovich, a Republican amendment supporter, was 
elected to the seat held by retiring Sen. John Glenn, a Democratic 
opponent. They had hoped that Dorgan and Conrad would make up the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the two North Dakota senators are sponsoring the ``Flag  
Protection Act of 1999,'' which they tout as a court 
challenge-proof alternative to amending the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said Dorgan and Conrad's proposal is exactly what the  
constitutional amendment would enable Congress to pass. Without the 
amendment, Hatch said, the courts are likely to strike down any 
statutory version.

<P>
	OXFORD, England (AP) -- Sir Edward Abraham, an Oxford University  
professor and biochemist who played an important role in the 
development of penicillin, died Sunday. He was 85.

in the treatment of respiratory infections such as pneumonia and 
bronchitis. 
</P>
<P>
	Through his patents, Abraham became very wealthy but donated  
most of his fortune to a charitable trust to support biomedical 
research. Since the 1970s, the Edward Abraham Fund has provided 
millions of dollars for projects at Oxford.

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Edwin L. Dale Jr., a former reporter for The  
New York Times and a spokesman for the White House Office of 
Management and Budget, died of cancer Monday. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale served as assistant director of public affairs at OMB  
between 1981 and 1987 during the Reagan administration. 
</P>
<P>
	He then spent two years as a counselor to Commerce Secretary C.  
William Verity before returning to the budget office as a director 
of external affairs. He worked in the area of policy studies before 
retiring in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for his mastery of the federal budget, Dale took as many  
as 110 calls in a day during the height of budget season. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale came to Washington in 1951 as a reporter for the New York  
Herald Tribune. Four years later, he began covering economics for 
The Times. He spent several years in Paris, and later returned to 
Washington with assignments at the White House and the State 
Department. In 1977, Dale went to work on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the author of ``Conservatives in Power'' in 1960 and was  
the primary author of ``The People's Budget,'' published in 1995.

</P>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- Joe Flowers, a former Escambia County  
comptroller who lost millions of taxpayer dollars by investing in 
risky securities, died Monday at age 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Flowers had a reputation as the watchdog of public finances for  
almost 40 years, but it was shattered in 1994 when Escambia County 
lost nearly $15 million as the value of its investments in 
derivatives dropped dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
	Four Texas securities brokers subsequently were convicted of  
conspiracy, racketeering and fraud for duping Flowers into 
purchasing the securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Many other public and private investors also lost millions on  
derivatives, whose value is based on -- or derived from -- an 
underlying asset such as a commodity or swings in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history, the December  
1994 collapse of Orange County, Calif.'s investments, also was tied 
to bad bets on derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Flowers resigned in 1995 and the Legislature abolished his  
position, which had been made an elected one in 1972. He also was 
indicted on lesser charges of mishandling public money and pleaded 
no contest. He was ordered to pay $1,600 in court costs.

<HEADLINE> Flynt Makes Deal With Prosecutors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Prosecutors dropped obscenity charges against  
Larry Flynt on Wednesday after he agreed to stop selling hard-core 
videos at his Cincinnati bookstore. As part of the plea bargain, 
the shop was fined $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement came on the third day of jury selection in a trial  
that could have sent the Hustler magazine publisher to prison for 
24 years. Prospective jurors had been warned they would have to 
watch as many as 40 hours of porn videos. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors allowed Flynt, 56, and his brother, Jimmy, 52, to  
substitute their bookstore for themselves in a plea of guilty to 
two counts of pandering obscenity. Hustler News &AMP; Gifts, which 
Jimmy Flynt manages, was fined $5,000 on each count. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flynts agreed to remove sexually explicit videos from the  
store, which also sells Hustler and other magazines and sex toys. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors dropped 13 charges against the Flynts, including one  
count alleging a 14-year-old boy bought porno videos at the store. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very pleased,'' Larry Flynt said. ``The deal the  
prosecution offered us was the deal we always wanted. We want to 
sell our magazine. If they just leave the magazine alone, we'll be 
OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt also said: ``My brother, who I love very much, is involved  
in this case and he faced 24 years right along with me. And even 
though we felt very good about the jury, you can never be sure what 
they're going to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt opened the store just off downtown Cincinnati's  
centerpiece Fountain Square in 1997 because he was angry at 
obscenity crackdowns that kept his magazine largely unavailable in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he hoped his trial would show that community standards  
for obscenity had changed since 1977, when he was convicted of 
obscenity for selling Hustler in Cincinnati. In that case, Flynt 
served six days of a seven-to-25-year sentence. The conviction was 
overturned in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Mike Allen said Hamilton County protected its values  
and made no concessions to the Flynts. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't win. He lost,'' Allen said. ``He turned tail and  
ran.''

<HEADLINE> Guide Dog Charity Has Huge Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN RAFAEL, Calif. (AP) -- The charity Guide Dogs for the Blind  
has accumulated so much money in donations that critics are 
suggesting it's time to share the wealth. 
</P>
<P>
	While no laws are being violated, most regulators and monitoring  
organizations don't like to see charities hoarding large amounts of 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Charities Information Bureau suggests donors be  
wary of organizations that have more than two years' spending in 
reserve. Guide Dogs has stashed away enough to cover costs for a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point is that you shouldn't be accumulating money ... if  
you're not going to spend it,'' bureau spokesman Dan Langan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The school is the nation's premier facility for training dogs to  
aid the visually impaired and training the new owners to use them, 
but the money issue is raising questions about how charitable it 
really is. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, it wound up with more than twice as much money as it  
needed, spending $21 million with nearly $24 million left over. 
Guide Dogs has an endowment of some $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The school says they are protecting themselves against  
investment problems while predicting a growing enrollment as the 
population increases. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is acting as prudent managers,'' said Richard Graffis, an  
investment adviser and chairman of the board of Guide Dogs, which 
was formed in 1942 to aid servicemen blinded during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Federation for the Blind says the nation's blind  
population of 1.1 million is growing slowly, and fewer than 10,000 
use dogs while 130,000 use the familiar red-tipped white cane.

<HEADLINE> Police Study Proposal Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A proposal for a new commission to study  
training, recruitment and use of force by big-city police 
departments won't solve persistent problems of police brutality, 
House Democrats said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need another study. What we need is real reform,''  
said Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, senior Democrat on the House 
Judiciary Committee, at a hearing on the National Police Training 
Commission Act of 1999. ``This is a serious, ongoing, historically 
important matter that's been troubling this committee ever since 
I've been on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police groups voiced different concerns about the objectivity of  
the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate leaders would appoint five members to the  
commission to study the ``effectiveness of training, recruiting, 
hiring, oversight and funding policies and practices in law 
enforcement'' and report to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also authorizes $3 million in grants next fiscal year  
for New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington for training 
programs. It is sponsored by House Judiciary Committee Chairman 
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde, who alluded to a recent spate of high-profile cases of  
alleged police brutality, said that while individual incidents can 
be redressed through the civil and criminal courts, the legal 
system cannot solve underlying problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, he said, proposes solutions ``to bolster the  
confidence the citizens have in their police and to provide 
effective training for police officers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. Marty Pfeifer, a national board member of the Fraternal  
Order of Police, said the organization was concerned that ``any 
commission with political appointees may not have the requisite 
objectivity needed to examine the issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Edward Flynn, police chief in Arlington, Va., and  
legislative chair of the Police Executive Research Forum, wanted 
details about how the study would be done. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who said she comes from the  
``police brutality capital of the world,'' pronounced herself 
disgusted by the Hyde-Serrano bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that this bill is going to help at all if police  
departments don't get it yet,'' she said. Real penalties are needed 
to deter officers from ``using the badge and the gun to violate 
people's civil rights,'' Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
	Serrano, who represents the Bronx district where the fatal  
police shooting of Amadou Diallo, a street vendor from West Africa, 
has come to symbolize excessive use of force by police, said the 
problem can't be blamed on racism alone. 
</P>
<P>
	He said police departments ``must do a better job of recruiting,  
teaching use-of-force policies and selecting assignments for 
officers'' because many lack the skills and training to deal 
effectively with people from other cultures. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP said the bill also should include increased funding  
for several Justice Department programs and require police officers 
to collect racial information on drivers pulled over for alleged 
traffic violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Diallo's mother, Kadiadou, who also testified, said she still  
seeks answers to questions about what happened to her eldest son. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not against the police,'' she said. ``All I ask is justice  
against these four people who murdered my son. All I appeal to the 
federal government is to provide whatever they can to prevent this 
kind of situation in the future.''

<HEADLINE> Morning Show Stunts Suffer Setbacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- TV's morning news shows may want to think twice  
the next time a travel agent comes calling. 
</P>
<P>
	After enduring an uncomfortable night on the side of Mount  
Everest, Matt Lauer of NBC's ``Today'' show was prevented Tuesday 
from traveling to a second mystery location when the Indian 
government grounded his plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Hostile weather in this country forced Charles Gibson, Diane  
Sawyer and the crew of ABC's ``Good Morning America'' to travel 10 
hours by bus from Austin, Texas, to New Orleans in time for 
Tuesday's show -- and another downpour. 
</P>
<P>
	Both shows are traveling to drum up interest during a ratings  
``sweeps'' month. For the second straight year, NBC's ``Where in 
the world is Matt Lauer?'' promotion sends the anchorman on a 
week-long mystery tour to destinations unknown to viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	He made it to the slopes of the world's tallest mountain Monday,  
but it's been all downhill since. 
</P>
<P>
	Fog obscured views of the peak and prevented Lauer from leaving  
after Monday's show. He was stuck in a shack with his wife, model 
Annette Roque Lauer, eating ravioli and crackers, and sleeping in 
sleeping bags. There was no running water, only an outhouse 
accessible after a jog in the freezing cold. 
</P>
<P>
	The fog finally lifted enough for Lauer to get off the mountain  
and fly to Katmandu, Nepal. But he waited on a runway for more than 
six hours when officials refused permission to fly over Indian 
airspace. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time Lauer finally took off, it was too late to reach his  
second destination in time for Tuesday's show, said Jeff Zucker, 
``Today'' executive producer. He was rerouted in the air to his 
planned third destination. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC scrambled overnight to fill time, calling former ``Partridge  
Family'' actor Danny Bonaduce after midnight for an interview on 
the perils of child stardom. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all part of the game,'' Zucker said. ``In order to score  
big, you've got to take big chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Good Morning America'' picked Austin for its first stop in a  
bus tour of the South. But Gibson and Sawyer were planning to cheat 
Monday -- traveling by plane to Lafayette, La. -- and ride the bus 
from there to New Orleans. Instead, their plane was grounded and 
everyone had to make the long drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Lafayette, and about 2,000 people who were waiting to greet the  
crew, were bypassed. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Orleans, a downpour Tuesday forced ``GMA'' to move its  
broadcast site from the outdoor Jackson Square to the nearby 
Pontalbo Cafe. The Neville Brothers had to cancel a performance 
because their equipment was drenched, said Shelley Ross, the show's 
executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all calm,'' Ross said. ``A zen came over our  
production. In a funny way, I think we had a better show. It had 
energy and spontaneity.''

<HEADLINE> Joan Chen Not on Screen in Latest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- At the edge of the Chinese province of  
Sichuan near the lonely steppes of Tibet, the seemingly endless 
grasslands sway with every breeze and the setting sun casts an 
eerie glow that can tingle your spine. 
</P>
<P>
	Joan Chen stood on those plains three years ago and realized she  
couldn't direct her first film -- ``Xiu Xiu: The Sent Down Girl'' -- 
anywhere but there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think when I made the choice to film this story, it was also  
a very aesthetic choice, under this piece of sky and horizon,'' she 
said. ``There are certain landscapes that inspire us and Tibet was 
one of those places.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The film is the story of Xiu Xiu, a teen-ager who, like some 7  
million other ``educated youth'' in China, was sent down from the 
cities to the countryside to learn from the peasantry during the 
Cultural Revolution. She instead suffers from the brutality of men 
with power. 
</P>
<P>
	The English-subtitled film won for best picture at Taiwan's  
Golden Horse Awards and best dramatic feature at last year's Ft. 
Lauderdale Film Festival. It begins nationwide release this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen never received permission to shoot from Chinese  
authorities. After the film debuted at last year's Berlin Film 
Festival, Beijing banned Chen from working in China for one year 
and ordered her to pay a fine of 10 percent of the movie's $1 
million budget. 
</P>
<P>
	This is a dramatic turnabout for the 38-year-old Chen, known as  
Hollywood's exotic Chinese paramour -- from a romp as Anne Heche's 
sexy plaything in the poorly received ``Wild Side'' to the spoiled, 
opium-addicted empress in the Oscar-winning ``The Last Emperor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her cherry-red lips, smooth voice and dark eyes made her a  
natural for Hollywood, a fill-in-the-blank Asian beauty for any 
project. But her expectations for herself made her yearn for 
something more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't even know that was typecasting,'' Chen said recently  
from Vancouver, British Columbia, where she had been filming a 
cable TV movie. ``I just thought that's what American people 
wanted. I accepted things as being strange. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought, 'OK, that's how they want a Chinese to look. That's  
how they want me to behave.' I tried to give that to them. I didn't 
want to fight or anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Shanghai-born actress was tapped for stardom by no less than  
Jiang Qing, wife of Mao Tse-tung, who needed a gun-savvy girl to 
play a guerrilla in a propaganda movie about the Communists' Long 
March. She chose Chen, who was on her high school's rifle team. 
</P>
<P>
	Expectations soared as she studied acting at the Shanghai Film  
Studio. At 15, she was called ``the young Elizabeth Taylor of 
China.'' At 19, she won the nation's top acting prize for playing a 
revolutionary's daughter in pre-Mao China in ``Little Flower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chen left China for the United States in 1981 to study  
filmmaking at California State University, Northridge, and also to 
escape her celebrity back home. 
</P>
<P>
	In America, ``it was exhilarating because nobody would be  
crowding around me, nobody knew me,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen made ends meet during college by working as a hostess at a  
Los Angeles-area restaurant. ``Friends had no idea I was a movie 
star in China because I was so poor,'' she said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	Things were slow until she was seen walking across a parking lot  
by director Dino De Laurentiis, who cast her in the lead Asian role 
in his 1985 TV movie ``Tai-Pan.'' Roles in good and bad projects 
followed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going through that bad experience affirmed my love of film and  
filmmaking,'' Chen said. ``I wanted to demand more from myself and 
wanted to widen my horizons for my career. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's how this film was made.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Xiu Xiu'' came to fruition from friend Yan Geling's 1995 novel  
``Tian Yu.'' Chen produced the film and co-wrote the screenplay 
with Yan. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Chen was the title character's age during the Cultural  
Revolution, she was never ``sent down.'' She views the film as a 
tribute to others who were. 
</P>
<P>
	``The project is many different things to me,'' she said. ``Most  
importantly, it's a commemoration and the loss of innocence of my 
generation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Predictably, Chinese censors frowned when they saw the  
screenplay and wanted changes made. Chen refused and started 
filming without a permit in the spring of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just wasn't right because I wouldn't be revising the script  
to improve a film. I'd be revising it to just get a permit,'' she 
said. ``... I had limitations already. I didn't want to limit 
myself further to get this permit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conditions were harsh. The location was at the 13,000-foot level  
with the closest airport a two-day drive away. When crew members 
weren't looking over their shoulders for Chinese authorities who 
might confiscate their equipment and kill the project, they were 
searching for places to hide film negatives before they were flown 
to the United States for processing. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything was paid for with cash stuffed inside backpacks  
carried by twitchy line producers. 
</P>
<P>
	The thin air made breathing difficult, and the crew was  
subjected to a diet that consisted almost exclusively of yak meat. 
Showers were rare. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, she always believed the ordeal was worth it.  
</P>
<P>
	``I now understand why they call it virgin work,'' she said.  
``It's like a first love, the first time you undress, in a way. 
You're in awe of that emotional power. It was very beautiful, very 
memorable.''

<HEADLINE> Abu-Jamal Asks Court To Review Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Death row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal has asked  
the U.S. Supreme Court to review his 1982 conviction for killing a 
Philadelphia police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal claims his Sixth Amendment rights were violated  
because he was not permitted to represent himself, and when he 
protested he was removed from the courtroom for most of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're arguing due process violations, that he was tried in  
absentia in effect,'' said Rachel Wolkenstein, one of Abu-Jamal's 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal stems from last October's decision by the  
Pennsylvania Supreme Court to refuse him a new trial. The appeal 
was filed last month. Abu-Jamal's supporters announced the filing 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The former radio reporter was convicted of the 1981 slaying of  
Philadelphia Police Officer Daniel Faulkner. The officer was shot 
after stopping Abu-Jamal's brother for driving the wrong way down a 
Philadelphia street. Abu-Jamal was arrested at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal's jailhouse writings about the justice system have  
made him a celebrity around the world. On April 24, thousands of 
his supporters gathered in Philadelphia to demand a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Supreme Court rejects this latest appeal, Abu-Jamal may  
appeal to the federal courts in Pennsylvania. If the federal courts 
do not find in Abu-Jamal's favor, he can go back to the U.S. 
Supreme Court one more time.

<HEADLINE>  Netanyahu Appeals for Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Admitting he has made mistakes, Prime Minister  
Benjamin Netanyahu is appealing to his traditional supporters not 
to abandon him in Israel's national election next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing in the polls, the prime minister has broadcast  
television ads this week acknowledging shortcomings during his 
three years in power. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of you don't agree with all that I have done,'' said  
Netanyahu, seated in an arm chair. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never claimed that I am innocent of any errors,'' he said.  
``But I can say, with my hand on my heart, that I believe I have 
led the state of Israel along the only road that will lead to 
security and a genuine peace,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Time may be running out from the prime minister. Polls in recent  
weeks have shown the gap between Labor leader Ehud Barak and 
Netanyahu growing, with some surveys showing Barak up to 12 points 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu's character has been at the center of the campaign.  
His opponents have repeatedly attacked him for unfulfilled 
promises, a recession and a reputation for being untrustworthy. 
</P>
<P>
	The tactics appear to be working. Polls also forecast  
disgruntled supporters of Netanyahu's Likud Party turning 
elsewhere. With 33 parties contesting parliamentary elections and 
five candidates for prime minister, Netanyahu has had a difficult 
time finding new voters. 
</P>
<P>
	In radio and TV ads Monday and Tuesday, Netanyahu called on  
Likud supporters who share his hard-line principles ``to set aside 
any other consideration,'' when voting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I call on you to return home, to the Likud, so that together  
we can defend our home, the state of Israel,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest ads represent the third time in as many weeks that  
Netanyahu has changed campaign strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	A first crop of ads and posters featured Netanyahu only and made  
little reference to Likud or its candidates for parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Next, negative ads suggested that Barak would give in to  
Palestinian demands in peace talks and damage Israel's security. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak, a former military chief and Israel's most decorated  
soldier, has presented himself as tough on security with positions 
similar to those held by Netanyahu. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Netanyahu ran TV ads airing footage from suicide bombings  
carried out by Islamic militants during the reign of the Labor 
government that Netanyahu unseated in 1996. After sharp criticism 
from the Israeli press and families of victims, the ads have 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Ben Simon, a political writer with Haaretz, said even if  
Netanyahu is re-elected, the Likud ``was finished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They've lost their core support from Sephardic Jews and  
without that, they don't have a chance,'' he said. Most Sephardic 
Jewish voters supported Netanyahu in the 1996 election. 
</P>
<P>
	Likud first came to power in 1977 with the support of Sephardic  
Jews -- those with roots in North Africa and the Middle East -- who 
harbored resentment against the then-ruling Labor party for the 
ill-treatment they received while immigrating in the 1950s.

<HEADLINE> Defeat Expected on Flag Burning Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Backers of a proposed constitutional amendment  
to ban flag burning said Tuesday the decision of two wavering 
Democratic senators to oppose it has dampened its prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	North Dakota Democrats Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad raised  
proponents' hopes this year by retreating from their opposition to 
the amendment and declaring themselves undecided. The amendments' 
supporters began to consider them two of three additional Senate 
votes needed to cross the required two-thirds threshold. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Senate leaders aim for a floor vote before Memorial  
Day. Dorgan and Conrad announced they would vote against amending 
the Constitution and offer a long-shot alternative that would ban 
flag desecration in a statute instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``A number of constitutional scholars have convinced me a  
statute can still be upheld by the Supreme Court,'' said Dorgan. 
The court has twice declared flag-burning laws unconstitutional 
abridgments of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators' decision ``hurts the situation,'' Judiciary  
Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said. ``It makes passage 
less likely.'' But Hatch said the amendment still would be brought 
to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel S. Wheeler, president of the Citizens Flag Alliance, said  
the Dorgan-Conrad pullout did not help the proposal's chances but 
held out the possibility of picking up votes from Democrats still 
undeclared. 
</P>
<P>
	Activists on both sides of the perennial debate said Dorgan and  
Conrad's announcement skirted what they had believed would be the 
amendment's best chance of congressional approval in years. Once an 
amendment obtains two-thirds majorities in both houses of Congress, 
three-fourths of the states -- 38 -- must ratify it before the 
measure becomes a part of the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said they won't give up on a measure they contend  
would provide needed protection of a symbol of American values. 
Opponents, who cheered the announcement by the North Dakota 
senators, insist the amendment would infringe on rights the flag 
symbolizes such as free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just can't imagine that there is a compelling interest now  
in scaling back even a little on this very grand idea,'' the 
Constitution's Bill of Rights, said Paul Tash, executive editor of 
the St. Petersburg Times and chairman of the freedom of information 
committee of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. ``Based 
upon their announcement, we believe that the amendment will likely 
fail in the Senate, though by a very narrow margin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is a 17-word amendment that would allow Congress to ban  
flag desecration. It has repeatedly attained a two-thirds majority 
in the House but failed in the Senate the last time by three votes 
in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents gained a vote in last year's elections when former  
Ohio Gov. George Voinovich, a Republican amendment supporter, was 
elected to the seat held by retiring Sen. John Glenn, a Democratic 
opponent. They had hoped that Dorgan and Conrad would make up the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the two North Dakota senators are sponsoring the ``Flag  
Protection Act of 1999,'' which they tout as a court 
challenge-proof alternative to amending the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said Dorgan and Conrad's proposal is exactly what the  
constitutional amendment would enable Congress to pass. Without the 
amendment, Hatch said, the courts are likely to strike down any 
statutory version.

<HEADLINE> Seahawk Defensive End Has Diabetes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Michael Sinclair, an All-Pro defensive end for  
the Seattle Seahawks, has diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, my body feels great,'' said Sinclair, who is  
participating in a Seahawks' minicamp. ``But this is uncharted 
territory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sinclair said he felt run-down in December when the Seahawks'  
season ended. Team physicians detected Sinclair's illness -- where 
the body doesn't produce enough insulin to regulate blood surgar 
levels -- last week during a routine physical exam. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinclair was told the diabetes was not expected to affect his  
NFL career. He was given medication and has been put on a diet to 
maintain proper blood-sugar levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just listening to the doctor, that helped a lot,'' Sinclair  
said. ``Even last year, toward the end of the season, I started to 
feel that I wasn't energetic and I was sluggish. My body just 
adjusted to feeling that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sinclair led the league with 16 1/2 sacks last season, when he was  
voted to his third Pro Bowl in a row.

delay space shuttle Discovery's upcoming launch to the new 
international space station. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery's 15-story external fuel tank was gouged during a  
thunderstorm over the weekend, mostly near the top. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 150 holes in the rust-colored foam insulation can be  
patched in time for a May 20 liftoff, NASA spokesman Bruce 
Buckingham said Wednesday. Thirteen gouges are near the top of the 
tank in the back, however, an area that typically cannot be reached 
when the shuttle is on the launch pad. 
</P>
<P>
	The concern is that ice could form in the holes, break off  
during liftoff and damage the shuttle. Ice could form because the 
tank is filled before liftoff with more than a half-million gallons 
of supercold liquid hydrogen and oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA is putting up scaffolding in an attempt to reach that area.  
If it's still inaccessible and engineers cannot determine the size 
of the 13 holes, shuttle managers may order Discovery back to the 
hangar for repairs, Buckingham said. 
</P>
<P>
	That would delay the station-outfitting mission by at least one  
week, Buckingham said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at it closely,'' he said. ``Hopefully, we'll be  
able to get the engineering community to agree that it's OK to fly 
as is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A decision is expected Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	The largest hole that can be measured on the tank is 2 inches  
wide and one-third of an inch deep, Buckingham said. Most are only 
a half-inch wide and one-tenth of an inch deep. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time NASA had to return a shuttle to the hangar for  
fuel-tank repairs was in 1995 when woodpeckers chipped away at the 
protective outer foam. The shuttle was Discovery that time, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The fuel tank is in the large, bullet-shaped container between  
the two solid-fuel rocket boosters. It provides fuel for the 
shuttle's three main engines during ascent and then is discarded 
and breaks up in the atmosphere as the shuttle reaches orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery itself, protected by the launch tower, was not  
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's storm already has delayed an Air Force launch.  
</P>
<P>
	Rain somehow leaked onto a military Global Positioning System  
satellite at the launch pad. The launch, which had been scheduled 
for as early as this weekend, is on indefinite hold while the Air 
Force removes the satellite from the rocket and checks for damage.

<HEADLINE> FDA Warns About Dialysis Blood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration has issued  
a safety alert over dialysis equipment that may have exposed 
patients to each others' blood and their blood-borne diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	Small amounts of blood that leaked inside dialysis machines have  
been found at treatment centers in Arizona, Florida, New Jersey and 
Pennsylvania, the FDA said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The risk that patients were exposed to others' blood and thus to  
blood-borne diseases such as hepatitis or HIV, the virus that 
causes AIDS, is ``extremely remote,'' said Steven Niedelman, an 
enforcement director for the FDA's Center for Medical Devices and 
Radiological Health. 
</P>
<P>
	The machines are used to cleanse the blood of deadly toxins when  
the kidneys fail. But Niedelman said there is concern because 
traces of blood were found in tubing inside the machines. Filters 
are supposed to prevent that from happening. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't really know the extent of the problem or what's  
causing the problem, so it's really a concern to us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The manufacturer of the tubing, Miami-based Nissho Nipro Corp.  
Ltd., told the FDA on Friday it is voluntarily recalling 154,000 
sets as a precaution. The company has distributed 2.1 million 
tubing sets in the United States during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, officials at St. Mary's Hospital in Tucson said that  
121 kidney dialysis patients faced months of blood tests to 
determine whether they were exposed to blood of other patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Since December, there also have been incidents of blood  
contamination of dialysis equipment at Total Renal Care, a dialysis 
center in Miami Lakes, Fla.; Lee Regional Hospital in Johnstown, 
Pa., and Bayonne Hospital in Bayonne, N.J., the FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
	The alert advises facilities to inspect their machines, and if  
contamination is found, to disinfect them.

<HEADLINE> Liposuction Linked to Five Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Researchers say at least five patients have died  
after liposuction in New York and one other U.S. city, raising 
questions about the safety of the nation's most popular type of 
cosmetic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, there have been occasional news stories of patients  
dying after liposuction, in which unwanted body fat is vacuumed 
out. But a report in Thursday's issue of the New England Journal of 
Medicine is the first detailed account in a medical journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors reviewing six years of autopsy records in New York City  
found four patients who had died after liposuction. A fifth death 
came from another state, which the doctors would not identify. 
</P>
<P>
	``We suspect it's a rare occurrence,'' Dr. Rama B. Rao said.  
``However, it's not rare enough. The bottom line is that a cosmetic 
procedure that is not necessary to maintain life or health of 
patients should have as close to zero risk as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plastic surgeons maintain liposuction is extremely safe,  
although they acknowledge rare deaths do occur. Some criticized 
Rao's report as unscientific and questioned the journal's decision 
to publish it. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 172,079 Americans underwent liposuction, according to  
the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons. The 
total has more than tripled since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	During the procedure, doctors typically inject large amounts of  
salt water beneath the skin, along with the anesthetic lidocaine 
and adrenaline, which shrinks blood vessels and reduces bleeding. 
Then surgeons insert a tube into the fat layer and vacuum it out. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure is typically done to flatten out thighs, tummies  
and love handles, but it is not recommended for general weight 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Rao and colleagues from the New York City Poison Control Center  
reviewed 48,527 city autopsies done between 1993 and 1998. They 
found four deaths linked to liposuction. The procedure was probably 
done tens of thousands of times in the city during this period. The 
fifth case came to light when it was referred to the New York City 
medical examiner's office for consultation. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the patients died of cardiac arrest during the procedure.  
One was stricken by fluid buildup in the lungs two hours afterward. 
One suffered blood clots in the lungs the next day. The fifth died 
of complications of low blood pressure and slow heartbeat, but the 
family refused to allow the release of details. 
</P>
<P>
	While the autopsy reviews could not clearly pinpoint liposuction  
as the cause of the deaths, Rao said, ``it's our suspicion that if 
they hadn't undergone these procedures, they probably would not 
have died.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She speculated that a bad reaction to lidocaine could have  
caused the deaths of the three patients with heart problems. She 
noted that liposuction involves injecting considerably higher 
amounts of the anesthetic than is used for other procedures, such 
as dentistry. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Paul Schnur of the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Ariz., said  
the plastic surgeons society anonymously surveyed its members two 
years ago and found five reports of deaths during plastic surgery. 
He was unsure whether any matched the ones in the journal report. 
</P>
<P>
	Schnur, the society's president, said it issued guidelines two  
years ago to help make the procedure safer, and new ones will be 
coming out soon on the use of anesthetics and preventing clots. 
</P>
<P>
	``The risks are surprising low, but it's not risk-free,'' said  
Dr. Gregory G. Gallico of Massachusetts General Hospital. ``With 
all cosmetic surgery, there is a risk of death.'' However, he said 
the journal article ``may overstate the issue and not examine it as 
scientifically as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He and other plastic surgeons said the New York doctors offered  
no clear evidence to support their argument that too much lidocaine 
was to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Rod Rohrich, chief of plastic surgery at the University of  
Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, argued that the report 
``should not have been accepted in any journal. They plucked five 
cases out of thousands done in New York City with no data on 
exactly how they died.''

<HEADLINE> L.A. County Pushes After-School Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Los Angeles County has taken a key step  
toward creating the nation's largest after-school child care 
program to help thousands of ``latchkey'' children. 
</P>
<P>
	The Board of Supervisors got a standing ovation from a group of  
single mothers Tuesday after approving $74 million for free child 
care at 225 elementary schools with large numbers of children from 
families on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the best gifts that mothers throughout the city  
and the county can get for Mother's Day,'' said Margaret Prescod of 
the Every Mother is a Working Mother Network. ``It's more 
substantial than the flowers we get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 16,000 children could be enrolled in the program,  
which is funded by federal and state welfare grants. It will begin 
this summer and expand through next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should really make life easier for so many people,'' said  
Lynn Bayer, director of the county's welfare department. ``The 
reality is that many of these children don't receive child care and 
go home to empty houses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, supervisors said, they hope to increase the funding  
to $120 million and expand it to include older children. 
</P>
<P>
	The program will concentrate on education rather than the  
after-school recreation some districts now offer. While districts 
will work out the details, some concepts include helping children 
with their homework and test preparation, and giving them access to 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Affordable child care has been a concern since welfare reforms  
began forcing many recipients to work. The Los Angeles area lags 
behind other urban areas in available child care for poor working 
mothers.

<HEADLINE> Feds Nix Research Funds for Duke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- The federal government has suspended nearly  
all government-funded research involving humans at Duke University 
Medical Center because of lax safety oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	The ordered was issued by the federal Office for Protection from  
Research Risks, a division of the National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke, one of the nation's largest and most prestigious research  
facilities, was told not to enroll new subjects in federally funded 
experiments because administrators hadn't fixed problems cited in a 
review the government completed in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``Research activities involving previously enrolled subjects may  
continue only where it is in the best interests of individual 
subjects,'' Dr. Michael Carome, the federal research protection 
agency's chief of compliance, said in a letter Monday to the Duke 
medical center's top administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	Problems center on Duke's Institutional Review Board, which  
evaluates research proposals to see whether they are sound and 
ethical. Federal rules require hospitals to establish such ``IRBs'' 
to ensure that people are properly informed of the risks of the 
trials they are taking part in and to catch early side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Government inspectors claimed that Duke's committee hadn't kept  
track of the research projects to make sure people weren't being 
harmed. Inspectors also said documents used to obtain consent from 
patients didn't meet regulatory requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	The Office for Protection from Research Risks also said the  
board violated rules that prevent members from reviewing projects 
in which they have a potential interest. After regulators ordered 
that members of one Duke office not vote on projects, they twice 
found that they had. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Duke was told to fix a number of these problems,  
which also included insufficient training of review board members, 
meetings with too few members and poor record-keeping. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said the school's response was inadequate. But  
Duke emphasized that there was no evidence the oversight lapses had 
harmed anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``We regret the need for OPRR's decision, but we agree with the  
importance of the administrative changes the agency has 
identified,'' Dr. Ralph Snyderman, Duke's chancellor for health 
affairs, said in a statement Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke said it submitted a plan for making the required changes in  
February, and progress reports in March and April. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke has about 2,000 clinical trials under way involving  
thousands of patients. Duke received $228 million in 1998 for 
federal and non-governmental research, with tens of millions of 
dollars for human clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinical trials are the tests performed on humans to evaluate  
how well new medicines or techniques work and whether there are 
negative effects. The process is required by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration before any new drug or device can be made widely 
available.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Mixed Early / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar rose against the yen Thursday,  
boosted by buying from Japanese institutional investors. Tokyo 
stocks were mixed amid concern over Russia's political situation. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.20 yen in early trading, up 0.34 yen from  
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also higher than its late New York 
level of 120.95 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 9.59 points,  
or 0.06 percent, to 16,956.95 in the first 30 minutes of trading. 
On Wednesday, the average rose 204.18 points, or 1.22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar gained ground on dollar-buying  
prompted by a belief that the successor to outgoing U.S. Treasury 
Secretary Robert Rubin may maintain a strong dollar policy. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Wednesday, the dollar fell 1.50 yen within  
minutes on news that U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin will 
resign in July. But the currency regained much of its losses later. 
</P>
<P>
	President Bill Clinton announced Wednesday that he will nominate  
Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, a former Harvard 
University professor who has worked closely with Rubin, as his 
third Treasury secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it weren't for Rubin, we probably would have seen the  
dollar go higher in New York, maybe testing 122 yen, so we could 
see some gains today,'' said Akihiko Ena, foreign exchange manager 
at Nippon Trust Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro suffered an overnight drop after Russian  
President Boris Yeltsin dismissed his prime minister Yevgeny 
Primakov. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was traded at 128.98 yen in early trading, down from  
129.15 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, sentiment remained low after the news about  
Rubin and the Russian prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Tsuyoshi Nomaguchi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities, said the  
succession by Rubin's deputy Summers may not have much impact on 
share prices on a long-term basis since there won't be any change 
in U.S. financial policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomaguchi said the Russia situation is more worrisome, as a  
political factor. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 0.96 points, or 0.07 percent, to 1,360.19 
points. The TOPIX closed up 5.33 points, or 0.39 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 212 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.325 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.340 
percent, driving its price up to 101.55 yen from 101.42 yen.

<HEADLINE> Literacy Program Making Strides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When most people think of early childhood  
learning programs, Head Start comes to mind. The $4 billion 
education and health program has served low-income preschoolers for 
30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But for the past decade, the smaller Even Start Family Literacy  
program has combined early-childhood reading lessons, adult basic 
education and parenting training for eligible families. The $135 
million Even Start serves about 31,000 families compared with 
800,000 children in Head Start, which provides education, health 
screenings and family social services. 
</P>

	``If you can't deal with the whole family, you're not going to  
break the cycle,'' said Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., who created Even 
Start in 1989. ``The academic success of the child is strongly 
related to the ability of their parents to support their 
education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodling, chairman of the House Education and Workforce  
Committee, said Even Start is more flexible and emphasizes parental 
involvement and represents his vision of what federal education 
policy should be. A hearing on the program's progress was being 
held today. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who work in the program knew from the start that it would  
have to be self-sustaining, said Deila Steiner, director of the 
Even Start program in Lincoln, Neb. ``We had to show that we could 
sustain the program beyond the life of the federal funding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Even Start grants last about 8 years, after which a program  
must come up with its own funds. Head Start programs are steadily 
funded, but must come up with matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
	--Even Start grants are administered by schools and community  
groups. Head Start centers, by comparison, are generally run 
independently of schools. 
</P>
<P>
	--Even Start programs -- nearly 700 nationwide -- are required to  
form local partnerships. Many of those are with local Head Start 
programs, which can operate alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Goodling is hoping to apply those principles -- partnership,  
self-reliance, local involvement -- as he leads the Republican 
congressional majority in its first chance to put its stamp on the 
34-year-old Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the 
comprehensive law that governs Even Start and most other federal 
kindergarten through 12th grade programs. Democrats controlled the 
House from the time the law was enacted in 1965 through 1994, when 
it was last reauthorized. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans are proposing changes in the law that would  
reduce the share of money spent on federal and state administration 
costs, cut federal education regulations and provide more 
flexibility to states and local school districts, bolster teacher 
training, and consolidate current programs. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton is focused on programs to end ``social  
promotion'' of students not academically ready to advance to the 
next grade and reduce class sizes by hiring new teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said his ultimate goal is to serve 1 million Head  
Start children by 2002. Under his administration, Head Start 
spending has increased by 68 percent. Enrollment has increased by 
more than 200,000 children, reaching 835,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Start's budget and scope have also grown this decade. In  
1989, it served approximately 2,500 families, compared with the 
31,000-plus today. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Head Start, eligible parents in Even Start must study for  
the General Educational Development certificate or take classes in 
basic adult education, parenting and job training. Their children, 
age 8 and under, read and play games to improve their literacy. At 
home, the families read together, draw and tell stories. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent Education Department report on Even Start showed that  
adults and children reached goals such as earning the GED 
credential and increasing reading test scores. However, even the 
most successful families still needed more intensive programs, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodling, a former Pennsylvania school superintendent, said he  
found that despite years of aiming federal dollars at the poor, 
children from such families were not improving their reading or 
learning. So he made sure his early-childhood specialist visited 
preschool-children and their parents at home to help them all read 
better.

<HEADLINE> Alborn Named To US Jumping Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- Alan Alborn of Anchorage, Alaska, who  
looks more like a choirboy than an emerging World Cup contender, 
heads a three-athlete U.S. Ski Jumping Team named today for next 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Alborn, 18, scored World Cup points in three competitions last  
season, his first full season on the World Cup tour. Coach Kari 
Ylianttila, who announced the 1999-2000 team, said he planned to 
work during the preseason on strengthening Alborn's takeoff for 
each jump. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Rhys Hecox of Ishpeming, Mich., who returned to the  
sport after two seasons away from ski competition, and 1998 
Olympian Brendan Doran of Steamboat Springs, Colo., were named to 
the national B Team. Hecox won a Continental Cup meet in Finland in 
March, the first merican victory since Doran won in Westby, Wis., 
in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Named to the national development team were Ben Erlandson, 16,  
of Westby, Wis.; Andrew Newcomb, 18, of Park City; and Clint Jones, 
14, Tommy Schwall, 14, and Logan Gerber, 15, all of Steamboat 
Springs.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Im Bank Backs Africa Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) - American businesses need to take greater risks  
to step up their investments in Africa, James Harmon , the head of 
the U.S. Export-Import Bank, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said these firms should go after new markets in Africa as  
aggressively as companies have from the former colonial powers, 
Britain, France and Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
	``U.S. businesses have not done as well as they should have and  
need to become more competitive,'' Harmon said during a workshop on 
Africa at the Ex-Im Bank's annual conference. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,400 exporters, financiers and government officials  
took part in the two-day meeting aimed at helping U.S. businesses 
to make more sales in emerging market nations and meet growing 
demand for U.S. products abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ex-Im Bank provides credits and loan guarantees for U.S  
businesses investing overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Harmon said his organization would boost financing for export of  
U.S. goods and services to 45 sub-Saharan African countries to $400 
million and possibly more in 1999, compared to $49 million last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	While some of the money provided goes to finance big ticket  
items such as pipelines or aircraft purchases, Harmon said small 
and medium size U.S. business should realize they can sell to 
Africa as well. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Princeton Medical Enterprises of Atlanta recently  
sold $1 million in diagnostic medical equipment to the largest 
hospital in West Africa, located in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. Other 
agreements have provided construction equipment to Uganda and cold 
storage containers to Ghana. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. goods currently account for seven percent of all imports to  
sub-Sahara Africa and Harmon said there was ample scope to expand 
that figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Ex-Im Bank has a new Africa pilot program that allows it to do  
traditional export financing in 32 sub-Sahara countries, up from 18 
a year ago. Bank officials said it was even possible to do business 
in countries like Angola, where a civil war has resumed, and 
Liberia, which is recovering from an internal conflict.

<HEADLINE>  Treasury Secretary Rubin Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, idolized on  
Wall Street for the policies many credit with spurring the record 
U.S. economic boom, is stepping down. President Clinton today will 
nominate his deputy, Lawrence Summers, to succeed him. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was to announce the long-rumored change at a Rose  
Garden ceremony later today, the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Secretary Rubin will be leaving after playing an  
extraordinarily central role in this administration as far as our 
outstanding record of fiscal discipline and turning the economy 
around,'' said presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 200 points  
when news of Rubin's resignation first was reported but quickly 
recovered most of that ground and by midafternoon was down about 60 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, a former investment banker, and Federal Reserve Chairman  
Alan Greenspan were widely credited by Wall Street and business 
leaders with the policies that set the U.S. economy on its longest 
peacetime expansion in history. 
</P>
<P>
	When Clinton took office, unemployment was at 6.9 percent, the  
nation's budget deficit was at $255 billion and the Dow Jones 
industrial average was below 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Unemployment now is at 4.3 percent, the nation will have a  
budget surplus this year and the market recently topped 11,000 for 
the first time, creating new wealth for millions of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, 73, a Republican whose term as Fed chairman ends in  
June 2000, is thought to want a fourth four-year term. Rubin has 
long been considered a candidate to replace him if, instead, 
Greenspan chooses to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has been one of the most effective secretaries of the  
Treasury in this nation's history,'' Greenspan said in a statement 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Rubin fought with Republican leaders in Congress during  
a 1997 budget fight that shut down the federal government, many 
Republicans also praised him as the administration's voice for 
spending restraint. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of all the officials in the Clinton administration, he has had  
more credibility with me, and I think with Congress, than any other 
official,'' the Senate Banking Committee chairman, Sen. Phil Gramm, 
R-Texas, said today. ``He will certainly be missed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the top Democrat on the House  
Ways and Means Committee, said Rubin often repaired frayed ties 
when Clinton appeared to bypass Democrats and negotiate directly 
with the GOP on taxes or welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the man,'' Rangel said. ``Thank God during all these  
times we knew we had someone we could depend on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he foresaw no  
problems with the Senate confirming Summers as Rubin's successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin's departure was not unexpected. It has long been rumored  
that the former investment banker, who made $26 million in private 
life with the investment firm of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. the year 
before joining the administration in 1993, wanted to return to 
private life. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Judith, has never moved to Washington, living in New  
York City throughout his term in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said Rubin, 60, discussed his decision  
with Clinton ``within the past week'' and said Rubin's decision was 
fueled solely by his desire to return to private life. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin had considered leaving sooner, but not during the Monica  
Lewinsky scandal, said one official familiar with his thinking. The 
official said Rubin is expected to stay at Treasury through July. 
</P>
<P>
	Before taking over at Treasury in 1995, succeeding former Sen.  
Lloyd Bentsen, Rubin headed Clinton's National Economic Council, 
with the task of creating harmony among more than a dozen agencies 
that advise the president on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton plans to nominate Summers, a former Harvard University  
professor who oversaw the administration's efforts to stem the 
Asian financial crisis, as his third treasury secretary, the senior 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuart Eizenstat, an undersecretary at the State Department, is  
Clinton's choice to replace Summers as second in command at 
Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining the Clinton administration, Rubin had spent  
nearly his entire career inside Goldman, Sachs, one of Wall 
Street's most powerful money machines. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the company in 1966, and became a young star in risk  
arbitrage -- speculating on the stocks of companies subject to 
takeover attempts. He later ran the firm's stock and bond trading 
departments, and revived its commodities subsidiary. He became 
co-chairman of the company in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with his strong business ties, Rubin proudly proclaims his  
Democratic heritage. He said it comes from his grandfather, a 
leader in a machine-style Brooklyn political club. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin has described himself as a centrist, particularly on  
economic issues, while staking out more liberal positions on social 
and urban issues. He has pushed hard for private investment in 
economically depressed inner city neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin was born in New York City in 1938 and grew up in Miami  
Beach, the son of a lawyer. He graduated from Harvard College with 
highest honors in economics, later studied at the London School of 
Economics and received a law degree from Yale.

<HEADLINE> Siena Plans Cuba Baseball Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUDONVILLE, N.Y. (AP) -- Siena College wants to become the first  
American college baseball team to play in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	The Franciscan school in suburban Albany has filed papers with  
the U.S. Treasury Department for a trade embargo waiver and the 
Cuban Intersection seeking permission for the January trip, 
athletic director John D'Argenio said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been college student trips to Cuba in recent years.  
But the NCAA said there has never been a U.S. university baseball 
game there. 
</P>
<P>
	If the trip is approved, Siena will play a Cuban team at its  
competitive level, D'Argenio said. A decision is expected within 
four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to raise the profile of our baseball team,''  
D'Argenio said. 
</P>
<P>
	Travel from the United States to Cuba has been restricted since  
Fidel Castro took control 40 years ago, though tensions have eased 
in recent years for academic and artistic events. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baltimore Orioles played there last month against the Cuban  
national team. The two teams played in Baltimore last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Siena, a Division I team, won a school-record 31 games this  
season and was the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference North 
Division champion. Siena will compete this week in the MAAC 
tournament.

<HEADLINE> Grateful Dead: OK To Download Us </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- It was the feeling of community and word of  
mouth that spawned the vast fan following of the Grateful Dead. Now 
four years after the band called it quits the Dead has found a way 
to keep its music alive -- online. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the Grateful Dead announced Tuesday the band will  
allow Internet trading of MP3 digital file versions of live concert 
recordings captured by fans, as long as they don't try to make a 
buck in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted to control this now rather than when the cow got  
out of the barn,'' said Grateful Dead attorney Eric Doney. He 
thinks online Deadheads would eventually police themselves enough 
to ensure that only the noncopyrighted MP3 files were made 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came after the band recently discovered an  
Internet Web site that posted live concert MP3 songs, but the 
site's owners also received revenues from banner advertisements on 
the Web page. 
</P>
<P>
	After a brief legal standoff, the site's operator has since  
removed links to the songs.

	Treasury Secretary Rubin Resigns  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, credited for  
the country's economic boom in recent years, is stepping down, and 
President Clinton will nominate his deputy, Lawrence Summers, to 
succeed him. At a White House Rose Garden ceremony, Clinton heaped 
praise on both men. And Rubin said Clinton and Vice President Al 
Gore ``have repositioned our country with respect to fiscal 
discipline, with respect to leadership on international economic 
issues that are so critical to economic well-being.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices ended mixed today as blue chips  
recovered most of a sharp drop following Treasury Secretary Robert 
Rubin's resignation, and the broader market rose on strength in 
technology issues. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 
25.78, at 11,000.37 at just about the time President Clinton 
formally announced Rubin's resignation at a White House news 
conference. The resignation had been made known earlier in the day. 
The Dow opened slightly lower and then plunged as much as 213 
points after word of Rubin's resignation crossed news wires about 
20 minutes later. The Dow is just shy of its record high close of 
11,031.59, reached last Friday. The Nasdaq composite index rose

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prices of existing homes rose in most

Nationally, the median resale price was $131,600 during the 
January-March quarter, up 4.6 percent from the same quarter a year 
earlier, the National Association of Realtors said today. Low 
unemployment, rising incomes, continuing stock market gains, and

Securities and Exchange Commission announced the action, alleging 
that 14 separate schemes deceived investors around the world by 
selling bogus securities over the Internet. The allegedly 
fraudulent investments included interests in gold mines, computer 
software, prefabricated hospitals in Turkey and a product described 
as a new way of processing gold. The agency said its surveillance 
team discovered some questionable offerings before any securities

<HEADLINE> White House Web Hacked, Back online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internet site for the White House reopened  
Wednesday, a day after officials took it down because of an attack 
by computer hackers. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said only that the Web site  
was made unavailable because of ``problems with people trying to 
get into the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Security procedures provided a response to the incident, which  
included limiting public access to the system until an assessment 
could be made,'' Lockhart said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening page of the White House site was altered briefly  
overnight Sunday to show a black Web page with the names of the 
hacker organizations claiming responsibility, along with messages, 
``Your box was own3d'' and ``Stop all the war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Why did we hack this domain? Simple, because we (expletive)  
could,'' the hackers wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	In hidden computer code contained within the page, they included  
the comments: ``OK, no real msg (message) here. Stop all the war no 
point for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House computers automatically detected the altered page  
and removed it within minutes. The Secret Service said it was 
investigating but declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet publication AntiOnline said it had interviewed one  
of the hackers involved, who said the White House site was targeted 
``because it was easily exploitable ... and was pretty high 
profile.'' But he also denied there was any political motivation 
behind the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	AntiOnline said it was furnished with computer logs and other  
materials that verified that the hacker, who wasn't named, was 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one of the two groups claiming responsibility is fairly  
well known within the loose-knit community of computer hackers but 
traditionally has targeted low-profile Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just so happened they stumbled onto a vulnerability in  
Whitehouse.Gov,'' said B.K. DeLong, a Boston computer consultant 
who said he also talked with one of the hackers involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the equivalent of stealing secretive government  
information,'' DeLong said. ``It's like spray-painting a federal 
building in downtown D.C.''

<HEADLINE> Deal Spares NYC Gardens From Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Singer Bette Midler teamed with conservancy  
groups Wednesday to keep the city from auctioning off 115 
city-owned lots that residents had transformed from trash-strewn 
eyesores into lush gardens. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Midler contributed $250,000 of her own money and got others  
to put up $4 million more to buy all the gardens, said Roberta 
Greene, a spokeswoman for the New York Restoration Project. 
</P>
<P>
	The lots had been slated for sale Thursday, before Ms. Midler,  
the New York Restoration Project and the Trust for Public Land 
stepped in. Ms. Midler started the New York Restoration Project in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're thrilled. This is a joyous occasion and means that these  
gardens will stay in perpetuity,'' Midler said in a statement. 
``Today, I'm prouder than ever to be a New Yorker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The community gardens began springing up in New York about 25  
years ago, when residents tired of the trash-strewn lots and 
illegal dumping grounds scattered around the city. They cleared out 
broken bottles and rusted-out cars, replacing them with pansies, 
petunias, collard greens and corn. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mayor Rudolph Giuliani decided that he wants the property  
back on the tax rolls and that the city shouldn't own so much land. 
</P>
<P>
	The gardeners first tried to prevent the auction, testifying at  
hearings and subjecting themselves to arrest at protests. One man 
dressed like a sunflower, climbed a tree outside City Hall and 
demanded a meeting with the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	The gardens are as diverse as the gardeners, capturing  
neighborhood character. One in Queens was photographed recently for 
National Geographic; another in Harlem looks to yield vegetables 
this summer for meals at soup kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
	Olean For, a 78-year-old gardener who has worked her little  
community plot for more than 20 years, said her phone rang all 
evening with the news. She was too tired to attend the impromptu 
parties being thrown together because she has spent the last 
several months trying to save her endangered green space. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't you think they did it pretty good?'' she asked of the  
deal, adding that it will take some time to plan her own 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Mayor Randy Levine called the sale a ``win-win for  
everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is right in the area where we expected to be if this went  
to public auction,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Merrill Lynch Wins Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Singapore's High Court has ordered former  
Merrill Lynch banker Kevin Wallace to repay more than $25 million 
to the company for manipulating its accounts, news reports said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge G.P. Selvam ruled Wednesday that he was ``more than  
satisfied'' that Wallace had breached his employment contract with 
the international investment bank by using the clients' accounts 
for his market manipulations, The Straits Times newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge dismissed Wallace's countercharge of $480,000, which  
he had claimed was compensation not paid to him when he was asked 
to leave the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace joined Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. in Singapore in 1990 as a  
financial consultant. The company fired Wallace in May 1997, saying 
he had violated certain rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace left Singapore and went to Hong Kong, where he was  
arrested and later charged with money laundering. Although he was 
released on bail, he wasn't allowed to leave Hong Kong for nine 
months until the money-laundering charges against him were dropped 
in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Wallace offered a settlement of $10 million to his  
former employer, but was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace had refused to testify in Singapore, saying his family  
received threats that he would be harmed if he came here, the 
newspaper quoted Wallace's lawyer as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace reportedly offered to testify via video from the United  
States, but the judge rejected the offer.

<HEADLINE> NBC Changes Cargo in Miniseries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It's still dangerous. It's just not THAT  
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC is making a significant cargo change for its miniseries  
``Atomic Train,'' which begins this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The drama was being hastily edited to replace references to  
nuclear waste with the phrase ``hazardous waste,'' network 
spokeswoman Rebecca Marks said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The title will remain the same.  
</P>
<P>
	``Atomic Train,'' about a runaway Idaho-to-Denver train carrying  
a nuclear weapon and, originally, nuclear waste, did not accurately 
depict safeguards used in connection with such waste, Ms. Marks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although it (the miniseries) is fictitious, rather than be  
inaccurate about the transporting of material we decided to change 
the nature of the material,'' she said. Nuclear waste is moved in 
casks that are not shown in the film. 
</P>
<P>
	A tacked-on disclaimer will tell viewers the miniseries is not  
based on fact and that NBC does not ``suggest or imply in any way 
that these events could actually occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to change the film was strictly internal and no NBC  
executive had been contacted by any nuclear industry representative 
requesting changes, Ms. Marks said. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC itself has a relative in the business. General Electric, the  
network's parent company, includes the GE Nuclear Energy unit, 
which supplies parts and services for reactors. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Atomic Train,'' which stars Rob Lowe and airs Sunday and  
Monday, the wayward train crashes west of Denver. Fire detonates a 
Russian nuclear weapon placed on board by a disposal company 
contracted by the government to dispose of such weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	In reality, nuclear weapons are always transported by truck and  
are disarmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the network said it acted independently, the miniseries  
hasn't escaped criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no way something like this could happen,'' Energy  
Department spokesman Derek Scammell said. ``It is just not 
feasible. With all due respect to Hollywood, this is going to be a 
typical Hollywood movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to NBC, the president of the Idaho chapter of the  
Health Physics Society, which specializes in radiation safety, 
called the movie's premise wrong and asked NBC to add a disclaimer 
similar to that eventually adopted by the network. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuclear Energy Institute, which represents utilities with  
nuclear power plants, issued a ``containment strategy'' for 
reaction to the film. 
</P>
<P>
	The April 27 memo suggested an ``aggressive effort'' to provide  
industry employees, state regulators and elected officials with 
information to field any questions raised about transportation 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., a prominent opponent of nuclear  
waste transportation, said the film in its original version had an 
important message: Such waste represents a disaster waiting to 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are 50 million people in 43 states, living within a mile  
or less from nuclear shipment routes,'' Bryan said. ``I keep 
telling people, this is nuclear waste that would be laid at your 
doorstep.''

<HEADLINE> Parma 3, Olympique Marseille 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Parma won its third European trophy of the decade,  
beating Olympique Marseille 3-0 Wednesday night in the UEFA Cup 
final on goals by Enrico Chiesa, Hernan Crespo and Paolo Vanoli. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory continued Italian domination of the tournament.  
Parma (1995), Internazionale of Milan (1991, '94, '98), Juventus of 
Turin (1990, '93) and Napoli (1989) have combined to win the UEFA 
Cup eight times in 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Parma also won the Cup Winners Cup in 1993 and last week won the  
Italian Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Crespo intercepted a poorly struck header from defender Laurent  
Blanc to goalkeeper Stephane Porato in the 26th minute and scored 
his sixth goal of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten minutes later, Vanoli scored off a cross from Diego Fuser.  
Chiesa added his eighth goal of the tournament in the 55th minute, 
scoring on a 15-yard kick off a cross from Juan Veron. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympique Marseille was missing five regulars: Christophe  
Dugarry, Fabrizio Ravanelli, Peter Luccin and William Gallas were 
suspended; and Eric Roy was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazio of Rome plays Mallorca next Wednesday at Birmingham,  
England, in the last Cup Winners Cup final. Manchester United plays 
Bayern Munich on May 26 at Barcelona in the Champions Cup final.

<HEADLINE> Beverly Hills Voters KO Fur Labels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Though voters in this city of  
elegance rejected a measure requiring fur garments to bear labels 
explaining how the animals died, the bill's supporters said they 
won the publicity war. 
</P>
<P>
	Measure A, the sole issue on Tuesday's ballot, was defeated by  
3,363 votes to 1,908 votes, or 63.8 percent to 36.2 percent, city 
spokeswoman Robin Chancellor said. A little over a quarter of the 
city's 20,000 registered voters cast ballots. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disappointing to lose the election, but we've won the  
battle,'' said Luke Montgomery, campaign manager of Beverly Hills 
Consumers for Informed Choice, the group behind the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we wanted was a little tag telling people what animals go  
through and we got front pages all over the planet,'' he said. ``A 
lot of people around the world now know about the cruelty these 
animals are put through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some famous residents such as Jack Lemmon, Sid Caesar and Larry  
King supported the measure, which would have been the first in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would have required furriers to place credit  
card-sized tags on furs costing more than $50, warning that the 
animals may have been electrocuted, gassed, poisoned, clubbed, 
stomped, drowned or snagged by steel-jawed traps. The law would 
have carried a $100-per-item fine for violations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that the city rejected this measure shows that  
Beverly Hills is not the place to try goofy ideas,'' Rudy Cole, No 
on A Committee campaign manager, told the Los Angeles Times in a 
story published today. 
</P>
<P>
	Voter Judith Karlan was angry about $60,000 cost of the special  
election. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a terrible waste of money,'' she said. ``It could've been  
put on a ballot with six other things to vote on. What is so 
important about this?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pro-Measure A group argued that retailers have misled  
consumers by saying animals are killed humanely. The campaign 
raised $75,000 and sent 5,000 videotapes to registered voters 
showing hidden camera excerpts of Beverly Hills fur merchants 
claiming the deaths were merciful. 
</P>
<P>
	The No on A campaign spent $81,000, saying the initiative was  
another attack by animal rights extremists who want to hurt the fur 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Behrouz Mahboubi, who works in property management, said it was  
a matter for the federal government, not a municipality, to decide. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a practical thing. How could a store or shopkeeper  
know where a coat is coming from, or how they kill the animal?'' 
Mahboubi said.

<HEADLINE> Police Arrest Wanted Springer Guest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- One moment, Willie Johnson was at a relative's  
house in Louisiana, watching a Jerry Springer episode on drag 
queens that featured a televised battle between him and his sister. 
</P>
<P>
	The next, he was being led away by police on a Texas warrant  
charging him with aggravated assault in last month's stabbing of 
his sister's common-law husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston police just happened to be on the phone with Louisiana  
authorities in search of Johnson when the show aired on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``My partner gave the officer a description of Johnson and the  
officer laughed and said, `I think he's on TV right now,' '' 
Houston homicide detective Brian Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was quickly arrested at his family's home in Rapides  
Parish in front of the relatives who had gathered with him to watch 
the show. Detectives were trying to determine whether he taped the 
show before or after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is accused of stabbing Reginald Hickman in the neck with  
a paring knife during an April 11 argument between Hickman and 
Johnson's sister, Veronica. Police said Johnson stabbed Hickman 
when he tried to prevent Veronica from leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston police had been looking for Johnson since April 16. At  
one point, they said, he promised to surrender but never showed. 
</P>
<P>
	``When (the Louisiana officers) told us they were watching him  
on TV we thought, `You gotta be kidding,' '' Harris said. ``This 
definitely goes into our memorable file.''

<HEADLINE> Tornado Victims Search for Photos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIDWEST CITY, Okla. (AP) -- Chris Abbott couldn't stop crying  
Wednesday as she talked about the photograph she lost in a tornado. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a sonogram image taken by doctors who thought it would  
confirm an enormous ovarian cyst. Instead it revealed tiny hands 
and feet. It was the first picture to go in her son's baby book. 
</P>
<P>
	Although her son is safe, the scrapbook is gone. So Ms. Abbott  
and her husband, Terry Hardy, went to the First Christian Church, 
which is serving as a lost-and-found site for tornado victims 
searching for photographs and other lost keepsakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The family escaped death last week as tornadoes killed 43 people  
in Oklahoma and injured hundreds. But the statistics do not account 
for the thousands of sentimental treasures and precious keepsakes 
suddenly swept away. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Abbott's tears hit the floor as she remembered the sonogram.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's the start of us being a family,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's when we decided to be something,'' Hardy added softly  
at her side. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of photographs and other mementos scattered by the  
twisters had been delivered to the church, and more arrived 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Untold stories loom in the mud-caked images: A grinning girl  
cradles a newborn in her lap. Four bridesmaids in pink dresses 
stare soberly toward an unseen bride. A woman stands in fresh snow, 
dressed in a long black coat of another era. 
</P>
<P>
	Church member Shauna Becker didn't know what to expect when she  
posted fliers offering the church as a repository. But the 
28-year-old mother said she had to do something when a 1971 
photograph of a man posing with his car blew into her yard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought, what if that is someone's dad?'' she said. ``What  
if that's the only picture they have of him?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The church will be open every Tuesday evening for tornado  
victims who want to see whether their treasured keepsakes are 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	On the first night, a man was reunited with his patch from the  
Vietnam War, and a family found a photo of a niece. A couple whose 
grandson died in the tornado recognized his baby photos on a 
television broadcast and picked them up Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Moore, another Oklahoma City suburb, 73-year-old Thelma  
Pruegert was still picking through the heap of furniture, lumber 
and cars tossed where her house once stood. She had recovered other 
people's photographs from the pile, but photos of her 16 
great-grandchildren remained missing, along with the wall where 
they hung. 
</P>
<P>
	Down the street, Barbara Sexton, 66, found her mother's wedding  
picture plastered against a wall. The rest of her photographs 
escaped damage inside an antique trunk. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was real happy,'' she said. ``That's our lives in there.''  
</P>
<P>
	At First Christian Church, Ms. Abbott and Hardy recalled how  
they and their son, George, were lifted in the air as a tornado 
mowed through their home. 
</P>
<P>
	They lost everything, but the photos were first on their minds.  
They had made a point of keeping everything from the sonogram photo 
to birthday shots for George, who turns 8 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	They searched the remains of their home and found nothing, and  
so they went to the church, hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
	Has anyone turned in any scrapbooks, they asked? Their eyes fell  
when Ms. Becker told them no. 
</P>
<P>
	``But come back,'' she said. ``I'm sure things will be rolling  
in all week long.''

<HEADLINE> Vitamin Helps Folic Acid Deficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Folic acid deficiency has nearly disappeared in  
the United States since the government ordered food manufacturers 
to add the vitamin to flour, rice and other grain products, a study 
concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	Folic acid is found naturally in green leafy vegetables and some  
other foods. If women eat too little of it when they become 
pregnant, they risk having babies with spina bifida and other 
neural tube defects. 
</P>
<P>
	To help protect against these birth defects, the Food and Drug  
Administration ordered manufacturers to begin fortifying foods with 
folic acid in January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest study is the first major effort to see what effect  
this has had. The researchers studied a group of mostly white, 
middle-aged residents of one Massachusetts town and looked at their 
blood levels of folic acid before and after the food fortification 
began. 
</P>
<P>
	They found that average blood levels of folic acid doubled. Just  
under 2 percent still had folic acid deficiency, compared with 22 
percent before the vitamin was added to food. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this shows is that there's really been quite a dramatic  
impact in this middle-aged population,'' said a co-author of the 
study, Dr. Irwin H. Rosenberg of the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University in 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was based on 1,106 volunteers in the Framingham Heart  
Study, which has followed the cardiovascular health of residents of 
a Boston suburb for 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The study hints that the extra folic acid could do more than  
reduce birth defects. Folic acid lowers levels of homocysteine, an 
amino acid that results naturally from the breakdown of protein. 
The study found average homocysteine levels fell about 7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Some studies have found that people with high homocysteine  
levels have an elevated risk of heart trouble. However, there is no 
evidence that bringing down homocysteine will keep the heart 
healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Rosenberg said the latest findings could be good news for  
the heart if lowering homocysteine does turn out to be beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
	The prevalence of unusually high homocysteine levels fell from  
19 percent to 10 percent of the volunteers. Rosenberg said this 
large a drop could ``have a substantial effect on the calculated 
risk of heart disease and stroke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The March of Dimes and some other health organizations had urged  
the FDA to require higher levels of folic acid in food. Dr. Donald 
Mattison, the group's medical director, said the latest study 
``suggests to us that we should see some health benefits'' from the 
additive. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenberg said he believes the data mean that folic acid levels  
have increased substantially for everyone, not just middle-aged 
whites, but Mattison said this remains to be proved.

<HEADLINE>  Star Wars Tickets Go On Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Diehard fans overcame driving rain, long  
lines, busy signals, clogged Web sites and grumpy movie critics 
Wednesday to buy advance tickets to the latest Star Wars movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been waiting 16 years for this,'' said Lee Dahlhauser in  
Ames, Iowa, after spending a rainy night in line at a theater under 
blankets and sheets of plastic. 
</P>
<P>
	Tickets for ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' the  
first Star Wars movie since 1983, sold out within minutes. The 
movie, a prequel to the earlier George Lucas films, opens May 19. 
</P>
<P>
	After opening day showings sold out, fans scrambled to get  
tickets for later dates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't even close,'' said Tom Peters, a 29-year-old video  
producer who waited in line for 90 minutes at a mall in Fox Chapel, 
Pa. ``They were selling them 12 at a time, and they were just going 
12 by 12 by 12 by 12.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Early reviews of the movie are mixed, but that didn't seem to  
quiet demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas initially barred advanced ticket sales to prevent scalping  
but relented under pressure from theater owners. In a compromise, 
theaters restricted sales to a maximum of 12 tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no early reports of scalping problems -- just  
thousands of diehard fans eager to get tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	At Mann's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, where the original  
``Star Wars'' premiered in 1977 and where the most devoted fans 
have been camping out for weeks, the line stretched down one side 
of Hollywood Boulevard and to the next block over. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important we see it on opening day at Mann's Chinese  
Theatre,'' said Susanna Modjallal, 30. ``If Lucas thought it was 
good enough to premiere here, it's good enough for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Baltimore, the crowd outside the Senator Theater was three  
blocks long, but Pete Levin staked claim to the 32nd spot in line 
by camping out with his sister and friend since 9 a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He bought five tickets for the first showing at 12:01 a.m. on  
May 19. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want anyone to spoil it for me,'' Levin said. ``I  
want to be surprised. I didn't want anyone to tell me the ending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His sister, 25-year-old Ilse Levin, said they didn't buy the  
maximum of 12 because: ``It's the Force, the Force is about being 
nice to people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Raleigh, N.C., Israel Ehrisman and four of his friends  
pitched a tent at the 16-screen Raleigh Grand theater to get a good 
place in line. They brought along a television and VCR to show the 
earlier ``Star Wars'' trilogy. They also brought a ``Star Wars'' 
Trivial Pursuit game and Nintendo 64 game featuring ``Star Wars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Seeing it opening night is fun and camping out with other  
people that are as interested in 'Star Wars' as you are is half of 
the enjoyment,'' Ehrisman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who thought it would be a little more sane buying tickets  
by phone or over the Internet were in for a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	So many people called MovieFone that circuits were jammed even  
though the ticket telephone service added lines. Its Web site was 
also swamped, moving at a snail's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	``The demand has been even greater than we expected. Thousands  
of transactions are being conducted every minute,'' said Christine 
Fakundiny, director of marketing for MovieFone. ``But people are 
getting through and we are processing them. The advice to the war 
weary is keep trying.''

<HEADLINE> Broadcom Chip Speeds Data Delivery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Communications technology maker Broadcom Corp.  
announced a chip that can deliver video, voice and data over 
conventional copper wire networks 10 times faster than current 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The Irvine, Calif.-based company said the new chip, to be used  
in local network switches, will allow companies to continue using 
their existing copper wiring inside their offices while achieving 
more network speed and capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcom announced the chip at an industry conference Tuesday,  
The Wall Street Journal reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcom says the chip will allow data to travel over copper  
wiring at up to one billion bits, or one gigabit, per second. 
Current copper networks now are limited to speeds up to 100 million 
bits per second. 
</P>
<P>
	The development has been hotly anticipated in the networking  
world because of the difficulty of achieving ever-higher speeds 
over the copper wiring used inside most offices. Many companies 
have been forced to install much more expensive fiberoptic cables 
and communications equipment to achieve gigabit-level network 
speeds. 
</P>
<P>
	The new chip can correct transmission errors, sort out  
interference from nearby wires and other data, and direct two-way 
data traffic down cables that previously carried information only 
one way, the newspaper reported.

<HEADLINE> Docs Need Quick Response to Anthrax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Scientists studying the possibility of a  
terrorist anthrax attack say larger amounts of vaccine need to be 
available and doctors need better training in recognizing the 
symptoms of infection. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report published in today's Journal of the American Medical  
Association, the Working Group on Civilian Biodefense says nearly 
half of those infected would die within 24 to 48 hours, probably 
well before doctors understood what was happening. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthrax is colorless, odorless, inexpensive to make and easy to  
transport. The group cited a 1993 government report that said it 
would take only about 20 pounds of anthrax to kill 3 million 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	``The possibility of a terrorist attack using bioweapons would  
be especially difficult to predict, detect, or prevent, and thus it 
is among the most feared terrorist scenarios,'' the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	Because anthrax infections can be controlled with antibiotics if  
administered very early, doctors and radiologists need to know what 
to look for, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortness of breath, an early sign of anthrax infection, could  
be mistaken for pneumonia. Other early symptoms include fever, 
cough, headache, vomiting, and chills, which could be mistaken for 
a bad flu. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trick here is to identify as quickly as possible and  
recommend antibiotic treatment of all those who might have been 
exposed ... and treat them for two months, which is a huge task,'' 
said Dr. D.A. Henderson, co-author of the report and director of 
the Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies at Johns Hopkins 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors found that anthrax remains deadly far longer than  
previously thought. It was believed that cases would occur within 
six days of exposure. But the group found the danger period lasts 
up to 46 days. 
</P>
<P>
	If an anthrax attack happens, doctors should use vaccines in  
combination with antibiotics, and cremation of bodies should be 
considered to prevent transmission. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson said the widespread use of the anthrax vaccine as a  
preventative is not recommended, unless a terrorist problem becomes 
real. In the meantime, efforts underway to produce large amounts of 
the vaccine should be stepped up so it will be ready if needed, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 17 nations are believed to have biological weapons  
programs, including Iraq, but it is unknown how many are working 
with anthrax, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson said he's convinced the vaccine is safe and is puzzled  
by concerns raised about it. Last week, the commander of Dover Air 
Force Base halted some anthrax vaccinations until airmen's concerns 
could be answered. They were resumed Tuesday after military health 
experts reassured airmen of the safety of the vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am really quite surprised by the negative reactions,''  
Henderson said. ``This is a vaccine that protects against a very 
serious disease,''

<HEADLINE> Senate Rejects Gun-Show Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled Senate rejected  
fresh restrictions on sales at gun shows Wednesday in Congress' 
first vote on gun control since last month's shooting spree in a 
Colorado high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, on a vote of 53-45, the Senate signaled support for a  
system of voluntary background checks on private sales at gun 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The developments marked a victory for the National Rifle  
Association and a defeat for gun control advocates, who had claimed 
that the shooting deaths at Columbine High School in Littleton, 
Colo. -- the latest in a string of violent episodes in the nation's 
schools -- would give their cause fresh momentum. Instead, their 
plan was killed on a vote of 51-47. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House called the Senate's action ``a serious mistake''  
and President Clinton told donors at a Democratic fund-raiser 
Wednesday night that was ``disappointed'' by the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many criminals who use gun shows as a place to  
procure their weaponry to commit the mayhem that they do,'' argued 
Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., who led the failed drive to close 
what he said was a ``loophole'' in the current law that allows 
private sales at gun shows without instant background checks. 
</P>
<P>
	He said there was evidence that some of the weapons used in the  
Colorado shooting spree had been purchased by a young woman at a 
gun show. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, countered that Lautenberg's  
proposal would impose fresh restrictions on ``private citizens who 
come to gun shows and engage in discussion with other private 
citizens and decide to exchange or sell their guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Is that a loophole?'' asked Craig, who is a member of the NRA  
board. 
</P>
<P>
	The developments came as the Senate debated legislation to  
stiffen prosecution of juvenile crime, largely by providing added 
funds to prosecutors, making it easier to try suspects as young as 
14 as adults and providing for tougher penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of the Littleton shootings, the measure also  
attracted Democratic gun control amendments as well as provisions 
crafted by Republicans to explore the connection between violence 
in music, video games and movies -- and real life. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., and a bipartisan group of  
senators won approval for a limited antitrust exemption to allow 
competing companies in the entertainment industry to explore 
creation of a voluntary code of conduct to restrict the amount of 
violence aimed at children. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the proposal calls for a study of the entertainment  
industry to see whether it is marketing violence to children. 
</P>
<P>
	``We live unfortunately in a culture that glorifies violence ...  
presented not as a horror, but as entertainment,'' said Brownback. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a move that underscored the Democratic insistence that  
guns be addressed as a cause of violence, Sen. Barbara Boxer, 
D-Calif., won acceptance for a parallel study of the gun industry 
to see whether it is marketing its products to children. 
</P>
<P>
	In the debate over gun control, Craig said that 98 percent of  
the vendors at gun shows are licensed dealers, and all their 
customers are subjected to background checks imposed under the 
Brady bill that was approved in 1993. But he also said that 
so-called private sales, which are exempt from background checks, 
accounted for roughly 40 percent of all sales at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	While his plan was voluntary, he said it contained incentives to  
entice private collectors to conduct checks on their customers, 
including limited protection from liability in future lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	That only raised more objections from Democrats, who said that  
the only people who currently enjoy liability protection are 
diplomats and some health insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tens of thousands of firearms are sold at these events with no  
background checks or record keeping,'' said Lautenberg. ``You can 
just walk into a gun show, put down your cash and walk away with a 
gun, semiautomatic or any other deadly weapons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The debate was forceful, as Craig accused Lautenberg of  
misstating key facts at one or two points, and gun control 
advocates made specific references to the National Rifle 
Association and its vaunted lobbying prowess. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration included the proposal in a package of gun  
control measures it unveiled in the wake of the Littleton 
shootings, which the NRA last week denounced as ``a litany of 
anti-gun schemes that would affect only the law-abiding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The outcome on the Senate floor seemed preordained, though, as  
Republicans spread the word in advance they had the votes to defeat 
Lautenberg's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote to table, and thus kill Lautenberg's proposal was  
51-47, with Democrats Max Cleland of Georgia and Max Baucus of 
Montana joining 49 Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Six Republicans crossed party lines and sided with the  
Democratic advocates of the measure. They were Sens. John Chafee of 
Rhode Island, Mike Dewine and George Voinovich of Ohio, Peter 
Fitzgerald of Illinois, Dick Lugar of Indiana and John Warner of 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	On the vote in favor of the system of voluntary checks, Chafee,  
Fitzgerald and Sen. William Roth of Delaware joined all voting 
Democrats in opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. Senate learned very little from Littleton,'' Illinois  
Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin told reporters after the votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic gun control advocates are expected to offer  
additional proposals on Thursday, but Republicans expressed 
confidence they could turn those aside, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP-crafted legislation includes one gun control provision.  
The ``juvenile Brady'' measure would prohibit possession of a 
firearm by anyone who was convicted of a violent felony as a 
juvenile.

<HEADLINE> IRL Is Struggling With Image Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Three years after its first race, the Indy  
Racing League has yet to overcome its biggest problem -- the 
drivers' image. 
</P>
<P>
	Since that inaugural race in 1996, the IRL has suffered from the  
widespread belief that the best-known and most-talented drivers in 
American open-wheel racing are in Championship Auto Racing Teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Tired of such talk is defending Indianapolis 500 champion Eddie  
Cheever, preparing for the fourth Memorial Day weekend classic 
since Indy speedway owner and IRL founder Tony George split with 
CART. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheever maintains that there's been a drop-off in CART's driver  
recognition because of retirements and defections of former 
champions to Formula One. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, are CART stars Juan Montoya, Adrian Fernandez and  
Greg Moore more talented or more familiar to the public than Scott 
Goodyear, Jeff Ward and Cheever? 
</P>
<P>
	``That definitely is not the case,'' Cheever said. ``The fur on  
the back of my neck stands up when somebody says the quality of one 
driver is better than another just because they're racing in a 
different series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saying that is like saying the drivers in NASCAR are a bunch  
of idiots, and that's not true. Every series has its better 
drivers, and those drivers are the ones that win races.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Comparing the talent of the two series is difficult because the  
drivers don't meet. Also, about half of CART's races are on road 
courses. The IRL runs exclusively on ovals. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it comes to the best open-wheel, oval-racing drivers in  
the States, they are in the Indy Racing League, because that is all 
they do,'' Cheever said. ``A lot of the drivers in our series, 
that's all they did beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
	``That goes back to what created Foyt and Rutherford and  
Parnelli Jones, all racing drivers that came from midget racing and 
dirt tracks and whatnot. So we've really just gone back to 
emulating what worked in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation on how well IRL drivers would fare on road courses  
is of no interest to Cheever. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's irrelevant, because that's not where they're racing,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	League spokesman Ron Green also sees little reason for all the  
CART-IRL talk. He thinks the IRL has an entertaining product and 
some topnotch competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``The quality of drivers that are entered for the 1999  
Indianapolis 500 is outstanding,'' Green said. ``One of the 
nation's hottest drivers, most popular drivers, Tony Stewart, is 
entered again this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, the 1997 IRL champ who's now the top rookie in NASCAR's  
Winston Cup series, will try for a share of racing lore. He'll 
attempt to become the second driver to race in the Indianapolis 500 
and the Coca-Cola 600, in Concord, N.C., in the same day. 
</P>
<P>
	Even without the attraction of Stewart, Green likes what he  
sees. But he isn't happy about what he hears about the IRL. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, when talk of the split was going on, the focus  
moved away from the drivers. There was very little attention on the 
drivers,'' Green said. ``It was all on the politics going on. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now you're seeing a re-emphasis on the drivers.''  
</P>
<P>
	CART president Andrew Craig refused to talk about the IRL or  
comparisons between the leagues. He did say he hopes they can 
eventually get back together. 
</P>
<P>
	While that might not happen anytime soon, at least the two sides  
seem content to be going their separate ways without hostility. 
</P>
<P>
	``The CART series is obviously more developed than the IRL  
series,'' IRL car owner John Menard said. ``But it's interesting. 
This whole thing is getting closer and closer to being more 
together on a more businesslike basis. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just wouldn't have dreamt of doing that a couple years  
ago. Everybody hated each other so badly.''

<HEADLINE>  Star Wars Tickets Go On Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Diehard fans overcame driving rain, long  
lines, busy signals, clogged Web sites and grumpy movie critics 
Wednesday to buy advance tickets to the latest Star Wars movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been waiting 16 years for this,'' said Lee Dahlhauser in  
Ames, Iowa, after spending a rainy night in line at a theater under 
blankets and sheets of plastic. 
</P>
<P>
	Tickets for ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' the  
first Star Wars movie since 1983, sold out within minutes. The 
movie, a prequel to the earlier George Lucas films, opens May 19. 
</P>
<P>
	After opening day showings sold out, fans scrambled to get  
tickets for later dates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't even close,'' said Tom Peters, a 29-year-old video  
producer who waited in line for 90 minutes at a mall in Fox Chapel, 
Pa. ``They were selling them 12 at a time, and they were just going 
12 by 12 by 12 by 12.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Early reviews of the movie are mixed, but that didn't seem to  
quiet demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas initially barred advanced ticket sales to prevent scalping  
but relented under pressure from theater owners. In a compromise, 
theaters restricted sales to a maximum of 12 tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no early reports of scalping problems -- just  
thousands of diehard fans eager to get tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	At Mann's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, where the original  
``Star Wars'' premiered in 1977 and where the most devoted fans 
have been camping out for weeks, the line stretched down one side 
of Hollywood Boulevard and to the next block over. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important we see it on opening day at Mann's Chinese  
Theatre,'' said Susanna Modjallal, 30. ``If Lucas thought it was 
good enough to premiere here, it's good enough for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Baltimore, the crowd outside the Senator Theater was three  
blocks long, but Pete Levin staked claim to the 32nd spot in line 
by camping out with his sister and friend since 9 a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He bought five tickets for the first showing at 12:01 a.m. on  
May 19. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want anyone to spoil it for me,'' Levin said. ``I  
want to be surprised. I didn't want anyone to tell me the ending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His sister, 25-year-old Ilse Levin, said they didn't buy the  
maximum of 12 because: ``It's the Force, the Force is about being 
nice to people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Raleigh, N.C., Israel Ehrisman and four of his friends  
pitched a tent at the 16-screen Raleigh Grand theater to get a good 
place in line. They brought along a television and VCR to show the 
earlier ``Star Wars'' trilogy. They also brought a ``Star Wars'' 
Trivial Pursuit game and Nintendo 64 game featuring ``Star Wars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Seeing it opening night is fun and camping out with other  
people that are as interested in 'Star Wars' as you are is half of 
the enjoyment,'' Ehrisman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who thought it would be a little more sane buying tickets  
by phone or over the Internet were in for a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	So many people called MovieFone that circuits were jammed even  
though the ticket telephone service added lines. Its Web site was 
also swamped, moving at a snail's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	``The demand has been even greater than we expected. Thousands  
of transactions are being conducted every minute,'' said Christine 
Fakundiny, director of marketing for MovieFone. ``But people are 
getting through and we are processing them. The advice to the war 
weary is keep trying.''

<HEADLINE> UAW Leader Critical of 'Dead' Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The top official for the United Auto Workers  
criticized a major manufacturing proposal by General Motors Corp., 
setting an early tone for what could be contentious negotiations by 
the two sides when national contract talks get under way later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, United Auto Workers president Stephen P. Yokich  
described GM's modular assembly plan as a ``dead'' issue, and said 
its chief advocate at GM should be fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Modular assembly, which GM is promoting as a way to drastically  
cut its manufacturing costs, would allow the auto giant to use 
fewer UAW workers and rely more on independent suppliers to put 
together major parts clusters, or modules. 
</P>
<P>
	During a briefing with reporters, Yokich and vice president  
Richard Shoemaker harshly criticized GM's small-car manufacturing 
chief, Mark Hogan, for comments he made about the company's modular 
assembly plans at a manufacturing conference Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hogan reported that GM had selected the suppliers for 15 major  
parts modules that will be used for its next generation of small 
cars. He made it clear that GM was moving ahead with plans to build 
modular plants in Lansing and Lordstown, Ohio, even though it 
expected UAW opposition to delay its progress. 
</P>
<P>
	To the secretive UAW, Hogan's public statements were an insult.  
Yokich is loath to discuss negotiating positions and issues in the 
press, and expects automakers to be equally circumspect. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they should fire Mark Hogan, quite frankly, because he  
just can't keep his mouth shut,'' Yokich said. ``If they can't fire 
him, they should put a muzzle on him. I hope he understands that, 
because he is not helping General Motors or the UAW when it comes 
to these negotiations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yokich, who described modular assembly as an attack on job  
security, implied after the briefing that the union won't give in 
to GM on the issue. He noted comments in March by GM president G. 
Richard Wagoner Jr. that modular assembly was not the only way to 
cut manufacturing costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the issue's dead,'' Yokich said. ``I don't think it's  
going to be a big issue in negotiations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM said Hogan was unavailable for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	But GM spokesman Edd Snyder noted that Hogan also told the  
manufacturing conference that ``there is a positive role for the 
union in helping us work with our supply chain'' and that both 
sides were ``making progress toward a mutually beneficial 
solution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The triennial negotiations are scheduled to begin with the  
ceremonial handshakes June 14 at Ford Motor Co., June 15 with the 
Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler AG, and June 16 at GM. The talks 
do not typically move into high gear before late August; the 
current pacts expire Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Yokich insisted each company has ``serious issues'' to  
resolve with the UAW, most of the attention will be on GM's efforts 
to improve its long-contentious relationship with the union. 
</P>
<P>
	GM and the UAW also will have to sort out the employment terms  
for thousands of UAW workers at Delphi Automotive Systems Corp., 
the big parts maker that GM plans to spin off later this month. The 
UAW, which opposes the spinoff, expects Delphi workers will remain 
under GM's national agreement when the talks are completed, 
Shoemaker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yokich said job security will again be the major issue in the  
pending talks with all three automakers. The UAW has watched its 
ranks among the U.S. automakers steadily decline in the past decade 
as the automakers have become leaner and more efficient. At the 
same time, the union has failed to organize newer plants opened by 
Japanese and German automakers.

<HEADLINE> Report: Nets To Move to Newark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey Nets have notified Gov.  
Christine Whitman that the basketball team will move to Newark by 
2003, the Star-Ledger reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Nets owners sent a letter to Whitman formally rejecting an offer  
to participate in a new sports complex planned for the Meadowlands, 
the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter said the Nets owners had ``reached a unanimous  
decision to work with the Newark group and build in Newark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which runs  
Continental Airlines Arena and the rest of the Meadowlands complex, 
also received a copy of the letter, authority president Dennis 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nets officials including owners Ray Chambers, Stan Gale and Finn  
Wentworth and team president Michael Rowe met with Whitman on 
Tuesday in Princeton to discuss their plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials said they anticipate raising $200 million in  
private investment to build an 18,500-seat arena in Newark by 2003. 
But they say about $100 million in public financing also will be 
necessary to fund improvements to roads and mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Newark complex also may include a 30,000 seat stadium to  
house Major League Soccer's New York-New Jersey MetroStars. The 
soccer club, which plays at Giants Stadium, is mulling its own move 
to Elizabeth. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey Devils owner John McMullen has said his ice hockey  
club will not follow the Nets to Newark. McMullen prefers instead 
to build a waterfront arena in Hoboken. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority had hoped to  
attract both the Nets and Devils to a new sports and entertainment 
complex in the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental Airlines Arena, formerly called Brendan Byrne Arena,  
was built in 1981. The Nets' lease runs through 2007, but an escape 
clause allows the team to move anywhere in New Jersey anytime 
without penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson said he is disappointed that the Nets and Devils could  
not agree on an arrangement that would keep them in the 
Meadowlands, an East Rutherford complex that also includes Giants 
Stadium and Meadowlands Racetrack. Robinson was not surprised by 
Tuesday's letter, however. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's consistent with what the Nets have been saying all  
along,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Honda Recalls 125,000 Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORRANCE, Calif. (AP) -- American Honda Motor Co. voluntarily  
recalled about 125,000 Hondas and Acuras built from 1996 to 1998 
because the front suspension assembly could collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	American Honda will replace the lower front ball joints on  
certain Acura RL, TL and CL models, as well as certain Honda 
Accord, Prelude and Odyssey models, spokesman Mike Spencer said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball joint assembly, which attaches the lower control arm of  
the front suspension to the hub-spindle assembly, may wear more 
quickly than normal on a small number of the affected vehicles, 
Spencer said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the plastic seat of the ball joint wears excessively it could  
cause the ball joint assembly to separate, causing the front 
suspension to collapse, Honda said. 
</P>
<P>
	One failure has been reported but there were no accidents or  
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Though the condition affects only a small percentage of the  
recalled vehicles, the components will be replaced in all of the 
potentially affected vehicles to ensure the safety and satisfaction 
of our customers,'' said Jim Roach, vice president of service at 
American Honda. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners of affected vehicles will be notified by mail and asked  
to take their vehicles to their Honda or Acura dealer to replace 
the ball joints free of charge.

<HEADLINE> RJR Shareholders Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- The spinoff of RJR Nabisco's domestic  
tobacco unit from its food business will return dividends to 
shareholders in both companies, said chairman Steven F. Goldstone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone told me today, `All's well that ends well,' '' he told  
reporters following what amounted to RJR Nabisco's last 
shareholders meeting. ``We now have two companies that are in very 
good shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In March, RJR Nabisco announced its intention to spin off its  
U.S. cigarette business from its food interests after selling its 
international tobacco business for nearly $8 billion to Japan 
Tobacco Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR said the international tobacco sale was completed Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	The spinoff of the domestic tobacco business, which makes  
Winston, Camel and Salem cigarettes, is expected to be completed by 
June 15, Goldstone said. It is second only to Philip Morris Cos. 
Inc., maker of Marlboro. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the moves required shareholder approval. The meeting  
drew about 200 shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing more relaxed than he has been at previous shareholders  
meetings, Goldstone said he could understand why one speaker 
described the meeting as a wake. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people are nostalgic about this company,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	RJR Nabisco was acquired just over a decade ago for about $25  
billion in the biggest leveraged buyout at that time. The deal 
capped one of the wildest corporate bidding wars of the junk 
bond-fueled 1980s and was chronicled on the book ``Barbarians at 
the Gate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to its tobacco business, RJR owns an 80.6 percent  
stake in Nabisco Holdings Corp., which makes Oreo cookies, Ritz 
crackers and Planters nuts. That is all RJR will own after the 
domestic tobacco spinoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates of a split-up of the tobacco and food interests argued  
the market was undervaluing the food business because of its 
connection with the potential liabilities of the tobacco 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	With the spinoff of the tobacco business, Goldstone said,  
Nabisco shareholders won't have to worry about lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstone will remain with Nabisco as chairman while James M.  
Kilts will remain as president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	As a separate publicly-traded company, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco  
will have the financial muscle to continue to defend itself in 
tobacco lawsuits, Goldstone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders will have one share in each separate company when  
the spinoff is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders Wednesday also elected a company-backed slate of  
nine directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholder Carl Icahn had nominated his own slate to challenge  
the RJR nominees but withdrew it late last month. Icahn wanted RJR 
to spin off the food holdings rather than the domestic tobacco 
business. But he dropped his proxy contest after several large 
shareholders told him they supported management's spinoff plan as 
the quickest way to divide the company. 
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks, R.J. Reynolds chief executive Andrew J.  
Schindler said he was looking forward to the challenge of running 
the tobacco business as a separate entity. 
</P>
<P>
	He said cigarette consumption is declining, with estimates for  
1999 indicating U.S. consumption will fall as much as 8.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the industry is facing more lawsuits and political  
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	``We intend to be as resilient and competitive as possible in  
this new environment,'' Schindler said. ``We'll fight hard to 
maintain our market position.''

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Halt Internet Gambling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill that would put a stop to the Internet  
gambling by closing down ``virtual casino'' World Wide Web sites 
cleared a Senate subcommittee on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, sponsored by Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., would extend to  
the Internet federal law prohibiting gambling via telephone wire. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, businesses offering gambling over the Internet,  
including interactive, pay-to-play casino-style games, would be 
fined an amount equal to the bets it received or $20,000, whichever 
is greater. Owners of the business could be imprisoned up to four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike a similar measure that passed the Senate but not the  
House last year, Kyl's legislation would not impose penalties on 
individual bettors. But they would remain subject to any state 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet service providers would be required to cut off service  
to anyone making a gambling site available to U.S. customers, 
allowing law enforcement to reach gambling companies with 
headquarters outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Judiciary subcommittee on technology, terrorism and  
government information passed the bill by a voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
	No companion bill has been introduced in the House, although  
several Republicans have said they plan to do so soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyl has denounced Internet gambling as an addictive and  
potentially corruptive activity that is breeding crime. Unlike 
other forms of gambling, it is virtually impossible to regulate, he 
said, and there is no sure way to keep minors from becoming 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	A trade group has contended that Internet gambling is popular  
and can be regulated successfully. The Interactive Gaming Council 
is opposing the bill.

Justice Department refusing to let the FBI search the computer of a 
suspected nuclear weapons lab spy in 1997 as ``a close call'' 
justified by a lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno's defense in a closed-door meeting Wednesday of the Senate  
Intelligence Committee left Republicans and Democrats still angry 
over the slow response by the FBI and Justice Department to an 
emerging espionage crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics contend a computer search would have turned up years  
earlier evidence emerging only last month that Los Alamos scientist 
Wen Ho Lee shifted thousands of classified atomic weapons codes to 
an unsecured computer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The diligence of the Justice Department and the FBI just was  
not there,'' said Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., the committee 
chairman. ``I don't think the country was well served.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., the committee vice chairman, said, ``We  
don't understand why a surveillance opportunity wasn't granted. If 
the Justice Department isn't at fault, then the process is at 
fault.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno did not speak to reporters after the meeting but Shelby  
said she described the ruling by her department as ``a close call'' 
justified at the time by a lack of evidence that Lee was spying for 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	To this day, Lee has not been charged with a crime, although he  
was fired from his job at Los Alamos in March. He has repeatedly 
denied through his attorney that he was a spy or that he provided 
China with classified information. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI was not looking for the shifted computer files in 1996.  
But it was acting then on intelligence indicating that China had 
obtained classified information about the W-88, a sophisticated 
U.S. nuclear warhead. Lee had worked on the W-88 program and had 
traveled to China, two facts that put him under suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Energy offered to search Lee's computer under  
internal guidelines permitting such searches for security purposes. 
The FBI, however, was concerned that if such a search turned up 
evidence it might be thrown out in court and could endanger a 
prosecution of Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the FBI's general counsel and the Justice Department agreed  
that a search warrant granted by a secret federal court under the 
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act would be required. The FBI 
applied, but in 1997 Justice ruled that there was not enough 
evidence against Lee and decided against seeking the warrant from 
the secret court. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, called the two-year delay in  
searching Lee's computer ``a classic case of bureaucratic 
bungling.'' Even if such a search jeopardized possible prosecution, 
it should have been conducted to help prevent additional losses of 
secrets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can't convict, we can sure stop the process,'' Murkowski  
said. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee he chairs 
heard from Justice and FBI officials earlier Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI search in 1996 or 1997 may have made little difference.  
Lee had transferred the classified weapons codes over a 12-year 
period ending in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Anne Sullivan, the Energy Department's general counsel,  
said that Los Alamos lab managers twice had offered to search Lee's 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
	If the department proceeded with the search over the FBI's  
objections, Sullivan said, ``we would have subjected ourselves to 
another criticism. That we compromised their ability to conduct an 
investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said Congress should make it clear  
there are certain times when national security is at issue that 
such a search of a government computer will not taint evidence.

<HEADLINE> GM Launches $1B Olympic Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. isn't letting the Salt Lake  
City Olympic scandal stand in the way of its $1 billion marketing 
campaign to link the world's leading sporting event and its No. 1 
automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	GM called on seven gold medalists Tuesday to help kick off its  
sponsorship program for the U.S. Olympic Committee and its 
constituent sports governing bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	Figure skaters Dorothy Hamill and Kristi Yamaguchi, track stars  
Carl Lewis, Evelyn Ashford and Bob Mathias, swimmer Pablo Morales 
and basketball player Grant Hill will help GM and the United Auto 
Workers aid families of U.S. Olympic hopefuls. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Olympics have taken some shots of late. Some of those  
shots are deserved,'' NBC sportscaster Bob Costas said a news 
conference Tuesday. ``But what endures about the Olympics is the 
athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM will launch 17 months of ads for the 2000 Summer Games during  
next month's NBA Finals, GM vice president and marketing chief Phil 
Guarascio said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing quite captures center stage like the Olympics,''  
Guarascio said. The early ad launch is a way of ``avoiding the 
Olympic clutter with other sponsors -- be there where they ain't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's also a good business deal. GM gets exclusive rights to use  
U.S. Olympic symbols and athletes in its ads for the next five 
Olympics -- through 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	GM pulled out all stops at a news conference to show its  
continued confidence -- and investment -- in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to bringing in six Olympic gold medalists -- Hill was  
absent because of his Detroit Pistons' NBA playoff series with 
Atlanta -- it hired Costas as master of ceremonies. NBC holds the 
U.S. Olympic TV rights through 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	Costas said those who strive to be the world's best before a  
worldwide audience of billions make a lasting impression ``no 
matter how much bungling people in suits are guilty of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ten International Olympic Committee members have resigned or  
been expelled in the scandal over favors and payments to win the 
2002 Winter Games for Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson &AMP; Johnson broke off U.S. Olympic sponsorship  
negotiations after the scandal broke, and other business interest 
has slackened. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly it slowed down the sale of our sponsorships,'' said  
John Krimsky, the U.S. Olympic Committee's deputy secretary general 
and marketing chief. ``But I will tell you that we have put that 
behind us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC sports head Dick Ebersol denied the network has felt any  
heat from the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been pretty much untouched,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, GM's solid and substantial support -- much of it going  
to buy ad spots on NBC -- should go a long way to shore up U.S. 
corporate backing of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's 10-year, $1 billion sponsorship agreement buys it rights as  
the official vehicle-maker to the U.S. team. It also will be the 
only domestic automaker advertising during NBC's 2000 Olympic 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The rights extend to Olympic coverage on NBC's 13 network-owned  
and operated stations. 
</P>
<P>
	GM signed the contract more than a year ago, before the scandal  
broke, but had not decided how it would be spending its money. 
</P>
<P>
	While discussing the megadollars going toward its Olympic ad  
campaign, GM sought to spotlight a more modest program to supply 
cars and trucks to the families of Olympic contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Team Behind the Team'' is a $3.5 million joint project with  
the UAW, the automaker's principal union. 
</P>
<P>
	The program will give cars to the families of 100 U.S. athletes  
preparing for the 2000 Games in Sydney and another 100 for those 
aiming for Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven Olympic medalists, who will select the recipients,  
talked about the sacrifices their families made to aid their sports 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mother never got that carpet for the living room,'' said  
Lewis, winner of nine track-and-field gold medals in the 1988, '92 
and '96 games. ``The money went to send us to track meets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My parents spent a lot of time away from the rest of the  
family,'' said Yamaguchi, 1992 figure-skating gold medalist. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamill said her mother fed her breakfast in bed, then  
chauffeured her on two daily 2 1/2-hour round trips from their 
Connecticut home to an ice rink in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I received all the glory, but my family and coach worked just  
as hard,'' the 1976 figure-skating gold medalist said.

<HEADLINE> AOL Considers Net TV Possibilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America Online Inc., which connects 17 million  
subscribers to the Internet through computers, now is looking to 
establish its service through television sets. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, AOL announced new partnerships with DirecTV, Hughes  
Network Systems, Philips Electronics and Network Computer Inc., to 
develop a system to connect televisions to the Internet by using 
satellite dishes, high-speed digital subscriber lines and 
high-speed modems. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Schuler, president of America Online's Interactive  
Services Group, said the proposed system also would allow viewers 
to watch TV while surfing the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The targeted audience, he said, are the AOL subscribers who  
already access the service through personal computers. While the 
computer will still be the main device used to access the service, 
he said, AOL would like to expand onto other appliances in the 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts saw the deals as a good first step toward  
AOL's goal of reaching viewers through other means besides the PC. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've pretty well maxed out the number of people signing up  
using computers,'' said Gerry Kaufhold, a multimedia and digital 
television analyst for Cahners In-Stat Group, a market research 
company for emerging technology in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaufhold said AOL is getting pinched by AT&AMP;T, which is moving  
aggressively to provide high-speed hookups to the Internet using 
recently acquired cable systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``AOL is in a footrace,'' he said. ``It expands their turf from  
the 14-inch monitor in your den to the 36-inch TV in your living 
room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If AOL succeeds in drawing in more viewers, it could increase  
their advertiser base and revenues. The new system is scheduled to 
be available some time in 2000, said Schuler.

<HEADLINE> EU Won't Meet WTO Beef Ban Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union will formally notify  
the World Trade Organization that it does not intend to meet the 
Thursday deadline for lifting a ban on hormone treated beef 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO has ruled the EU's 10-year-old ban on imports of  
hormone-treated beef is illegal and set the deadline for the 
15-nation bloc to lift the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has threatened to impose $900 million in  
sanctions on EU goods if the ban is not lifted. Canada has also 
issued a list of proposed EU goods for possible retaliatory 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigel Gardner, trade spokesman for the European Commission, said  
the EU plans to send a letter Thursday to the WTO's Dispute 
Settlement Body stating that the ban will remain in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at WTO headquarters in Geneva said the issue will be  
on the agenda when the dispute panel meets May 26. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commission says it won't lift the ban because studies  
carried out by European scientists indicate possible human health 
risks posed by six growth-promoting hormones used by beef farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the EU is waiting for final results on 17 other  
scientific studies before it can consider changing its position on 
beef hormones. Those studies won't be ready until late this year or 
early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner said negotiations were continuing with the United States  
on a compensation proposal for U.S. cattle farmers that would head 
off the threat of sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking with the Americans,'' Gardner told reporters.  
``We want to continue the dialogue on compensation and the 
scientific evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	EU Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan met with U.S. Trade  
Representative Charlene Barshefsky Wednesday in Tokyo, but the two 
sides didn't reach an agreement on beef hormones. Barshefsky said 
the U.S. reserves its right to seek WTO authorization for imposing 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not drop our plan,'' she said, adding, ``We intend to  
avail ourselves of our WTO rights and seek authorization to 
retaliate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. cattle industry says that the ban cost them about $250  
million a year in lost sales.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Transfers $54.5 M to Coaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The NCAA officially brought an end to  
its most expensive mistake on Tuesday, transferring more than $54.5 
million to an account controlled by lawyers for former 
restricted-earnings coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	The final accounting, agreed upon after the NCAA was found in  
violation of antitrust law for artifically capping the coaches' 
salaries, included $19,754.40 in interest since the NCAA was three 
days late in making the payment. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted to wait until all the points in the written  
agreement were settled and we didn't get that done until this 
morning,'' said Dennis Cross, a lawyer for the coaches. ``It was 
resolved with their agreement to pay interest, which amounted to 
about $6,000 and change per day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conceived as a way to save money, Division I schools voted  
almost unanimously in 1991 to create an entry-level coaching 
position in all sports but football where people could be paid no 
more than $16,000 per year. Several coaches filed suit, which 
became a class-action representing more than 2,000 men and women. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA fought the suit through the courts for more than three  
years, losing at every turn. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is very glad to have this finally resolved. It has  
been a very trying time for everyone,'' said Wally Renfro, director 
of public relations for the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	Every one of the more than 310 Division I schools will share in  
the payment. It will cost the major powers about $190,000 each and 
the smaller schools about $77,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA, which is moving its headquarters to Indianapolis from  
suburban Kansas City, had expected to get much of the money through 
a tax-free bond issue guaranteed by the state of Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Indiana Legislature adjourned without acting on the  
bill. So the NCAA covered the biggest part of the $54.5 million 
from the nearly $200 million which arrives this time every year 
from CBS as payment for rights to the basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be several months before the coaches get their money.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's still a lot of work to do,'' Cross said. ``We have to  
get preliminary approval from the court, send notice to (the 
coaches), propose a plan of distribution. Then there will be a 
final hearing and the court will decided whether to give final 
approval to the settlement. Then distributing and processing the 
claims will take a lot of effort as well.''

<HEADLINE> China Protest Affecting US Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- Recovery in China will be arduous for  
Kentucky Fried Chicken. After it rebuilds restaurants wrecked by 
rampaging protesters, it faces a new threat: calls for Chinese to 
boycott the Colonel's chicken. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters enraged at the NATO bombing of China's embassy in  
Yugoslavia want Chinese to shun everything American, from KFC and 
Coca Cola to Motorola mobile phones. 
</P>
<P>
	``We definitely will see in the short term, maybe one to two  
months, our sales will fall. How much, we don't know,'' said Tony 
Chen, a spokesman for Tricom Global Restaurants Ltd., which owns 
310 KFC restaurants in China. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese leaders say foreigners are welcome and safe, but at  
least for now the boycott threats, security alerts and the echo of 
anti-American chants have changed the atmosphere for U.S. 
businesses in China. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies say long-term plans will not be affected by the events  
of this week -- when Chinese leaders encouraged protesters to stone 
the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. But many canceled their executives' 
trips to China or told American employees to stay at home. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest change could be in attitude among customers and  
business contacts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have seen among the Chinese almost a love affair with  
things American, and it's not clear whether that will continue. 
People are less enthralled,'' said Michael Furst, executive 
director of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese leaders have tried to reach out to foreign investors  
amidst the din of protests that equated Americans with Nazi 
Germany. In Shanghai, Mayor Xu Kuangdi visited General Motors Corp. 
and other companies Tuesday to reassure them, said Lawrence B. 
Zahner Jr., president of GM China. 
</P>
<P>
	American companies say they accept those assurances.  
</P>
<P>
	Boeing Co. denied rumors that it was evacuating some of the 100  
Americans working in its 18 offices in China. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought everyone would take advantage of this to stay home,  
but it's been business as usual,'' said Tom McLean, a spokesman for 
the aircraft maker. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. presence is vital to China, which relies on foreign  
companies for jobs and investment at a time of slowing growth and 
massive restructuring of state industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky Fried Chicken alone employs 23,500 people in China.  
</P>
<P>
	And U.S. business is one of Beijing's best friends, lobbying in  
Washington against trade sanctions and in favor of World Trade 
Organization membership for China. 
</P>
<P>
	But even basic precautions will force companies to postpone  
high-level meetings and crimp other activities. 
</P>
<P>
	British Petroleum has told its 20 British and American employees  
in China to avoid public events and others to put off trips from 
abroad, said Jeremy Yao, general manager of BP's Shanghai office. 
</P>
<P>
	And companies like Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald's, with  
far-flung restaurant networks spread across China, are hard to 
protect. KFC's signature Colonel Sanders statues were smashed this 
week outside dozens of restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to open our doors everyday for customers. A company  
like GM, General Electric or Motorola has much more flexibility,'' 
Chen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The protests come at a time when economic reformers led by  
Premier Zhu Rongji are struggling with hardliners who oppose the 
broad concessions Zhu offered the United States last month for WTO 
membership. 
</P>
<P>
	The scale and intensity of protests in some 20 Chinese cities  
could boost the premier's opponents, said Zhu Nongfei of the 
consulting firm A.T. Kearney. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the protests, a string of surprise events had made  
companies more wary about possible political shifts on WTO and 
other issues, said Bob Broadfoot of the Political and Economic Risk 
Consultancy in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	They included the January collapse of a major investment trust  
and an extraordinary silent protest in central Beijing last month 
by as many as 30,000 members of a martial arts group. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's going to be greater caution on the part of both  
Chinese and the foreign companies about when China is going to get 
into WTO. That has a really big impact,'' Broadfoot said. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign companies are watching for a long-term political  
backlash. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't see any impact right now, but it's still too soon to  
know for sure,'' said Brian Zhou, a spokesman in Beijing for the 
U.S. computer chip maker Intel Corp.

<HEADLINE> Former Bre-X Executive Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Ontario's stock market watchdog has charged  
former Bre-X Minerals Ltd. vice-chairman John Felderhof with 
violating the province's securities laws relating to the 1997 
Busang gold mining scandal in Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ontario Securities Commission announced late Tuesday it has  
filed eight charges against Felderhof, accusing the longtime mining 
industry executive of insider trading and other violations of 
provincial securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission spokesman Mark Conacher said the charges came after  
an exhaustive investigation which involved the analysis of more 
than 200,000 stock market transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took until now to conclude that offenses had been  
committed, in our view, and that the evidence supports that,'' 
Conacher said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The Royal Canadian Mounted Police is also investigating  
Felderhof for possible violations of Canada's Criminal Code. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-time geologist is believed to have been holed up at his  
Cayman Islands estate since the Bre-X meltdown, which wiped $4.1 
billion in stock market value off the company's books and led to 
numerous lawsuits by disgruntled investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Busang site in Indonesia was once touted as one of the  
biggest gold discoveries in history. Bre-X Minerals shares, which 
started out worth 21 cents apiece on the junior Alberta Stock 
Exchange, became an instant heavyweight on the prestigious Toronto 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	But after seeing its stock price rise to more than $137 a share,  
the Calgary-based exploration company collapsed after an 
investigation proved its Indonesian gold property was a fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission alleges that between April 24, 1996 and September  
10, 1996 Felderhof was involved in insider trading of more than 2.7 
million shares of Bre-X for about $57.5 million ``with knowledge of 
a material fact pertaining to rights of Bre-X in relation to the 
Busang properties that had not been generally disclosed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A further four counts allege that between June 20, 1996 and Feb.  
17, 1997 Felderhof ``authorized, permitted or acquiesced'' in Bre-X 
issuing misleading or untrue press releases about the amount of 
gold at Busang. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission said Tuesday that as a strict liability offense,  
it's not necessary to prove whether Felderhof knew at the time that 
the gold estimates were false. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue, for the commission, is not whether or not he knew  
that the resource calculations were misleading or untrue,'' said 
Conacher. ``But given his position with the company, it's his 
responsibility to establish that they were not misleading or 
untrue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bre-X shares crashed after the scandal and the stock was again  
worth pennies before the company was pushed into bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	A subsequent investigation showed stellar drilling results were  
fabricated by Bre-X's chief geologist Michael de Guzman and his 
associates in Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	De Guzman later died -- authorities concluded he committed  
suicide -- after falling from a company helicopter over the 
Indonesian jungle. Bre-X chairman David Walsh, a Calgary mining 
promoter, died almost a year ago of an aneurysm at his Bahamian 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ontario commission said Felderhof, or his lawyer, will be  
required to appear before the Ontario Court of Justice on June 15 
to answer the charges.

<HEADLINE> NBC Win Tightens Ratings Race / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC now knows that biblical characters and Julia  
Roberts are great audience lures. Hippie killers, however, are not. 
</P>
<P>
	The second part of NBC's mini-series, ``Noah's Ark,'' was the  
week's second most-watched program after ``ER.'' Part one topped 
Nielsen Media Research's prime-time ratings the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The drama ``Law and Order'' reached its biggest audience since  
March 1997 with last Wednesday's episode, where movie star Roberts 
was the guest. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sunday's NBC mini-series, ``The Hunt for the Unicorn  
Killer,'' didn't do nearly as well. The story about convicted 
fugitive Ira Einhorn was soundly beaten in the ratings by CBS's 
movie, ``The Simple Life of Noah Dearborn,'' which starred Sidney 
Poitier. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the mixed results from its ``sweeps'' month events,  
NBC's boost from its biblical epic tightened the competition for 
the season crown with first-place CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of the week's top eight shows were from NBC's Thursday  
night lineup. Yet even that was a mixed blessing: it was the 
lowest-rated Thursday evening of first-run shows for the network 
since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, NBC had a 9.9 rating and 17 share. CBS was second  
with a 9.0 rating and 15 share, ABC had a 7.5 rating and 13 share, 
and Fox had a 6.1 rating and 11 share. The WB was at 3.0 and 5, UPN 
had a 2.0 and 3, and Pax TV had a 0.7 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' won the evening news competition with a  
7.7 rating and 17 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was second 
with a 7.1 rating and 16 share, while the ``CBS Evening News'' had 
a 6.3 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of May 3-9, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: ``ER,'' NBC, 18.4; ``NBC Monday Night Movie: Noah's 
Ark, Part Two,'' NBC, 17.1; ``Friends,'' NBC, 14.3; ``CBS Sunday 
Movie: The Simple Life of Noah Dearborn,'' CBS, 13.8; ``Frasier,'' 
NBC, 13.8; ``Law and Order,'' NBC, 13.4; ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' NBC, 
12.0; ``Veronica's Closet,'' NBC, 11.9; ``Touched By an Angel,'' 
CBS, 11.7; ``Dateline NBC-Tuesday, 11.2.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Official Releases Notes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Sydney Olympic Committee president  
Michael Knight has released personal notes on International Olympic 
Committee members made by Australian IOC member Phil Coles. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight did not seek IOC permission to give out 400-pages of  
previously confidential material today and justified his release by 
saying the documents had already been leaked to two media 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Personal details such as marital problems, perceived honesty,  
even matters such as smoking, eating and shopping habits, were 
documented by Coles and his partner Patricia Rosenbrock -- both 
members of Sydney's bid team. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC is investigating how the documents apparently found  
their way to Salt Lake City officials before the city's successful 
bid to host the 2002 Winter Games. Coles has denied passing them 
on. 
</P>
<P>
	Several IOC members covered by the notes have either been  
previously expelled by the IOC, resigned or died. 
</P>
<P>
	In one entry, Coles noted that the husband of Finnish member  
Pirjo Haggman needed work in forestry. Haggman resigned after 
husband Bjarne worked for Salt Lake City, following a 20-month 
forestry contract in Canada while Toronto was bidding for the 1996 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles' notes were made before Sydney won the 2000 Games.  
</P>
<P>
	In handwritten notes on 67 IOC members, Rosenbrock gives her  
suggestions on whether an IOC member would vote for or against Salt 
Lake City. It appears that her notes were written after Sydney won 
its bid but before the 1995 vote for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents went much further than voting predictions, and  
included characterizations of certain members, such as labelling 
Greek IOC member Lambis Nikolaou as being ``very temperamental -- 
emphasis on mental.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenbrock was also blunt about perceived weaknesses.  
</P>
<P>
	For example, she noted Alexandru Siperco, IOC member from  
Romania, was ``a little old and irritable,'' and Western Samoa's 
Seuili Paul Wallwork ``seems to have a bit of a chip on his 
shoulder, i.e. often seems a little unhappy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She noted that Lamine Kieta of Mali was ``more than prepared to  
take advantage of any expense allowance. Not to be trusted I 
believe -- but said he supports Salt Lake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenbrock found plenty of ``nice'' and ``honorable'' IOC  
members but also noticed other personal traits -- vanity, pride, 
desire. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles has been censured for receiving excessive hospitality from  
the Salt Lake bid and is under investigation on claims he received 
expensive jewelry from Athens' failed bid for the 1996 Summer 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight said he did not consider it necessary to ask for the  
IOC's permission to release the documents, despite the personal 
references made to many members. 
</P>
<P>
	``The material is already out there in full with two media  
organizations,'' he said. ``We took advice on how we could handle 
any (Freedom of Information) applications. The legal advice was if 
there was an FOI application, we'd have to hand the stuff over, so 
it's silly to prevaricate or procrastinate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, who has claimed a conspiracy working against him with the  
SOCOG board, took a shot at Knight over the release. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a typical Knight stunt probably,'' Coles said. ``He seems  
to have been wanting my head on a block for some time.''

<HEADLINE> Lukas' Colts Draw Good at Preakness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The luck of draw was with trainer D. Wayne  
Lukas on Wednesday for his Kentucky Derby winner Charismatic and 
third-place Cat Thief. Trainer Bob Baffert's sensational filly 
Silverbulletday's outside post might keep her out of the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert's other filly, Excellent Meeting, fifth in the Derby,  
will definitely be in the full field of 14 3-year-olds Saturday at 
Pimlico. It's only the eighth time in the 124-year history that 
there's been at least 14 starters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll mull it over tonight, (Mike) Pegram and I,'' Baffert  
said of whether Silverbulletday, winner of 10 of 11 starts, will 
start in the Preakness. ``We're disappointed, really, you know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert said if Silverbulletday had drawn No. 1 or from No. 4  
through 10, she definitely would start. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert picking No. 13 could have had that post position for the  
filly, but he and Carl Nafzger, picking 14th for 18th-place Derby 
finisher Vicar, decided to have a little fun. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to make this interesting,'' Baffert said. ``We're  
going to flip a coin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nafzger called ``heads,'' won and picked No. 13.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked whose idea it was for the coin toss, Nafzger said,  
``Bob's. I ain't that smart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert picked No. 7 for Excellent Meeting, who broke from No. 5  
in the Derby and had what he called an horrendous trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas chose No. 6 for Charismatic, who won from No. 16 in the  
Derby, and took No. 3 for Cat Thief, who left from No. 10 in the 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're delighted,'' Lukas said. ``Things are falling in  
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic was made the early 6-1 fourth choice behind Derby  
runnerup Menifee (5-2), Silverbulletday (7-2) and Excellent Meeting 
(5-1). 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the story all week will be he's a claimer (he ran for a  
$62,500 tag Feb. 11) and everything went his way in the Derby,'' 
Lukas said earlier Wednesday. ``Don't discredit the horse because I 
was foolish enough to run him in a claiming race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee broke from the No. 18 post in the 19-horse Derby, was  
12th with a quarter-mile remaining, then just missed catching 
Charismatic by a neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten Derby starters are in the Preakness, the most ever in the 1  
3-16-mile Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	The other Derby veterans are sixth-place Kimberlite Pipe (No. 2  
post), seventh-place Worldly Manner (No. 10), 14th-place Stephen 
Got Even (No. 11), 15th-place Valhol (No. 12) and 17th-place Adonis 
(No. 9). 
</P>
<P>
	No jockey was named by trainer Nick Zito for Stephen Got Even,  
winner of the Gallery Furniture.com Stakes and second Derby 
favorite behind the entry of fourth-place Prime Timber and 
Excellent Meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris McCarron was supposed to ride the colt, but suffered a  
hairline fracture near his left heel when he was unseated during a 
workout Monday at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday or Excellent Meeting could become the fifth  
filly to win the Preakness and the first since Nellie Morse won 
from the No. 15 post in 1924. The last time there was more than one 
filly in the race was when three started in 1921. 
</P>
<P>
	The last Preakness winner not to have raced in the Derby was  
Deputed Testamony in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	The other Preakness starters who missed the Derby would be  
Patience Game (post 8), winner of the 1-mile Derby Trial April 24 
at Churchill Downs; Torrid Sand (No. 1), third in the 1 1/8-mile 
Arkansas Derby in his stakes debut April 10, and Badge (No. 4), 
winner of the one-mile Gotham and fourth in the Wood Memorial April 
10 in his last two starts. 
</P>
<P>
	While Stephen Got Even, Adonis and Valhol were already at  
Pimlico, the other 11 didn't arrive until Wednesday. Badge vanned 
in from New York and the others came in two flights from 
Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
	The first off the first van from the airport was Charismatic,  
who was greeted by owners Bob and Beverly Lewis, owners of the 
Baffert-trained Silver Charm, winner of the 1997 Kentucky Derby and 
Preakness. Bob Lewis was 75 on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Russian Director Assails U.S., NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANNES, France (AP) -- It didn't even take a full day for the  
conflict in Kosovo to take center stage at the Cannes Film 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	Nikita Mikhalkov, the Oscar-winning Russian director of the  
festival's opening film, used his platform Wednesday to castigate 
NATO and especially the United States over the airstrikes on 
Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NATO action is a tragic, tragic error,'' Mikhalkov,  
director of ``The Barber of Siberia,'' told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	War, he added, is not a video game, describing NATO pilots  
pushing buttons -- like a game -- as they fired their missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``After 10 seconds, the plane goes back to its base,'' Mikhalkov  
said. ``The missiles are still falling. What happens on the ground, 
the pilot doesn't know. Maybe the bomb has hit the Chinese 
Embassy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of those giving orders, he added, ``don't know what they're  
fighting for -- they don't know the difference between a Serb, a 
Croat and a Kosovar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mikhalkov, 53, considered a Russian nationalist, won an Oscar  
for best foreign-language film in 1995 with ``Burnt By the Sun,'' a 
story of Stalinist repression told through one family's 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
	The son of the author of the Soviet anthem, Mikhalkov was a  
successful director in Soviet times and managed to maintain his 
popularity after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet regime. 
</P>
<P>
	He is known for his fierce patriotism, and has often said  
post-Soviet Russia lacks a ``national idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mikhalkov spent 10 years making ``The Barber of Siberia.'' The  
film, being shown out of competition, is a lavish period drama in 
which the director himself plays Czar Alexander III. 
</P>
<P>
	Starring British actress Julia Ormond and Russian star Oleg  
Menshikov, it premiered in February at the Kremlin to an audience 
of 5,000 that included starlets, Cabinet ministers and tycoons. 
</P>
<P>
	It recounts a romance between a Russian cadet and an American  
woman who comes to Russia on behalf of an entrepreneur who wants to 
develop a logging device for Siberia. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, director Mikhalkov chided a journalist who  
suggested that the film's first half, which is lighthearted, was 
less realistic in portraying Russia than its second half, which 
veers into tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are a victim of your impression of life in Russia,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Movie Mogul Defends Hollywood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Entertainment mogul Edgar Bronfman Jr. said  
today that Hollywood is too easy a target for politicians feeling 
pressured to assign blame for the Colorado school shootings and 
other violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that the American people who really look to  
their government for leadership instead get finger-pointing and 
chest-pounding,'' he said. As CEO of Seagram, Universal Studios' 
parent company, Bronfman oversees an empire that includes movies, 
music and theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Violence ``is not an entertainment problem,'' he said. ``It's a  
societal problem and I believe the government would be well-served 
to deal with it as a societal problem rather than create a quick 
fix that may be popular but ultimately is a disservice to their 
constituents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, President Clinton and 60 educators, federal officials  
and entertainers gathered in Washington to brainstorm ways to 
reduce youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, plans to propose a federal  
investigation into whether Hollywood markets specifically markets 
violent images and products to youths.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Considers China WTO Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- When Nora Yeung's foreign customers sought to  
eliminate her Hong Kong-based trading company as the middleman for 
purchasing gifts and stationery from mainland Chinese 
manufacturers, she started to worry. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't take her clients long, however, to realize how much  
easier it was to buy their products through her company, Planet 
Earth Inc., instead of doing it on their own in China. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of the day, they all came back and didn't actually  
do business with those companies,'' Yeung said. ``It's the trust 
factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The difficulties that confront foreign companies in China have  
helped many traders in Hong Kong make their fortunes, but the cash 
is not pouring in like it used to. Some worry the flow could ebb 
even more with China's anticipated entry to the World Trade 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	That may not happen anytime soon. NATO's bombing of the Chinese  
Embassy in Yugoslavia resulted in angry protests and has strained 
U.S.-Chinese relations. That could make it difficult for China's 
leaders to make new and unpopular market-opening pledges to gain 
entry to the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	The day China does enter the organization, Hong Kong will  
certainly take some blows as some foreign companies bypass this 
expensive trading center and cut their deals in China on their own, 
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	For China, WTO membership would give it the chance to boost  
exports, but would also pry open its markets to foreign 
competition. Hong Kong could see its traders lose some business to 
China, even though they also likely would benefit in the long run 
by having a much bigger market to pursue on the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the short-term losers could be Hong Kong's crucial import  
and export trade, which employs 14 percent of the work force. The 
bulk of that business is re-exports, in which goods are imported 
and then re-exported to other countries, sometimes with 
improvements made here such as packaging. 
</P>
<P>
	Re-export trade with China accounts for 94 percent of the $148  
billion in goods that pass through Hong Kong each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Stationery dealer Yeung, for example, imports products from  
China and sends them directly to Hong Kong's ports, which offer 
more flexible schedules and often cheaper rates to the United 
States than Chinese ports. 
</P>
<P>
	The value of Chinese goods re-exported through Hong Kong, which  
has already been falling -- down 12.4 percent in March compared with 
March 1998 -- could slip even more. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the territory of 6.8 million people is more likely  
to benefit from the trickle-down effect of an overall increase in 
business between China and foreign partners. 
</P>
<P>
	China's external trade could double to $600 billion within 5  
years of joining WTO, estimates Fred Hu, an economist who follows 
China for investment bank Goldman Sachs Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Hong Kong gets a slice of that,'' he said, ``Hong Kong will  
stand to gain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until the WTO talks wrap up, estimates for Hong Kong's potential  
gains are hard to make, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite some shifts to China, many companies maintain Hong Kong  
as a base where they can also get top quality financial and legal 
services, said Bill Galvin, Hong Kong-based director of Kurt Salmon 
Associates Inc., which advises consumer firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the WTO agreement secures greater access to China's  
financial sector, Hong Kong banks won't lose clients to Chinese 
banks, said Robin Hammond, regional banking analyst for Paribas 
Asia Equity Ltd. Instead, Hammond predicts the local banks will 
instead find more opportunities in China. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a long process to get the Chinese banks up to Western  
standards,'' Hammond said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, as Chinese companies become more savvy, some old Hong  
Kong trading companies are expanding into consulting and other 
services to stay one step ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hong Kong is not just a middleman,'' asserted Edward Leung,  
chief economist for the Trade Development Council. ``Hong Kong 
provides a one-stop shop of supporting services and will not be 
easily replaced by any city in China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And until Chinese companies can prove they're up to par, foreign  
companies will still need Hong Kong, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of foreigners are still reluctant to go into China,''  
Yeung said. ``They might visit a factory once, but they'd rather 
pay you to do it.''

<HEADLINE> N.J. Town Nixes Springsteen Statue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREEHOLD, N.J. (AP) -- Plans for a statue of The Boss are off in  
his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in Freehold nixed the Bruce Springsteen statue because  
of its escalating cost. The original estimate was just over 
$150,000, said Councilwoman Sharon Shutzer. 
</P>
<P>
	``But now we're finding out that it'll be closer to $200,000 to  
get it done,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	That kind of money could be better spent elsewhere in the  
municipal budget, Shutzer said Monday. Mayor Michael Wilson, who 
originally suggested the sculpture, said public support for the 
plan wasn't that strong to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
	Springsteen, who sang of Freehold as a fading town of  
``whitewashed windows and vacant stores'' in ``My Hometown,'' is 
currently on a world tour with the E Street Band. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither his publicist, Seth Cohen, nor his manager, Jon Landau,  
would comment Tuesday on the town's change of heart.

<HEADLINE> Pro Sports Becoming Flea Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Don't look now, but the world of sports is turning into one big  
flea market, where just about anything is liable to be for sale at 
any given moment. 
</P>
<P>
	Want a franchise? There are plenty around. Want a stadium? Those  
are available, too. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a dizzying scramble of owners buying, selling or moving  
teams almost daily. 
</P>
<P>
	Start with the bankrupt Pittsburgh Penguins, swimming through a  
sea of bookkeeping red ink but doing very well, thank you, in the 
second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins could win the Stanley Cup and have no place to  
display it because they may be moving out of town. Seattle 
billionaire Paul Allen, who also owns the NFL's Seattle Seahawks 
and NBA's Portland Trail Blazers reportedly is interested in buying 
the team for $85 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Want to buy an NHL team and move it? Hey, no problem. In this  
decade, Hartford went to Carolina, Quebec to Colorado, Winnipeg to 
Phoenix and Minnesota to Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Want to buy a NHL team and forget about it? That's happened,  
too. The New York Islanders were sold a year ago to a group that 
included Howard Milstein, who then proceeded to ignore them and 
throw all his energy into trying to buy the NFL Washington 
Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	That deal fell through because the package contained too much  
debt and not enough equity to suit NFL owners. They're set instead 
to approve the $800 million sale later this month to a group headed 
by Daniel Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Abe Pollin said he was selling the NHL's  
Washington Capitals and his minority interests in the NBA's 
Washington Wizards and the MCI Center to America Online executive 
Ted Leonsis. The 75-year-old Pollin said he decided to sell after 
his sons told him they had no interest in taking over his business. 
</P>
<P>
	Across town in the nation's capital, D.C. United of Major League  
Soccer is also on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	That means the most stable franchise in Washington right now is  
the WNBA's Mystics, who have been in existence only one year. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost as soon as Milstein and his partners bought the  
Islanders, their opening marketing ploy was to declare the Nassau 
Coliseum a dump and abandon the building until repairs were made. 
That issue remains in litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Over in New Jersey, they're planning a new sports complex for  
the Meadowlands. There's some question, though, who will be playing 
there. The NBA Nets have decided their future will be in Newark, 
and the NHL Devils want to move to Hoboken. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartford, which lost its hockey team to Carolina, thought it had  
a replacement franchise when it lured the NFL New England Patriots 
with a sweetheart stadium deal late last year. That went up in 
smoke last month with the Pats deciding to stay in Massachusetts in 
a new stadium that hopefully will afford better access to 
one-lane-in, one-lane-out Foxboro. 
</P>
<P>
	With the death last week of New York Jets owner Leon Hess, that  
franchise is likely to be on the market. Hess made it clear that he 
didn't want to burden his heirs with running a football team, 
perhaps after watching the legal tug-of-war going on in San 
Francisco between Ed DeBartolo and his sister, Denise. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the NFL has committed to placing its 32nd franchise  
in Los Angeles on the site of the old Coliseum, but don't ask more 
than that. An ownership group is to be selected by Sept. 15 with 
Houston still in the wings, hoping a resolution is not found and 
the franchise winds up in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball hasn't had a franchise move since 1971,  
when the Senators left Washington -- that town again -- for Texas. 
But that track record may change soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal keeps developing players for other franchises while  
operating on a shoestring, waiting for a new stadium and settlement 
of ownership issues.

	A group of owners led by team chairman Jacques Menard is trying  
to buy out shares in the team controlled by general partner Claude 
Brochu and attempting to restart a stalled stadium project, which 
is seen as essential to keeping the Expos in Montreal.

	The future is cloudy as well for the Minnesota Twins and perhaps

	``The bottom line is that except for a handful of people, sports

	``The financial stakes have become so high with cities willing  
to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to lure teams or keep them 
that it's hard not to shop it around. Even if a team stays, it gets 
a better deal,'' he said. ``It's worth $100 million at least to 
just create the illusion that you're mobile.''

	The ever increasing payrolls may also have taken the  
profitability out of it for some owners.

trying to compete with big bucks clubs, and they staged a protest 
last week when the New York Yankees came to town.

<P>
	They waved dollar bills at the players and turned their backs on  
the action, leaving the visiting millionaires a bit befuddled but 
nevertheless amused.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Close Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks rose Wednesday on an overnight rise  
on Wall Street and investment in companies that have recently made 
bullish announcements. The U.S. dollar was lower against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 204.18  
points, or 1.22 percent, to finish the day at 16,947.36. On 
Tuesday, the average closed down 233.83 points, or 1.38 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.86 yen, down 0.02 yen from late Tuesday in  
Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 120.97 yen 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices bounced back, following  
Tuesday's gains in New York, where the Dow Jones industrial average 
jumped 18.90 to 11,026.15, just shy of its record high close of 
11,031.59 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in a number of technology companies, including Sony,  
Softbank and long-distance telephone carrier DDI, posted strong 
gains following a rise in their counterparts in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was supported by remarks from Okiharu Yasuoka, a  
member of the ruling Liberal Democrats, suggesting that the party 
would consider an extra budget. 
</P>
<P>
	But the government's continued vagueness on additional economic  
stimulus measures kept many investors on the sidelines and directed 
buyers toward companies that have been the focus of upbeat news. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Nintendo Co. and Matsushita Electric Industries Ltd.  
rose sharply on reports they will tie up to develop advanced game 
consoles. 
</P>
<P>
	Takeda Chemical Industries shares jumped after it said it would  
market a new drug to treat AIDS, and Taisho Pharmaceuticals posted 
hefty gains on news it will sell a U.S.-developed hair-growth 
stimulant in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei average moved as high as 17,104.49 during the  
morning, but profit-taking by domestic investors in the afternoon 
knocked the market off its early highs. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 5.33 points, or 0.39 percent, to 1,361.15. The 
TOPIX closed down 18.04 points, or 1.31 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 648.77 million shares, down from 727.60 million shares 
Tuesday. Advancing issues outnumbered retreaters 740 to 478, while 
105 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar slipped as selling of the  
greenback by Japanese exporters offset buying by Japanese 
institutional investors amid an absence of market-moving news. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dollar/yen rate has mostly been determined by Japanese  
investors and exporters recently,'' said Hirokazu Note, assistant 
general manager of foreign exchange at Sumitomo Bank. ``But they 
mostly balance each other out, leaving the dollar range-bound 
between 119.50 yen and 121.50 yen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yasuoka's comments on plans for an extra budget failed to boost  
the yen as traders awaited more concrete proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 120.60 yen and 121.10 yen in  
Wednesday's trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro remained under pressure due to continued unrest in  
Kosovo. It was quoted at 129.15 yen in morning trading, down from 
130.90 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 212 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.340 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.355 percent, 
driving its price up to 101.42 yen from 101.28 yen.

<HEADLINE> Willey Knows Man Who Scared Her </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kathleen Willey says she knows the identity of  
a man who allegedly threatened her and that prosecutor Kenneth 
Starr's office is investigating the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing Tuesday night on CNBC's ``Hardball'' program, Mrs.  
Willey told interviewer Chris Matthews that Starr's office had 
asked her not to reveal the identity of the man who she says 
approached her two days before she testified against President 
Clinton in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are investigating this,'' Mrs. Willey said of Starr's  
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week at the trial of one-time friend Julie Hiatt Steele,  
Mrs. Willey said she had been frightened by an encounter in January 
1998 with a stranger who knew that her cat was missing and her car 
tires had been slashed. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey said that when she asked the man how he knew these  
things, he made a comment leading her to believe he was referring 
to her imminent testimony about the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was meant to scare me,'' Mrs. Willey said of the man's  
approach. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after the incident, Mrs. Willey testified about  
Clinton's allegedly unwanted sexual advance in the Oval Office.

<HEADLINE> Food Maker To Cut 7,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Foods giant ConAgra Inc. said today it will  
cut 7,000 jobs and close at least 15 production plants to reduce 
expenses and concentrate on selling its major food brands and other 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, whose brands include Healthy Choice, La Choy and  
Butterball, also will close at least 70 storage, distribution and 
smaller processing facilities and shed about 20 small non-core 
businesses. Specific plant and business closings will not be 
identified until employees are notified, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling the restructuring plan ``Operation Overdrive,'' the  
company wants its 80 independent operating companies to work more 
closely together, sharing sales tasks and buying products from each 
other, said spokeswoman Lynn Phares. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also wants to meet its longstanding goal of annual  
14 percent per share revenue growth. Last year, per share revenue 
grew 1.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the job cuts, including about 4,000 to be announced by  
May 30, will take place in the next few months, with others coming 
more than a year away, Ms. Phares said. The majority of workers 
probably will be laid off, she said, though some could find new 
jobs within the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves will mean a pretax charge of $810 million over three  
years, starting with $420 million in fiscal year 1999's fourth 
quarter ending May 30, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a couple years since they had much growth,'' said  
analyst David Nelson of CS First Boston. ``I think these are moves 
they're taking to maintain the growth they've had in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ConAgra, which owns businesses ranging from flour milling to  
frozen foods, said it wants to focus on more efficiently selling 
all its products, including beef and prepared foods to restaurants 
and its branded foods in grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fair to say this is a company wide effort,'' Ms. Phares  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also will invest about $200 million and create new  
jobs over the next two years to get full value from its 
consolidation, said Bruce Rohde, chairman and chief executive 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Phares said the effort announced Wednesday is broader than a  
1996 restructuring that eliminated 6,300 jobs and overhauled 29 
plants, because it involves the way ConAgra's businesses work 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	Based in Omaha, ConAgra employs 83,000 people at about 250  
production plants and 1,150 total locations. Its net income last 
year was $613.2 million, compared with $615 million the year 
before.

<HEADLINE> Mob, Stock Boost Trial Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The chairman of an Arizona company who was  
accused of paying mob-linked stock promoters to boost his company's 
stock was convicted of racketeering Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury verdict in U.S. District Court in Manhattan came four  
months after four reputed mobsters pleaded guilty to charges in the 
case, the largest prosecution ever to involve members of organized 
crime manipulating the stock market. Ten other people also had 
pleaded guilty. Four await trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's verdict came against Gordon Hall, the 45-year-old  
chairman and chief executive officer of HealthTech International 
Inc., a Mesa, Ariz., operator of health and fitness centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Also convicted was Michael Motsykulashvili, who helped run two  
branch offices of Meyers Pollock &AMP; Robbins Inc., a brokerage firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no comment. Have a nice day,'' Hall said politely as he  
stood outside court after the verdict was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall was accused of arranging to pay off stock promoters who  
then bribed stockbrokers to drive up the value of his company's 
stock by aggressively promoting it to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	James McGuire, Hall's lawyer, had told the jury his client was  
victimized by mob-tainted promoters he met in December 1996. 
McGuire said the promoters never told Hall they had mob ties when 
he signed a consulting agreement with them. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors relied in part on the results of court-ordered tape  
recordings of conversations between Hall and the stock promoters. 
</P>
<P>
	A key prosecution witness in the case was Irwin Norman  
Schneider, a disbarred securities lawyer who testified that he and 
Eugene Lombardo, a Bonanno organized crime family associate, paid 
off brokers to boost the value of HealthTech. 
</P>
<P>
	Schneider, who pleaded guilty in March to conspiring to violate  
securities laws, had suggested that sometimes the line between 
legitimate compensation for promotional services by a brokerage and 
the payment of bribes was blurry, noting: ``Some were perfectly 
proper. Others were not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lombardo pleaded guilty in January along with three others with  
alleged mob connections. 
</P>
<P>
	Lombardo said during his plea that the mob tried to extend its  
influence over Wall Street by inserting its own people as brokers 
at Meyers Pollock. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had even threatened to use force to remove a Meyers  
Pollock employee who was preventing people backed by the mob from 
being hired.

<HEADLINE> Two Trainers Barred for Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREEHOLD, N.J. (AP) -- The leading trainer at Freehold Raceway  
and a trainer he allegedly employed were suspended for the rest of 
the year by the track's judges on Wednesday for conduct detrimental 
to harness racing. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Krajczewski, 33, of Hopatcong, and Carl Rafanelli, 34, of  
Brick, were cited for conspiracy, fraud and other violations. A 
judge fined them $500 apiece and placed them on probation for next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The trainers were cited for violations in two races, including  
one on March 10 that led the suspension of George Brennan, the 
nation's leading driver at the time, and two other drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	In an action independent of the judges, Krajczewski and  
Rafanelli were also barred indefinitely from Freehold Raceway and 
Garden State Park in Cherry Hill by Richard Orbann, the president 
of both private tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that such measures have to be taken, but we  
are intent on fulfilling our obligation to protect our fans and the 
integrity of our sport. We will not tolerate any form of wrongdoing 
ever,'' Orbann said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Krajczewski, who leads the current trainers' standings with 32  
winners, was employing Rafanelli when the two twice had horses in 
the same race, according to the judges' ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	In the third race of March 10, each entered horses as separate  
wagering entities, even though they should have been coupled 
because of Krajczewski's and Rafanelli's employer-employee 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Krajczewski's horse, My Dream Come True, finished last.  
Rafanelli's The Shawnster was second. 
</P>
<P>
	The March 10 race is the same one that led to the exclusion and  
suspensions of Brennan, James Morrill Jr. and Howard Parker for 
unsatisfactory drives. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan, who drove My Dream Come True, has maintained he did  
nothing wrong in the race, adding he was only following 
instructions given by Krajczewski. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation found questionable betting in the race. A  
chauffeur for Parker won $24,000 in exacta and trifecta wagers, 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Krajczewski and Rafanelli raced the same two horses as separate  
entities on Feb. 26.

<HEADLINE> IBM Claims Disk Storage Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARMONK, N.Y. (AP) -- IBM Corp. announced today that it set a  
computer disk-drive storage record by packing 20 billion bits of 
data into a square inch, more than three times that of any disk 
drive shipping today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Armonk-based company said the advances came from researchers  
at its Almaden Research Center in San Jose, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The new level of density means every square inch of disk space  
could hold 2.5 gigabytes, equivalent to two TV-quality movies or 
the text of some 2,500 average-sized novels. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM said increasing data density could lead to disk drives that  
are lighter and consume less energy. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's previous record storage level was 10 billion bits per  
square inch, announced in December of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Ex-1st Lady Seeks GOP Women Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) --Former first lady Barbara Bush says Republican  
women need to get out there and take the helm in statehouses, 
congressional delegations and governorships across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although please don't set your sights on Texas and Florida,''  
Mrs. Bush quipped Tuesday night at a dinner for the Republican 
Women Leaders Forum. ``They are doing just fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wife of former President George Bush helped rouse the crowd  
of nearly 1,100 Republican women and asked them to carry the 
party's torch in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is plain to see this movement is off and running, but a lot  
more work lies ahead,'' she said, giving her address in the Ronald 
Reagan International Trade Center. She praised the group for their 
efforts to reach out to more women, insisting that the GOP should 
be the party of inclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes a lot of sense to me to make our party the party of  
inclusion. There's room under the Republican umbrella for 
differences,'' Mrs. Bush said to the audience of women, at least a 
few of whom sported red buttons reading ``Elizabeth Dole for 
President in 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bush only touched on election politics to say she hoped  
candidates in the upcoming race would refrain from demeaning 
personal attacks and urged them to observe the 11th commandment: 
``Thou shalt not speak ill of another Republican.'' Her son, Texas 
Gov. George W. Bush, is expected to seek the 2000 GOP presidential 
nomination. His brother, Jeb Bush, is Florida's governor. 
</P>
<P>
	But the former first lady did manage to get in a few good  
zingers aimed at one Republican -- her husband. The Bushes were in 
town not too long ago when the sprawling campus of the CIA was 
renamed as the George Bush Center for Intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bush called the dedication a little bewildering, as she  
wondered why an agency devoted to intelligence would name itself 
``after a 74-year-old man who wants to celebrate his 75th birthday 
by jumping out of another perfectly good plane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has said he plans the June skydive as an encore to his  
March 25, 1997, jump near Yuma, Ariz.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Say Bush Is AWOL in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush is so busy  
running for president he's not paying enough attention to his state 
duties, the Democratic Party charged Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so, Bush and his aides said, although the Republican  
governor and presidential prospect acknowledged that one of his top 
priorities in the Legislature -- taxpayer-funded private school 
tuition for some children -- is in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic National Committee cited a Houston Chronicle  
review of Bush's office calendars. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper reported that those records showed the Republican  
governor has had about half the personal involvement in this 
legislative session than he did during the last one, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although Bush has stayed in Texas, his mind and priorities are  
focused on New Hampshire and Iowa,'' the Democrats said in a 
statement issued in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, GOP front-runner in several presidential polls, has  
pledged to remain in Texas until the legislative session ends May 
31. Campaign trips to Iowa and New Hampshire are tentatively set 
for mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes accused national Democrats of  
trying to inject partisanship into Texas lawmaking. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people of Texas are counting on their legislators to work  
in a spirit of cooperation to cut taxes and fund improvements to 
our public schools,'' Ms. Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Bush has spent considerable time meeting with lawmakers  
in their offices. ``Official entries on his calendar don't always 
tell how much time he has spent with legislators,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, meanwhile, said that except for vouchers, he remains  
highly optimistic about the fate of his legislative program. That 
includes a property tax cut, lowering the minimum alcohol level for 
drunken driving, limiting Y2K-related lawsuits and requiring 
automatic detention for juveniles caught illegally carrying 
firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the issues I campaigned on came out of the Senate, and  
there will be a moment of reconciliation (with the House),'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the Republican-controlled state Senate nor the  
Democratic-controlled House has approved a voucher bill. In the 
Senate, voucher opponents claim to have enough votes to keep the 
bill from being debated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm an optimistic, cheery fellow, but...'' Bush said. ``I  
think there's still a chance that vouchers may have some life in 
the Senate, but I'm not nearly as hopeful about that particular 
issue as I would have been at the beginning of the session.''

<HEADLINE>  Star Wars Tickets Available </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- For Javier Sanchez, it was fate as much as  
the Force that led him to the long line of devotees camping outside 
Mann's Chinese Theatre to get tickets to ``Star Wars: Episode I -- 
The Phantom Menace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A week ago, the 15-year-old high school student and longtime  
``Star Wars'' enthusiast happened to see the cluster of fans 
outside the famous movie house. 
</P>
<P>
	``I decided I wanted to be out here with them,'' said Sanchez,  
whose love of the films began at age 9 when he saw ``Return of the 
Jedi.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanchez and others are getting their chance to buy tickets today  
when advance sales for ``Phantom Menace'' begin at 3 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phantom Menace'' doesn't open until May 19. But some fans have  
been camping outside Southern California theaters for weeks to 
ensure they're among the first to see the long-awaited prequel to 
George Lucas' ``Star Wars'' trilogy. This morning, the line was a 
block long. 
</P>
<P>
	People also were in line today at theaters around the country.  
</P>
<P>
	The film picks up the ``Star Wars'' fable a generation before  
hero Luke Skywalker comes of age, tracing how his father Anakin 
Skywalker becomes the evil, black-masked Darth Vader, who later 
leads Empire forces against the Rebels in a battle for galactic 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	As sale time neared, theater operators and independent ticket  
sellers were gearing up for an expected onslaught of thousands of 
fans seeking tickets at theater box offices, over the Internet and 
by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	MovieFone, which sells tickets over the telephone and Internet,  
boosted its Web capacity to enable 10 times more people than usual 
to use its site, and increased its phone capacity by 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this case, everyone's going to start coming after tickets  
at the same point in time,'' said Andrew Jarecki, the company's 
chief executive. ``That presents a challenge to us, but it's one we 
think we can handle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Loews, Mann Theatres and Edwards Cinemas were among the theater  
operators planning to sell in advance by telephone or at the box 
office at most theaters. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Star Wars Tickets Available </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- For Javier Sanchez, it was fate as much as  
the Force that led him to the long line of devotees camping outside 
Mann's Chinese Theatre to get tickets to ``Star Wars: Episode I -- 
The Phantom Menace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A week ago, the 15-year-old high school student and longtime  
``Star Wars'' enthusiast happened to see the cluster of fans 
outside the famous movie house. 
</P>
<P>
	``I decided I wanted to be out here with them,'' said Sanchez,  
whose love of the films began at age 9 when he saw ``Return of the 
Jedi.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanchez and others are getting their chance to buy tickets today  
when advance sales for ``Phantom Menace'' begin at 3 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phantom Menace'' doesn't open until May 19. But some fans have  
been camping outside Southern California theaters for weeks to 
ensure they're among the first to see the long-awaited prequel to 
George Lucas' ``Star Wars'' trilogy. This morning, the line was a 
block long. 
</P>
<P>
	People also were in line today at theaters around the country.  
</P>
<P>
	The film picks up the ``Star Wars'' fable a generation before  
hero Luke Skywalker comes of age, tracing how his father Anakin 
Skywalker becomes the evil, black-masked Darth Vader, who later 
leads Empire forces against the Rebels in a battle for galactic 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	As sale time neared, theater operators and independent ticket  
sellers were gearing up for an expected onslaught of thousands of 
fans seeking tickets at theater box offices, over the Internet and 
by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	MovieFone, which sells tickets over the telephone and Internet,  
boosted its Web capacity to enable 10 times more people than usual 
to use its site, and increased its phone capacity by 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this case, everyone's going to start coming after tickets  
at the same point in time,'' said Andrew Jarecki, the company's 
chief executive. ``That presents a challenge to us, but it's one we 
think we can handle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Loews, Mann Theatres and Edwards Cinemas were among the theater  
operators planning to sell in advance by telephone or at the box 
office at most theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	But Columbus, Ga.-based Carmike Cinemas Inc., elected to stick  
with its policy of not selling tickets in advance and even had to 
shoo away one fan who set up camp outside a theater. The chain has 
theaters in 36 states.

<HEADLINE> Unions Have Little Say in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- By the time Tang Sin-hing joined the union, he  
had driven loaded container trucks an average 17 hours a day, six 
days a week all over Hong Kong for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	With 25 deliveries each week, it was hard for Tang to find time  
to spend with his unemployed wife and two daughters. But driving 
was his passion and he wanted to stay on -- even if relations with 
his bosses were beginning to chafe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to talk to them about the long hours and a salary  
increase,'' said Tang. ``But they didn't take me seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the company tried to cut workers' pay 37 percent, Tang and  
about 40 other drivers formed a union. They negotiated with 
management for shorter working hours, medical benefits, and holiday 
allowances. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tang found out that being in a union can carry a price in  
Hong Kong, and he soon lost his job. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the company's word was final. Tang came away  
thinking that Hong Kong labor laws offer little to unionists, a 
lesson more people are learning amid the territory's long and deep 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the law here, employees can organize into unions, but they  
have no collective bargaining rights. In other words, unions can 
operate, but management can choose to ignore them. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't want to put up with it, you can always get out,''  
Tang said. ``But the management will always get someone cheaper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tang claimed he was fired to weaken the union, but his former  
employer, Orient Overseas Container Co., said that ``over an 
extended period of time he did not meet basic performance 
criteria.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike countries such as South Korea or the Philippines, known  
for their active and influential trade unions, Hong Kong's 
hyperactive economy for decades kept jobs abundant and unions 
docile. 
</P>
<P>
	But as companies cut back on salaries to maintain profitability  
in the fallout from Asia's economic crisis, more workers are 
turning to Hong Kong's 538 unions for help. In the past two years, 
more than 23,500 people have joined unions, which now claim 22 
percent of Hong Kong's 2.95 million workers as members. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven new unions have formed in the last six months and applied  
for membership in the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions, an 
umbrella group representing 140,000 workers, says Lee Cheuk-yan, 
legislator and secretary-general of the confederation. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee has repeatedly called for legislation to establish  
collective bargaining rights and prevent discrimination against 
union members, saying it is a ``common misconception'' that union 
demands for concessions inevitably will deaden Hong Kong's 
enterprising spirit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Businesses close because of bad management and not collective  
bargaining,'' says Lee, sitting in an office adorned with such 
social-activism posters as ``Poverty is Wrong'' and ``Demand Women 
Workers' Rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's labor laws came under scrutiny when Cathay Pacific  
Airways recently ignored a flight attendants' union and negotiated 
directly with individual cabin crew members to make them fly longer 
hours in exchange for pay increases. 
</P>
<P>
	The union cried foul, but Cathay pointed out that trade unions  
here have no right to collective bargaining when managers seek 
concessions from employees. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar fate could loom over Cathay's pilots and flight  
engineers, who have until May 31 to agree to a deal that includes 
an average 8 percent pay cut in exchange for stock options. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots won't comment publicly on their dealings with  
management, but flight attendants who just lost their own battle 
say the outlook isn't good. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forget the good times, a strike now would be unrealistic,''  
says Tess Lim, a Cathay Pacific flight attendant and active union 
member for 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
	K.W. Tsang, the assistant commissioner of labor, disputes  
suggestions that labor laws were designed to protect the interests 
of management, saying ``voluntary and direct negotiation is firmly 
in place and working well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along with more innovative management techniques that foster  
``congeniality'' in the workplace, employers are now investing 
money on their employees by providing long-term training programs 
and seminars, says Eden Woon, director of Hong Kong's General 
Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the way society is going,'' says Woon.  
</P>
<P>
	The lack of union activism may stem from a corporate culture  
that traditionally encouraged job switching rather than 
confrontation with management, says Won Hong, a lecturer on labor 
issues and social work at the City University of Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	About 94 percent of businesses hire fewer than 20 people, and  
``many are run like family businesses, where workers and employers 
take a cooperative attitude toward profitability,'' says Hong.

<HEADLINE> Brain Shocks Trigger Depression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Accidental electrical stimulation of the brain  
during medical treatment can trigger bouts of deep depression that 
come and go almost instantly. 
</P>
<P>
	French doctors made the discovery while treating a woman with  
Parkinson's disease. They implanted electrodes deep in her brain in 
an attempt to stimulate the parts that malfunction in her disease. 
</P>
<P>
	To their surprise, they found that turning on one of these  
electrodes made the woman profoundly sad. She leaned to the right, 
started to cry and told of feeling of sad, guilty and useless. 
</P>
<P>
	``I no longer wish to live, to see anything, hear anything, feel  
anything,'' she told doctors. Asked if she felt pain, she replied, 
``No, I'm fed up with life. I've had enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ninety seconds after the doctors stopped the electrical  
stimulation, the woman's depression disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	Stimulating another electrode implanted nearby dramatically  
relieved the woman's Parkinson's disease, enabling her to give up 
taking her medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Intrigued by their chance discovery, the doctors asked if they  
could repeat their stimulation of the depression electrode while 
they videotaped her. The woman agreed, and twice more they 
triggered profound sadness. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Boulos-Paul Bejjani and others from INSERM, the French  
research organization, published a report on the case in Thursday's 
New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Stuart C. Yudofsky of Baylor  
College of Medicine in Houston wrote that the report ``raises 
fundamental and far-reaching questions about depression'' and the 
use of electrical treatments. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
	--Is depression hard-wired into the brain?  
</P>
<P>
	-Does depression carry some evolutionary advantage, such as  
intensifying grief in a way that helps hold families together? 
</P>
<P>
	--Can brain stimulation also trigger symtoms of mania, and would  
this be a possible treatment for depression? 
</P>
<P>
	--Could stimulation of other parts of the brain treat such  
disorders as alcoholism, drug abuse, aggression and violence?

<HEADLINE> Pentagon To Beef Up Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Call it a sign of the times. The Pentagon  
plans to build a bunker where every unclassified package -- from 
paper towels to computer equipment -- will go through a security 
check before entering the Defense Department headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense officials cite the risk of terrorism as the chief reason  
for ever-stricter security in general, and for building the $60 
million package screening center in particular. 
</P>
<P>
	The building is a scheduled part of a decade-long, $1.2 billion  
Pentagon renovation and has nothing to do with the current air 
campaign in Yugoslavia, Pentagon spokesman Glenn Flood said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A major part of the renovation is to enhance the security  
posture of the building,'' Flood said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like just about everything at the Pentagon, the new building has  
an acronym. It's RDF, for Remote Delivery Facility. The idea is to 
screen ordinary packages with metal detectors, X-ray machines or 
bomb-sniffing dogs in a separate building several hundred yards 
from the Pentagon itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Classified or other sensitive material typically arrives by  
special courier or inside someone's briefcase, and will not be 
screened at the new center, Flood said. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, mail already is screened by the Post Office, and  
sometimes by Pentagon experts, and will not pass through the new 
delivery center. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department and a few other government agencies have  
similar delivery centers, and the Pentagon is already using a 
warehouse some blocks away for much the same purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	The new center will be much more high-tech, and will centralize  
delivery of about 1,200 truckloads of material bound for the 
Pentagon each week. 
</P>
<P>
	Trucks will drive into bays in the low-slung, V-shaped building,  
where the loads will be inspected for explosives or anything else a 
terrorist or smuggler might try to sneak in. From there, trucks 
will head to traditional delivery bays. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction begins next week on the 250,000-square-foot  
building, which will occupy what is now a coveted parking lot. The 
new center is scheduled to open in the summer of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	No terrorist has yet tried to breach the Pentagon's current  
delivery bays, nor has smuggling been a problem, Flood said. But 
awareness of the vulnerability of public buildings, especially to 
car bombs, increased dramatically after the World Trade Center 
bombing in 1993 and the Oklahoma City federal building bombing two 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
	After Oklahoma City, federal buildings were increasingly ringed  
by concrete flower planters that double as automobile barriers, and 
Pennsylvania Avenue closed down in front of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite new barriers and increased restrictions on visitors in  
recent years, Flood said the Pentagon is trying to remain as open 
as possible. Public tours still pass through the hallways, and 
those with legitimate business can usually get inside without too 
many hassles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to remain as open as we can for as long as we  
can,'' Flood said.

<HEADLINE>  Williams Talks About Star Wars Score </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) -- From a modest bungalow in a movie  
studio compound have emerged some of the most stirring sounds in 
motion pictures: the shark attack of ``Jaws,'' the victory march of 
``Star Wars,'' the chase music of ``Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' the 
bicycling-over-the-moon melody of ``E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And now -- ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.''  
</P>
<P>
	This is the workshop of Hollywood thememeister John Williams,  
tucked away in the Universal Studios compound of the Amblin 
Entertainment and DreamWorks headquarters of Steven Spielberg, for 
whom Williams has scored 16 movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams has amassed an astonishing record: 37 Academy Award  
nominations and five Oscars; 12 Grammys; scores for seven of the 10 
top moneymaking movies; album sales in the millions. 
</P>
<P>
	Some conductors have reputations for being brusque if not  
bombastic. Not Williams. With round face, friendly eyes and neat 
goatee, he is a courtly man who welcomed a reporter and 
photographer into his office, three times thanking them for coming. 
</P>
<P>
	The room is about the size of a tract-house living room, the  
major elements being a grand piano and, next to it, an architect's 
drawing board on which Williams writes his scores. 
</P>
<P>
	He was asked about ``The Phantom Menace,'' which takes place  
years before the earlier ``Star Wars'' trilogy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know the word 'prequel,''' Williams admitted. ``It  
may be a word George (Lucas) invented. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was interesting to me, because it triggered a few unique  
things of construction, in the following way: There is in this film 
120 minutes of music -- two hours of music! I would say 
conservatively that 90 percent of it is new. The remaining 10 
percent are 'quotes' from earlier themes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first minute and a half has the 'Star Wars' theme. In the  
middle there are quotes, very brief, of Darth Vader's theme, Yoda's 
theme, Princess Leia or whatever, when there are hints of what they 
will become as the prequel advances. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the 90 percent that is new comes to something like this: I  
was able to take some of the old themes and 'de-compose' them -- 
take them apart and write them, in a sense, backward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He cited the theme of Anakin, the little boy who becomes Darth  
Vader. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the kind of theme you would have for a young boy, very  
innocent, lyrical and idealistic. But it's made up of intervals 
from Darth Vader's Imperial March. Which we know -- 
be-bom-bom-BOM-bom-bom -- an archetypical evil expression. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made Anakin's theme out of those intervals by inverting them  
or rearranging them rhythmically or accompanying them harmonically 
in a different way. It sounds familiar, very sweet. But if you 
listen to it carefully, there's a hint (of evil).'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he recorded the theme with the London Symphony Orchestra,  
younger musicians who were familiar with ``Star Wars'' told him: 
``I know what that is; you can't fool me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, 66, found that interweaving snippets of previous  
themes with a new score was a unique experience and ``fun to do.'' 
His approach followed its usual pattern: He looks at the film in a 
nearly completed state, except for the special effects. Having 
spent his early Hollywood years writing scores for TV shows and B 
movies, he is accustomed to stringent deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first I saw 'The Phantom Menace' was Oct. 1, 1998,'' he  
recalled. ``I began to write the score in the middle of October, 
and we recorded it in the middle of February. The film opens May 
19. So it gave me three months plus to write two hours of music for 
orchestra. Very difficult, just in logistic terms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the creative process, Williams looked at the rough cut  
every day, chose a scene to score, sat down at the piano and began 
composing. The drawing board is to his left, and he still uses 
``old-fashioned tools: pencil and paper, no synthesizers or 
anything like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The swiftness required of screen composers has a bad and good  
side, he observed. 
</P>
<P>
	Regrets? A few. But he added:  
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the things we labor over often have less value than  
the things we do quickly, when we're unguarded, not hurried but 
unburdened by repeated and constant self-doubt when you have more 
time to work and rework. Much of the time the heat and the pressure 
bring out the best in us.''

	And now -- ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.''  
</P>
<P>
	This is the workshop of Hollywood thememeister John Williams,  
tucked away in the Universal Studios compound of the Amblin 
Entertainment and DreamWorks headquarters of Steven Spielberg, for 
whom Williams has scored 16 movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams has amassed an astonishing record: 37 Academy Award  
nominations and five Oscars; 12 Grammys; scores for seven of the 10 
top moneymaking movies; album sales in the millions. 
</P>
<P>
	Some conductors have reputations for being brusque if not  
bombastic. Not Williams. With round face, friendly eyes and neat 
goatee, he is a courtly man who welcomed a reporter and 
photographer into his office, three times thanking them for coming. 
</P>
<P>
	The room is about the size of a tract-house living room, the  
major elements being a grand piano and, next to it, an architect's 
drawing board on which Williams writes his scores. 
</P>
<P>
	He was asked about ``The Phantom Menace,'' which takes place  
years before the earlier ``Star Wars'' trilogy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know the word 'prequel,''' Williams admitted. ``It  
may be a word George (Lucas) invented. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was interesting to me, because it triggered a few unique  
things of construction, in the following way: There is in this film 
120 minutes of music -- two hours of music! I would say 
conservatively that 90 percent of it is new. The remaining 10 
percent are 'quotes' from earlier themes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first minute and a half has the 'Star Wars' theme. In the  
middle there are quotes, very brief, of Darth Vader's theme, Yoda's 
theme, Princess Leia or whatever, when there are hints of what they 
will become as the prequel advances. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the 90 percent that is new comes to something like this: I  
was able to take some of the old themes and 'de-compose' them -- 
take them apart and write them, in a sense, backward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He cited the theme of Anakin, the little boy who becomes Darth  
Vader. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the kind of theme you would have for a young boy, very  
innocent, lyrical and idealistic. But it's made up of intervals 
from Darth Vader's Imperial March. Which we know -- 
be-bom-bom-BOM-bom-bom -- an archetypical evil expression. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made Anakin's theme out of those intervals by inverting them  
or rearranging them rhythmically or accompanying them harmonically 
in a different way. It sounds familiar, very sweet. But if you 
listen to it carefully, there's a hint (of evil).'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he recorded the theme with the London Symphony Orchestra,  
younger musicians who were familiar with ``Star Wars'' told him: 
``I know what that is; you can't fool me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, 66, found that interweaving snippets of previous  
themes with a new score was a unique experience and ``fun to do.'' 
His approach followed its usual pattern: He looks at the film in a 
nearly completed state, except for the special effects. Having 
spent his early Hollywood years writing scores for TV shows and B 
movies, he is accustomed to stringent deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first I saw 'The Phantom Menace' was Oct. 1, 1998,'' he  
recalled. ``I began to write the score in the middle of October, 
and we recorded it in the middle of February. The film opens May 
19. So it gave me three months plus to write two hours of music for 
orchestra. Very difficult, just in logistic terms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the creative process, Williams looked at the rough cut  
every day, chose a scene to score, sat down at the piano and began 
composing. The drawing board is to his left, and he still uses 
``old-fashioned tools: pencil and paper, no synthesizers or 
anything like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The swiftness required of screen composers has a bad and good  
side, he observed. 
</P>
<P>
	Regrets? A few. But he added:  
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the things we labor over often have less value than  
the things we do quickly, when we're unguarded, not hurried but 
unburdened by repeated and constant self-doubt when you have more 
time to work and rework. Much of the time the heat and the pressure 
bring out the best in us.''

<HEADLINE> NYC To Pay $5M Over Strip Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A jury ordered New York City to pay $5 million  
to a woman who was strip-searched after her arrest in a domestic 
dispute, the first court decision against the city over the 
controversial policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict could have broad financial impact as the city faces  
a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of 63,000 people who claim 
they were illegally strip-searched. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials are negotiating with lawyers in the class-action  
to try to settle the claims before trial, The New York Times 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The city adopted a policy of strip-searching all people arrested  
and arraigned on minor charges in Manhattan and Queens for about 10 
months in 1996 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court ruled in 1986 that people charged with  
minor offenses may not be strip searched unless there is reason for 
authorities to believe they were concealing weapons or contraband. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's Department of Correction said the policy of searching  
everyone was necessary because crowded holding cells created safety 
concerns. Officials acknowledged in court papers that jail guards 
conducting the searches were not told of the appeals court's 
requirement of reasonable suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury last Thursday awarded Debra Ciraolo $19,600 for  
pain, suffering and medical expenses and $5 million in punitive 
damages. The city plans to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ciraolo claimed that she was falsely arrested in January  
1997 after a domestic spat and was taken to a Manhattan holding 
cell. She said two female guards ordered her to strip naked, stand 
against a wall, bend over and cough. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt so shamed,'' Ms. Ciraolo, 43, said. ``I felt as if I  
was taken to the lowest human emotion that anyone could possibly 
experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the people strip-searched had been arrested for crimes  
such as drug dealing and prostitution, city officials said.

<HEADLINE> SEC Targets Internet Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators have charged 18 people and  
eight companies with using the Internet to sell bogus securities, 
extending their crackdown on investment fraud in cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the Securities and Exchange Commission's third nationwide  
``sweep'' against online investment scams, which have cost ordinary 
investors millions of dollars in recent years. The agency announced 
the action Wednesday, alleging that 14 separate schemes deceived 
investors in this country and around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, the investors lost around $2.25 million, the SEC said.  
</P>
<P>
	The allegedly fraudulent investments included interests in gold  
mines, computer software, prefabricated hospitals in Turkey and a 
product described as a new way of processing gold. Eight of the 
cases involved the sale of so-called ``prime bank'' notes -- 
nonexistent securities promoted as providing guaranteed high rates 
of return. The names of well known U.S. or foreign banks are 
sometimes fraudulently added to the securities' names to bolster 
credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The market watchdog agency made the allegations in eight civil  
lawsuits and six administrative actions. All 14 cases involved 
people allegedly selling or marketing phony securities using the 
World Wide Web and making ``outrageous'' promises to investors, 
such as annual returns exceeding 100 percent or even 2000 percent 
of an initial investment. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC also charged several individuals with acting as  
unregistered brokers and selling unregistered securities. 
</P>
<P>
	In some of the cases, the agency said its 200-member Internet  
surveillance team discovered the questionable offerings before any 
securities were sold, preventing any potential investors from 
losing money. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is in many respects a pre-emptive strike,'' SEC  
Enforcement Director Richard Walker told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	In other cases, however, it was too late.  
</P>
<P>
	In one scam, a Dutch man, an Indiana man and a Missouri woman  
allegedly bilked thousands of people out of at least $1.25 million 
in seven schemes that promised investors risk-free returns of up to 
400 percent a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Smith, director of the SEC's Office of Investor Education  
and Assistance, said, ``People spend more time choosing a computer 
than they spend researching Internet investments. Investors can 
take their own pre-emptive strikes against Internet fraud simply by 
checking out investments before they buy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC was seeking civil fines and court orders against the  
investment promoters and companies, compelling them to refrain from 
the allegedly fraudulent activity. In two of the cases, federal 
judges have granted temporary restraining orders against the 
promoters and companies. One of the cases was settled, with the 
person charged neither admitting nor denying wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The actions were seemingly mild, but the regulators' options are  
limited. They do not have legal authority to shut down investment 
promoters' Web sites, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	The civil enforcement actions were brought by SEC's headquarters  
in Washington and by its offices in Atlanta; Boston; Denver; Fort 
Worth, Texas; New York; Philadelphia and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The actions were the latest moves in a nationwide crackdown  
against investment fraud in cyberspace started by the SEC last 
October. In ``sweeps'' in October and February, the agency targeted 
people promoting legitimate stocks over the Internet who don't 
disclose they are paid to do so by the companies. Such stock 
promotions are known as ``touting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., chairman of a Senate Appropriations  
subcommittee, recently proposed increasing the SEC's budget, now at 
$337.4 million, by $5.5 million next year to fight investment fraud 
over the Internet. That would bring the agency's funding to the 
level requested by the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cops won't catch every crook in cyberspace, so investors  
need to watch out for themselves,'' said Peter Hildreth, president 
of the North American Securities Administrators Association, which 
represents state securities regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regulators will not allow con artists and charlatans to hijack  
... (the Internet) and turn it into the electronic equivalent of a 
restroom wall,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>

	EDITOR'S NOTE: The SEC advises investors to read its guide  
titled ``Internet Fraud: How to Avoid Internet Investment Scams'' 
before buying any investment promoted on the Internet. The 
publication is available on the investor assistance and complaints 
link of the agency's Web site at www.sec.gov. It also is available 
by calling 1-800-SEC-0330.

<HEADLINE> Cox Is Buying TCA Cable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Cox Communications is reaching into smaller  
markets with the acquisition of Texas-based TCA Cable TV for $3.3 
billion in cash and stock. The deal announced Wednesday will make 
Cox the fourth-largest cable company in the nation with about 5 
million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Robbins, president and chief executive officer of  
Atlanta-based Cox, said TCA ``will become the cornerstone of our 
plans to offer advanced services in middle-market communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Cox's markets are in large urban or suburban areas like  
southern California, Virginia and Phoenix. Cox will be adding about 
883,000 TCA customers, nearly all of them in Texas, Arkansas and 
Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``There remain growth opportunities in our business, and we're  
going to continue to pursue mid-market opportunities as well as 
large-market opportunities,'' Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Nichols, TCA's chairman and CEO, said the merger will mean  
little change for subscribers in areas like programming but will 
add Cox's expertise and experience to TCA's efforts to be ``a 
totally integrated communications provider in our operating 
areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cox officials noted that TCA's recent system upgrades have  
enabled the company to offer high-speed Internet access and digital 
video services. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox Communications has been a pioneer in building digital  
networks and offering new services such as digital television, 
Internet access and local telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
	Robbins also cited TCA's record of customer service, its balance  
sheet and a ``solid management team'' that will remain in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox is paying the equivalent of $4,115 per subscriber. AT&AMP;T  
Corp. recently agreed to pay about $4,600 per subscriber for cable 
TV company MediaOne Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox also is assuming $736 million in debt as part of the deal,  
which has been approved by both boards and is expected to close 
late this year. 
</P>
<P>
	TCA's stock rose Wednesday after the deal was announced, gaining  
$7.70 or 15 percent to $60.31 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Cox's 
shares fell $1.93 3/4 to $86.06 1/4 on the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> SEC Tips To Avoid Internet Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tips from the Securities and Exchange Commission for avoiding  
Internet investment scams: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Before you invest, check the SEC's EDGAR database at  
www.sec.gov or call your state securities regulator to find out 
whether an investment is legally registered. To locate your state 
regulator, call the North American Securities Administrators 
Association at 202-737-0900 or go to its Web site at www.nasaa.org. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Ask your state regulator whether the person or company selling  
the investment is licensed to do business in your state and whether 
they have a record of complaints or fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Assume that investments offered over the Internet are scams  
until you've done your research and proven otherwise.

<HEADLINE> WWII Slave Labor Reparations Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department played host Wednesday to  
a large international gathering of government, business and private 
groups trying to agree on reparations for hundreds of thousands of 
people forced by the Nazis to work as laborers during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Many were employed by large German companies, 15 of which have  
pledged to set up a fund by September to pay the reparations. 
</P>
<P>
	Presiding at the conference were Stuart Eizenstat, U.S.  
undersecretary of state for economic affairs, and Bodo Hombach, 
chief of staff for German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
	Delegations from Belarus, Ukraine, the Czech Republic, Israel,  
Poland and Russia were present. Also attending were representatives 
from reconciliation foundations from the Central and Eastern 
European countries, and officers from key German companies and 
their lawyers. Also represented was the Conference on Jewish 
Material Claims and attorneys representing Holocaust survivors in 
class-action suits. 
</P>
<P>
	Eizenstat told a news conference that agreement was reached to  
set up two working groups, one to set eligibility rules for 
payments from the fund and the other to deal with ways to ensure 
legal closure for the German companies. 
</P>
<P>
	He said participants are committed to meeting in working groups  
in Washington and in Bonn and to making recommendations within the 
next 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
	He expressed hope that processes can be agreed to by Sept. 1.  
That date, he noted, is the 60th anniversary of the start of World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the issues to be settled, he said, are ways to achieve  
legal closure, who should be the beneficiaries and how the fund 
would be operated. 
</P>
<P>
	The process will deal with the 70,000 to 90,000 people who are  
classified as slave laborers, mostly Jewish concentration camp or 
ghetto survivors, and so-called forced laborers, a much larger 
category that consists mostly of agricultural workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The participation of all those who attended is a significant  
accomplishment in moving the process toward closure,'' Eizenstat 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the goal of the initiative is to provide victims with  
payments through a ``cooperative, fair and non-bureaucratic 
arrangement without regard to nationality or religion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gideon Taylor, executive vice president of the Conference of  
Jewish Material Claims Against Germany expressed his appreciation 
for the initiative of the U.S. and German governments in convening 
the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``For this effort to succeed we need to make very rapid  
progress,'' he said. ``We also hope that more companies will join 
the process very soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The German Embassy hosted a dinner for the visiting delegations  
Tuesday night.

<HEADLINE> 1M Infants To Get Classical CDs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COPPELL, Texas (AP) -- Nobody can say for sure if listening to  
Mozart, Beethoven or Bach will make kids smarter. The parents of 
more than 1 million children around the country are getting the 
chance to find out. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences Foundation  
began handing out free CDs of Grammy-winning classical music in 
hundreds of hospitals Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal of the project is to give children ``every scientific  
and cultural advantage possible,'' said Michael Greene, president 
and chief executive of the academy, which hands out the annual 
Grammys. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Smart Symphonies'' CDs will be distributed for about a  
year in hospitals. Mead Johnson Nutritionals, which makes Enfamil 
infant formula, is providing $3 million for the project. 
</P>
<P>
	John Flohr, who teaches at Texas Woman's University in Denton  
and was a consultant on the Grammy project, has led several studies 
indicating that certain music stimulates neural connections in the 
brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Music has a nice way of producing circuits,'' he said. ``Some  
brain development caused by music may be helpful in developing 
other abilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those abilities may include better visual-spatial reasoning,  
which helps children with patterns, puzzles and mazes; and improved 
memorization. 
</P>
<P>
	But Flohr urges caution before simply claiming that listening to  
classical music will make children better in science and math, 
which some experts claim because of the genre's complexity, 
repetitions and patterns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should never say that music makes you better in math,''  
Flohr said. ``There is some research supporting that but not 
much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flohr will lead a study on the effect of the Grammy CDs on  
dozens of 3- to 5-year-olds in San Antonio. The brain activity of 
children who listen to the CD several hours a day will be compared 
with that of other youngsters who aren't listening to classical 
music. 
</P>
<P>
	Most early childhood specialists agree that music generally is  
good for infants, said David Moore, a professor of psychology at 
Pitzer College in Claremont, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is very little doubt that every experience a baby has  
affects the structure of a baby's brain,'' he said. ``But there's 
no reason to say it's going to raise the baby's IQ. That is 
determined by many factors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Children's World, a child care center where Flohr volunteers,  
kids may not understand the difference between Beethoven and 
Barney, but they know they're having fun when Flohr shows up. 
</P>
<P>
	Air piano is the newest game. With arms and fingers  
outstretched, children at the day care bang on imaginary keyboards 
to the flourishes of Mozart. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't just listen to the music now,'' said teacher Gladys  
Monsante, whose 2-year-old son attends the center. ``They 
participate. ``They become part of the music. And at the same time 
they are learning.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

	Summers To Replace Rubin at Treasury  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, idolized on  
Wall Street for the policies many credit with spurring the U.S. 
economic boom, is stepping down. President Clinton today will 
nominate his deputy, Lawrence Summers, to succeed him. Rubin, a 
former investment banker, and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan have overseen the policies that set the U.S. economy on 
its longest peacetime expansion in history. Rubin has long been 
considered a candidate to replace Greenspan if he chooses to retire 
when his term ends in June 2000.

	U.S. Seeks Russia Support on Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Declaring NATO's mistaken bombing of the  
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade would not block a diplomatic solution 
in Kosovo, the Clinton administration is focused on winning 
Russia's approval of its tough demands on Yugoslavia. But President 
Boris Yeltsin declared today in remarks obviously aimed at 
Washington: ``Some people obviously aren't understanding our 
repeated proposals,'' which include a bombing halt. Still, White 
House press secretary Joe Lockhart said a meeting between Russia's 
envoy to Yugoslavia, Viktor Chernomyrdin, and Deputy Secretary of 
State Strobe Talbott had been productive.

	Yeltsin Fires Prime Minister  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin fired Prime Minister  
Yevgeny Primakov today, one day before Parliament was to begin 
impeachment hearings against Yeltsin. Political leaders warned that 
Primakov's dismissal would almost certainly guarantee that the 
Duma, the lower house of parliament, will vote to impeach. To 
remove Yeltsin from office, however, the impeachment motion must 
also be approved by two-thirds majorities of the upper chamber and 
the supreme and the constitutional courts.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Making good on a pledge to pay for 100,000

grants allowing communities to hire cadets and urged Congress to 
support his anti-crime package. Clinton also used the announcement 
to celebrate what he said were the effects of the 1994 crime bill -- 
a drop in murder rates and other violent crimes -- and to call for 
renewal of the community policing grants.

	FCC Mulls Cell Phone Rules for 911  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission is  
expected to take action tomorrow to increase the chances that 
cellular phone calls to 911 will go through. Under the FCC plan, 
new analog cellular phones would be required to have software to 
route 911 calls to another carrier when the customer's own company 
can't complete the call. More than 98,000 calls to 911 are made 
each day on cell phones. Digital phones wouldn't be covered by the 
FCC rules because they are more complex and technology doesn't yet 
exist to deal with the call completion problem.

	House Considers Y2K Lawsuit Limits  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House neared a vote this afternoon on a  
bill to limit millennium-bug lawsuits -- a measure that businesses 
say is needed to avoid a year-2000 financial catastrophe. The 
legislation would try to stem a potential flood of lawsuits arising 
from computer breakdowns by establishing a 90-day waiting period 
before lawsuits can be filed, cap punitive damage and limit class 
action lawsuits. The White House sees it as slanted against 
consumers and deserving of a presidential veto.

aging. The next step is to determine whether a similar enzyme 
exists in humans. The findings are published in tomorrow's issue of

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Down 25.78 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed Wednesday as blue chips  
recovered most of a sharp drop following Treasury Secretary Robert 
Rubin's resignation, and the broader market rose on strength in 
technology issues. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 25.78 at 11,000.37, just as President Clinton formally 
announced Rubin's resignation and the nomination of Lawrence 
Summers as his successor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow opened slightly lower but plunged as much as 213 points  
after word of Rubin's resignation first crossed news wires 20 
minutes later. It made back most of its losses within the first 
hour of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators, which also fell on the Rubin news,  
climbed quickly back into positive territory. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 
500 index closed up 8.39 at 1,364.00 , and the Nasdaq composite 
index gained 39.86 to 2,606.54. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was initially worried that new leadership at the  
Treasury might mean a change in the administration's approach to 
the economy, which has thrived since Rubin was installed in 1995. 
But market experts said Rubin's resignation had long been expected 
and that the White House had made a good move in choosing Summers, 
his deputy, as a successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers will need to be confirmed by the Senate. Market analysts  
warned that any delay on Capitol Hill could send the stock and bond 
markets lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Ned Riley, chief investment officer at BankBoston, said the  
choice of Summers helped the market regain its footing. ``The 
promptness of his appointment and well-orchestrated transition 
calmed the markets very quickly,'' Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan, Rubin is seen as  
having played a key role in the stock market's historic eight-year 
advance, although Summers is also well respected for his 
intellectual prowess and command of economic issues. 
</P>
<P>
	But Summers, who came to public life from academia, has a  
different style from Rubin, a former Wall Street investment banker. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Rubin is thought to be more reserved in his style of  
communicating, somewhat more contained,'' said Christine Callies, 
chief investment strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston, ``while 
Mr. Summers is thought of as someone who is a little more garrulous 
and slightly more outspoken on a number of issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Byron Wien, the U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley  
Dean Witter who knows both men, said Summers ``can be acerbic,'' 
but that he was often the brains behind Rubin's formidable 
diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
	And, although the market was concerned about interest rates,  
analysts were quick to note that Greenspan continues to lead the 
Fed. The 30-year Treasury bond yield ended at 5.82 percent, down 
from 5.83 percent Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services stocks tumbled on the news of Rubin's  
resignation but recovered. Citigroup was up 1 7/16 at 73 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyclical stocks, which rise and fall in response to economic  
conditions, were lower. Alcoa was down 2 3/16 at 62 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks fell after new government data showed an unexpected  
increase in oil reserves. Exxon was down 2 9/16 at 79 1/16, and 
Chevron fell 3 to 95 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks rose sharply.  
</P>
<P>
	IBM climbed 4 1/2 to 225 1/2 after trading as high as a record 228  
7/16. IBM unveiled a new computer disk drive storage system that 
packs 20 billion bits of data into a square inch, twice the 
previous record. IBM also announced it had signed a $1 billion 
contract to make a computer chip for Nintendo's next-generation 
video game player. And in a meeting with analysts after the close 
of trading, chief executive Louis Gerstner said the Internet 
represents a ``gigantic service opportunity'' for IBM. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues had a narrow 9-to-8 lead on advancers on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume came to 1.01 
billion shares, up slightly from Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 1.91 to 647.68, the American Stock  
Exchange composite rose 9.06 to 798.35, and the Russell 2000 index 
of smaller companies added 2.45 to 449.26. 
</P>
<P>
	In foreign markets, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo advanced 1.22  
percent. In Europe, the DAX index in Frankfurt fell 0.02 percent, 
the CAC index in Paris rose 0.11 percent, but the FT-SE 100 index 
in London declined 0.55 percent.

<HEADLINE> Almond Growers Expecting a Bounty / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- Almond growers are counting a record  
number of blossoms this spring and expecting a bounty this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	California, the nation's sole commercial producer of almonds, is  
expected to harvest 760 million pounds of the tree nut this season, 
eclipsing the previous high of 756 million pounds in 1997-1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999-2000 forecast, based on predictions by 224 growers, was  
released this week by the California Agricultural Statistics 
Service, an arm of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	Growers have been anticipating a bumper crop since the beginning  
of the season, with estimates based on thousands of additional 
plantings and buoyed by near-perfect pollination in the San Joaquin 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	But those expectations have been tempered by the knowledge that  
a huge drop might follow to compensate for the heaviness of the 
crop on the trees. Nutlets drop to the ground three different 
times, once during the bloom and again four and seven weeks after 
bloom. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a tremendously beautiful bloom,'' said D. Billings, who  
helps run a family farm in Delano. ``Coinciding with that we 
usually have a tremendous drop. It's natures way of letting the 
tree survive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest forecast reflects a continued trend in growth that is  
forcing the almond industry to find ways to broaden the 
marketplace, hoping to keep demand on pace with larger future 
crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past 20 years, almond production has jumped 575 million  
pounds, sales have nearly tripled and grower revenues have jumped 
nearly 700 percent, according to the Almond Board of California. 
</P>
<P>
	With the value-per-bearing acre trending upwards the past five  
years and now hovering above $2,000, trees have been planted at a 
rate too dizzying for statisticians to keep good count. The 
estimate now stands at more than 450,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	The almond board, based on a vote by an overwhelming majority of  
almond growers, will be expanding dramatically its overseas 
marketing programs, especially in China, Japan and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry, which exports more than 70 percent of the crop,  
already has won awards for its domestic ``Almonds are In'' campaign 
featuring ads that show how California almonds can make food more 
special. 
</P>
<P>
	The board also is touting newly discovered health benefits,  
citing studies that show almonds help shed pounds, and can lower 
the risk of colon cancer and heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``Almonds are a luxury item. You don't have to have almonds in  
order to live,'' said Mario Viveros, a University of California 
farm advisor for Kern County, one of the state's largest almond 
regions with about 89,000 acres of trees. ``When people don't have 
disposable income to buy them, they are going to buy something that 
is more vital to their diet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China's 1.2 billion consumers are of especial interest.  
California is already that country's top supplier. However, the 
record nine million pounds shipped there last year represent only 
1.5 percent of the state's total exports. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got all kinds of programs we've been working on in  
China,'' said Michael Marsh, director of finance, statistics and 
compliance at the almond board. ``We're hoping in very near term 
those programs will bear more fruit and we'll be shipping millions 
more pounds.''

<HEADLINE> Valvoline Apologizes for Racing Ad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Sports Illustrated and Valvoline Co. are  
apologizing for the placement of an advertisement opposite a 
photograph of the body of a victim of a recent accident at a North 
Carolina speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Three spectators were killed and eight other fans were injured  
May 1 when debris from a crash during an Indy Racing League event 
flew over a 15-foot catch fence and into the crowd at Lowe's Motor 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	The photograph in the magazine's May 10 issue shows one victim,  
with a leg protruding from beneath a sheet, lying on the 
blood-covered grandstand steps. 
</P>
<P>
	On the opposite page, a full-page Valvoline ad shows five men  
working under the hood of a car, with the caption, ``You're born. 
You die. In between you work on cars. We should all be so lucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Valvoline statement Tuesday to The Associated Press apologized  
for ``any offense that inadvertently may have occurred.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Valvoline has long given explicit direction to Sports  
Illustrated to never place any Valvoline ad near or adjacent to any 
article or photography which describes or illustrates death or 
injury, especially involving auto racing. This week, Sports 
Illustrated failed to comply with our policy,'' the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine took full responsibility.  
</P>
<P>
	``We make every effort to comply with their requests, but  
sometimes with quick closing deadlines and as people are scrambling 
to close the issue, these things happen,'' said spokesman Robin 
Shallow.

<HEADLINE> Simpson: No Comment on Custody Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Is there an agreement for O.J. Simpson to  
keep custody of his two youngest children? Simpson's lawyer says 
yes. Their grandfather says no. The children's lawyer thinks so, 
and Simpson isn't commenting. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney, 13, and 10-year-old Justin Simpson, the children of  
Simpson and his slain ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, have been at 
the center of a custody battle between their father and their 
mother's parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Simpson's father, Lou Brown, insisted Tuesday that no  
custody agreement had been reached and was angry at Simpson's 
lawyer for talking about the negotiations to The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know why the attorney was discussing it,'' he said.  
``It's supposed to be confidential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson's lawyer, Bernard Leckie, said Monday that an agreement  
giving custody to Simpson was ready to be signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson refused to comment and seemed distressed that his lawyer  
was discussing the matter publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what was holding up resolution of the children's custody,  
Brown said, ``It depends on him,'' referring to Simpson and adding: 
``He's out of town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marjorie Fuller, the attorney representing the children, said  
Tuesday she has not been involved in the negotiations but believes 
an agreement is close. 
</P>
<P>
	``My job is to hang back and let Mr. Simpson and the Browns work  
it out,'' she said. ``But as far as I know, everybody's been 
working real hard on an agreement and it was waiting to be 
signed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brown family lawyer, Kimberly Knill, did not return a phone  
call. 
</P>
<P>
	The children, who live with Simpson, often visit Brown and his  
wife, Juditha. The Browns lost their first custody suit, but the 
California Supreme Court ruled in February the case could be 
retried. 
</P>
<P>
	Leckie said Monday that everyone agreed ``it's in the best  
interest of the children that this not be dragged out through the 
courts any further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson was acquitted of the 1994 murders of Ms. Simpson and her  
friend Ronald Goldman. But he was held liable in a wrongful death 
lawsuit filed by the Brown and Goldman families, who were awarded 
$33.5 million.

<HEADLINE> Old Stock Certificates Vaulable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Ned Downing spent years trading on Wall Street, but it wasn't  
until he left the business that he bagged his most memorable deal: 
Bank of North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the company is defunct and its stock nonredeemable, the  
share that he purchased for $33,000 was priceless to Downing since 
it's the nation's oldest-surviving stock certificate -- dated June 
7, 1783. 
</P>
<P>
	``I collect stories in documents. This is the foundation of  
capitalism. It's our history,'' he explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Though long depreciated, many old stock and bond certificates  
are gaining in value among a growing number of collectors. An 
estimated 30,000 people worldwide are involved in the hobby, known 
as scripophily (pronounced scrip-awfully). 
</P>
<P>
	They believe antique securities will increase in value as the  
world moves into the new millennium and electronic trading 
continues to eliminate the use of paper certificates. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Downing, they scour old company files, estate sales and  
auctions. Many of these old papers turn up in attics, closets or 
safe-deposit boxes, dusty and long forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
	The most valuable certificates, according to Haley Garrison,  
owner of Antique Stocks &AMP; Bonds of Williamsburg, Va., 
(www.tiac.net/users/haley/) are those that have historical 
significance. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the most desired periods: Colonial, Civil War, and the  
beginning of any emerging industry, such as banks, oil or 
railroads. Signatures from famous people, like John D. Rockefeller, 
William H. Vanderbilt, or J.P. Morgan, add to the value, especially 
if the signatures are scarce. 
</P>
<P>
	Also of value are securities that are aesthetically appealing.  
Many were ornately engraved with elaborate vignettes crafted by 
artists to guard against counterfeiting and to entice investors, 
like those from mining or railroad companies during the 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlantic, Mississippi &AMP; Ohio American Railroad Gold Bond  
issued in Virginia in 1871 features a little bit of everything -- 
elaborate vignettes of trains, landscapes, paddlewheel steamers, 
seals, crests and medallions, all surrounded by an ornate border. 
It's worth around $500 in very fine condition, according to 
Garrison. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock certificates from International Mercantile Marine Co.,  
which built the Titanic, are worth about $700. One from 1905 
features a steamer with black smoke billowing from its four stacks. 
The company is now defunct, having been sold in 1943. 
</P>
<P>
	More recently, one of the most colorful and appealing  
certificates was issued in the 1960s by the Ringling 
Brothers-Barnum and Baily Circus. It featured wild animals, clowns 
and acrobats. Mattel Inc., which bought the circus in the early 
1970s, could only persuade shareholders to exchange their Ringling 
certificates for new ones after promising to return the originals 
once they were canceled, Garrison said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also hard to part with for some shareholders were the first  
certificates issued by Playboy Enterprises after it went public in 
1971. It sported the nude image of February 1971 ``Playmate'' Willi 
Rey. 
</P>
<P>
	There are fewer elaborate certificates these days; most designs  
are computer-generated. And that makes the older ones even more 
valuable, the experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a dying art form,'' said Jean M. Young, a spokeswoman for  
the American Bank Note Co. in Philadelphia, one of the oldest and 
largest security printers in the world. ABN has an extensive 
library of engraved plates, designs and vignettes for virtually all 
New York Stock Exchange-listed companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look in our archives, you see a big picture, which  
was originally done by the artist ... then scaled down to size,'' 
Young said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scripophily began to take off in the United States in the early  
1980s, although it flourished in countries like Germany much 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Fueling that interest has been the emergence of financial  
museums like the Museum of American Financial History 
(www.financialhistory.org), which opened in lower Manhattan in 
1988. The museum, founded by world-renowned collector and vintage 
securities expert John E. Herzog, features antique stocks, bonds, 
and currency; historic documents and photographs; and equipment 
once used on Wall Street. Its main objective: to preserve 
American's financial history. 
</P>
<P>
	Those with an interest in financial history can start collecting  
with just a few dollars. Many dealers offer extensive catalogs of 
available certificates on the Internet or via online auctions. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, you can buy each of the ``Monopoly'' collection of  
railroad stocks, which includes the Pennsylvania Railroad Co. and 
Erie Railroad Co., for under $10 apiece. Many Confederate war bonds 
can be had for under $50. 
</P>
<P>
	But you also can also spend tens of thousands of dollars like  
Downing did at an auction in 1995 for his Bank of North America 
certificate. 
</P>
<P>
	Downing, a history buff from Weston, Mass., said that the  
corporation was formed to help raise funds for George Washington's 
army. 
</P>
<P>
	``The certificate was made out to John Carter, an alias for John  
Barker Church ... brother-in-law of Alexander Hamilton,'' he 
explains. ``It was Church's dueling pistols that resulted in the 
death of Hamilton in 1804.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first known stock certificate, which isn't for sale, has  
been valued for insurance purposes at $600,000. It's from the Dutch 
East India Company and dates to 1608. There are also bonds dating 
to the 1500s, which also go for thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Downing suggests collectors become familiar with the historical  
significance of the certificates they plan to buy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before I started collecting I would read as much as I can  
about the actual history of what I'm trying to collect and then go 
after the very best material,'' said Downing, a former stock broker 
who also traded in mortgage-backed securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Garrison collects much the same way, and includes researched  
material about the company with many of the stock and bond 
certificates he sells. 
</P>
<P>
	He's especially fond of collecting swindles -- stocks of  
fly-by-night companies offering get-rich-quick schemes or 
businesses plagued with scandal -- and sees them as constant 
reminders that history can, and does, repeat itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his favorites: Huxter's Chocnog Corp., a company that  
claimed to have developed a special formula that made cows give 
chocolate milk; International Money Machine Corp., which claimed to 
have developed a machine that turned $1 bills into $5 bills; Keely 
Motor Co., which said it discovered ``energized water'' that could 
be used instead of fuel; and Gray Goose Airways, which developed a 
flying machine that flapped its wings like a goose. 
</P>
<P>
	``On its first flight the (Gray Goose Airways) contraption  
landed on its inventor,'' but didn't kill him, Garrison said.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Kenny Chesney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Kenny Chesney is a country singer  
looking for a little respect. 
</P>
<P>
	The breezy ``How Forever Feels'' recently spent six weeks at No.  
1, the most successful single of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Chesney is also playing to his largest audiences ever as part of  
superstar George Strait's tour of stadiums. And on the new album 
``Everywhere We Go,'' Chesney's song selection takes a serious turn 
with ``California,'' about a woman trying to brush off an abusive 
past. Randy Travis gave Chesney some props by singing a duet with 
him on another song on the CD. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the 31-year-old singer tends to get lumped in with the  
``country hunk'' movement of the early 1990s, when so many 
good-looking young men in cowboy hats had hits, it was hard to tell 
one from another. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of those aging hunks have disappeared from the charts.  
Chesney remains. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's still tons of people, millions of people out there who  
don't know who I am,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly his eyes narrow: ``But there's a couple million out  
there that do.'' Just as quickly the serious mood passes and he 
starts laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Slowly and surely people are putting the face with the  
songs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``How Forever Feels'' has really struck a nerve with people.  
Why? 
</P>
<P>
	Chesney: I think 'How Forever Feels' was really just an  
infectious song from the very opening riff. I just think it's 
different. Also, I've never heard another love song that mentions 
Richard Petty. That song really opened up a brand new audience for 
me. My past two albums have gone gold (meaning sales of more than 
500,000), but a lot of people think 'How Forever Feels' is my first 
single. It's odd, because I've been out there for six years now. 
</P>
<P>
	1 1/2. In the video for the song you lose the cowboy hat and show  
off your balding head. Was that a big decision for a ``country 
hunk''? 
</P>
<P>
	Chesney: We were just having fun down there at the beach, and  
it's kind of hard to scuba dive with a cowboy hat on. ... If 
there's one thing about me -- I want to be real. It never once 
crossed my mind about competition or about what people would think. 
</P>
<P>
	2. Many of your hits are lighthearted love songs, but on  
``Everywhere We Go,'' there is a song about a woman abused by her 
father and the duet with Randy Travis is about getting baptized. 
Why the serious turn? 
</P>
<P>
	Chesney: I think it's just a reflection of a growing process  
that I'm going through. On my first couple of records, I recorded 
some songs that were well-written songs, and I had a couple of hits 
here and there. But there was nothing I feel like really dug deep 
down and got into people's minds and their hearts. 
</P>
<P>
	I wanted to have a lot of fun with this record, but I also  
wanted to have a little bit of depth. With 'California,' it doesn't 
come right out and say it's a molesting relationship, but then 
again it does. You just got to listen for it. Songs like that and 
'Baptism' -- those two songs might not be singles for us, but make 
the album just 10 times better. 
</P>
<P>
	3. You've also got a song called ``She Thinks My Tractor's  
Sexy'' on the album, which is a downright silly double entendre. 
</P>
<P>
	Chesney: Yeah, it's silly. But it's infectious, and it's written  
very well, and it made me laugh the first time I heard it. Music is 
like medicine to me, man. You've got to have serious things, and 
then you got to have 'She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy' to have fun 
with and let your hair down. ... We're getting a bigger response 
from the 'Tractor' thing then anything I've ever had out, and it's 
not even a single yet. 
</P>
<P>
	4. You're the country singer most identified with Tennessee  
football, yet you didn't attend the university in Knoxville, Tenn. 
What's the connection? 
</P>
<P>
	Chesney: I grew up there. I lived 10, 15 minutes from the  
stadium, so it's around you everywhere. It's in the blood over 
there. Peyton (Manning, the former Tennessee quarterback who now 
plays for the Indianapolis Colts) liked my music ... so we set it 
up and went to lunch one day and kept in touch and become really 
good buddies. I talk to him two or three times a week. 
</P>
<P>
	I think there's always been a bond between pro athletes and  
musicians. I've been trying to talk Peyton and the Colts 
organization into letting me suit up one day. Peyton goes, 'No way, 
not even in pre-season. You cannot do that.' 
</P>
<P>
	5. What's it like playing to such large audiences on the George  
Strait tour? 
</P>
<P>
	Chesney: It's pretty incredible. My fan base is growing and  
growing every weekend. We're playing in front of 70,000 people, and 
I'm singing a really big hit record, 'How Forever Feels.' The fact 
that George Strait wants me out there on tour with him -- thinks 
enough about my music and what I'm doing -- it means a lot to me. I 
made a joke to George the other night, that I seem to draw a lot 
better when I'm playing with him. He just kind of looked at me like 
I was a little crazy.

<HEADLINE> Arthritis Drug, Infections Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is asking the maker of a new  
rheumatoid arthritis treatment to study whether the drug increases 
patients' risk of infections. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Enbrel was approved last winter, 30 of an estimated 25,000  
Enbrel users have developed serious infections -- including sepsis -- 
and six have died, the Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases are puzzling because carefully controlled studies of  
Enbrel taken by rheumatoid arthritis patients had not shown an 
increased infection risk. 
</P>
<P>
	But Enbrel works by targeting an immune system protein that  
causes painful arthritis inflammation. So scientists had always 
wondered whether inhibiting that protein would suppress the immune 
system enough to render some people vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday, the FDA warned doctors not to give Enbrel to anyone  
who has an active or chronic infection, and to be cautious when 
considering the drug for people with a history of recurring 
infections or other diseases like diabetes that may increase 
infection risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, the drug's warnings had only prohibited giving Enbrel  
to people with sepsis, a dangerous bloodstream infection. And 
patients were urged to quit taking it if they became infected. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturer Immunex Corp. wrote thousands of doctors Monday  
informing them that the warning was coming. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty infections isn't an alarming number in itself. But  
officials became worried about a pattern, explained FDA immunology 
chief Dr. William Schwieterman. The sick patients often appeared 
predisposed to infections; the new infections developed within a 
week or two of starting Enbrel; and some of the fatalities occurred 
after antibiotic treatment failed. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA stressed that no one knows if Enbrel causes any problem,  
but urged doctors to consider the cases as a precautionary measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the agency asked Immunex to conduct a special, large study  
to settle the issue. The company and government are discussing how 
to do that.

<HEADLINE> NBC Win Tightens Ratings Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC now knows that biblical characters and Julia  
Roberts are great audience lures. Hippie killers, however, are not. 
</P>
<P>
	The second part of NBC's mini-series, ``Noah's Ark,'' was the  
week's second most-watched program after ``ER.'' Part one topped 
Nielsen Media Research's prime-time ratings the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The drama ``Law and Order'' reached its biggest audience since  
March 1997 with last Wednesday's episode, where movie star Roberts 
was the guest. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sunday's NBC mini-series, ``The Hunt for the Unicorn  
Killer,'' didn't do nearly as well. The story about convicted 
fugitive Ira Einhorn was soundly beaten in the ratings by CBS's 
movie, ``The Simple Life of Noah Dearborn,'' which starred Sidney 
Poitier. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the mixed results from its ``sweeps'' month events,  
NBC's boost from its biblical epic tightened the competition for 
the season crown with first-place CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of the week's top eight shows were from NBC's Thursday  
night lineup. Yet even that was a mixed blessing: it was the 
lowest-rated Thursday evening of first-run shows for the network 
since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, NBC had a 9.9 rating and 17 share. CBS was second  
with a 9.0 rating and 15 share, ABC had a 7.5 rating and 13 share, 
and Fox had a 6.1 rating and 11 share. The WB was at 3.0 and 5, UPN 
had a 2.0 and 3, and Pax TV had a 0.7 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' won the evening news competition with a  
7.7 rating and 17 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was second 
with a 7.1 rating and 16 share, while the ``CBS Evening News'' had 
a 6.3 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of May 3-9, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: ``ER,'' NBC, 18.4; ``NBC Monday Night Movie: Noah's 
Ark, Part Two,'' NBC, 17.1; ``Friends,'' NBC, 14.3; ``CBS Sunday 
Movie: The Simple Life of Noah Dearborn,'' CBS, 13.8; ``Frasier,'' 
NBC, 13.8; ``Law and Order,'' NBC, 13.4; ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' NBC, 
12.0; ``Veronica's Closet,'' NBC, 11.9; ``Touched By an Angel,'' 
CBS, 11.7; ``Dateline NBC-Tuesday, 11.2.

<HEADLINE> Preakness Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Bob Lewis celebrated his 75th birthday  
Wednesday by greeting his Kentucky Derby winner Charismatic as the 
colt came off a van after shipping in from Louisville for the 
Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imagine being this age and having so much fun?'' Lewis,  
accompanied by his wife, Beverly, said. ``It's incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewises have won two of the past three Kentucky Derbys --  
Silver Charm won the Derby and Preakness in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FILLIES ARE HERE:* Trainer Bob Baffert showed up at Pimlico,  
too, bringing along his fillies Silverbulletday and Excellent 
Meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were expected to run in Saturday's Preakness, although  
there was still a chance one could run in the Black-Eyed Susan 
Friday, 
</P>
<P>
	``The fillies will be tough if they run in the Preakness,''  
Baffert said. ``Now it's up to fate and the draw.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday, owned by Mike Pegram, has won 10 of 11 starts,  
including an easy victory in the Kentucky Oaks the day before the 
Derby. Silverbulletday, to be ridden by Gary Stevens, would be 
running against males for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent Meeting, fifth in the Derby with Kent Desormeaux  
aboard, has won seven of 12 starts. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DERBY WINNER LIKES TO EAT:* Charismatic is the most seasoned  
horse in Saturday's Preakness, just like he was in the Kentucky 
Derby. He also may be the best fed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He likes to eat,'' owner Bob Lewis said. ``A few weeks ago, I  
suggested he may eat us out of house and home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, that was before the Derby victory and the winner's  
share of $886,200. 
</P>
<P>
	``He goes out there and does his business on the track, than  
comes back to the barn and eats the bottom out of the grain 
bucket,'' Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3-year-old colt will be making his 16th career start.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CHANGES:* Chris McCarron sustained a foot injury and will not  
be aboard Stephen Got Even in Saturday's Preakness. Trainer Nick 
Zito has yet to pick a replacement. ... Vicar, 18th in the Derby 
under Shane Sellers, has a new jockey in Robby Albarado. Sellers 
took the call on Kimberlite Pipe, who finished sixth in the Derby 
under Albarado. ... Lead Em Home was withdrawn from Preakness 
consideration by trainer Phil Marino, who will enter his colt in 
the Sir Barton Stakes on the undercard. ... Prime Timber, fourth in 
the Derby but out of the Preakness, won't run in the Sir Barton, 
either. ... Dubai-based Worldly Manner was one of the many 
Preakness horses who shipped in Wednesday. The colt went 5 furlongs 
in 1:00 2-5 in Tuesday's workout at Churchill Downs. ... Valhol 
will be ridden by Edgar Prado.

<HEADLINE> US Remains Firm on China, WTO Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Clinton administration will remain firm  
on requirements for China's entry to the World Trade Organization 
while seeking to ease tensions caused by the accidental bombing of 
the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia, Commerce Secretary William Daley 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The bombing last week has complicated negotiations, but there  
are no plans for the United States to retreat from concessions won 
during negotiations before Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to Washington 
last month or demands that China further open its markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a political deal. This is not a political  
statement about how far China has come or how important they are. 
This is a commercial deal and these are commercial terms,'' Daley 
said during a question-and-answer period after a speech to Town 
Hall Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. aircraft bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade Friday.  
NATO officials have blamed the accident on outdated maps that 
identified the building as a Yugoslav government command center. 
</P>
<P>
	China's attempts to win U.S. support for its admission to the  
WTO already were hindered by allegations of Chinese spying, 
questionable political contributions and human rights abuses within 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	China has been negotiating for 13 years to enter the 134-country  
WTO. Based in Geneva, Switzerland, the organization sets rules for 
international trade and mediates disputes among its members. Entry 
to the body, which must be approved by member countries, would 
enable China to trade on more favorable terms with WTO nations. 
</P>
<P>
	In the days before Zhu's visit, China offered concessions that  
would open up aviation, agriculture, telecommunications and 
financial and other services -- sectors long-closed and in which 
American businesses excel. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration is hoping to secure greater access to  
China's financial services sector and protections for U.S. steel 
and textile makers from Chinese imports. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and Chinese negotiators last met Friday in Beijing, hours  
before the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the tragedy that occurred makes the timing of it  
more difficult. It should not impact the agreements that were 
reached before Premier Zhu came, the issues of agriculture and 
others,'' Daley told reporters after his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If, by chance, someone in China thought that they could pull  
back some of those commitments and positions and somehow we would 
find that acceptable, that's not the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daley noted that European negotiators also have been unable to  
reach agreement with China on similar issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``That shows also that this is not just the United States that  
has problems on these economic issues with China,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Winter Wheat Crop Down 14 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. winter wheat production is down 14  
percent and the soybean crop is expected to rise to a record high 
as the lagging farm economy sends many farmers to alternative 
crops. 
</P>
<P>
	The monthly crop report issued by the Agriculture Department  
today also offered proof that the farm woes have taken a toll on 
cotton. Final 1998 production numbers show a 26 percent drop from 
the previous year. The 13.9 million bales produced last season, as 
many states endured drought and high temperatures, was the smallest 
crop since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Production of winter wheat is forecast at 1.61 billion bushels.  
The area for the 1999 grain harvest is forecast at 36.3 million 
acres, a 9 percent decrease from 1998. If realized, this would be 
the smallest winter wheat area since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, oilseed production is projected to increase nearly  
6 percent to a record 89.7 million tons. Most of the increase is in 
soybeans, which are expected to rise to a record 78.4 million tons. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean prices are expected to drop this season to $4.75 a  
bushel, compared to $5.05 last year and $6.47 in 1997. Still, 
soybean prices have fared better than wheat, which is projected to 
get around $2.60 to $3.10 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	The low prices are a continuation of a farm crisis that last  
year led Congress to pass a $6 billion aid deal for farmers. With 
the price problem expected to continue much of this year, some 
lawmakers are already discussing another bailout package for 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm-state Democrats have even launched an effort to get $4.7  
billion in emergency aid attached to a supplemental package now 
moving through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Orange production is also expected to take a hit, the government  
said. Production this season is forecast at 9.84 million tons, down 
1 percent from last month but 28 percent lower than last year's 
record 13.7 million ton crop.

<HEADLINE> Wesleyan Reviews Pornography Course </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIDDLETOWN, Conn. (AP) -- Students are defending a course at  
Wesleyan University that requires them to create a work of 
pornography as a final project. 
</P>
<P>
	The course, College of Letters 289, examines pornography as a  
cultural and political practice. 
</P>
<P>
	One student in Professor Hope Weissman's class submitted as a  
final project a short film that focused on a man's eyes while he 
masturbates. In another project, a female student acts out a scene 
of sexual bondage. 
</P>
<P>
	The projects have gotten the attention of university President  
Douglas Bennett, who in a memo dated Tuesday and distributed to 
faculty questioned ``the appropriateness of this course in the 
Wesleyan curriculum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett has ordered a review of the course.  
</P>
<P>
	Brian Edwards-Tiekert, a junior majoring in English and American  
studies, complained the review was spurred by media reports -- and 
not complaints from students or alumni. He said that shows the 
school is bowing to public pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's taken the faculty out of the equation'' Edwards-Tiekert  
said. ``It just seems like a very dangerous trend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Holder, a spokesman for Wesleyan, denied that the  
university is compromising academic standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``By asserting responsibility for the content of our curriculum,  
we are strengthening it,'' Holder said. 
</P>
<P>
	A phone message left Wednesday night for Professor Weissman was  
not returned.

<HEADLINE> Crude Falls Below $18 a Barrel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures fell below $18 a barrel Wednesday on the New  
York Mercantile Exchange after weekly inventory figures suggested 
U.S. gasoline inventories will be ample this summer despite 
producer cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, frozen concentrated orange juice futures  
soared, while cotton futures fell sharply on government supply and 
demand reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude tumbled after the American Petroleum Institute reported  
unleaded gasoline inventories jumped 3.66 million barrels last week 
to 222.42 million barrels -- more than three times the average 
analyst estimates. U.S. Energy Department figures were even more 
discouraging, with supplies building by 4.5 million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	The API figures showed implied daily gasoline demand to be 8.38  
million barrels, down from an average of 8.6 million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors now are concerned that after an early promising start  
of the driving season, summer demand may not reach record levels as 
predicted by the Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts are blaming the cooling demand on rising prices at  
the pump, which may have caused drivers in the important California 
region in particular to take to the road less. 
</P>
<P>
	The gasoline numbers helped reinforce sentiment that the world  
may remain awash in oil despite producers' concerted efforts to 
push prices higher with slashing output. 
</P>
<P>
	Royal Dutch-Shell Group and BP Amoco both acknowledged this week  
they have cut crude processing in Europe because of poor profit 
margins. Refiners suffer if the price of the crude they pay for is 
far higher than the products that come out of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Light, sweet crude for June delivery fell 49 cents to $17.57 a  
barrel; June unleaded gasoline fell 1.57 cents to 51.62 cents a 
gallon; June heating oil fell .66 cent to 42.43 cents a gallon; 
June natural gas fell 4.5 cents to $2.191 for each 1,000 cubic 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Orange juice futures moved sharply higher on the Board of Trade  
of the City of New York after the U.S. Agriculture Department's 
supply and demand report predicted Florida production will fall by 
2 million boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida is by far the nation's largest orange producer, and the  
USDA predicted this year's crop to be 188 million boxes, down about 
1 percent from the April estimate of a 190 million box crop and 23 
percent smaller than last year's record crop. 
</P>
<P>
	July frozen, concentrated orange juice rose 4 cents to 86.55  
cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton futures plunged on the New York Board of Trade after the  
government predicted farmers will harvest 18 million bales of 
cotton this year, a 29 percent increase over last year's small 
harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	The crop will add to already ample inventories that come as a  
result of weak global demand and poor quality. Market participants 
said farmers planted 4 percent more acreage to cotton this year 
because of relatively weak prices of other commodities. 
</P>
<P>
	July cotton fell 2.55 cents to 57.16 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Pollin To Sell Washington Capitals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Abe Pollin has agreed to sell the NHL's  
Washington Capitals and minority interests in the NBA's Washington 
Wizards and the MCI Center, WRC-TV reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Capitals would be sold to America Online executive Ted  
Leonsis, the station said, although it did not say whether shares 
of the Wizards and MCI Center would go to Leonsis or other 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollin scheduled a ``major announcement'' involving his teams  
for 5 p.m. EDT, according to a statement released by his 
organization, Washington Sports &AMP; Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL spokesman Frank Brown said the NHL was aware of the news  
conference and the TV report, but would have no other comment. NBA 
spokesman Chris Brienza said the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
	The report came as another NHL club, the bankrupt Pittsburgh  
Penguins, is close to being sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The Capitals would also be the second of three major sports  
teams sales expected this year in Washington. The NFL is expected 
to approve the sale of the Redskins to Daniel Snyder later this 
month, and D.C. United of Major League Soccer is also on the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of a sale has been circulating for months.  
Pollin spent about $200 million of his own money to build the 
downtown MCI Center two years ago, but his teams have continued to 
lose money since the arena opened in December 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	With more and more teams now being run by corporations, Pollin  
has been a throwback to the days of solo ownership. But the 
75-year-old executive never seemed comfortable with the high 
salaries and lifestyles of the 1990s athletes, and he was 
particularly discouraged by legal troubles involving Wizards 
players during the 1997-98 season. 
</P>
<P>
	This season for Pollin could be summed up in one word: losing.  
The Capitals and Wizards missed the playoffs for the first time 
since 1980-81. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wizards, despite the addition of Mitch Richmond to a  
high-payroll lineup that featured Juwan Howard and Rod Strickland, 
missed the playoffs during the lockout-shortened season. They fired 
coach Bernie Bickerstaff after 32 games and finished 18-32. 
</P>
<P>
	The Capitals, who made the Stanley Cup finals the year before,  
had their worst season since the early 1980s, finishing 31-45-6. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollin purchased the Wizards -- then known as the Baltimore  
Bullets -- in 1964 and became sole owner in 1968. He built his first 
arena, the Capital Centre in Landover, Md., in 1973 and moved his 
NBA team there. The Capitals, Pollin's expansion NHL franchise, 
opened play there a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollin is liked by most of the Washington community. He was  
applauded when he built the MCI Center downtown with his own money 
and was optimistic the move would help revitalize the nation's 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	But the arena hasn't been a panacea. Its showcase restaurant  
shut recently for nonpayment of taxes. The NBA lockout also kept 
the arena dark for many nights last fall, contributing to the 
team's losses and dampening the arena's impact on surrounding 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonsis is the president of AOL Studios, an arm of America  
Online that describes itself as the ``leading online content 
programmer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is a 1977 graduate of Georgetown University and has been  
labeled by The Wall Street Journal as ``one of the Web world's most 
influential players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman at America Online said the company was not  
involved in the purchase of the teams.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three weeks after the Colorado high school  
shootings, Republicans and Democrats skirmished over gun control 
and youth violence Tuesday in the prelude to an expected Senate 
showdown later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must do more to keep guns out of the hands of children,''  
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said as gun-control advocates 
readied a series of proposals ranging from an increase in the age 
for handgun possession from 18 to 21 and a measure to restrict 
sales at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without guns, families in Littleton, Colo., would not be  
grieving, and 15 people would be alive today,'' Kennedy added. 
</P>
<P>
	``Passing a law sounds good, but to really maximize our impact  
... we've got to prosecute the laws we've got,'' countered Sen. 
Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., as Republicans unveiled statistics showing a 
sharp decline in prosecutions for gun-related crimes since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Republicans focused their attention on the violence  
that sometimes underpins modern-day culture. Lawmakers attending 
their weekly closed-door caucus were shown a sequence from 
Basketball Diaries, a move in which a high school student mows down 
some of his classmates with a gun while some of his closest friends 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican and Democratic aides said the fate of the gun control  
proposals was unclear, with the shock of the Colorado shootings 
adding an element of uncertainty to what is customarily a hotly 
controversial issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, they said, Senate passage of the provision to place gun  
shows under the law requiring an instant background check on anyone 
purchasing a gun at a licensed dealer was possible by the end of 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Republicans and Democrats both embraced a proposal  
to ban firearms possession by any person who has been convicted of 
a felony as a juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond that, Republican sources, who spoke on condition of  
anonymity, said GOP leaders were confident they had enough votes to 
block efforts to reinstitute a three-day waiting period for handgun 
purchases or to limit gun sales to one per month, as some Democrats 
want. Less clear was the outcome of any vote on the proposed 
increase in the age for handgun possession from 18 to 21. 
</P>
<P>
	No gun votes were expected before Wednesday as the Senate worked  
its way through GOP-drafted legislation relating to juvenile crime 
prevention and enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's looming debate on gun control marked the latest  
response to the shootings on April 20 in a high school in 
Littleton, where two students killed 12 fellow students and a 
teacher before turning their guns on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Within days, President Clinton had called for fresh gun control  
restrictions and longtime advocates of such measures said their 
cause had fresh momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Clinton hosted a summit that brought together gun  
manufacturers and the entertainment industry for a discussion of 
youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online and the video game industry agreed at the meeting  
to plug a loophole that allows children to buy violent video games 
over the Internet that they are too young to buy in stores. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the American Shooting Sports Council, representing  
350 firearms manufacturers and distributors, endorsed a five-point 
administration plan for gun control, including background checks 
for firearms bought at gun shows and increasing the minimum age for 
buying a gun to 21. 
</P>
<P>
	But the White House excluded the National Rifle Association from  
the session, and the organization purchased newspaper ads accusing 
the administration of failing to enforce existing laws. If the 
White House had succeeded in driving a political wedge between the 
gun manufacturers and the NRA, the issue was also potentially 
explosive for some Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	While Democrats from urban states are among the strongest  
supporters of fresh gun control measures, their colleagues from 
Western states have been noticeably less vocal on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	The party's leader in the Senate, Sen. Tom Daschle of South  
Dakota, for example, issued a statement last week that embraced 
some of Clinton's proposals, but said others needed fresh scrutiny. 
In the past, Democrats have generally refrained from forcing gun 
control issues to a vote in the Senate in recent years for fear of 
putting vulnerable lawmakers at risk in an election year. 
</P>
<P>
	Most public opinion polls show strong support for gun control,  
but Democrats fear the political intensity of opponents, including 
the NRA. Some Democrats believe they lost control of the House in 
1994 in large measure because lawmakers who had supported gun 
control legislation were defeated.

<HEADLINE> Cincinnati Player Charged With Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- University of Cincinnati football player  
DeMarco McCleskey was arrested today on a rape charge and suspended 
from the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-year-old freshman is accused of attacking a 19-year-old  
woman. She told police she was asleep in her campus dorm early 
Sunday when McCleskey entered the room and raped her. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati athletes charged with violent crimes are suspended,  
and they are dismissed if convicted, athletic department spokesman 
Tom Hathaway said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> La. Bus Driver Had Health Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The driver of a bus that crashed on Mother's  
Day, killing 22 people, had been diagnosed with congestive heart 
failure -- a condition that should have kept him from behind the 
wheel, a federal investigator said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are delving into Frank Bedell's medical history to  
determine what role, if any, his health played in Sunday's tragedy. 
He remains hospitalized in critical condition with head and pelvic 
injuries and has not been interviewed by police. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedell, 46, was driving a group of mostly elderly women to a  
casino on Mississippi's Gulf Coast when his bus veered off a 
highway. 
</P>
<P>
	During an August 1998 physical exam, Bedell checked ``no''  
alongside every listed illness, including diabetes -- with which he 
was diagnosed in 1995 -- and cardiovascular disease, Ken Suydam of 
the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But when asked by the attending physician if he was taking any  
medications, Bedell ticked off a list of medicines that led the 
doctor to conclude he had congestive heart failure, Suydam said. 
Congestive heart failure is a condition in which the heart cannot 
pump enough blood to meet the body's demands. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctor approved Bedell's fitness for driving, Suydam said,  
despite a federal law that bars people with congestive heart 
failure from holding commercial drivers' licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the doctor also wrote ``congestive heart failure'' atop  
the form that was returned to Bedell's employer, Custom Bus 
Charters, Suydam said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was uncertain whether officials of Custom saw the notation or  
what, if anything, they might have been required to do, Suydam 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedell failed a routine drug test taken shortly after he was  
hospitalized Sunday, indicating that he had smoked marijuana at 
least once within the past 30 days, the Times-Picayune of New 
Orleans reported today, citing a doctor at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the newspaper quoted the doctor, who declined to be  
identified, as saying the test results do not necessarily mean 
Bedell was under the influence of drugs at the time of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedell tested positive for cocaine when he applied for a job  
with Greyhound in April 1997 and was not hired, said Suydam. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1997, Bedell gave the Greyhound physical results to  
Custom and passed another drug test, said Suydam. He also passed 
random drug tests required by Custom in April 1998 and October 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedell would have had to take a physical next November to renew  
his commercial driver's license and, because of his kidney disease 
and other health problems, probably wouldn't have passed the test, 
said Kay Covington, commissioner of the state Office of Motor 
Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``If his condition is as serious as we have been hearing since  
the accident, he probably wouldn't pass a test,'' Covington said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, investigators removed two electronic monitoring  
boxes from the engine and transmission of the mangled bus, hoping 
they will yield information in the same way that ``black boxes'' 
can offer clues about airplane crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedell and at least one witness have said Sunday's accident  
happened after a white compact car cut in front of the bus. There 
have been other reports that the bus narrowly missed hitting a 
green car just before it crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of dollars in cash and various valuables were missing  
from the bodies of four of the victims, family members said in 
today's Times-Picayune. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Marse, son of victims Arto and Juanita Marse, said most of  
their money and valuables were missing when he collected their 
belongings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither of them had near what they left with,'' he said. ``It  
was pathetic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Gagliano, spokesman for the coroner's office, said there  
were many passers-by at the crash scene before police secured it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time you get a disaster you expect things like that,''  
Gagliano said. ``There are so many people handling so many things. 
There's no way to control it. We expected it.''

<HEADLINE> Nintendo, Matsushita To Team Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Nintendo Co. and electronics giant  
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. will develop the next version of 
the Nintendo game console as part of a broad partnership, the 
companies said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The partnership is the second in recent months pairing a game  
maker and a major electronics company. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the alliance, Matsushita will provide digital video disc  
drives for the new Nintendo game machine, which will go on sale 
worldwide at the end of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The new game machine will be powered by an IBM PowerPC  
processor, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony and Toshiba Corp. announced in March that they will jointly  
manufacture the next generation of the PlayStation. 
</P>
<P>
	Putting games on digital video discs will be a big change for  
Nintendo, which has used specialized cartridges in previous 
versions of its game players. Sony's decision to use compact discs 
instead of cartridges was seen as a major reason for the popularity 
of its PlayStation. 
</P>
<P>
	Both CDs and DVDs are less expensive to manufacture than  
cartridges, making the formats popular with game developers. 
</P>
<P>
	Matsushita and Nintendo also said they will collaborate on other  
home electronics products -- possibly including a machine that could 
be used both to play games and view movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Matsushita sells products under the Panasonic, Quasar, and  
National brands.

<HEADLINE> N.M. Suspect May Have Killed More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOCORRO, N.M. (AP) -- The girlfriend of a man charged with  
sexually torturing three women told police he may have killed as 
many as 14 people and buried their bodies in ravines. 
</P>
<P>
	The information, which came in an interview with Cynthia Lea  
Hendy soon after her arrest, was released Wednesday by Deputy 
District Attorney Jim Yontz. 
</P>
<P>
	Hendy, 39, told police David Parker Ray, her boyfriend and  
co-defendant, disposed of the bodies in in Elephant Butte Lake, in 
south-central New Mexico's Sierra County. Hendy told police that 
Ray had killed men and women, including two women who appear in 
photographs being tortured. 
</P>
<P>
	Details from Hendy's interview could explain why law enforcement  
officials mounted a massive effort after a woman, bleeding and 
wearing only a padlocked collar, fled Ray's mobile home in Elephant 
Butte on March 22. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 100 agents from the FBI and state police investigated  
the case in the first few weeks, following leads in 10 states and 
using ground-penetrating radar and dogs trained to locate human 
remains. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents combed gullies in Sierra County and searched Elephant  
Butte Lake for bodies and other evidence. No bodies have been 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray's attorney, Jeff Rein, said Hendy's allegations came after  
she had worked out a deal with prosecutors that reduced both the 
number of charges she faced and her potential prison sentence -- 
from 198 years to as few as 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``She told them what they wanted to hear,'' Rein said. ``I think  
if they would have found any bodies after 45 days, we would have 
seen some charges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray, 59 faces 25 charges involving two women who accused him and  
Hendy of kidnapping and sexual torture. He waived a preliminary 
hearing on 12 additional charges related to a third woman who says 
she was kidnapped by Ray and his daughter Glenda Jean ``Jesse'' 
Ray, 32, in July 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Ray and his daughter have said they are innocent.

<HEADLINE> Primakov a Victim of His Popularity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Ousted Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov was widely  
admired even as Boris Yeltsin's own approval ratings plunged to the 
low single digits -- a factor that may have led the Russian 
president to fire him. 
</P>
<P>
	An experienced diplomat known for carefully deliberating his  
actions, Primakov, 69, was quiet about his political beliefs and 
did not assert his loyalty to any political force -- including 
Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he was seen as a patriot who ``protects the country's  
interests as he understands them, every time the country gives him 
the slightest opportunity to do so,'' columnist Alexander Minkin 
wrote shortly before Primakov's appointment last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	His wide popularity made him an ideal compromise premier between  
the Kremlin and the Communist opposition in parliament, and his 
appointment last fall quelled a major political feud. 
</P>
<P>
	But Primakov's growing popularity apparently became too much for  
Yeltsin and he fired him on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike his predecessor Viktor Chernomyrdin, Primakov was  
considered ``clean,'' without links to political parties or the 
often corrupt industrial managers and bankers who dominate Russian 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Primakov restored some measure of political calm to the country  
and helped bring at least temporary stability to the foundering 
economy. He paid back some wage and pension arrears, and was 
credited with inspiring hope among the Russians that the economic 
crisis could be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	He had even promised to restore Russia's national soccer team to  
glory. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Primakov didn't present a coherent plan for tackling  
the economic problems, and seven months into his tenure no 
breakthrough was in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, confidence in his government was surprisingly high,  
according to public opinion polls. For months there was talk about 
Primakov as a potential presidential candidate -- a notion he 
dismissed as ``rubbish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Primakov has a cordial, but cool stance toward the West,  
clashing with Western politicians on several issues in recent 
years. Still, was seen as a pragmatist. 
</P>
<P>
	Primakov vaulted to world attention in 1990-91 as the special  
envoy of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
	He was appointed head of the Soviet KGB's intelligence  
directorate in 1991, and stayed on through the collapse of the 
Soviet Union, Gorbachev's resignation, and the transformation of 
his KGB spy agency into independent Russia's Central Intelligence 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, as Yeltsin's spy chief and foreign minister, he developed  
Russia's ``multipolar'' view of the world, which sees its mission 
as fending off the United States as the world's only superpower. 
</P>
<P>
	An Arab affairs specialist, Primakov negotiated with Iraqi  
leader Saddam Hussein in December 1990 and January 1991 in a failed 
attempt to avert the 1991 Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Toy Sales Surge at Usually Slow Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Santa isn't set to arrive for seven more months,  
but it sure looks like Christmas right now at the nation's toys 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to the lineup of much-awaited ``Star Wars'' merchandise  
and continued demand for anything tied to Pokemon and Furby, toy 
shops -- both big and small -- say business is booming during what is 
typically the slowest time of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	That's good news following a disappointing 1998, when a shortage  
of blockbuster hits caused sales of toys to fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe how many people are here,'' said Stephanie  
Klein, on a recent visit with her son to FAO Schwarz in New York. 
``This is the time of year that you aren't supposed to wait in 
line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spring time usually is quite slow for toy retailers, who make  
the majority of their money during the fourth quarter as consumers 
buy gifts for the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales a year ago were particularly soft, after movies such as  
``Godzilla'' and ``Mulan'' were big disappointments at the box 
office and failed to spur toy sales. 
</P>
<P>
	But this year, merchants are getting a big sales jolt in the  
off-season. In recent weeks, there have been reports of crowds 
jamming stores and checkout lines running 10-people deep -- hardly 
typical for May. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding fuel to the buying-frenzy: a healthy U.S. economy that is  
giving Americans extra money to spend, combined with a wider 
assortment of must-have toys than in years past. 
</P>
<P>
	``These popular toys are the catalyst to draw them to the  
store,'' said Alan Marcus, a spokesman for FAO Schwarz. ``But many 
are buying something else once they are in the store.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's what Gina Diaz did this week while at FAO's New York  
store. After grabbing a few ``Star Wars'' action figures for her 
nephews, she also bought some Play-Doh and a Barbie doll for her 
nieces -- both impulse purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	``I usually avoid toy stores except for Christmas,'' said Diaz,  
who is from the Bronx borough of New York. ``But I came for the 
``Star Wars'' stuff and I decided to get a few other things while I 
was here just for fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new ``Star Wars'' merchandise -- from action figures to  
spinning lollipops -- hit store shelves on May 3. 
</P>
<P>
	While the first wave of buyers has been made up mostly of adult  
collectors, retailers anticipate demand to really soar once the 
film hits theaters on May 19 and children then want the toys 
they've seen on the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
	Merchants are also confident that traffic will continue through  
the summer as toymakers stagger the release of new ``Star Wars'' 
products over the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
	Also luring shoppers is the Pokemon craze, which hasn't slowed a  
bit since taking off late last year. More than 2.6 million of the 
$30 Nintendo Game Boy video games based on the fantasy Japanese 
cartoon have sold, and the hot-selling trading cards tied to the 
show's 150 animal characters are scarce nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are at the point that the cards are so popular that kids  
even want them in Japanese,'' said Bart Kaplan, manager at The Toy 
Box, a small toy shop in Thornwood, N.Y. ``I sold out of 600 packs 
in four days. It was incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Furby, meanwhile, remains the best-selling doll on the market.  
Since Christmas, more than three million have sold and retailers 
continue to bring in the talking, furry dolls from Asia by plane to 
keep up with demand. 
</P>
<P>
	New to toy stores -- but attracting crowds on the West Coast --  
are Tech Deck Fingerboards, miniature tabletop skateboards that 
look like the real thing but are operated with fingers rather than 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone was worried about what this year would be for the toy  
industry,'' said Chris Byrne, a New York-based toy industry 
consultant. ``But it has turned into a really amazing year and 
Christmas is in seven months.''

<HEADLINE> Kmart, Federated Earnings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Kmart Corp.'s first-quarter earnings climbed more than 40  
percent from a year ago as affordable prices and wide selection of 
merchandise lured shoppers to its stores. Federated Department 
Stores Inc.'s earnings jumped 48 percent from a year ago, topping 
Wall Street analysts' expectations. 

</P>
<P>
                            *Kmart Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	The Troy, Mich.-based Kmart earned $67 million, or 14 cents a  
share, for the quarter ended April 28, compared with $47 million, 
or 10 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales at the nation's third-largest retailer were $8.14 billion,  
up from $7.52 billion last year. Sales at stores open at least a 
year, an industry gauge of performance, rose 6.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Kmart's results met Wall Street analysts' expectations.  
</P>
<P>
	``Kmart's performance continues to gain momentum,'' said Kmart  
chairman and president Floyd Hall. ``Comparable sales growth was 
ahead of expectations for the quarter, while total sales increased 
at the highest rate in four years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kmart said its 1,377 recently refurbished Big Kmart stores,  
which combine full supermarkets with its discount stores, were 
doing well. Also strong were sales of its private-label merchandise 
lines -- including Martha Stewart home furnishings, and Route 66, 
Jaclyn Smith and Kathy Ireland apparel. 
</P>
<P>
	Kmart, with 2,151 stores, is the nation's No. 3 retailer behind  
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. 

</P>
<P>
                  *Federated Department Stores Inc.    	
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati-based retailer earned $87 million, or 40 cents  
per share, in the quarter ended May 1, compared with $60 million, 
or 27 cents per share, for the first 13 weeks last year, Federated 
reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose to $3.71 billion from $3.46 billion. Sales at stores  
open at least a year, an industry gauge of performance, were up 4 
percent for the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	April was the first month that results from Federated's recent  
acquisition of Fingerhut Companies Inc. were included in its 
financial results. 
</P>
<P>
	Federated is looking to benefit from Fingerhut's expertise in  
handling orders through catalogs and the Internet, in addition to 
database management and direct marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Federated's results topped Wall Street analysts' estimates. Its  
stock was up $2.25 at $53.25 in morning trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Federated operates more than 400 department stores in 33 states  
under the names Bloomingdale's, The Bon Marche, Burdines, 
Goldsmith's, Lazarus, Macy's, Rich's and Stern's. During the first 
quarter, it opened one department store, a Burdines in Tampa, Fla.

<HEADLINE> Bill Bradley Says Hard Work Pays Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Bill Bradley returned to a basketball  
court today to tell young people that, as an athlete, he learned 
that hard work pays off, and the same holds true in running for 
president and in life. 
</P>
<P>
	On his fourth trip to New Hampshire in his quest for the  
Democratic presidential nomination, Bradley said the American 
political system is based on a ``triangle of trust'' -- people 
trusting the president, trusting the political process and the 
president trusting that people will make good decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any decision a president makes will be based on that triangle  
of trust,'' Bradley said. ``The harder the decision, the more 
important that triangle is,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The former senator from New Jersey and NBA star used a  
basketball court as the backdrop for his remarks to about 200 young 
people and YMCA volunteers. He stressed the importance of hard 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having learned that lesson in the game, it is directly  
applicable to academic life, it is directly applicable to service 
in the Senate, and it is directly applicable to running for 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, voters asked Bradley about health care and prisoners  
of war in Vietnam. He refused to be pinned down, saying it is still 
early and he will make his opinions known sometime this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being an armchair quarterback is easy, and I'm not going to do  
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley met with 50 faculty members, students and area religious  
leaders at Rivier College in Nashua before speaking with 100 
supporters at a Laconia common. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy Schier, a Rivier administrator, said Bradley genuinely  
seemed interested in voter concerns, but ``he needs to communicate 
where he stands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Rivier, Bradley said Americans are groping for meaning in  
their lives, exemplified by the fact they move on average every 
seven years and by the existence of a popular perfume called 
``Eternity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The search for meaning has led many young people to volunteer  
work, but they remain alienated from politics because of its 
emphasis on money and polls, Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to put service at the center of politics,'' he said.  
``That's why I'm in this process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said he supports gun control, campaign finance reform,  
improving trade by raising living standards in other parts of the 
world, and making it easier to get health care. He did not say how 
he would accomplish those goals. 
</P>
<P>
	On the environment, he said, ``My approach would be to try to  
clean up what is polluted and prevent what is not polluted from 
becoming polluted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some recent polls showed a shrinking gap between Bradley and  
Vice President Al Gore, who leads by at least 20 percentage points 
in most of them. The Republican National Committee this month 
decided to begin spending as much time scouring Bradley's 
background as Gore's. 
</P>
<P>
	The move could indicate Republicans are taking Bradley more  
seriously, or could be an attempt to portray Gore as a weak 
candidate. Either way, Bradley said he is not concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really care what the Republican National Committee  
does,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Astros Coach Has Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Astros hitting coach Tom McCraw will  
leave the team after Sunday's game to begin treatment for prostate 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doctors tell us we have caught this in the early stages and  
we're confident Tommy will make a full recovery,'' general manager 
Gerry Hunsicker said. ``At this time, he is deciding which doctor 
he will work with and what course of action he will take.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCraw, in his third season with the Astros, was tested in  
spring training and a more recent biopsy revealed the cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	McCraw is the second Astros coach to be sidelined by illness.  
First base coach Jose Cruz is out three to four weeks while 
undergoing treatment for an irregular heart beat. Bullpen coach 
John Tamargo is coaching at first base in Cruz' absence. 
</P>
<P>
	Harry Spilman, Houston's minor league field coordinator, will  
assume hitting coach duties during McCraw's absence. Spilman, who 
played for the Astros, Tigers, Reds and Giants during an 11-year 
major league career, is expected to join the team this weekend 
during the Astros' three-game series vs. San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros were batting a league-leading .295 going into  
Wednesday night's game. McCraw's diagnosis was announced the day 
after his hitters set or tied several team records in a 19-8 
victory over Pittsburgh.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Students Charged in Bomb Scares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Seven teen-agers have been arrested on  
charges of threatening to detonate bombs at their high school, 
including one threat targeting Jewish classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	``A bomb is in the school to kill Jews,'' stated a note found by  
a student at Shawnee High School, The Philadelphia Inquirer 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Rory McGovern, 18, of Medford, was arrested May 3 on a  
charge that he used red lipstick to write one of four threats at 
the school 20 miles south of Trenton. 
</P>
<P>
	Six juveniles between the ages of 15 and 17 were charged Monday  
with various counts of causing a false public alarm, making 
terrorist threats and conspiracy. Each was released to parents. 
</P>
<P>
	The students have been suspended and face expulsion, said school  
spokeswoman Pat Milich. 
</P>
<P>
	The threats came in the aftermath of the shootings at Columbine  
High School in Littleton, Colo. Fifteen people died in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials said they hope the arrests will halt a recent  
spate of phony bomb reports that have forced evacuations.

<HEADLINE> Cat Thief Could Capture Preakness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Even if Charismatic doesn't come up with a  
suitable encore in the Preakness, there's still a chance that D. 
Wayne Lukas will be smiling broadly in the winner's circle. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because his other entrant, Cat Thief, could very well  
steal the show Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief took third in the Kentucky Derby, his 11th straight  
finish in the money since his maiden run in April 1998. He 
challenged for the lead from the outset and never dropped lower 
than second place before fading in the stretch and coming in less 
than a length behind Menifee. 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief ran a fine race, but was clearly overshadowed by his  
stablemate. Charismatic, a 31-1 longshot, rallied from seventh 
place to give Lukas his fourth Derby winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas, who was to arrive with both colts at Pimlico today, took  
a diplomatic approach in assessing the chances of his horses in the 
Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since they've got different owners, you can't pick between  
them,'' he said. ``You don't want to hurt anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The focus will be on Charismatic, of course, because he's the  
only horse in the field with a chance to win the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like when you win the Derby, everyone tries to figure  
out a way to beat you,'' Lukas said. ``This race may not suit him 
as well as the Derby. On the other hand, he's sharper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic ran five furlongs in 1:01 Tuesday, his final workout  
before being shipped to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Another notable trainer with designs of making some noise in the  
Preakness is Carl Nafzger, who will saddle Vicar with hopes that 
the colt's 18th-place finish in the Derby can be attributed 
entirely to an awful position in the starting gate (17th). 
</P>
<P>
	After watching the horse run five furlongs in 59 3-5 seconds at  
Churchill Downs on Tuesday, Nafzger declared Vicar primed and ready 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's steadier, more focused in what he's doing,'' Nafzger  
said. ``I was super impressed. I just hope we get a better post 
position. Regardless, with 14 horses we have a better shot at 
getting some rhythm going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Baffert, meanwhile, remained steadfast in his assertion that  
he will wait to decide what to do with his two talented fillies 
until after this afternoon's Preakness draw. Baffert has entered 
Silverbulletday and Excellent Meeting in both the Preakness and 
Friday's Black-Eyed Susan Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent Meeting finished fifth in the Derby; Silverbulletday  
won the Kentucky Oaks one day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're buddies, real good friends,'' Baffert said. ``Who'd  
ever think they'd be pals like that? I'm sure they discussed their 
races with each other in the barn.''

<HEADLINE> Grains Rise, Soybeans Retreat / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain futures moved higher Wednesday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade, while soybean futures retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures advanced after the U.S. Agriculture Department  
predicted this year's winter wheat crop will be 14 percent below 
year-ago levels after many farmers planted smaller acreage in light 
of weak export prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	Production of winter wheat is forecast at 1.61 billion bushels.  
The area for the 1999 grain harvest is forecast at 36.3 million 
acres, a 9 percent decrease from 1998. If realized, this would be 
the smallest winter wheat area since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures edged higher as scattered rains continued to delay  
fieldwork in parts of the Midwest, as the window of opportunity for 
planting closes. That could mean a smaller than expected corn crop, 
although gains were limited by ideas the rain would prove 
beneficial to crops already in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans fell after the government again predicted a record  
soybean crop this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 3 1/2 cents to $2.70 1/2 a bushel; July  
corn rose 1 cent to $2.23 1/4 a bushel; July oats fell 1 1/4 cents to 
$1.26 a bushel; July soybeans fell 2 1/4 cents to $4.75 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures were mostly lower on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while pork futures finished mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle fell .30 cent to 61.10 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .25 cent to 72.92 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
fell .12 cent to 59.85 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell .10 
cent to 58.95 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Announces Grants for Cops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton presented a new round of  
grants to hire community police officers Wednesday, checking off 
one of the biggest promises of his administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I signed the crime bill I pledged to help communities all  
over our nation fund 100,000 community police officers by the year 
2000,'' Clinton said. ``Today we are keeping the pledge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton presented $95 million in grants, created in the 1994  
crime bill, for a round of 1,500 officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will bring us to over 100,000 police officers funded,  
ahead of schedule and under budget,'' he said. Only half the 
officers actually are patrolling the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton used the announcement in the Rose Garden to celebrate  
what he said were the results of the 1994 crime bill -- a drop in 
murder rates and other violent crimes -- and to call for renewal of 
the community policing grants. 
</P>
<P>
	``In making America's thin blue line thicker and stronger, our  
nation will be safer,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans in Congress have been resisting the idea of renewing  
the community police grants, saying there is too little room in 
next year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``Funding existing programs is going to be tough enough; new  
ones are impossible,'' said Elizabeth Morra, spokeswoman for the 
House Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, Morra said, Clinton's budget would eliminate  
anti-crime block grants favored by Republicans. Republicans are 
anxious to see money set aside for a $523 million program that 
provided aid to local law enforcement agencies and $250 million in 
block grants for state and local juvenile crime programs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent Justice Department inspector general's report  
criticized several state and local police agencies for using the 
grants to supplant, rather than supplement, state and local funds. 
Also, GOP officials have contended that the grants program has not 
worked as promised. 
</P>
<P>
	But administration officials said there is a lag of up to 18  
months between the time an agency receives the funds and a new 
trainee is ready to hit the streets. They estimate that Clinton can 
boast of more than 50,000 officers already on the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also was pushing Congress to embrace his omnibus crime  
package. He unveiled legislation to combat terrorism by toughening 
penalties for unauthorized possession of harmful biological agents 
and holding certified handlers of such materials accountable for 
their misuse.

<HEADLINE> Study: Internet Privacy Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Businesses have made dramatic improvements  
since last year in warning people how companies use personal 
information collected about them at Web sites, an industry-financed 
study shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly two-thirds of commercial Internet sites displayed at  
least some warning that businesses were collecting personal details 
from visitors, such as names, postal and e-mail addresses, and even 
shopping tastes, the study found. But less than 10 percent of those 
sites had what experts consider comprehensive privacy policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Web sites sell the information to third-party advertisers  
and others. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar study last summer by the Federal Trade Commission  
found only 14 percent of sites warned how companies used private 
information they collected about customers. 
</P>
<P>
	FTC Commissioner Robert Pitofsky said companies on the Internet  
``deserve considerable credit for making progress over the last 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a remarkable increase in the number of Web sites  
posting information about their privacy practices,'' Pitofsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC expects to recommend to Congress this summer whether new  
Internet privacy laws are needed. It previously said that it wanted 
to see results from this latest study before making any decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry groups argued that merely doubling the number of sites  
with privacy notices from last year's 14 percent would represent 
substantial progress. The latest study found almost 66 percent of 
the 364 commercial Internet sites examined had privacy notices. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that policy-makers take a look at these numbers and are  
encouraged by the progress and increase their determination to work 
with the private sector ... rather than resort to additional, broad 
laws applied to the Net,'' said Harriet Pearson of IBM Corp., one 
of the companies that paid for the study. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was troubling news: less than 10 percent of the  
commercial Web sites with the personal detail warnings had privacy 
policies deemed comprehensive by experts. 
</P>
<P>
	Those sites notified consumers, gave them the chance not to have  
their personal information collected, allowed customers to review 
their information, promised to keep the information secure and 
explained how to contact the company with questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a survey that says only 10 percent of this narrow  
slice of the Web is providing notice that we think is the critical 
first step,'' said Deirdre Mulligan of the Washington-based Center 
for Democracy and Technology. ``Notice is clearly not enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House has agreed so far to allow the industry to  
develop its own guidelines because of concerns federal intervention 
could stifle the growth of electronic commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be people who will continue to call for  
legislation, but I think the message here is that this is 
working,'' said Christine Varney of the Online Privacy Alliance, an 
industry group. 
</P>
<P>
	People who do not use the Internet frequently cite privacy  
concerns as their primary reason for staying offline. The issue has 
taken on growing significance as more companies have begun selling 
products over the Internet, expected eventually to carry billions 
of dollars in transactions daily. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the largest companies on the Web, including IBM, America  
Online, Microsoft, Compaq and eBay, paid a total of $60,000 for the 
study, conducted by Georgetown University business professor Mary 
J. Culnan.

<HEADLINE> Last Cop-Hiring Subsidies Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is urging support for his  
crime-fighting proposals and seeking new controls on dangerous 
biological materials. 
</P>
<P>
	Announcing a milestone for his administration -- the federal  
funding of the 100,000th new police officer under the community 
policing component of his 1994 crime bill -- Clinton was presenting 
$95 million in grants today for a round of 1,500 officers. 
</P>
<P>
	He was pushing Congress to renew the community policing program  
for five years and embrace his omnibus crime package, especially 
its initiatives aimed at reducing juvenile violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also was unveiling new legislation to combat terrorism  
by toughening penalties for unauthorized possession of such harmful 
biological agents as anthrax and holding certified handlers of such 
materials accountable for their misuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It essentially bans the possession of these agents for other  
than peaceful purposes and makes the unsafe handling of them a 
crime as well,'' said an administration official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has made putting 100,000 new police on the streets a  
hallmark of his administration. Although the number of officers 
actually in place is lagging behind the number funded, White House 
officials said today's grants amounted to a goal attained. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 526 grants being announced today, officials said, were  
$2.3 million to hire 30 new officers for the Miami-Dade Public 
Schools police in Florida; $1.5 million to hire 20 new officers in 
Raleigh, N.C.; $1.9 million for 20 new officers in Fairfax, Va.; 
and $1.6 million for 21 new officers in Irvington, N.J. A 
half-dozen towns in Puerto Rico were receiving funds for 137 new 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have criticized the administration for failing to  
make good on the 100,000 cops pledge, and a recent Justice 
Department Inspector General's report criticized several state and 
local police agencies for using the grants to supplant, rather than 
supplement, state and local funds. 
</P>
<P>
	But administration officials said there is a lag of up to 18  
months between the time an agency receives the funds and a new 
trainee is ready to hit the streets, and they estimate that Clinton 
can boast of more than 50,000 officers already on the street. 
</P>
<P>
	There is also some flexibility for police agencies who want to  
use funds to upgrade communications and other gear in order to free 
officers for patrols.

<P>
	As to the Justice report, Jose Cerda of the White House domestic  
policy team noted that the agencies investigated represented less 
than 1 percent of the recipients and had been singled out for 
review because of administration suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every indication from the Justice Department, from surveys  
that they conduct regularly, is that every six months there are 
more cops on the street,'' Cerda said. ``The program is working 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants to extend the community policing program and spend  
$1.3 billion annually to help local law enforcement continue to 
hire more police, buy bulletproof vests and improved communications 
gear, hire more local prosecutors and engage schools and community 
leaders more closely.

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Meares on Disabled List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Pittsburgh Pirates shortstop Pat Meares was put  
on the 15-day disabled list Wednesday because of a tendon problem 
in the pinkie finger of his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an old injury, some type of tendon tear,'' Meares said.  
``It's been torn and I've been trying to play with it for three 
weeks. The doctor basically said play with it as long as you can 
until it really bothers you. I have no use of my pinkie and I was 
afraid it was going to affect another finger. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a lot of pain yesterday when I held the bat. I'm going  
to see a hand specialist tomorrow in Pittsburgh to see if I need 
surgery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meares is hitting .297 with no homers and five RBIs in 17 games.  
</P>
<P>
	``Right now we don't know how long he's going to be out,''  
Pittsburgh manager Gene Lamont said.

<HEADLINE> Home Resale Prices Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The price of existing homes went up in most of  
the nation's metropolitan markets during the first quarter of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The median resale price of used homes -- meaning half of them  
sold for more and half for less -- was $131,600 during the 
January-March quarter, the National Association of Realtors said. 
That was up 4.6 percent from the same quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	This contrasts with an inflation rate that was rising at only  
about a 1.7 percent annual rate during 1998 and kept to an even 
lower 1.5 percent rate so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rise in home prices in all regions has been fueled by a  
combination of buyers ready to move up to more expensive homes and 
a growing number of first-time buyers in this favorable economic 
environment,'' said James F. Smith, chief economist for the real 
estate group. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation enjoyed an unprecedented home-buying boom last year,  
attributed to low unemployment, rising incomes, continuing stock 
market gains and low mortgage rates. Sales of existing homes have 
continued to break records this year, rising at a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 5.88 million units from January through 
March, the group said, up 8.4 percent from the 5.24 million sales 
rate during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten of the 120 metropolitan areas surveyed by the trade group  
reported median resale price increases of 10 percent or greater, 
while 24 posted declines. 
</P>
<P>
	Median resale prices ranged from $65,700 in Ocala, Fla., to  
$331,100 in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The cities with the top five increases were: Kalamazoo, Mich.,  
13.6 percent; San Francisco, 13.2 percent; Miami-Hialeah, Fla., 
12.9 percent; Boise, Idaho, 12.4 percent; and San Diego, 11.6 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The cities with the five worst drops were Riverside-San  
Bernadino, Calif., 8.9 percent; Akron, Ohio, 7.3 percent; Omaha, 
Neb., 5.9 percent; Champaign, Ill., 4.6 percent; and Seattle, 4.5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	By region, the West and the Northeast posted the largest  
increases, 6.8 percent and 5.6 percent, respectively. The South 
lagged, with a 2.9 percent rise. In the Midwest, the median prices 
advanced 4.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Samaranch's IOC Reform Tactics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The latest reshuffling of the deck at the International Olympic  
Committee leads to one inescapable conclusion: Three-card monte is 
about to become an Olympic sport. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no better explanation for the bait-and-switch games  
Juan Antonio Samaranch has been perfecting the past few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Every time the clamor grows for the IOC strongman to do  
something about the serial bribe-taking and pleasure-tripping by 
his cronies on the committee, Samaranch turns over a card and -- 
voila! -- suddenly the corruption is somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	His most impressive sleight-of-hand came earlier this month,  
when the Spaniard named a task force to review IOC membership 
policies and standards, voting practices and public accountability. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since the bribery scandal broke last fall, Samaranch has  
come under increasing pressure by some very powerful Americans to 
clean up the IOC's act. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Justice Department opened an investigation into the  
Salt Lake City bidding process. Former Senate Majority Leader 
George Mitchell headed a special ethics panel that went so far as 
to draw up a blueprint. Not long after that, Sen. John McCain 
chaired a Senate Commerce Committee that promised a string of 
hearings to find out how things were going. 
</P>
<P>
	What he learned last week is that all those promises about ``no  
more business as usual'' must have been made by Samaranch while his 
fingers were crossed. 
</P>
<P>
	Though nearly three dozen IOC members were implicated in various  
bribery scandals, only 10 have resigned or been expelled so far, 
though one high-ranking member, Australian Phil Coles, is still 
twisting in the wind. But the chances for any further reforms were 
seriously damaged when Samaranch announced the makeup of ``IOC 
2000,'' the task force that will chart the course for the Olympic 
organization into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
	Original plans called for a panel of two dozen members, tops,  
most of them drawn from outside the IOC. The first hint that those 
plans were being scrapped came with a report that a provisional 
list was being floated that contained more than 60 names. The final 
version was even worse than critics feared. 
</P>
<P>
	``IOC 2000'' now has 80 members, 44 of whom are IOC members. Its  
three most important committees -- the bid process, administration 
and mission -- are headed by loyalists who owe Samaranch their 
Olympic careers. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Anita DeFrantz is one of those loyalists, the American  
rower who went on to become an IOC vice president has not lost any 
of her candor. ``What's the new IOC?'' she said, repeating a 
question put to her recently. ``The (old) IOC without 10 members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No matter. Just the whiff of reform apparently is good enough  
for some people. After several U.S. corporations had proved 
skittish about going ahead with planned sponsorship deals, General 
Motors stepped forward Tuesday to say it would honor every penny of 
the $1 billion it promised the U.S. Olympic Committee -- beginning 
almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing quite captures center stage like the Olympics,'' GM  
vice president and marketing chief Phil Guarascio said at a news 
conference in Detroit, adding that the world's No. 1 automaker will 
launch 17 months of ads for the 2000 Summer Games during next 
month's NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	For all the knocks the Olympic movement has taken, it still  
possesses what advertisers like to call the ``halo effect.'' The 
greedy behavior by nearly one-third of the IOC membership made that 
halo seem tattered and cockeyed. Though nothing substantial has 
changed, GM stepped up Tuesday to say everything looked fine from 
where it stood. 
</P>
<P>
	To drive the point home, the company hired sportscaster Bob  
Costas (from NBC, which holds the U.S. Olympic TV rights through 
2008) as master of ceremonies for Tuesday's event. Then it trotted 
out a half-dozen U.S. gold medalists to tell stories about the 
sacrifices they made to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	The GM announcement wasn't unexpected, since the company  
announced its sponsorship long before the current scandal broke, 
and shoring up the Olympic ``brand'' is as much about protecting 
its investment as anything else. But there was a lingering sense 
that the long arm of the U.S. Olympic Committee was somewhere in 
the background, nudging GM toward the spotlight and holding up the 
cue cards. 
</P>
<P>
	How the USOC got involved isn't hard to guess. The sad thing is  
that if Samaranch and his country-club pals knew half that much 
about sacrifice as the athletes they pretend to represent, they 
wouldn't be stumbling about, calling in every marker they can find. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Safety on Ark. Tour Boat Discussed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) -- A survivor of a tour boat accident in  
which 13 people drowned said today that the operator offered no 
safety instructions before piloting the amphibious craft onto Lake 
Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
	Diane Ledin's testimony at a U.S. Coast Guard hearing  
contradicted that of driver Elizabeth Helmbrecht, who testified 
Tuesday that she had instructed passengers on how to use the life 
jackets before their $9 excursion began May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Ledin said the driver showed passengers where the life  
preservers were but didn't say how to use them or point out any 
other safety features on the boat, known as a duck because it 
travels on both land and water. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Ledin said she probably would not have survived if she  
had put on a life preserver. The buoyancy would have trapped her 
inside the vessel, under a canopy where investigators say most of 
the victims were found. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had a life jacket on, I wouldn't be here today. I  
honestly feel it would have been more of a detriment,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other survivors have said the bulky preservers might not have  
fit through a narrow opening between the sides of the boat and the 
canopy. 
</P>
<P>
	At the weeklong hearing, Mrs. Ledin said that what seemed like  
``a wall of water'' poured into the vessel just minutes after what 
was scheduled to be a 30-minute excursion on Lake Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We looked around and the water just gushed in. I don't think  
anybody had any time to react,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Ledin said she and her husband, Gary, were seated  
side-by-side. They were the only passengers not to lose a family 
member. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were so thankful, but we just felt guilty because we made  
it as a family and nobody else did,'' Mrs. Ledin said. 
</P>
<P>
	A rescue diver, Michael Roberson, testified today that while  
most of the victims were found beneath the boat's canopy, others 
were outside the boat. With the depth and darkness they probably 
didn't know which way to swim, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``At 34 feet, in fresh water, you begin to lose buoyancy. Air is  
compressed and you lose buoyancy. If you're trying to swim, you 
wouldn't know which way was up,'' said Roberson, a Garland County 
sheriff's deputy. Lake Hamilton is murky and the boat sank to a 
depth of nearly 60 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Ms. Helmbrecht broke down on the stand as she  
recounted the final minutes before the Miss Majestic slipped 
beneath the surface. She told the panel that there were no signs of 
trouble until shortly before the boat sank. 
</P>
<P>
	About five minutes into the tour, the amphibious boat became  
sluggish, she said. When it tilted slightly to the left, she asked 
a passenger to move to balance the weight. But water began pouring 
in from the bottom and from the rear ``like a propeller'' was 
blowing it in, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the passengers, `Grab a vest and get off. We're going  
down,''' she said. ``It seemed like slow motion. Nobody would move. 
They just were real orderly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she had no time to grab a life jacket. She said she  
tried to save a young boy as the boat went down, grabbing his hand 
and leading him toward an opening under the canopy. He was jerked 
away from her, apparently by the force of the water, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened two days after Ms. Helmbrecht had taken  
her boat to mechanics and complained that its bilge pump was 
switching on and off erratically. She said she was assured that the 
repairs had been made. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspectors checked out two pumps Wednesday night and both  
worked, the Coast Guard said today. The main bilge pump was 
dismantled and sent off for a detailed inspection, the service 
said.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Announces Grants for Cops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton presented a new round of  
grants to hire community police officers Wednesday, checking off 
one of the biggest promises of his administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I signed the crime bill I pledged to help communities all  
over our nation fund 100,000 community police officers by the year 
2000,'' Clinton said. ``Today we are keeping the pledge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton presented $95 million in grants, created in the 1994  
crime bill, for a round of 1,500 officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will bring us to over 100,000 police officers funded,  
ahead of schedule and under budget,'' he said. Only half the 
officers actually are patrolling the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton used the announcement in the Rose Garden to celebrate  
what he said were the results of the 1994 crime bill -- a drop in 
murder rates and other violent crimes -- and to call for renewal of 
the community policing grants. 
</P>
<P>
	``In making America's thin blue line thicker and stronger, our  
nation will be safer,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans in Congress have been resisting the idea of renewing  
the community police grants, saying there is too little room in 
next year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``Funding existing programs is going to be tough enough; new  
ones are impossible,'' said Elizabeth Morra, spokeswoman for the 
House Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, Morra said, Clinton's budget would eliminate  
anti-crime block grants favored by Republicans. Republicans are 
anxious to see money set aside for a $523 million program that 
provided aid to local law enforcement agencies and $250 million in 
block grants for state and local juvenile crime programs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent Justice Department inspector general's report  
criticized several state and local police agencies for using the 
grants to supplant, rather than supplement, state and local funds. 
Also, GOP officials have contended that the grants program has not 
worked as promised. 
</P>
<P>
	But administration officials said there is a lag of up to 18  
months between the time an agency receives the funds and a new 
trainee is ready to hit the streets. They estimate that Clinton can 
boast of more than 50,000 officers already on the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also was pushing Congress to embrace his omnibus crime  
package. He unveiled legislation to combat terrorism by toughening 
penalties for unauthorized possession of harmful biological agents 
and holding certified handlers of such materials accountable for 
their misuse.

<HEADLINE> Korean Hospital Workers on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Thousands of South Korean metal and  
hospital workers walked off their jobs Wednesday to protest planned 
layoffs and wage cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said about 20,000 workers were participating, but the  
government put the figure at fewer than 8,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Gap-yong, head of the Confederation of Korean Trade Unions,  
said more metal, hospital and insurance company workers would join 
the walkout this week. But the government said the strike was 
fizzling on its first day. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of the 35 unions that the militant labor confederation  
urged to go on strike Wednesday failed to heed the call as workers 
showed little enthusiasm, the Labor Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's walkout was led by 4,000 union workers at carmaker  
Ssangyong Motor Co. who fear layoffs after their company's merger 
with Daewoo Motor Co., South Korea's No. 2 car maker. 
</P>
<P>
	Ssangyong's assembly lines ground to a halt.  
</P>
<P>
	About 400 nurses and other workers at Seoul's state-funded Korea  
Cancer Center Hospital walked off their jobs to protest the 
hospital's plan to shed workers and cut wages by 7 percent. A lack 
of staff forced the hospital to postpone nonemergency surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second strike in a month called by the labor  
confederation to protest planned layoffs by manufacturers grappling 
with a severe economic recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The group has not been able to muster strong support in recent  
months amid public concern that rekindled labor unrest could scare 
off foreign investors just as the economy is showing signs of 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has gotten tougher as well. It used police to  
break an illegal subway strike last month and fired dozens of union 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea was forced to accept a $58 billion bailout from the  
International Monetary Fund in late 1997. In return, it promised 
structural reform of industries, which expanded rapidly during the 
boom years of the 1970s and 80s.

<HEADLINE> Plains Tornadoes Yield Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORMAN, Okla. (AP) -- The vision of scientists taming deadly  
storms isn't likely to become a reality, researchers say. They 
don't even know yet how giant tornadoes are born. 
</P>
<P>
	But a University of Oklahoma researcher who trailed the funnels  
that killed 41 people last week predicts more may be learned from 
that May 3 evening than a decade of storm chasing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to make quantum leaps, I think -- I hope,''  
professor Howie Bluestein said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, viewing the ruins Saturday of neighborhoods  
swept away in the storms, suggested seeing if the ``frontiers of 
science can widen to the point where we can dilute the strength of 
the storm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll put Oklahoma at the center of that,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But it's unlikely the strength of storms is something that can --  
or should -- be tamed, said Harold Brooks, research meteorologist at 
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National 
Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman. 
</P>
<P>
	Tornadoes spin from thunderstorms that hold the energy of ``an  
atomic bomb explosion per second,'' he said. ``If we take that 
option away from the thunderstorm, it may respond in some way that 
is even less friendly than a tornado.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the technology existed, Brooks doubts taxpayers would  
support the cost of maintaining the equipment, such as a fleet of 
aircraft, to attack and dilute storms. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado that hit the Oklahoma City suburbs last week reached  
wind speeds of 318 miles an hour, according to readings taken by 
one of the University of Oklahoma's Doppler on Wheels radar trucks. 
It was rated F-5 on the Fujita scale, the highest ranking for 
twisters. 
</P>
<P>
	Two teams led by Joshua Wurman, an assistant professor in the  
meteorology department and head of Oklahoma University's storm 
tracking unit, intercepted the storm system that afternoon west of 
Lawton and trailed its path past Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	Later that night, the team followed a mile-wide tornado that  
plowed through the town of Mulhall. ``We had one radar watch a 
powerful tornado be born,'' Wurman said. ``That's another piece of 
the puzzle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Down the hall from Wurman's office, Bluestein pointed to an  
image recorded by another Doppler radar on the truck his team drove 
near the storm. Tiny dots appear in the center of a mass of 
swirling red and blue that show varying wind speeds. 
</P>
<P>
	``These were small tornadoes within the large cone,'' he said.  
The radar image might help explain phenomenon such as a mobile home 
in Bridge Creek that was sucked away by a tornado while lawn chairs 
sat undisturbed nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Bluestein, who has been tracking tornadoes across the prairie  
since 1977, said it could take months or even years to interpret 
all the data collected that evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're ever going to be able to modify  
tornadoes,'' he said. ``We still need to understand how tornadoes 
form.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If researchers can do that, Brook said, they might be better  
able to predict intensity and tailor storm warnings accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
	``My house takes an F-1 tornado. ... In an F-3 tornado, our  
interior hallway is almost certainly survivable, although we may 
lose a good part of the house,'' Brooks said. ``In an F-5 tornado, 
we're dead if we're there.''

Tempted Stakes Nov. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh What a Windfall returned $22.40, $8.90 and $4.60. Paved in

<HEADLINE> Alexander Urges Support for Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Lamar  
Alexander said Wednesday that the tumult in Russia's government 
``could be a force for stability'' and should not diminish U.S. 
support for President Boris Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Arguing that the Russian leader could emerge stronger from the  
political chaos, Alexander said, ``Yeltsin has more lives than any 
cat we know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, in a telephone interview during a campaign stop in  
New York, said the Clinton administration should not overreact to 
the abrupt firing of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov or the 
upcoming impeachment proceedings against Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is a valuable ally, particularly when the country is in a  
position to help end fighting in Kosovo, said the former Tennessee 
governor, who visited Russia in November 1998 to meet political 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new prime minister is well respected and could be a force  
for stability,'' Alexander said. ``There will be an initial 
temptation to say we should review our (international) loans, that 
we should step back from involving Russia in Kosovo but we should 
stay the course, push right ahead and continue our relationship 
with them as before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet even as Alexander made the remarks, Yeltsin was warning that  
Russia may pull out of Kosovo talks. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate phone interview, Alexander urged President Clinton  
to go to Congress for the authority to ``win the war quickly'' in 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I regret that we are in it,'' he said. ``But now that we are  
in it, we have to win it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until then, he said, the NATO bombing should continue.  
</P>
<P>
	Alexander said that once the president has asked ``for the full  
support of the American people,'' he should be given ``all the 
options he needs'' to get Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to 
withdraw his troops from Kosovo and allow the ethnic Albanians to 
return home. 
</P>
<P>
	Firing Primakov and replacing him with Interior Minister Sergei  
Stepashin, as acting prime minister will strengthen Yeltsin's hand, 
Alexander said. ``He dismissed one prime minister and appointed 
another. The new one is the Interior minister who is in control of 
the police. Yeltsin is probably a good deal more secure than it 
look like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the appointment of Stepashin, a Yeltsin ally, appears to  
have little chance of approval in the Duma, the lower house of 
parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin is now on a collision course with the parliament, which  
is scheduled to begin impeachment proceedings Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should not be surprised if Yeltsin dissolves the  
parliament,'' Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if that would be a bad move, Alexander said, ``It's a  
matter of Russian politics but we should not become overly 
concerned about it because the Duma is filled with Yeltsin 
opponents and he might do it just to keep them off balance.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Report: NYSE Brokers Under Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal prosecutors and regulators are  
investigating dozens of New York Stock Exchange floor brokers who 
may have illegally shared profits with customers, The Wall Street 
Journal reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight brokers already face charges for improper trading.  
Prosecutors are preparing for a June 1 trial in the case of five of 
those eight brokers, a broker-dealer and two of its principals. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Attorney's office, in a letter to defense attorneys in  
the case, said investigators have reason to believe 64 other 
brokers traded in accounts in which they shared customers' profits, 
possibly violating securities laws, people familiar with the letter 
told The Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers are prohibited from trading with their own money.  
However, defense attorneys for brokers headed to trial have argued 
that the stock exchange until recently took the view that it wasn't 
illegal to share in profits with customers for whom they trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Walker, enforcement director at the U.S. Securities and  
Exchange Commission, confirmed that ``an investigation is ongoing 
with respect to floor brokers'' on the NYSE and that the SEC is 
participating. 
</P>
<P>
	But he declined further comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The exchange's approximately 500 independent floor brokers trade  
blocks of stock for outside brokerage firms or large professional 
investors. They have access to highly sensitive information about 
trading at the exchange, so the exchange bars them from trading for 
themselves or putting their trading interests ahead of clients.

<HEADLINE>  Pollin To Sell Washington Capitals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Abe Pollin plans to sell the NHL's Washington  
Capitals and his minority interests in the NBA's Washington Wizards 
and the MCI Center to America Online executive Ted Leonsis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to stress here and now that I am not retiring.'' Polin  
said Wednesday at a news conference. ``I never planned to retire. I 
am going to be actively involved and in control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 75-year-old executive, accompanied by his wife and two sons,  
said his family agonized about the decision for months because ``we 
did not want a repeat of the mess that the Redskins went through in 
their transition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	News of the sale came as another NHL club, the bankrupt  
Pittsburgh Penguins, is close to being sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The Capitals would be the second of three major sports teams  
sales expected this year in Washington. The NFL most likely will 
approve the sale of the Redskins to Daniel Snyder this month, and 
D.C. United of Major League Soccer is also on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollin said he decided to sell after his sons told him they had  
no interest in leaving their careers to take over his business. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were talked to by a lot of people, met with a lot of people  
and there was one person who stood out among all of them,'' Pollin 
said of Leonsis, whom he called ``a really good and kind person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pollin said he still has big sports aspirations.  
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to bring another NBA championship to Washington and  
we're not going to quit until we do it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My hope and my prayer is that I'll be able to spend a little  
more time with a little bit more money that I have now with people 
who are little less fortunate than we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of a sale has been circulating for months.  
Pollin spent about $200 million of his own money to build the 
downtown MCI Center two years ago, but his teams have continued to 
lose money since the arena opened in December 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	With more and more teams now being run by corporations, Pollin  
has been a throwback to the days of solo ownership. But he never 
seemed comfortable with the high salaries and lifestyles of the 
1990s athletes, and he was particularly discouraged by legal 
troubles involving Wizards players during the 1997-98 season. 
</P>
<P>
	This season for Pollin could be summed up in one word: losing.  
The Capitals and Wizards missed the playoffs for the first time 
since 1980-81. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wizards, despite the addition of Mitch Richmond to a  
high-payroll lineup that featured Juwan Howard and Rod Strickland, 
missed the playoffs during the lockout-shortened season. They fired 
coach Bernie Bickerstaff after 32 games and finished 18-32. 
</P>
<P>
	The Capitals, who made the Stanley Cup finals the year before,  
had their worst season since the early 1980s, finishing 31-45-6. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollin purchased the Wizards -- then known as the Baltimore  
Bullets -- in 1964 and became sole owner in 1968. He built his first 
arena, the Capital Centre in Landover, Md., in 1973 and moved his 
NBA team there. The Capitals, Pollin's expansion NHL franchise, 
opened play there a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollin is liked by most of the Washington community. He was  
applauded when he built the MCI Center downtown with his own money 
and was optimistic the move would help revitalize the nation's 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	But the arena hasn't been a panacea. Its showcase restaurant  
shut recently for nonpayment of taxes. The NBA lockout also kept 
the arena dark for many nights last fall, contributing to the 
team's losses and dampening the arena's impact on surrounding 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonsis is the president of AOL Studios, an arm of America  
Online that describes itself as the ``leading online content 
programmer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is a 1977 graduate of Georgetown University and has been  
labeled by The Wall Street Journal as ``one of the Web world's most 
influential players.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Sentenced for Fake Hate Mail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The problem began in December 1996 when United  
Parcel Service began delivering overnight envelopes scrawled with 
racist words and phrases to prominent black leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	When the shipping company protested that its employees weren't  
to blame, FBI agents fanned out to discover whether the envelopes 
were part of a racist plot or an attempted extortion scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	The final chapter came Tuesday when former law student Angela  
Jackson was sentenced to five years and five months in federal 
prison for scheming to defraud UPS out of hundreds of thousands of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were so many falsehoods and lies, they were like  
dandelions in the spring grass,'' U.S. District Judge Charles 
Norgle declared. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old Jackson, who is black, had claimed that white  
racists working for UPS had damaged or lost four packages 
containing her artwork. She tried to collect $143,500 for each of 
the packages. 
</P>
<P>
	To make her claim credible, Jackson scrawled racist remarks on  
letters sent via UPS to herself and several prominent black 
leaders, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, NAACP President Kweisi 
Mfume and eight members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Her aim was to make it appear the remarks were written by UPS  
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who is not related to Jesse Jackson, was also convicted  
of trying to torpedo the career of a Chicago police sergeant who 
arrested her in 1996 by making it look as if the officer had stolen 
her credit card. 
</P>
<P>
	She took the witness stand at her trial and tried to talk her  
way out of trouble but became hostile and defiant under 
cross-examination. At one point, she called prosecutor Ryan Stoll 
``an animal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the sentencing, she apologized to her family, seated in  
court, saying she was ``sorry that their introduction to the 
American judicial system had to be so negative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norgle said that Jackson ``has not shown remorse for what she  
has done.'' But he declined to impose the maximum sentence of 6 1/2 
years, saying she is young and had a troubled youth. 
</P>
<P>
	She was a student at Chicago-Kent College of Law and later  
transferred to William Mitchell College of Law in St. Paul, Minn.

<HEADLINE> Food Prices Not Likely To Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Growers trying to eke out a living amid a  
lagging farm economy can expect low prices again this year for 
rice, soybeans and other crops. 
</P>
<P>
	But consumers might not find lower prices for food products and  
other goods, industry analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will the consumer see the benefit of it?,'' said Joe Miller of  
the American Farm Bureau Federation. ``The answer is probably no. 
The (retail) industry because of packaging and handling costs. . . 
they don't tend to lower their prices when the raw commodity prices 
fall apart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows there is a real disconnect in what the actual price  
of wheat or corn is and what the consumer pays for it,'' Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Major cereal makers, for instance, recently announced breakfast  
cereal price increases of 2.5 percent to 3 percent, even while 
wheat prices are at their lowest in years. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation is similar in the cotton industry, which recently  
completed the 1998 season at 13.9 million bales -- the smallest crop 
since 1989. Cotton farmers are getting significantly less for their 
crop, about 56 cents a pound compared with 64 cents a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But does that mean Americans will pay more for blue jeans,  
T-shirts and other textiles because of short supplies? Not exactly, 
says Mark Lang, director of economic services for the National 
Cotton Council. 
</P>
<P>
	A surge in foreign textiles entering the country is leaving the  
American consumer ``unscathed with maybe actually a small 
benefit,'' Lang said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the U.S. imported the equivalent of 12.5 million  
bales, compared with 8.7 million in 1996. Most of that surge is due 
to the economic crisis in Asia, which has left that part of the 
country searching for customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the finished textile product is significantly different  
from the raw product, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	In general, Miller of the American Farm Bureau predicts ``a  
rough year price wise'' after ``some fairly low prices'' in the 
last half of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could see even lower prices in 1999 for most of the  
commodities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress passed a $6 billion bailout package for farmers last  
year and lawmakers are talking about a similar deal in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Total wheat production is down 12 percent to 2.2 billion  
bushels. The smaller crop coupled with increased exports will give 
wheat prices a slight boost, to $2.60 to $3.10 a bushel, compared 
with $2.65 last year, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat prices have not been this low since the 1987-88 season  
when farmers got $2.57 a bushel. In the 1997 and 1996 seasons, 
wheat farmers got $3.38 and $4.30, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, rice prices are expected to average $6 to $7 per  
bushel, compared with $8.55 to $8.75 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean prices are also forecast to drop to between $3.95 and  
$4.75 per bushel, compared with an estimated $5.05 last year and 
$6.47 in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Finding Old Stocks Brings New Cash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	While stationed in Pakistan with an engineering company, R.W.  
Johnson Jr. decided to put $5,000 in a growing Swiss mutual fund as 
an investment for the future. That was around 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	After a little globetrotting, some job changes and his marriage  
to Louise 10 years later, he lost track of the fund -- and the fund, 
the notorious Investors Overseas Services of Geneva, which folded 
amid scandal in the early 1970s, lost track of him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was told they weren't worth anything, and he kept thinking,  
'I'll throw them out ...,''' recalled Louise Johnson, of Escondido, 
Calif., whose husband passed away in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, the Johnsons redeemed those shares for $7,500.  
</P>
<P>
	``When he finally got the money, he said it felt like a  
windfall. He bought a pickup truck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Countless other families have had similar stories to share: Old  
stocks and bonds turning up in attics, closets or safe-deposit 
boxes, most of which had been lost or forgotten over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	In most cases, the companies that issued them have long  
disappeared, which means the certificates probably have no 
intrinsic, or market, value. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there are some instances when a company may have been  
acquired or changed its name, so owners might be able to recover 
some money if they can track down the company. Also, some defunct 
companies may have had funds set aside in bankruptcy court to repay 
creditors or shareholders, which had been the case with the 
Johnsons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people that have old stocks and bonds, especially from  
companies that went bankrupt, believe they lose everything no 
matter what. It's not true ... (but) they don't know how to get 
their money,'' said Pierre Bonneau, chief executive of Stock Search 
International Inc. in Tucson, Ariz., one of several companies 
specializing in tracking old securities. The company helped the 
Johnsons get money back from their old fund shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when a stock isn't actually redeemable -- and Bonneau says  
only 20 percent are -- a growing number are getting attention from 
collectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock Search conducts about 150 searches a month. It charges $85  
per search, and keeps around 30 percent of whatever money is 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the largest securities research firms is R.M. Smythe of  
New York (www.rm-smythe.com). For $75, Smythe provides a report 
detailing a company's history -- any name changes, mergers, 
bankruptcies, predecessor and successor companies. If the 
researched security has no market value, Smythe says it will make 
an offer for it as a collectible. 
</P>
<P>
	For those with the time, and inclination, it's possible to do a  
search on your own. 
</P>
<P>
	The first stop should be a broker. He or she may be able to tell  
if a security is still traded on an exchange, or if the company 
might have merged with another over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	Another good source: the Internet, where you can search for a  
company name or product. A listing of resources can be found at 
www.HappyTrails.com. It even has direct links to the Securities and 
Exchange Commission Edgar Archives. (For you low-techers: Financial 
reference books found in many public libraries are available.) 
</P>
<P>
	The transfer agent listed on the front of each certificate is  
another potential source. However, if the agent no longer exists, 
the state where the company was incorporated, which is usually 
listed on a certificate, may help. Contact the Secretary of State

<HEADLINE> 'Monica's Story' Hits Bargain Bin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- From Barbara Walters to the bargain bin. Two and  
a half months after the release of ``Monica's Story,'' the former 
White House intern's best seller has joined the ranks of the 
``remaindered,'' books offered at a big discount. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a common approach that publishers use to try to boost  
sales of a hardcover that's lagging,'' Jim Milliot, business and 
news editor for the trade magazine Publishers Weekly, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Monica's Story,'' easily the year's most-publicized book, came  
out in early March, the day after Ms. Walters interviewed Ms. 
Lewinsky on national television. 
</P>
<P>
	Although hated by reviewers, it was hardly a commercial flop.  
According to John Murphy, director of publicity at St. Martin's 
Press, the book easily sold out its initial printing of 350,000 and 
has now sold about half a million copies in the United States 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very pleased with how the book did,'' Murphy said. He  
added that the publisher is hoping to clear the way for the mass 
market paperback, to come out this summer with a first printing of 
500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Martin's is urging stores to sell the hardcover at half its  
$24.95 list price. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest in the book followed the pattern of such previous  
news-driven best sellers as ``The Starr Report'' and O.J. Simpson's 
``I Want to Tell You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Written by Princess Diana biographer Andrew Morton, Ms.  
Lewinsky's memoir about her affair with President Clinton 
immediately topped best-seller lists and soon faded. 
</P>
<P>
	Within weeks, ``Monica's Story'' was being outsold by another  
Clinton-related book, ``All Too Human,'' by former White House aide 
George Stephanopoulos. Ms. Lewinsky's book is now No. 1,675 on the 
sales list of Amazon.com, the online store. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anybody is surprised,'' Milliot said. ``I think  
most predictions were that it would have a short shelf life.''

<HEADLINE> USA Networks Abandons Lycos Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- USA Networks Inc. officially called off plans to  
buy Internet site Lycos Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Networks chairman and CEO Barry Diller had planned to create  
a company worth $22 billion by combining Lycos with his Home 
Shopping Network and Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch Inc., a ticket 
agency and online entertainment directory. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies announced today they had called off the deal by  
mutual consent. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the termination agreement, Lycos has agreed to pay USA  
Networks $35 million if it agrees to be acquired by someone else 
before July 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the companies said they had reached an agreement  
under which Ticketmaster and CitySearch services will be featured 
on Lycos Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Diller couldn't win over small day traders who own a major stake  
in Lycos and trade it in average blocks of 419 shares. In addition 
to the small investors, Diller failed to keep the support of Lycos' 
largest shareholder, CMG Information Services, a Boston-based 
investment firm that owns about 20 percent of the Internet company. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders want the Waltham, Mass.-based company to remain a  
pure Internet company, and avoid the traditional business problems 
of a retail company like Home Shopping Network, which include 
inventory controls and distribution. Lycos' Web site offers 
research, news, music and shopping links. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos investors criticized the deal when it was announced in  
February and have swamped Internet chat rooms and message boards 
with virulent and caustic opinions about the deal, Diller and Lycos 
chairman Bob Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	CMGI, which originally supported the deal, reversed itself after  
Lycos shares nosedived. The firm then hired the investment banker 
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter to help find a more favorable suitor to 
knock out Diller's bid. While CMGI does not appear to have found 
one, smaller investors cheered the prospect that Lycos may again be 
a target for a takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Networks owns the Home Shopping Network and is a majority  
shareholder in Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch.

<HEADLINE> Ordonez Comfy As White Sox Cleanup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Magglio Ordonez moved into right field as a  
rookie last season and found a home. Now the Chicago White Sox have 
given him a bigger assignment: fill in the huge No. 4 hole in the 
batting order created by the departure of Albert Belle. 
</P>
<P>
	Ordonez won't put up Belle-like numbers, but he's shown in his  
short stint as the cleanup hitter that he can be a consistent run 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think my concentration has been better and I'm getting a lot  
of good pitches to hit, and I'm being patient,'' Ordonez said after 
Wednesday night's game with the Texas Rangers was rained out. 
</P>
<P>
	Since moving into the cleanup spot April 15, Ordonez has batted  
.318 with seven homers and 25 RBIs. For the season, he's hitting 
.296 with eight homers and 29 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Best of all for the White Sox, he's making decent contact with  
only 11 strikeouts in 115 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to be a good hitter. I can hit home runs, but I'm  
not a home run hitter,'' Ordonez said. 
</P>
<P>
	``With home runs, you just never know. Sometimes, you can go 20  
or 30 games without one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ordonez was named the American Association Player of the Year at  
Triple-A Nashville in 1997, winning the batting title with a .329 
average. He was promoted to the majors and in 21 games showed 
promise with four homers and 11 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Then last year he took the right field job, hitting .282 with 14  
homers and 65 RBIs in 145 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Early this season, the Sox experimented with Paul Konerko at  
cleanup before moving up Ordonez. So far, it has worked. 
</P>
<P>
	At 25, Ordonez is currently one of the best bargains in baseball  
with a salary of $275,000. He will continue to get RBI 
opportunities with Ray Durham, Mike Caruso and Frank Thomas ahead 
of him the order. All have a penchant for getting on base, 
especially 1997 batting champion Thomas, who has walked more than 
100 times in eight straight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frank is always on and there will be lot of chances for me,''  
Ordonez said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers and White Sox will make up Wednesday's postponement  
as part of an Aug. 13 doubleheader beginning at 5:05 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Parque, Chicago's scheduled starter Wednesday, will pitch in  
Friday's series opener against the Yankees at New York. John Snyder 
will start Saturday and Mike Sirotka will pitch Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas will move Mark Clark, Wednesday's scheduled starter, to  
Friday for the second game of a four-game series at Arlington 
against the Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Morgan will start Thursday night followed by Clark, Rick  
Helling on Saturday and Aaron Sele on Sunday. Sele's start will 
depend on his health after he missed his turn Tuesday night because 
of the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Gonzalez, who had to leave Tuesday night's game in the  
fourth inning with a strained hamstring, an injury suffered while 
running the bases after a home run, was not in the Rangers' posted 
lineup before Wednesday's game was called off. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez will be evaluated on a daily basis.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Seeks To Boost Even Start Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly a million low-income preschoolers get a  
Head Start, participating in the 30-year-old education and health 
program. But for the last decade, many fewer children have been 
getting an Even Start. 
</P>
<P>
	The $135 million Even Start Family Literacy program has combined  
early-childhood reading lessons with adult basic education and 
parenting training for eligible families. And Wednesday its 
creator, Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., said he would seek $500 million 
from this year's spending bill to boost the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our quest for a literate society has come along way,''  
Goodling, chairman of the House Education and Workforce Committee, 
said at a hearing Wednesday. ``The academic success of the child is 
strongly related to the ability of their parents to support their 
education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Start serves about 31,000 families, compared with 800,000  
children in Head Start, which provides education, health screenings 
and family social services and is administered by the Health and 
Human Services Department, not the Education Department. Parents 
receive some of the services in Head Start. 
</P>
<P>
	During last year's renewal of the Head Start law, GOP lawmakers  
pushed for it to be more of an educational program and include 
specific skills that children should learn. 
</P>
<P>
	With Even Start, children, age 8 and under, read and play games  
to improve their literacy. At home, their families read together, 
draw and tell stories. And their income-eligible parents must study 
for the General Educational Development certificate or take classes 
in basic adult education, parenting and job training. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even Start has been right on the mark,'' said Andrew Hartman,  
director of the National Institute for Literacy. ``Given the role 
that a high school diploma plays in opening doors to both job and 
educational opportunities, this is an important outcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Brown, Even Start director in Oklahoma City, said Even  
Start children are helped by the program's emphasis on their 
parents earning their GED certificate or taking classes in basic 
adult education. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even Start has a lot to contribute to welfare reform,'' she  
said. ``It helps the second generation by not warehousing the child 
somewhere while the mom goes to a minimum wage job. The parent and 
child learn together. They spend more time together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Goodling is hoping to apply those principles -- partnership,  
self-reliance, local involvement -- as he leads the Republican 
congressional majority in its first chance to put its stamp on the 
34-year-old Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the 
comprehensive law that governs Even Start and most other federal 
kindergarten-through-12th grade programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats controlled the House from the time the law was enacted  
in 1965 through 1994, when it was last reauthorized. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, who has focused on programs to end ``social  
promotion'' of students not academically ready to advance to the 
next grade and reduce class sizes by hiring new teachers, has 
championed Head Start. Under his administration, Head Start 
spending has increased by 68 percent and enrollment has increased 
by more than 200,000 children. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Start has also grown. It started in 1989 with about 2,500  
families, compared with the 31,000 today. 
</P>
<P>
	--Even Start grants last about 8 years, after which a program  
must come up with its own funds. Head Start programs are steadily 
funded, but must come up with matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
	--Even Start grants are administered by schools and community  
groups. Head Start centers are generally run independently of 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	--Even Start programs -- nearly 700 nationwide -- are required to  
form local partnerships. Many partnerships are with Head Start 
centers, which can operate alone. 
</P>
<P>
	The Education Department found that Even Start adults and  
children reached goals such as earning the GED credential and 
increasing reading test scores. A research panel was created last 
year to measure the quality in the Head Start program.

<HEADLINE> AOL Considers Net TV Possibilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America Online Inc., which connects 17 million  
subscribers to the Internet through computers, now is looking to 
establish its service through television sets. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, AOL announced new partnerships with DirectTV, Hughes  
Network Systems, Philips Electronics and Network Computer Inc., to 
develop a system to connect televisions to the Internet by using 
satellite dishes, high-speed digital subscriber lines and 
high-speed modems. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Schuler, president of America Online's Interactive  
Services Group, said the proposed system also would allow viewers 
to watch TV while surfing the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The targeted audience, he said, are the AOL subscribers who  
already access the service through personal computers. While the 
computer will still be the main device used to access the service, 
he said, AOL would like to expand onto other appliances in the 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts saw the deals as a good first step toward  
AOL's goal of reaching viewers through other means besides the PC. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've pretty well maxed out the number of people signing up  
using computers,'' said Gerry Kaufhold, a multimedia and digital 
television analyst for Cahners In-Stat Group, a market research 
company for emerging technology in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaufhold said AOL is getting pinched by AT&AMP;T, which is moving  
aggressively to provide high-speed hookups to the Internet using 
recently acquired cable systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``AOL is in a footrace,'' he said. ``It expands their turf from  
the 14-inch monitor in your den to the 36-inch TV in your living 
room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If AOL succeeds in drawing in more viewers, it could increase  
their advertiser base and revenues. The new system is scheduled to 
be available some time in 2000, said Schuler.

<HEADLINE> Gas Additive May Not Ease Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New questions are being raised about the  
required use of reformulated gasoline in many parts of the country 
after a group of scientists concluded that the fuel's high oxygen 
content does little to stem urban smog. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of the National Academy of Sciences said in a report  
Tuesday that the oxygen-boosting additives used in the gasoline are 
believed to reduce peak ozone levels ``by only a few percent'' in 
urban areas with serious smog problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Ground-level ozone, or smog, has declined more than 10 percent  
since 1986 in urban centers and continues to decline. But the 
11-member panel said ``it is not certain that any part of these 
trends can be significantly attributed to the use of reformulated 
gasoline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study, which had been requested by the Environmental  
Protection Agency, said reformulated gasoline does have a number of 
characteristics, other than higher oxygen levels, that do lower 
pollution from automobiles and light trucks. The group made no 
recommendation on whether to continue the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Reformulated gasoline has been required by the EPA since 1995 in  
areas that have severe smog, including in all or parts of 17 states 
from New England to Texas and Wisconsin, as well as California. 
</P>
<P>
	But the most widely used oxygenate, MTBE, has been the focus of  
controversy as critics argue that it has its own environmental and 
health risks. Maine this month stopped requiring the special 
gasoline and has asked to get out of the federal program. 
California reversed course and said it would ban the additive 
beginning in 2002 because MTBE has been found in lakes and streams. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of MTBE or ethanol to gasoline, in itself, ``is  
likely to have little air quality impact in terms of ozone 
reduction,'' the study by the Academy's National Research Council 
said. It said reductions in volatile organic compounds and carbon 
monoxide from cars ``appears to be quite small'' and that the 
additive may lead to more nitrogen oxide being released. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozone, or smog, is the result of sunlight interacting with a  
number of pollutants including hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides 
from tailpipe or evaporation from motor vehicles. At high levels, 
especially in summer, it is a severe irritant that can damage lung 
tissues and aggravate respiratory problems. 
</P>
<P>
	While the EPA said it supports the technical findings of the  
report, it said the study should not dissuade the continued use of 
the reformulated blends of gasoline. The agency in a statement that 
the report confirms that the gasoline additive reduces toxic 
emissions and that it has the potential of cutting smog-causing 
chemicals from cars as much as 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cleaner gasoline are an important tool for achieving cleaner  
air and protecting public health and we expect that some form of 
cleaner gasoline will always be in demand,'' EPA spokesman David 
Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	William Chameides, the science panel's chairman and a professor  
at the Georgia Institute of Technology, also said the report should 
not be interpreted to suggest reformulated gasoline be abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not at all,'' Chameides said in a telephone interview. ``We  
are simply looking at the impact.'' He said that overall 
reformulated gasoline may be environmentally beneficial, but that 
``it is not possible to attribute a significant portion of past 
reductions in smog to the use of these gasoline additives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Oxygenated Fuels Association, a trade group, said the report  
``is completely at odds with a host of real world findings ... 
which show that (reformulated gasoline) with oxygenates is working 
effectively in helping clean up our air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA directed in 1993 that reformulated gasoline, containing  
an oxygen additive, be used in nine urban areas with the most 
severe smog problems. Other states were allowed to begin requiring 
the fuel is some counties if they wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently the cleaner gasoline is used in all or part of 16  
states: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, 
Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New 
York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	While Maine is still formally part of the program, awaiting EPA  
approval to leave it, the special gasoline stopped being sold in 
the state this month.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Welfare Recipients Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Major changes in the nation's welfare laws  
have moved millions of families off the rolls, but to where? 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly two dozen state studies paint a clear if preliminary  
picture: 
</P>
<P>
	Most have jobs. They earn more than they got from the  
government, but not enough to escape poverty. And while 
homelessness and other worst-case scenarios are rare, a substantial 
number face daily financial difficulties, such as trouble paying 
for food and keeping the phone connected, an Associated Press 
review of the studies shows. 
</P>
<P>
	In assessing the growing body of information, it's easy for  
analysts to focus on the data that supports their convictions, said 
Mark Greenberg of the liberal Center for Law and Social Policy. 
Work rates are up, yet so are daily struggles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to see those are both part of the story,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	America's welfare rolls have dropped further and faster than  
anyone predicted. Fueled by the strongest economy in a generation 
and strict new work requirements and time limits, the rolls have 
dropped from more than 5 million families in 1994 to just 2.7 
million by the end of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually every state has a study under way to see where these  
former recipients have landed. Some examine wage reports from 
employers to see who is working. Others use telephone surveys. Some 
go door-to-door. 
</P>
<P>
	The differences in methodology make it difficult to compare  
states. And critics warn that some surveys have low response rates, 
raising suspicions that those who are hardest to find may be having 
the most trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the current results offer a wealth of new information.  
</P>
<P>
	The most basic question is whether people are working, and the  
results range from 35 percent in Mississippi to 75 percent in 
Florida. Most states hover between 50 percent and 65 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates appear lower among those who were kicked off welfare  
because they wouldn't follow the rules. In New Jersey, for 
instance, just 29 percent of this group had jobs when surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Even some liberal analysts find the data more positive than they  
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a picture in my head of most former welfare recipients  
being destitute and left out in the cold, but I've had to rethink 
that opinion,'' said Sarah Brauner, a researcher with the Urban 
Institute, who has reviewed many studies. 
</P>
<P>
	But others argue the nation should expect more given the strong  
economy and the billions of dollars states can spend. In most 
cases, even those who work don't leave poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, a state board decided that $10 an hour was needed  
for ``self-sufficiency,'' but just 4 percent to 8 percent of state 
residents leaving the welfare rolls were earning that much. 
</P>
<P>
	In most states, those working tend to earn just above minimum  
wage, with averages ranging from $5.50 per hour to $7.50 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Maryland found wages rose as people had been off welfare  
longer, suggesting they were moving up the economic ladder. 
</P>
<P>
	But people who have left welfare share many problems:  
</P>
<P>
	--Substantial numbers say there was a time when they couldn't  
afford to buy food -- 43 percent in Florida and 32 percent in 
Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	--Many get behind paying utility bills -- 59 percent in Florida.  
</P>
<P>
	--In New Orleans, which conducted its own study, 22 percent have  
had their phones cut off. 
</P>
<P>
	--In Wisconsin, 68 percent say they are ``just barely making it  
from day to day.'' In South Carolina, 56 percent say that. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a tiny number report being homeless or having to give up  
children to foster care. 
</P>
<P>
	Many sound positive about their new lives. In Kentucky, more  
than half say they are better off since leaving welfare. In South 
Carolina, 59 percent say they have more money now. In Mississippi, 
60 percent say life was not better before. 
</P>
<P>
	In Iowa, 40 percent said their income went up after leaving  
welfare, while 49 percent said it went down. 
</P>
<P>
	So how are people supporting themselves, particularly those not  
working? 
</P>
<P>
	Most rely on friends and family. In Florida, 23 percent said  
they had moved in with someone else to help pay bills. In New 
Mexico and New Jersey, nearly half got help from family. 
</P>
<P>
	But some experts worry this support may not last. Patience may  
wear thin, generosity may run out, and many of these families and 
friends are poor, too. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, advocates and state officials alike worry that  
many people are not using -- and may not know about -- government 
supports. That includes Medicaid, food stamps and child care 
subsidies, all of which are available even after a family stops 
receiving cash welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	In Massachusetts, just 7 percent of families who left welfare  
get food stamps. In South Carolina, just 13 percent are getting 
child care subsidies. In Michigan, barely six in 10 get Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether the early findings spell success depends largely on  
expectations.

	``The ambition of the program is to turn welfare poor into  
working poor and give them a chance at something better,'' said 
Jack Tweedie of the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
``The program is not going to convert the welfare poor into the 
middle class, and we shouldn't look at it that way.''

<HEADLINE> Star Luge Racer Back After Injuries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) -- Duncan Kennedy, the most successful  
singles luge racer in United States history, announced his return 
to international competition Wednesday after an absence of two 
seasons due to physical problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-time Olympian (1988, 1992, 1994) from Lake Placid,  
N.Y., was diagnosed with bleeding on the brain stem in the fall of 
1997 and was forced to retire and forego a fourth Olympic team 
berth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started to think about returning last winter as the symptoms  
were clearing and thought more about it this spring,'' Kennedy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	During that time, Kennedy, 31, was racing competitively on the  
eastern snowboard circuit, coaching luge juniors and luging 
recreationally in Lake Placid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I missed the sliding, the travel, the people and the racing  
most of all,'' he admitted. ``Now the symptoms have basically 
cleared and the doctors are confident that I can do this. Dr. 
(Michael) Edwards (of Sacramento), the neurologist, said it was 
more a matter of controlling non-physical stress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Edwards has said that the symptoms are stable and activity  
will not be harmful,'' said U.S. Luge team physician Dr. Brad 
Stephens of Lake Placid. ``We also have independent neurologic 
evaluations from Burlington (Vt.) and Boston that feel it is safe 
for Duncan to compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added USA Luge trainer and strength and conditioning coach Dan  
Smith: ``Dr. Edwards is very comfortable that luge and physical 
training should not exascerbate Duncan's situation. Dr. Stephens 
and I will monitor him closely and re-evaluate if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tested him at our spring camp last weekend and he felt  
good. Duncan's test results were comparable alongside our other 
athletes. Currently, there are no limitations on his physical 
training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is one of two areas in which the veteran luger will have to  
excel in order to be completely reinstated. The U.S. coaching staff 
has insisted that he pass the conditioning test this summer. 
Thereafter, Kennedy will enter a race-off series in October against 
four teammates and must place in the top two in order to be 
guaranteed a spot for the fall World Cup trip to Europe. Anything 
less would require concurrence by the coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy, who gained worldwide reknown as much for standing up to  
a group of neo-Nazi skinheads in Germany in 1993 as for his luge 
prowess, has 21 international medals including the United States' 
first-ever World Cup gold during the 1991-92 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I plan on coming back strong, hopefully on the podium next  
season,'' he said. ``I felt great last year on the sled and I think 
it'll be a lot of fun. I'm very lucky to have this opportunity to 
come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's return will make him the fourth-oldest competitor on  
the tour when the 1999-2000 season begins in November. Austrian 
Markus Prock will be 35, Jens Mueller of Germany 34 and Georg Hackl 
of Germany 33.

<HEADLINE> Siena Hopes To Play Baseball in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUDONVILLE, N.Y. (AP) -- Siena College's baseball team has  
applied for permission to play in Cuba next winter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Franciscan college in suburban Albany has filed papers with  
the U.S. Treasury Department and the Cuban Intersection seeking 
permission for the January trip, athletic director John D'Argenio 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to raise the profile of our baseball team,''  
D'Argenio said. The Division I team posted a school record 31 
victories this season. They finished as the Metro Atlantic Athletic 
Conference North Division champions and will compete this week in 
the MAAC tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Travel from the United States to Cuba has been restricted for  
more than 40 years under the Communist control of Fidel Castro. 
Though American tourists are still not allowed in Cuba, the 
Baltimore Orioles played in Cuba last month against the Cuban 
National Team and the Cuban team played in Baltimore last week. 
</P>
<P>
	If Siena's trip is approved, they team will play a Cuban team  
that is at its competitive level, D'Argenio said. A decision is 
expected within four to six weeks.
