ABU DHABI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farouq Ahmed
Leghari left here today for home after a three-day official
visit to the United Arab Emirates(UAE) in a bid to boost
economic cooperation between the two countries.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Leghari, who arrived here Saturday, told reporters that
Kashmir is the biggest problem blocking the improvement of the

<HEADLINE> Canada's Economic Ranking Drops, Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Canada has dropped to 14th spot from
ninth in an international ranking of economic freedom, says a
report released today.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong placed first on the list of 115 countries, followed
by Singapore, New Zealand and the United States, according to the
report compiled by 47 economic institutes.
</P>
<P>
Algeria had the world's lowest rating, followed by Croatia,
Syria and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The report said Canada's decline occurred even though its
freedom score remained the same.
</P>
<P>
"Canada's loss in position was due to the significant increases
in economic freedom in Costa Rica, Australia, Panama, the
Philippines and Mauritius, all of which were less free than Canada
in last year's measurement," a Canadian economist was quoted as
saying by reports today.
</P>
<P>
The rating is based on 17 factors that measure infringements of
basic economic freedoms, such as the freedom of exchange, the
freedom to keep one's earnings and the freedom to own private
property and use it for personal and commercial purposes.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled "Economic Freedom of the World 1997", said
countries that offered their citizens more economic freedom had
higher incomes and faster rates of growth.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji
and Australian leaders expressed here today their optimism about
the prospects of friendly and cooperative relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Chinese vice-premier was told by Australian
Governor-General William Deane that Australia sincerely hopes to
maintain and expand its friendly and cooperative relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with the Australian governor-general, the
Chinese vice-premier said this visit made him firmly believe that
the prospects of Sino-Australian relations are bright.
</P>
<P>
On a separate occasion, the Chinese leader was told by Prime
Minister John Howard that Australia adheres to the one-China
policy and does not believe that a powerful China will pose any
threat to any other countries.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with the Chinese leader, Howard described
his recent visit to China as a success.
</P>
<P>
The Australian prime minister went on to say that he had
established good relations with Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Australian leader said that Vice-Premier Zhu's visit has
deepened mutual understanding and helped the two countries reach
consensus on many important issues, thus contributing to the
further development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Howard said China's growing economy will open up better
prospects for mutually-beneficial Australian-Chinese ties.
</P>
<P>
Australia will continue to commit itself to cooperation with
China in broader fields, the prime minister noted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice-premier told Howard that the Chinese
government attaches great importance to Sino-Australian relations.

<P>
Sino-Australian ties in general have been smooth since the two
countries established diplomatic relations in 1972, and the
exchange and cooperation in various fields have been improving,
Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
There are broad prospects for Sino-Australian cooperation on
the basis of mutual benefit, the vice-premier added.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to make further efforts with Australia, on the
basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence, to push
Sino-Australian relations to a new high," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"China's further reform and opening up and Australian
government's long-term policy towards Asia will enable the two
countries to be each other's important trade and investment
partner," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier expressed his appreciation of the Australian
government's adherence to the one-China policy.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Gets Tough on Land Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- China will put a one-year freeze
on the use of land for non-agricultural purposes and launch an
unprecedented investigation on land-abuse cases so as to curb the
sharp shrinkage of cultivated land, a top land official said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national working conference in Beijing, Zou
Yuchuan, director of the State Land Administration, said that
"strict measures should be taken to protect cultivated land which
has a direct bearing on the grain output."
</P>
<P>
During 1986 and 1995, 70 million mu (about 4.7 million
hectares) of cultivated land were lost for construction for
non-agricultural purposes.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, developers have left large tracts of the land idle
or used them with a poor efficiency. Duplicated construction has
also led to a waste of land resources, Zou said.
</P>
<P>
In order to strengthen the protection of cultivated land, the
Chinese central authorities recently issued a notice putting a
one-year freeze on the use of cultivated land by non-agricultural
projects, lasting from April 15 this year to April 14 of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The notice, issued by the Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee and the State Council, is serious and must be carried
out without delay, the director said.
</P>
<P>
Zou also said that China will exercise a land check of
unprecedented scale. Both in urban and in rural areas, all land
used for construction projects between 1991 and the end of 1996
will be scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
SLA will soon send seven groups to various areas to urge local
government agencies to begin the checks. In August, the
administration, along with the Ministry of Supervision and other
relevant departments will handle the remaining land cases.
</P>
<P>
The administration is studying possible problems that might
arise in the check and ways to deal with them, so that officials
who illegally approve land or dispense with land wastefully, as
well as other lawbreakers, will be held responsible for their
wrongdoings, Zou said.

HONG KONG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- How long can a dragon be? Now the
answer can be found in Nathan Road, Tsim Sha Tsui of Kowloon,
where you see the head of a dragon, but definitely not its tail.
</P>
<P>
With its head facing the Victoria Harbor at Tsim Sha Tsui and
the tail reaching the end of Nathan Road, the Guinness-record
3.5-kilometer-long dragon delineated with neon lights is scheduled
to unveil its full lines in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
This is only one of the hundreds of activities that Hong Kong
people have been staging to celebrate Hong Kong's return to China
which falls on midnight, June 30.
</P>
<P>
The enthusiasm of the Hong Kong people toward the historic
event seems to have no bounds -- in terms of the scale of various
activities they have organized or are organizing and their
generosity in giving out money to make the whole thing possible.
</P>
<P>
"We are all Chinese and we are all descendants of the Dragon --
the auspicious token of the Chinese nation, so we chose the Dragon
to be the main theme of our celebration," said Lau Tak Ki,
director of public relations of the Kowloon committee for
celebrating Hong Kong's handover to China, who supervises the
erection of the dragon.
</P>
<P>
He said the large dragon contains nine smaller dragons,
indicating the name of Kowloon which means "nine dragons" in
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The more than seven million HK dollars (900,000 U.S. dollars)
for setting up the dragon has been contributed by people from all
walks of life, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mass celebrations actually started more than a year ago, when
clocks were set up in many places in both the mainland and Hong
Kong to count down the days and minutes up to July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
"This is the time to celebrate," said Philip Lai, chairman of
the Pat Heung Rural Committee in the "New Territories". "We've
been under colonial rule for 156 years and everybody is glad that
it is coming to an end and we are back to ourselves."

<HEADLINE> Philippine Inflation Rate Continues to Dip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' year-on-year
inflation rate dipped further to 4.6 percent in April from 4.8
percent in March, the National Economic and Development Authority
said today.
</P>
<P>
The monthly inflation rate also went down to 0.1 percent in
April from 0.8 percent in March, according to a report released
today by the authority on the country's economic fundamentals in
April.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the slight drop to lower price changes in
all major components of the consumer price index, except for fuel,
light and water during the month.
</P>
<P>
Among the regions that posted higher monthly inflation rates,
the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao recorded the highest of
0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed that the exchange rate depreciated
against the US dollar from 26.33 pesos to one dollars to 26.36
pesos in April.

Lai and his fellow villagers have donated over a million HK
dollars (128,000 U.S. dollars) to erect an 11.6-meter-high
monument to mark the handover.
</P>
<P>
"This will be the first permanent building in Hong Kong in
commemoration of the handover, we will try to finish it by
mid-June," Lai said proudly.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's return bears a special meaning to people in the
"New Territories" -- in 1899 their ancestors fought fiercely
against the British aggressors and many of them sacrificed their
lives.
</P>
<P>
In this respect the Tang family in Ping Shan of Yuen Long is
representative. On the memorial tablet enshrined in the family's
temple are the names of more than 100 of their ancestors who died
in those battles. For celebration purpose, they built a
16-meter-high flag post to hoist the five-star national flag.
</P>
<P>
"Pen Cai" is a kind of local-flavor banquet in the area --
roasted pigs, chickens and other meat are chopped into square
pieces and put into one big bowl for the whole table to enjoy. It
is usually arranged for grand occasions, but now the local people
are doing it fairly frequently and in large scale, usually with
more than 1,000 people attending, on various festivals such as the
100-day countdown to the handover.
</P>
<P>
"Every village in my township will gather together to enjoy Pen
Cai in the days before and after the handover," said Lai.
</P>
<P>
So far all industries, social groups and religious
organizations in Hong Kong have established handover celebration
committees, which together will hold hundreds of celebration
activities. These activities are mostly self-sponsored and
self-funded.
</P>
<P>
This festive atmosphere will reach its peak on the night of
July 1, when a comprehensive joint performance is staged in the
Victoria Harbor. It will be the largest-ever mass activity in Hong
Kong's history involving 31 brightly-decorated ships, fireworks,
laser lights and colored fountains, which will cost over 100
million HK dollars (12.82 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Sales of Existing Homes in US Declines in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Sales of previously owned homes
fell by 2.4 percent in April, the second monthly decline in a row,
the U.S. National Association of Realtors reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the existing single-family homes sold at a
seasonally adjusted 4.09 million annual rate, down from a 4.16
million rate in March and 4.23 million in February,
</P>
<P>
Despite the declines of two continuing months, the existing
home sales remained at high level and was only a little below last
May's record high of a 4.28 million rate.
</P>
<P>
For all of 1996, the sales in the U.S. totaled 4.08 million,
the best in 18 years.
</P>
<P>
By region in April, sales rose by 3.1 percent in the Northeast
and remained unchanged in the Midwest. They fell by 6.1 percent in
the West and 3.9 percent in the South.
</P>
<P>
U.S. realtors economists have said the sales of existing homes
should remain strong this year because of the strong job market
and high consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the median price of an existing home in the country
was 120,800 dollars, up 3.6 percent from a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Job Outlook in US Strong This Summer, Survey Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Job seekers in the U.S. will
find the best opportunities in nine years this Summer as employers
look to add more workers in an increasingly tight labor market,
according to a new survey released today.
</P>
<P>
The study by Manpower Inc., the largest temporary staffing firm
in the U.S., said 30 percent of 16,000 companies surveyed plan to
expand their work force in the July-August quarter.
</P>
<P>
Only five percent said they expect to reduce their staff, while
65 percent either plan no changes or didn't know, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
At this time last year, 27 percent said they planned increases
and 7 percent planned reductions.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that the strongest region for hiring this
Summer will be the Midwest, where 33 percent of employers plan to
expand their staff. That compared with 31 percent in the West, 28
percent in the South, and 27 percent in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
By industry, construction companies were the most eager to add
workers, with 40 percent planning additions heading into their
typically busy Summer season.
</P>
<P>
Companies involved in wholesale and retail trade were tied for
second at 34 percent along with manufacturers of durable goods,
which make long-lasting items such as computers or cars.
</P>
<P>
The weakest industry by far was mining, with only 12 percent
predicting new hiring.
</P>
<P>
The survey was based on telephone interviews with management
personnel in 487 U.S. cities.

<HEADLINE> Fund Set up to Benefit Youngsters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A hefty donation from a Japanese
woman has helped to set up a one-million-yuan fund for poor
children in China's urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The "Kinuko Fund for Protecting and Aiding Chinese Children,"
was named after its founder Sutiyama Kinuko, who has donated
nearly 10 million yuan (about 1.2 million US dollars) for the
activities of Chinese youth and children in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The fund, formally established in Beijing today, was part of
the "Loving Heart Project" to protect the children under 18 years
old, jointly launched by the Central Committee of the Communist
Youth League of China (CYLC) and four other government
organizations, said Zhou Qiang, secretary of the Central Committee
of CYLC.
</P>
<P>
The fund will aid the first group of 300 youngsters in cities
around the country this year, by giving each of them 500 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Those to receive the aid include handicapped children and
orphans, the children of laid-off workers, those who cannot afford
to go to school or live in poor conditions, and children whose
rights have been violated.
</P>
<P>
There are currently 380 million children in China, accounting
for one-third of the total population. In 1991, China stipulated
a law to protect the rights of the youngsters and children under
18.

<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Chi Haotian, Vice-Chairman of
China's Central Military Commission and minister of national
defense, met here today with V.P. Malik, first deputy chief of the
army staff of India. Chi spoke highly of the good relationship
shared by the two armed forces, pointing to potentials for future
growth.
</P>
<P>
Extending a warm welcome, Chi, also a state councillor,
expressed his belief that Malik's current visit will boost the
friendly relations between Chinese and Indian militaries.
</P>
<P>
"Recent years have witnessed frequent exchanges of visits
between leaders of the two armies," he said. "We hope that our
bilateral military relations will enjoy rapid development at
various levels and in all spheres."
</P>
<P>
"We are glad to see the sound development momentum of
Sino-Indian ties. To strengthen unity and friendship of the two
countries is not only in the fundamental interests of the two
peoples but also represents a great contribution to the peace and
stability in the Asia-Pacific region and in the world as a whole,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China will never seek hegemony and the country
advocated a multi-polarized world because the time when one or two
countries dominated the world is over.
</P>
<P>
Malik said that India and China, both ancient civilized
countries, are focusing on economic development and enhancing the
living standards of their peoples.
</P>
<P>
He said both sides prefer a multi-polarized world to a
single-poled one. Under the new international situation, the two
countries should seek closer exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Wu Quanxu, deputy chief of the general staff of the Chinese
People's Liberation Army, attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Malik and his party arrived in Beijing on May 25 on a goodwill
visit to China.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A young pelican sneaked out of the
Beijing Zoo Monday and spent a pleasant day on a lake in a nearby
park.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday afternoon, visitors in the Purple Bamboo Yard Park
in western Beijing spotted a big grey-white bird on the lake,
cruising on the water and sometimes dipping its head below the
surface to catch fish.
</P>
<P>
The crowd assembling to see the pelican applauded when it took
flight, its wingspan stretching more than one meter.
</P>
<P>
Park staffers said the bird arrived at about 11 a.m. After
checking with the zoo, they confirmed that it was the runaway
pelican.
</P>
<P>
The staff failed in their attempts to catch the bird. However,
apparently satisfied with its brief holiday in the park, the
pelican made several circles on the lake and flew home at about 5
p.m. Several minutes later, the zoo reported that the bird had
returned.
</P>
<P>
According to an ornithologist in the zoo, the pelican was born
there last May.
</P>
<P>
Pelicans are under state protection in China.

<HEADLINE> Salim Defends OAU's Mediating Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim, Secretary General
of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), today rebuffed claims
that the OAU's role in mediating regional conflicts had been dwindled.
</P>
<P>
In reference to media reports that the OAU had not done much
in mediating a peaceful end to the conflict in former Zaire,
Salim said the OAU had been actively involved in regional and
international efforts to contain the crisis in that country, now
renamed the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Salim said in an interview with Xinhua that the OAU dispatched
its envoy to mediate the Zairean crisis soon after it broke
out last year and the mediation bore fruit to some extent.
</P>
<P>
OAU officials, while brushing aside criticism of the organization's
dwindling role, maintained that if it had not been for the OAU's
mediation, the Zairean crisis would have led to massacres of
civilians.
</P>
<P>
Salim noted that final solutions of crises depend on the
parties directly involved and what the OAU can do is to help push
for such solutions.
</P>
<P>
He said there were lots of experience that the OAU could draw
from the crisis in the former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Troops led by Laurent Kabila took over Kinshasa by force two weeks
ago, dashing hopes of peacefully ending the civil war in that country.
South Africa, rather than the OAU itself, had been actively mediating
the conflict, giving rise to sceptism about the OAU's several-year-old
Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Containment and Resolution.
</P>
<P>
Salim, who is here to attend the OAU's 33rd summit scheduled for

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Niger President (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- China has always viewed its
friendly cooperation with African countries as an important part
of its foreign policy and sees this cooperation as increasingly
important at the turn of the century, Chinese Premier Li Peng said
here today.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Niger President Ibrahim Mainassara
Barre, Li said he believed Mainassara's current China tour will
help deepen mutual understanding and further promote the friendly
cooperative ties between China and Niger.
</P>
<P>
He noted that after the restoration of diplomatic ties last
August, the two countries have swiftly restored bilateral friendly
cooperation in politics, economy, public health and education,
with concrete results.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also have a good collaborative partnership in
international affairs and bilateral contacts are expanding, the
Chinese premier said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Chinese leaders highly value China-Niger
friendship, and are willing to further consolidate and develop a
long-term and stable state-to-state relationship of all-round
cooperation with Niger.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to work with Niger in actively exploring new
areas and ways to step up economic and trade cooperation between
the two countries and push bilateral friendly cooperative ties to
a new height, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Africa, with more than 50 countries, is playing
an important role in world political affairs, and serves as a
significant force in pushing the world toward multi-polarization.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his tour of seven African nations not long ago, Li
said the visit left a deep impression on him, adding that Africa,
rich in natural resources and with a huge population, has broad
prospects for advancement.
</P>
<P>
He stated that during the visit, he exchanged extensive views
and reached consensus with leaders of the seven countries on
promoting traditional friendship under new circumstances, on
strengthening economic cooperation of equality and mutual benefit,
and on other issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
"The visit has helped us to reach the goal of increasing mutual
understanding, furthering traditional friendship and expanding
cooperation of mutual benefit," Li said.

<HEADLINE> Israel: Settlement Building Not on Summit Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHARM EL-SHEIKH, EGYPT, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's spokesman said today that the
Egyptian-Israeli summit would not discuss details of the
controversial Israeli settlement building.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the summit is to resume the peace talks with
the Palestinians, said Bar Ilan, who accompanied Netanyahu on his
talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak held at the Red Sea
resort of Sharm el-sheikh today.
</P>
<P>
"To get the peace process back on track, (there are) very
important issues we have to discuss. This is discussion on
destiny of two peoples in a very small piece of land," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli official denied that the summit would go into
details of Israel's construction of a new Jewish settlement in
Arab East Jerusalem which has led to the two-month-old deadlock
in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Defending the Israeli settlement policy, he said that it is
only designed to meet the demand of the Jewish population growth.
</P>
<P>
"In places where there is a demand, there is going to be a
supply," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Netanyahu has reiterated several times that he is
willing to meet Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat without any
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Mubarak met to discuss ways to revive the
deadlocked peace process, while the prospects for a breakthrough
augur ill.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has reportedly proposed a new initiative on salvaging
the peace process, but kept the details secret, saying that
further contacts are needed to crystalize it.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told Xinhua today that
the success of today's summit between Mubarak and Netanyahu
depends on Israel's change of stance.
</P>
<P>
During the past few days, Mubarak has been trying to bridge
the differences between the Palestinians and Israeli sides
through a flurry of telephone contacts with Netanyahu as well as
meetings with Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
He also sent his political adviser Osama el-Baz to see Israeli
top officials twice in three days in preparation for today's
summit and possibly to sound out his new plan with Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that under Mubarak' five-point initiative, there
should be a "political solution" to the Har Homa issue. The plan
also envisages the resumption of Palestinian-Israeli security
cooperation, a halt to Jewish settlement building in the West
Bank, the immediate resumption of talks on Israeli further
redeployment in the West Bank and the final peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
While Jordan, the European Union and the United States have
apparently supported the plan, it is unknown whether Arafat has
endorsed it.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians were pessimistic that Egypt would succeed in
reviving peace negotiations, something U.S. Mideast Peace
Coordinator Dennis Ross has failed to deliver in his last three
rounds of shuttle missions in the region.
</P>
<P>
They fear that Israel's assertion of sovereignty over
Jerusalem kills their hope for a future capital in the city's
eastern part.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Niger President (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In recent years, Li went on, China-Africa relations have
shown notable progress, especially in the increase of high-level
exchange of visits, and China has further tightened its
consultations and cooperation with Africa on international issues.
</P>
<P>
China and African nations have no conflicts of interest, he
noted, adding that the deepening of the traditional China-Africa
friendship and the enhancement of friendly cooperative ties in the
various sectors is not only in the common interests of both sides,
but also conducive to safeguarding and promoting world peace.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that for developing nations, stability is the
prerequisite for development.
</P>
<P>
With different circumstances, African countries may explore
their development road that cater to their own national
conditions, he said, adding no other country is entitled to
interfere.
</P>
<P>
During the 45-minute meeting, Mainassara said he had
wide-ranging and fruitful discussions with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin yesterday, and the talks between relevant Niger and Chinese
departments were also good, with the two sides reaching consensus
over a wide range of subjects.
</P>
<P>
He said he would also go to other parts of China, and he hopes
to know more about the economic experiences of the country, as
Niger can learn from this.
</P>
<P>
The president stated that Niger attaches importance to
developing relations with China, as a long-term and stable
bilateral relationship is in the best interests of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
The fruitful cooperation between the two countries can serve to
promote the economic development in Niger and help raise the
living standard of the people, he said. He spoke highly of
China's achievements in maintaining stability and keeping
continuous economic progress.
</P>
<P>
The Niger people have always regarded China as their reliable
partner for cooperation, as its cooperation with Niger is without
selfish motives.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting were Li's wife Zhu Lin and Mainassara's
wife Aissa Clemence Barre.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Mainassara left Beijing for Nanning, capital
of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Mainassara toured the Great Wall in
Beijing.

<P>
FREETOWN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Two days after the military coup
in Sierra Leone, there are still signs that the regime of Major
Johnny Koroma is still not completely in control.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 foreign nationals, mainly Lebanese, Japanese,
Americans and British citizens are now ready to leave the
country.
</P>
<P>
Other UN dependants and non essential staff are gathered at
a seaside hotel Tuesday awaiting further arrangements. The
Americans are expecting an evacuation ship from Monrovia Tuesday
evening while the Lebanese government is sending two Hercules
planes for its own nationals.
</P>
<P>
Many of the nationals are protesting against the massive
looting on Sunday night by soldiers during the dusk to dawn
curfew, one diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
The new regime reopened the country's air, land and sea
borders Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The coup has been widely criticised both internally and
externally. Many people are in the streets but have ignored
greetings from soldiers to mirror their displeasure.

<HEADLINE> Mandela, Museveni Meet over Regional Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today met his Ugandan counterpart Yoweri Museveni
in Cape Town today to exchange views on bilateral and regional
issues.
</P>
<P>
Mandela told reporters after the meeting that it would be
suicidal for Laurent Kabila, President of the Democratic Republic
of Congo, to allow free party activities before he had a firm
grip on the government of the country.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was reacting to Monday's ban by Kabila's government on
all the parties in former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Kabila had made it clear he was committed to democracy and that
in due course he would allow political parties to operate, Mandela
said, adding that he believed Kabila could be trusted.
</P>
<P>
Museveni, an ally of Kabila, also expressed his dislikes to
political parties, saying that he "believed in democracy based on
democracy of individuals and not parties".
</P>
<P>
Museveni yesterday arrived in Cape Town for a 5-day visit,
during which an agreement on double taxation will be signed after
bilateral talks between Ugandan and South African government
officials.
</P>
<P>
Trade between South Africa and Uganda stood at 30.4 million U.S.
dollars last year, up from 20.3 million dollars in 1995. South Africa
exports to Uganda totalled 29 million dollars in 1996. enditem

MANILA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today ordered the deployment of marines in Mindanao, the southern
Philippines, to help fight against kidnapping syndicates there.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also issued an order formally directing the Armed Forces
to use all needed resources, including aircraft and watercraft,
against kidnap-for-ransom syndicates in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Ramos hoped that as the elite force of the Armed Forces, the
marines can help curb the surge of kidnappings in the southern
Philippines which has worried investors.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Ramos ordered the transfer of the government's
anti-kidnapping task from the National Police to the army after
the police force was criticized sharply for failing to prevent the
rise of kidnapping cases.
</P>
<P>
Kidnap-for-ransom syndicates have been rampant in the
Philippines, particularly in Mindanao, in recent months. Since
January this year, at least 37 people have been kidnapped in

<HEADLINE> South Korean Economy to Perform Better Than Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 27 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's economy is expected to
perform better than previously predicted this year thanks mainly
to the strong Japanese Yen and the steadily rising exports.
</P>
<P>
"Sign of an economic recovery has emerged in most economic
sectors amid the Yen's rise and subsequent recovery of the
nation's export competitiveness," said Paeng Dong-joon, research
economist at the Bank of Korea (BOK).
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese Yen has gained against the dollar since early
this month, and the Yen's strength has boosted the competitiveness
of South Korean exporters of autos, ships, steel, electronics and
petrochemical products," he added.
</P>
<P>
With the growing awareness of the changing economic conditions
here, major private economic-research institutes have adjusted
their economic growth forecast.
</P>
<P>
Samsung Economic Research Institute, an economic think tank
affiliated with the Samsung Group, recently made an upward
revision of its estimate for the nation's 1997 economic growth
rate to 5.8 percent from 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The institute also predicted that South Korean economy will
enter a recovery phase next year, with gross domestic product
(GDP) growth reaching some 7.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai Research Institute of the Hyundai Group also has made
an upward adjustment to its 1997 economic growth forecast from the
earlier 5.7 percent to 5.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Finance-economy Ministry said that South
Korea's GDP grew 5.4 percent in the first quarter of 1997, far
surpassing the 4-percent level prediction by many private research
institutes.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the nation's GDP growth is likely to reach 6
percent this year, which is much higher than the originally
anticipated 5.5 percent, they said.

<HEADLINE> Index Compiled to Monitor Free Market Environment in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Policy Research
Institute (PRI), a non-governmental think-tank, announced today
the introduction of an index to monitor the level of market
freedom in Hong Kong after the handover.
</P>
<P>
At a reception marking the second anniversary of the institute,
PRI Chief Executive Dr Jane Lee said, the PRI Hong Kong Free
Market Index is designed to measure changes in Hong Kong's status
as a free market economy over time.
</P>
<P>
Using June 1997 as the base period, PRI will update the index
every six months for future comparison.
</P>
<P>
The index is compiled based on seven factors that PRI sees
determine the level of market freedom of an economy -- government
involvement and intervention, government regulation,
infrastructure, mobility of production resources, price
flexibility, information flow and market competition.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the research is open and objective, PRI has set
up an International Advisory Board with members consisting of
scholars, economists and business leaders from Hong Kong and
beyond, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) Tung Chee Hwa was present at the reception.
</P>
<P>
There are many factors of success for Hong Kong that the SAR
government treasures and the economic freedom is one of them, Tung
noted.
</P>
<P>
After the return of Hong Kong to China, Hong Kong will retain
its absolutely free flow of capital, information and talents, he
assured. "We strongly believe that as long as our markets retain
its high degree of freedom, and supervision remains prudent, our
economy will retain its vitality," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Many research organizations in the world publish indices on
economic freedom and their recent reports placed Hong Kong at the
very top of the list, meaning that Hong Kong's high degree of
economic freedom is highly recognized by the world, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Tung expected that the PRI index will show that Hong Kong will
retain a high level of free economy after the handover.

<P>
HONG KONG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong 97 Spectacular, the
biggest and most exhilarating show of its type, will be held at
Victoria Harbor on the evening of July 1 to mark the beginning of
a new era.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here today, the Better Hong Kong
Foundation, organizer of the show, announced details of the
Spectacular, which features an illuminated flotilla of 31 barges,
music, water fountains, special effects, lights, lasers and
fireworks display.
</P>
<P>
The show will involve a central stage moored in the middle of

</P>
<P>
Also incorporated into the one-hour event is "Song of Peace",
from "Symphony 1997 -- Heaven, Earth, Mankind", composed by
world-renowned Chinese musician Tan Dun to mark the handover.
</P>
<P>
Henry Cheng, chairman of the foundation's advisory council,
said July 1, the first day of Hong Kong's return to China, is "the
perfect time for the Hong Kong community to make a bold statement
to the world, embodying confidence in the future of Hong Kong as a
special administrative region of China, as well as to foster a
spirit of togetherness and enable Hong Kong to forge further ahead
in its new role."

</P>
<P>
The cost, at some 100 million HK dollars (12.8 million US

<HEADLINE> New Municipality to Quadruple GDP in 2010 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing, China's fourth and
also the largest municipality, aims to quadruple its 1995 gross
domestic product (GDP) by the 2010, according to a senior leader
of the city.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the city, Zhang Delin, announced the economic
blueprint at the on-going First Chongqing Municipal Congress of
the Chinese Communist Party, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the city is set to become the economic center
in southwest China or the upper reach of the Yangtze River with
the rising of a group of new industries.
</P>
<P>
The GDP of Chongqing in 1995 totaled 111.3 billion
yuan. However, rural population now accounts for more than 80
percent of the city's total, including more than three million
people still living under the poverty line. The overall economic
strength of the city is in the lower-middle level among similar
economic entities in China.
</P>
<P>
In the coming 14 years, the city is set to register an annual
growth of 11 percent while eliminating poverty by the end of the
century and ensuring a well-to-do life for local people, according
to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
He told delegates to the meeting that the city should
seize the historic opportunity to push forward the development of
the Three Gorges Project, China's largest hydropower project, and
avail the chance to revitalize the local economy. One of the tough
problems for the city is to resettle one million people migrated
from the dam site, according to a local economist.
</P>
<P>
He urged local people to make every effort by building the city
into a commercial, financial and information center, a transport
and telecom hub, as well as a production base for new and
high-tech industries in the upper reach of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The new Chongqing has an area of 82,000 square kilometers and a
population of 30.02 million. The city was granted the municipality
status on March 14 by the Fifth Plenary Session of the Eighth
National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Located in the intersection between the developed eastern part
of China and the western part known for its abundant natural
resources, the city is considered a pivotal to drive the economic
development for the whole of southwest China and the Yangtze River
belt.

<P>
MANILA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- At least twenty-four persons were
killed and 14 others injured when typhoon "Bining" swept through
Luzon Island in the northern Philippines Monday, the National
Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) said today.
</P>
<P>
In a report submitted to President Fidel Ramos, the NDCC, the

<P>
The report said 16 of the killed were residents of Metro
Manila, or the capital region, while the remaining eight were from
Zambales province in central Luzon.
</P>
<P>
More than 42,000 families or 210,000 people have been affected
by floods in Metro Manila and the provinces of Bataan, Rizal,
Bulcan, Pampanga and Zambales.
</P>
<P>
Over 77,000 people were evacuated to shelter centers in the

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Central Bank Urged to Improve supervision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia (BI), being the
country's central bank, should improve its supervision to prevent
recurrence of the Bank Arta Prima (BAP) corruption case, chairman
of the Indonesian national banks (Perbanas) I Njoman Moena said
here today.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that a corruption case, which involved one trillion
rupiah (420.16 million US dollars), happened to BAP only shows
that the internal and external supervisory systems of BI do not
function well," he said.
</P>
<P>
The police on Monday said a number of BAP executives, including
its former president, have been arrested for their alleged
involvement in the fraud of commercial papers and bad debts worth
one trillion rupiah (420.16 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The case involved transfers of a number of BI securities worth
83 billion rupiah (34.87 million US dollars) and bad credits
amounting to 700 billion rupiah (294.11 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Moena said there are two kinds of supervision in a bank, namely
internal and external supervisions.
</P>
<P>
He said that internal supervision is carried out by the board
of directors and the bank's internal supervisory units, while
external supervision is carried out by BI and the public
accountant.
</P>
<P>
"BI should from now on improve its supervisory system,
particularly against banks with problems," he stressed.

<P>
HARARE, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim, Secretary General of
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) said here today that African
countries value their friendly ties with China and hope to upgrade
such relationship to a new level.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, the OAU chief lauded China's important
contributions to the promotion of peace and stability in the African
continent.
</P>
<P>
He said China has always supported the just cause of the African
people and African countries appreciate such support.
</P>
<P>
Salim recalled a visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin to the OAU
headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia last year, saying the visit
significantly contributed to the development of Aino-African ties.
</P>
<P>
Salim said the speech made by Jiang at the OAU headquarters
spelled out new guidelines for developing ties between African
countries and China.
</P>
<P>
The OAU, Salim said, believed that Sino-African relationship
could be further developed on the basis of such guidelines.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang put forward a proposal for
promoting Sino-African relations. The proposal calls for the
development of sincere friendship, cooperation on an equal footing,
mutual benefit and enhancement of consultations.
</P>
<P>
Salim said as China is playing a more and more important role in
international affairs, it surely will be able to do more in helping
Africa achieve long-term peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief is here to attend the June 2-4 OAU summit. enditem

Bonn, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Former East Germany's intelligence
chief Markus Wolf was given today a suspended two-year jail
sentence in a trial in Dusseldorf which he said was "politically
motivated".
</P>
<P>
Wolf, 74, was convicted of four kidnapings related to people
who allegedly were forcibly taken from former West Germany to East
Germany during the Cold War in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Wolf was in charge of East Germany's intelligence center HVA
between 1953 and 1986. In December, 1993, the Dusseldorf court
sentenced him to six years in jail on three charges of treason.
</P>
<P>
But the conviction was rescinded after the German Federal
Constitutional Court granted full-time HVA employees broad
immunity from prosecution on espionage charges.

Opportunities Commission (HREOC) said about 100,000 aboriginal
children were forcibly removed from their families under
Australia's infamous assimilation policies during 1910-1970.
</P>
<P>
HREOC President Ronald Wilson reaffirmed today that removing
aboriginal children from their parents was an act of genocide,
thus putting himself at odds with the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who offered personal apology yesterday for
the forced removal at the Australian Reconciliation Convention,
claimed it was done with good intentions.
</P>
<P>
Many aboriginal people said the prime minister's personal
apology was far from satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued tonight, Gatjil Djerrkura, chairman of
the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, said: "I ask
all Australians to think about how you would react to having your
children forcibly removed. I ask all Australians to consider how
you would feel if you knew that your children were forced to
forget about their family, their community and everything that
makes a person proud of who that person is."
</P>
<P>
"We await the federal government's formal response to the HREOC
report," Djerrkura said.
</P>
<P>
In a speech greeted with a standing ovation at the Australian
Reconciliation Convention today, Australian Governor-General
William Deane expressed profound sorrow for the forced removal of
aboriginal children from their parents.
</P>
<P>
Among those attending the three-day convention are aboriginal
people from Australia, the United States and Canada.

<HEADLINE> Slovak FM Resigns Following Failed Referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Slovak Foreign Minister Pavol Hamzik
resigned on Monday following a failed referendum last weekend.
</P>
<P>
In the referendum on whether Slovak should join the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), only 10 percent of the
country's total population cast their votes, and the government
was forced to declare it void.
</P>
<P>
In explaining his resignation, Hamzik said the current
political situation in his country, especially the circumstances
surrounding the referendum, had greatly narrowed the scope for him
as foreign minister to pursue the foreign policy priorities.
</P>
<P>
Hamzik, 42, became foreign minister last August. He has been
charged with trying to persuade the Western countries that
Slovakia was moving towards integration with the European Union
(EU) and NATO.
</P>
<P>
President Michal Kovac said the failure of the referendum had
ruined Slovakia's last chances of being among the first contenders
for membership in NATO and EU.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Bank Reports Good Start in Yuan Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai branch of the Hong
Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Ltd (HKSB) has reported a
good start in business in the Chinese currency, according to a
senior bank official.
</P>
<P>
Several dozens of customers have opened yuan accounts in the
branch, which became the first overseas bank to deal in the
Chinese currency on March 27, said Dennis Wong, HKSB Shanghai's
deputy governor for yuan business.
</P>
<P>
He added that most of the accounts were opened by individuals
and deposits in the Chinese currency have totaled tens of millions
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the branch has extended more than 10 million yuan in
loans to overseas-funded enterprises and participated in
inter-bank business several times, Wong said.
</P>
<P>
Overseas banks play a supplementary role in yuan business, as
domestic Chinese banks are still predominant in the field, he said.
</P>
<P>
HKSB Shanghai has not entered a profit-making period in
yuan-based business due to limited sources of funds in yuan and
business restrictions, the deputy governor said.
</P>
<P>
Since last December, the People's Bank of China, the central
bank, has approved nine overseas banks in China to deal in yuan on
the trial basis in Shanghai's Pudong New Area. Six of them have
passed examination by the central bank and are now officially
engaged in yuan business.

<HEADLINE> China's Fujian Tightens Screws on Use of Arable Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Southeast China's Fujian Province
has kicked off a campaign to check the use of arable land for
purposes other than agricultural production, according to a
provincial official.
</P>
<P>
The check will cover all approved or unauthorized use of arable
land between January 1 of 1991 and April 1 this year, said Lin
Fanglei, director of the provincial land administration.
</P>
<P>
Chief targets for the check-up effort will include land used for
building development zones and for real estate projects or golf
links, the official said.
</P>
<P>
China has about 22 percent of the world's population but only
seven percent of its arable land.
</P>
<P>
However, a land development fever along with the economic boom
over the past ten or more years, especially for real estates, has
made the limited resource even scare, prompting the government to
take resolute measures against unchecked use of farmland.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, China issueed a document calling for
stricter and better management of arable land.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Calls on Turkey to Withdraw from Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordan today called on Turkey to
pull its troops immediately out of northern Iraq, the first time
the kingdom has expressed its stand on the issue since the start
of the Turkish intrusion earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military thrust into Iraq has violated the Iraqi
sovereignty and posed a threat to the territorial integrity of
Iraq, said a Jordanian Foreign Ministry spokesperson who declined
to be identified.
</P>
<P>
Continuation of Turkish military operation in Iraq will
heighten tension in the area, the spokesperson told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Since early this month, Turkey has been sending troops into
northern Iraq in a bid to chase and wipe out members of the
separatist group of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
The Turkish move has caused strong opposition from Iraq and
serious concern of other countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, a major sympathizer with Iraq during the 1990-1991 Gulf
Crisis, began to distance itself away from Iraq later in order to
end its isolation from other Arab states and the West.
</P>
<P>
However, the two countries have begun to restore trade
relations recently, thereby enabling Jordan to get more low-price
oil from Iraq, while Iraq expects to increase its trade volume
with Jordan by a large margin.

HONG KONG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's two flag carriers,
Cathay Pacific and Dragonair, said that all of their 15 A330s
which have been grounded due to engine problems will resume flying
within three weeks.
</P>
<P>
The two airlines grounded their Airbus 330-300 fleets on
Saturday after a string of in-flight engine shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
Cathay executives said on Monday that the first of its Airbuses
with the defective Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines would be back on
line within a week, after testing of new engine parts in the
United Kingdom was successful.
</P>
<P>
The airline's engineering director Roland Fairfield said
Rolls-Royce could have the first batch of new parts ready within a
week. It would take a further two weeks to manufacture, supply and
fit all the new components.
</P>
<P>
Today's local newspapers said that Garuda Indonesia was last
night banned from servicing its Hong Kong routes with A330-300
jets using suspect Rolls-Royce engines.
</P>

The local Civil Aviation Department said it had received
support from Britain's Civil Aviation Authority over the Cathay
and Dragonair suspensions. In view of that, the department decided
to inform Indonesian authorities certain Garuda services would be
suspended.

<P>
Cathay and Dragonair said they had made progress in chartering
planes from other airlines to replace their grounded jets.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Rejects Misinterpretation by Foreign Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Iranian president-elect Mohammad
Khatami today hailed the massive turn-out in the presidential
election Friday, but rejected what he termed as a
misinterpretation by certain foreign media that it was a wide
protest against the Islamic regime.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, at a press conference here, said that the 29
million votes illustrated the stability and strength of the
Islamic Republic and that the people in the first place
voted for the revolution and stability of the country.
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old president-elect said that the unprecedented
turnout in the elections demonstrated love of the nation for
the Islamic republic and its leader.
</P>
<P>
He criticized foreign media for their misinterpretation of the
massive turn-out, attributing their misinterpretation to their
misunderstanding of Iran and their mischievousness.
</P>
<P>
The new leader stressed "there has been a revolution
already once in Iran and there is not going to be another
one. The revolution took place by men and women and it was
not imposed on people."
</P>
<P>
However, some political specialists maintain that the Friday
massive voting had actually turned into a political protest
against the regime because the majority of people voted for the
open-minded candidate rather than hardliner Parliament Speaker Ali
Akbar Nateq-Nouri, who is a favorite of the conservatives backed
by Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the Iranian people prefer the moderate policy
advocated by moderate President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. As a
consequence, Nateq-Nouri, representative of the conservative
camp, secured only 24.9 percent of a total of 29,076,070 votes
cast in the Friday election.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, however, stressed that the vote was an expression of
the right of making a choice and not an expression of opposition
as interpreted by some foreign press.
</P>
<P>
He added that the people voted for the system and the
independence of the country. The country has reached a
stage of stability.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the stunning turnout in the elections, he said
that he is more proud of the vote than being surprised.
</P>
<P>
"This leaves a heavy burden on my shoulders. This vote is
the vote of confidence in the system, the leadership and the
revolution and is a sign of alertness of the people and
their presence in the scene to decide their future," he added.
</P>
<P>
The president-elect pledged that "I will stick to the program I
 have promised and I will try to materialize them in coordination
with other organ of the government."

<HEADLINE> New Discovery in Cancer Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Pathologists in this capital of east
China's Anhui province have become the first in the world to
discover that the activity of enzyme in cells is closely related
to stomach cancer.
</P>
<P>
The discovery by Professors Yang Guanglin and Dong Yuming of
Anhui Medical University, helps judge the degree of malignancy
of stomach cancer and its prognosis, and can serve as a marker in
the diagnosis of the cancer.
</P>
<P>
The professors found that the activity of marker enzyme in the
cell organs of cancer cells are related to the type of tissue,
degree of differentiation, mode of growth and prognosis of stomach
cancer, and the examination of the activity can serve as indices
for the degree of malignancy of the cancer lesion and its
prognosis.
</P>
<P>
They also conducted studies on several types of isozyme in
alkaline and acid phosphatase of normal gastric mucosa, non-cancer
lesion and cancer tissues, finding the isozyme only in cancer
tissues. Therefore, they drew the conclusion that the existence of
the isozyme can be an indication of stomach cancer.

<HEADLINE> "Green Pension" Project Ensures Livelihood for Mongolian Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, May 27 (Xinhua) -- For farmer and herdsman families
living on the vast pastures in north China's Inner Mongolian
Autonomous Region, a son is most desirable.
</P>
<P>
In a poor mountainous county like Hexigten Banner where life is
even harder, local people's desire to have a son is especially
strong, who is expected to take care of his parents when they are
old.
</P>
<P>
This quite adds to the difficulty for local authorities to
implement China's family planning policy, even though Mongolian
families with even two daughters are allowed to have another child
while the vast majority of Chinese couples can have only one child.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of the area's vast resources of uncultivated
hills and slopes, the local authorities initiated a so-called
"green pension" project.
</P>
<P>
The project started with the government investing money in tree
planting on its 8,000-ha undeveloped hills, then gave out both the
certificates for use of the hills and those of ownership of the
newly planted woods to local families with one or two daughters
who have decided not to have more children. And the families will
be able to cut the trees and plant new ones in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, about 2,000 hectares of land have become "green
pension" forests, and 3,067 families with one or two daughters
have got at least about 0.3 hectares of such forest.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that each family will get at least 23,000 yuan
from the forests, calculated on the lowest price of 360 yuan
(about 43 US dollars) for one cu. m. of firewood in 25 years.
</P>

<P>
ZHUHAI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Zhuhai, one of China's five special
economic zones, in southern Guangdong Province, has introduced
landmark measures for leasing state-owned enterprises to overseas
investors.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, such enterprises will be allowed to be transferred to
overseas investors in whole or restructured into companies solely

last year, about 26 percent of the city's total.
</P>
<P>
The lastest measures to lease or transfer some state-owned
enterprises to overseas investors are aimed at further expanding
the sources of overseas investment in Zhuhai, according to a city
official.
</P>
<P>
When conditions are ripe, overseas companies, enterprises,
economic organizations and individuals will be allowed, in
cooperation with local partners, to sponsor overseas-funded
joint-stock limited companies, the official added.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors will even be allowed to underwrite and
trade, on behalf of overseas investors, domestically-listed shares
reserved for overseas investors, he revealed.
</P>
<P>
The new measures will open a new channel for overseas funds to
flow into China, analysts say.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi said that his government guarantees the safe conduct of
opposition groups pursuing their cause peacefully but is at the
same time committed to striking terrorism-related individuals and
organizations.
</P>
<P>
According to today's "Ethiopian Herald", the remarks were made
by the Ethiopian prime minister in an interview with Abyotawi Democracy,
the weekly organ of the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary
Democratic Front (EPRDF) in connection with the 6th anniversary
of the May 28 Liberation Day.
</P>
<P>
Meles, who is also chairman of the EPRDF, said those
organizations that give sanctuary and support of whatever kind to
terrorist elements don't seem to be fully aware that they are
playing with fire.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government has not so far
taken any measure against those accredited organization that have
been pursuing alternatively peaceful means of struggle on the one
hand and by supporting terrorists, on the other hand, in the
belief that they would come to their sense.
</P>
<P>
"Such organizations can have only two options, either adhere
to peaceful means of struggle, or side with anti-peace and
anti-democratic elements. They can't have it both ways of them at
the same time," he warned.
</P>
<P>
He added that his government will take all appropriate legal
measures against those individuals and organizations which, while
pretending to pursue peaceful means, in fact provide safe havens
for elements of organized terrorism.

<HEADLINE> UAE President Endorses 1997 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- President of the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan al Nahyan has approved
the federal budget for 1997, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The official "Emirates News" said the projected spending for
the year was set at around 5.4 billion U.S. dollars, while the
planned revenues stood at 5.2 billion dollars, with an estimated
budget deficit of 200 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The 1997's projected expenditure shows an increase of 440

<P>
The increase of 440 million dollars in the 1997 budget will be
allocated primarily to education, health and other sectors
providing services for citizens, officials from the Ministry of
State for Financial and Industrial Affairs said.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 budget was ratified by the president nearly seven
weeks after it was issued by the cabinet early last month.
</P>
<P>
Financial sources here said the budget was late because of
delays in calculating oil revenues.
</P>
<P>
Under the UAE constitution, the federal budget is financed
through half of the income of each of its seven sheikdoms, but
in practice, all the revenues come from the two main members, Abu
Dhabi and Dubai. The rest of the sheikdoms are Sharjah, Ras
al-Khaimah, Ajman, Fujairah and Umm al-Quwain.
</P>
<P>
Abu Dhabi has the largest oil reserves in the country while
Dubai is the UAE's biggest and most important trade hub.
</P>
<P>
Local observers said though the UAE has launched a drive to
diversify the sources of its national income, the country's
budget relies heavily on oil export earnings.
</P>
<P>
A latest report by the UAE's Central Bank showed that of the
total revenues of 5.62 billion dollars in 1996, 3.5 billion

PARIS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin today

recognizing the signing of a Russia-NATO bilateral agreement, or
the Founding Act, as "a victory of reason".
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin made his stance in the Elysee presidential palace

succeeded in overcoming the most delicate problems," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "There will be no nuclear arms on the territories of
new (NATO) members, there will be a new reduction of conventional
forces in Europe, there will be no military infrastructures close
to Russia."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that the Founding Act makes up a "firm and
obligatory engagement" by all signatories, adding that Moscow and
Brussels should do all to implement it.

basis of relations with which our continent will enter the 21st
century," he said.

<HEADLINE> Oil Price Rise Boosts Gulf Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The six Arab states in the Gulf
earned more than 2 billion dollars in extra income during the
first quarter of 1997 because of higher crude prices, a local
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
With their crude exports standing at around 11.5 million
barrels per day (bpd), revenues of the Gulf states grew by
up to 2.4 billion dollars compared to the same period of
1996, Gulf News quoted bankers as saying.
</P>
<P>
The averaged oil price stood at 20.77 dollars in the first
quarter this year against 18.4 dollars in the same period of
1996, according Opecna, the news agency for Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec).
</P>
<P>
This means more than 23 million dollars in extra income
for the six Gulf states every day.
</P>
<P>
The six countries -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain,
Oman and the United Arab Emirates -- produce nearly 13.5 million
barrels each day, of which around 11.5 million barrels are
exported, mostly to Japan, the U.S. and European countries.
</P>
<P>
The income of the six countries, which control nearly 45
percent of the world's proven oil reserves, hit a 12-year high of
some 90 billion dollars in 1996 as crude prices climbed to 20.22
dollars from an averaged 16.8 dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The price surge boosted the economies of these countries and
allowed them to cut budget deficits.

<HEADLINE> Iran Wants to Expand Cooperation with Arab World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President-elect Mohammad
Khatami said today Iran wants to expand cooperation with Arabian
countries, especially Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old president-elect said in his first press
conference "We will use all our efforts to strengthen ties
the Arab world through dialogue and patience."
</P>
<P>
Khatami said that there are many commonalities and common
interests between Iran and the Arabian countries.
</P>
<P>
"We are all interested in cooperation and development.
Cooperation requires security and development should be realized
through international cooperation. There are plenty of chance
for cooperation," he said in a an hour-long conference.
</P>
<P>
As to Egypt's condition for resumption of normal ties with
Iran, Khatami said, "I hope we will have close ties with
Egypt."
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, Iran's conditions to improve relations with
Egypt are Iran's "independence and national interests".
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the establishment of relations between Iran
and Egypt will depend on the resolution of a number of
problems. "Egypt should not listen to the insinuation of the
foreign powers," he added.
</P>
<P>
As to the issue of terrorism, he said, "We oppose
terrorism, especially the state terrorism. We should stand hand
by hand and fight terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Claiming sovereignty of three disputed islands in the Persian
Gulf, he said, "our problem with UAE must be solved through
dialogue and negotiation. The interference of other governments or
foreign powers is not in the interests of either country.
</P>
<P>
Regarding to the question of the Middle East peace process, he
said, "we believe that there can be no peace until all the
legitimate demands of the Palestinians are met. You can not talk
about peace when the most primitive rights of the Palestinian
people have not been met."
</P>
<P>
He termed Israel as "an illegitimate racist state" which has
imposed its domination over the Palestinians, adding "We do not
recognize Israel (let alone) to negotiate or establish ties with
it."

<P>
TEHRAN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Iranian president-elect Mohammed
Khatami today voiced his opposition to the Turkish military
incursion in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In his first press conference since the election victory,
Khatami said that the territorial integrity of all countries,
including Iraq, is of importance to Iran and "we will defend it."
</P>
<P>
"We emphasize the territorial integrity of Iraq. Military
occupation can not solve problems. We believe in settlement
through negotiation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The new Iranian president, who will come to power in August,
urged the Turkish to stop the military incursion, saying "We hope
that the Turkish government would also arrive at the same
conclusion."
</P>
<P>
On Sunday evening, Iran protested Turkish military incursion in
northern Iraq by summoning Turkish Charge d'Affaires Aydin
Evirgen to the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Iran termed the Turkish move as violation of all international
laws and regulations and called for immediate and unconditional
withdrawal of Turkish army from northern Iraq.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Turkish Troops Killed 1,800 PKK Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkish troops killed at least 1,800
rebels of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) since the
massive cross-border military operation started in northern Iraq
on May 14, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that with the support of the air bombing
and artillery fire, the 50,000-strong Turkish government troops
crossed the border into northern Iraq and destroyed eight large
PKK camps of Haftanin, Avagoze, Sivi, Zeli, Zap, Hakurk, Kani
Mazi and Metina during the large-scale military operation, which
is still going on in the region.
</P>
<P>
The security forces also destroyed positions in valleys of
Amadiya, Batufa, Begova, Sersing in northern Iraq near Turkey and
many small PKK camps, shelters and caves in the areas near Iran
and Syria, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
It also said that Turkish fighters bombarded the PKK
militants who escaped to the Iranian and Syrian borders Monday
and today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Turkish military officers as saying that
the PKK guerrillas, who suffered a heavy blow in the Turkish
military campaign in northern Iraq, are trying to flee toward
the camps in other areas.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish incursion followed a request for help by Iraq's
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) leader Mesud Barzani.
</P>
<P>
The military intervention in northern Iraq has drawn strong
criticism from both Western and Arab countries, which demand
an early withdrawal of the Turkish government troops from the
region.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkish senior army sources have said that the
massive military operation would continue until the northern Iraq
was swept free of the PKK militants.
</P>
<P>
More than 23,000 people, including PKK rebels, civilians and
government troops have been killed in conflicts since August
1984 when the PKK started its separatist war in eastern and
southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The PKK guerrillas often infiltrate into Turkey from northern
Iraq to launch attacks against Turkish military and civilian
targets posing serious threats to the security of Turkey's
border area.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Troops Head for S.Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- An unspecified number of troops of
the West African Peacekeeping Force in Liberia known as ECOMOG
has left the Liberian capital of Monrovia for Freetown, Sierra
Leone, a report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
Heavily armed Nigeria-led troops left aboard two naval
vessels, but their mission was not specific, it said.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG officers are not available at the movement to confirm
the report.
</P>
<P>
However, ECOMOG force Commander Victor Malu said here on
Monday that Sunday's coup in Sierra Leone which toppled elected
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah would have no effect on the peace
process and security in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
According to Malu, ECOMOG has effectively deployed troops
along the border with Sierra Leone and indeed all Liberia's
borders to ensure no weapon can be transported into Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the possibility of the coup in Sierra Leone
affecting the stability in Liberia is out of the question, he
said.
</P>
<P>
There are a training team and a battalion of Nigerian troops
in Sierra Leone but their mission is to train that country's
armed forces and police according to a bilateral agreement
between the two countries, Malu explained.
</P>
<P>
"There are not part of the ECOMOG peacekeeping contingent," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian soldiers there are also reported to guard the state
house, parliament building and other strategic locations in
freetown.
</P>
<P>
A BBC broadcast monitored here said ousted President Kabbah

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Africa's Economy Makes Headway (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Economic issues and regional
cooperation feature prominently on the agenda of the forthcoming
summit of African countries long torn by conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) will meet here on Wednesday to lay the ground for the June
2-4 OAU summit.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which will trumpet the call for keeping up with
the global trend of peace and development, comes as Africa's
economy has consecutively taken a turn for the better.
</P>
<P>
The year of 1996 witnessed Africa emerging as a continent
moving ahead with vigor in terms of its economic growth and
further political stability.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA)
recently has announced a 3.96 percent growth in Africa's Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The rise, as compared with a 2.74 percent growth of 1995 and a
2 percent increase of 1994, has been hailed as the fastest in the
continent since the beginning of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Among the African countries, 11 of them registered a rise of 6
or more than 6 percent in the GDP and 28 others recorded a rise
of 3 to 6 percent. There were only two countries which saw a
negative growth.
</P>
<P>
More encouraging is the fact that economic development
outpaced population growth of 2.8 percent in 1996. For the first
time in 10 years, Africa's per capita income rose.
</P>
<P>
The EAC also painted a rosy picture of agriculture in Africa.
In 1996, the continent's agricultural production jumped by 5.2
percent, the highest growth since the beginning of the 1990s.
Agricultural harvests in a number of African countries alleviated
food shortages to a certain extent.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics by the UN Food and Agricultural
Organization, the continent's per capita grain output increased
by 1.8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Africa's export volume showed an upswing too, standing at
1996's 113 billion US Dollars in value terms, a 8.5 percent rise
over the previous year. The growth was higher than the world
average level, the first time in seven years.
</P>
<P>
Tourism, one of Africa's major foreign currency earners,
collected eight billion US Dollars in 1996, a 15 percent increase
over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Industry, once a stumbling block affecting economic growth,
also made headway with a 6.6 percent increase in mineral output
value and 2.5 percent rise in manufactural output value.

<P>
HARARE, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Prospects for greater development
are bright. The ECA predicted that further restoration of peace
and stability throughout Africa will boost the continent's
economy to a 4.2 percent growth in 1997. The famine-stricken
continent, the ECA said, will also harvest 103 million tons of
grain this year.
</P>
<P>
The past developments help rebuild Africa's image and injected
hope into the continent.
</P>
<P>
There are several factors that have led to the positive
changes in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Restoration of peace and stability, for one, played a key role
in guaranteeing economic rehabilitation and progress. Warring
factions in countries like Somalia, Angola, Mozambique and
Liberia are burying their hatchets after long years of bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
Peace and stability encouraged the inflow of foreign
investment estimated at 11.8 billion US Dollars last year in
black Africa, 11.5 billion Dollars more than that of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Economic reform, fewer natural disasters and rises in prices
of crude oil and raw materials could also be attributed to the
upturn of African economy.
</P>
<P>
Powerful trend for regional and trans-regional cooperation
could be another contributor to the African economic growth. Ever
since African countries signed a treaty on the creation of the
African Economic Community in 1991, various organizations for
regional cooperation have been booming and thriving.
</P>
<P>
They include the Union of the Maghreb Arab Countries, the
Economic Community of West African Countries, the Southern
African Development Community, the Inter-Governmental Authority
on Development and the Common Market of Eastern and Southern
Africa.
</P>
<P>
These groupings, besides mediating regional conflicts, have
played a significant role in breaking down trade barriers,
facilitating border transport and promoting tourism.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the achievements, Africa still faces grave
challenges. Among them, repetition and continuation of conflicts
threaten the long-term development and offset peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
External debt, which currently stands at 340 billion US
Dollars, remains a staggering burden on the continent. Poverty, a
lingering scourge, continues to haunt 220 million African people,
or one third of inhabitants on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The continent's refugees which number more than 7 million need
greater concern and attention from African countries and the
world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming African summit will muster greater efforts to
address these pressing issues. Will Africa be able to enter the
next century with further stability and greater development? The
summit will give an answer.

<HEADLINE> UNIDO Says Poor Infrastructure Retards Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Africa will continue to lag behind
in industrialization because of weak infrastructure that requires
about 20 billion U.S. Dollars to improve, the U.N. Industrial
Development Organization (UNIDO) has said.
</P>
<P>
According to reports of the "Financial Mail" today, the UNIDO
said that frequent road breakdowns, power shortages and absence
of communications are the principal factors contributing to the
high cost of doing business in many African countries.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper also quoted the U.N. organization as
noting that while Africa has been investing around five percent
of its gross domestic product (GDP) in infrastructure
development, the performance of infrastructure services is
disappointing.
</P>
<P>
Quality of infrastructure services improves a country's
foreign investment prospects and has a decisive impact on the
competitiveness and export performance of enterprises, the UNIDO
said.
</P>
<P>
The commercial principles of operation should form the basis
for reforms in the sectors, said the UNIDO.

LONDON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin

toward a new relationship between Russia and the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC radio interview this morning, Cook said, "It
sets out a very bold, ambitious program of joint cooperation.
There is no reason why it should weaken NATO."
</P>
<P>
"I think the signals -- if we both use it and both put
ourselves into making it work -- are very positive for a new
relationship between Russia and the West," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
On NATO's plan to admit new members, he said, "There is no
question of moving the troops forward into Poland and Hungary or
any new member."
</P>
<P>
"Indeed today's agreement does say that we believe we can
provide security in these countries without any substantial
deployment of troops in their territory," he added.

Russian President Boris Yeltsin, U.S. President Bill Clinton
and other leaders of NATO member states are in Paris today to sign

<HEADLINE> Iran's President-elect Withholds Makeup of Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Iranian president-elect Mohammad
Khatami today still kept secret the make-up of his new government,
saying that it is under consultation with Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
While answering a question raised by Xinhua on whether he
makes the decision independently, Mohammad Khatami replied: "I
have started review and consultations and it is naturally in
consultation with the leader."
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old president-elect said that the list will be
forwarded to the Parliament in August for approval, adding
that the country needs all the forces and talents it can
muster and that he hoped to utilize the services of all of
them in running state affairs.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that it would be a tough job for
Khatami to form the cabinet since some posts would be imposed
directly by Khamenei. He also has to give some posts to
close aides of outgoing president Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The president-elect kept silent on the question who will be
the first vice-president, foreign minister and defense minister.
</P>
<P>
Some specialists believe that Khamenei would absolutely grab
the most important posts such as foreign minister, information
minister, defense minister and even the minister of culture
and Islamic guidance.
</P>
<P>
They noted that there would not be much room for Khatami to
play round. Rafsanjani is much stronger and more powerful than
Khatami, but he controls only half of the cabinet members, the
other half is controlled by the supreme leader.
</P>
<P>
On a question whether woman can be a minister in his
cabinet, Khatami replied: "It could be."
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason not to give the women high posts in
management of the country. Appointment of women ministers is
under consideration," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed on equal opportunity for women and laid
emphasis on consolidating the foundation of the family.
</P>
<P>
As to a question who will be No. 2 man in Iran after
the leader, Khatami said, "the leader is No. 1 and president
is No. 2."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "his Excellency Rafsanjani will still
remain as the most prominent figure among the Iranian Islamic
revolutionaries" irrespective of what office he would be holding.
</P>
<P>
He said that his government would benefit from Rafsanjani's
experiences and ideas systematically.
</P>
<P>
He said "Mr. Rafsanjani as the trustee of the leader will
also use his competence and intellectual ability for the welfare
of the system."
</P>
<P>
Observers here hold that Khatami's election to the top
executive post has strengthened the position of outgoing President
Rafsanjani who will chair the State Expediency Council, the
moderates and the left wingers.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's victory has also created a balance in Iran's
politics with moderates now controlling executive branch and the
conservatives already controlling the legislative and judicial
branches.
</P>
<P>
However, Khatami seems to have a difficult task in forming his
cabinet mainly because of the coalition which facilitated his
victory is at sharp odds on many issues and it is not yet clear
which faction would set the direction of Khatami's
administration.

<HEADLINE> Smoking to Be Banned on Israeli Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Transportation
Ministry has instructed all local airlines to consider plans to
gradually ban smoking on their flights.
</P>
<P>
Transportation Minister Yitzhak Levy announced Monday his
intention to bar smoking on Israeli airline flights up to a
duration of five hours long as a year-long experiment.
</P>
<P>
Levy has asked the three Israeli aviation firms the El Al,
Arkia and the charter-flight subsidiary Sun D'or to present
detailed plans for gradual limitation and then halting of
smoking on commercial flights. Currently, smoking is barred on
flights for over two hours long.
</P>
<P>
His action came a few days ahead of the deadline set by the
High Court which heard a suit by stewards from Israel's leading
airline El Al and a frequent passenger demanding the end to
on-board smoking.
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs argued that air inside the aircraft is merely
recycled and not cleansed, and that no-smoking sections do not
prevent contaminated air from smoking sections from reaching the
passengers.
</P>
<P>
El Al stewards argued that their health was endangered by
constant exposure to tobacco smoke.
</P>
<P>
The court has instructed the transportation minister to set
up a committee of experts to examine the question. It heard
testimony in favor of a smoking prohibition from the Israel
Cancer Association, the Israel Society for the Prevention of
Smoking, and the Health and Environment Ministries.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the International Civil Aviation Organization
passed a resolution calling on member nations to bar smoking on
all commercial flights either entering or leaving their
country. So far, Canada and Australia have carried it out.
</P>
<P>
Levy said if the three Israeli firms did not present plans to
him within three months, he would consider the unilateral
establishment of new regulations to bar smoking on their
flights.
</P>
<P>
El Al spokesman Nahman Kleiman said his company would
consider a plan on banning smoking in the next three months. But
he expressed concern that this could harm El Al's marketing
efforts as some determined smokers could simply patronize other
airlines allowing smoking.
</P>
<P>
He suggested a smoking ban on all airlines flying to Israel
so as to solve the problem of competition that would be caused
by unilateral ban on local flights.

PARIS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and Russia today signed the historic treaty on
bilateral relations at 10:45 (08:45 GMT) in the Elysee
presidential palace here.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony was attended by French President Jacques
Chirac, U.S. President Bill Clinton, Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana and heads of state
or government of 13 other NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is intended to ease the way for the eastward
expansion of NATO.
</P>
<P>
Chirac gave a hug to Yeltsin when the latter arrived at the
presidential office for the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He met with President Clinton earlier this morning in his
office and held talks with him for about half an hour.
</P>
<P>
Chirac hailed the "disappearance of the last vestiges of the
Cold War" and pleaded for a renovation of the trans-Atlantic
alliance, so that Europe can "fully exercise their
responsibilities."
</P>
<P>
Chirac highlighted the "hope of a reconciliated Europe" which
led to the fall of the Berlin Wall eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Today it is about to draw the ultimate consequences of this
movement of history by making disappear the last vestiges of the
Cold War. To the logic of confrontation between adversaries of
yesterday, succeed an era of cooperation between the equal and
respected partners," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that the new agreement will not only remove the old
division in Europe since the Yalta conference in 1945, but to "rub
it out definitely".

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Success of Summit Depends on Israeli Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHARM EL-SHEIKH, EGYPT, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The success of the
ongoing summit between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu depends on Israel's
change of stance, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told
Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the remarks after he greeted Netanyahu at the local
airport.
</P>
<P>
On the outcome of the talks Mubarak's top advisor Osama el-Baz
held with top Israeli officials last week, Moussa said "some
progress has been made but Netanyahu insisted on talking to
Mubarak tete-a-tete."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu arrived here this morning to meet with Mubarak on
ways to revive the deadlocked peace process, while the prospects
for a breakthrough augur ill.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli premier made no statement upon arrival at the Red
Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh before rushing straight to a
five-star hotel for a second meeting this year with Mubarak to
curb the mounting crisis in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who has reportedly proposed a new initiative on
salvaging the peace process, flew here an hour earlier and held a
pre-summit meeting with his top aide Osama el-Baz, Prime Minister
Gamal el-Ganzouri and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
During today's talks, Netanyahu is expected to seek Mubarak's
support for ending the current crisis and building common ground
with the Palestinians. However, hope is slim for narrowing the
gap as Netanyahu insisted not discussing ways of stopping the
disputed Har Homa project, a contentious issue at the heart of
the current crisis, at the summit.
</P>
<P>
During the past few days, Mubarak has been trying to bridge
the differences between the Palestinian and Israeli sides through
a flurry of telephone contacts with Netanyahu as well as meetings
with Arab leaders. He also sent Baz to see Israeli top officials
twice in three days in preparation for today's summit and
possibly to sound out his new plan with Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that under Mubarak' five-point initiative, there
should be a "political solution" to the Har Homa issue. The plan
also envisages the resumption of Palestinian-Israeli security
cooperation, a halt to Jewish settlement building in the West
Bank, the immediate resumption of talks on Israeli further
redeployment in the West Bank and the final peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
While Jordan, the European Union and the United States have
apparently supported the plan, it is unknown whether Palestinian
National Authority President Yasser Arafat has endorsed it.
</P>
<P>
Although the Sharm el-Sheikh summit was intended to give
impetus to the Palestinian-Israeli peace track, the lack of
Israeli concession on the settlement issue at one point put the
convocation of the meeting in question. The Palestinians were
also pessimistic that Egypt would succeed in reviving peace
negotiations.

president in Friday's elections, Khatami said "as long as the
U.S. is after harming Iran's interests and independence, Iran
will have no relations with the U.S."
</P>
<P>
Khatami won 69 percent of the 29 million votes Friday, scoring
a landslide victory for the country's moderates over the
conservative wing.
</P>
<P>
"Iran will not tolerate any domination-seeking power. Any
change in our relations with the U.S. depends on changes of its
attitude," he said in his hour-long press conference.
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old president-elect said that the key is in the
hands of the U.S. administration.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, he has not seen any sign of change in the
attitude of the U.S. and American policies have always been
hostile towards the Iranian revolution.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran will not give up its independence which he
described as the main objective and outcome of the Islamic
Revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said Iran's ties with all countries of the world "are
based on two principles -- independence and national interest."
</P>
<P>
Observers pointed out that Khatami spelled out the same tone
of other Iranian leaders such as Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and
outgoing President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Any bold step in mending Iran-U.S. relations would be
impossible if without the endorsement of the Supreme Leader, they
said.
</P>
<P>
The English daily Tehran Times, believed to be close to the
pragmatic Rafsanjani government, yesterday urged the U.S. to
prove its goodwill for rapprochement and asked the Clinton
administration to abandon hostile policies toward Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran said it hoped for normal and friendly relations with all
countries in the world, except the U.S. and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati had said during an
interview that it is the supreme leader who defines Iran's foreign
policy no matter who is elected as the new president. There will
be no change in the foreign policy, he added.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Agriculture Sector Still Encouraging: Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Prospects for Malaysia's
agriculture sector are encouraging in view of the expected
sustained growth in the world economy, Malaysia's Public Bank said
today.
</P>
<P>
The sustained growth is likely to result in higher demand for
agriculture-related products from Malaysia while in the domestic
economy, increased income and favorable investment environment
would boost demand for food and non-food agricultural products,
the bank said in its Economic Review released today.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture sector has become a major supplier of raw
materials for resource and agro-based industries in downstream
processing in the country and this would ensure the importance of
the sector in Malaysia's overall economic development.
</P>
<P>
The sector has a bigger role now in terms of helping Malaysia
to sustain its economic growth by providing affordable food to
maintain low inflation, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the review, to ensure that the sector
maximizes its potential, it needed to overcome several challenges
such as labor and land shortages, high labor cost and low
productivity.
</P>
<P>
In terms of absolute value, the total agriculture sector's
value added continued to rise and the role of the agriculture
sector as an important supplier of raw materials such as palm oil,
rubber, cocoa and wood on the manufacturing sector is still
pertinent, the review said.
</P>
<P>
With the government promoting the food and agro-based
industrial clusters in the Second Industrial Master Plan
(1996-2005), it would augur well for a stronger rather than weaker
agriculture sector, it said.
</P>
<P>
As the Malaysian economy is shifting towards manufacturing and
services industries at a rapid pace, the proportion of agriculture
of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has been on a declining trend.
</P>
<P>
In the year 2000, the agriculture's contribution to GDP and
export earnings is estimated to decline from 13.6 percent and 13.1
percent in 1995 to 10.5 percent and 7.2 percent respectively, the
bank predicted.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe
announced his resignation today after the first round of the
country's legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
During the first round elections on Sunday, the ruling right
coalition only won 30 percent of the votes, almost 10 percentage
points lower than the leftists who are not in office.
</P>
<P>
"Voters have just given us a serious warning. A new era must
begin now. A new team led by a new prime minister is needed," to
lead the rightist's election, said Juppe in a televised message to
his supporters. "My job is done," he added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that President Jacques Chirac had telephone
conversations with the rightist leaders after the results of the
first round election were announced and held talks with Juppe. He
is expected to explain the reason for Juppe's resignation.
</P>
<P>
Chirac dissolved the National Assembly on April 21 and called
the legislative elections nearly a year earlier in a bid to carry
out the reform in France and do more for the European
integration.

<HEADLINE> Center Of Ancient State Discovered In China's Three Gorges Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The center of the Ba State which
disappeared some 2,000 years ago has been found in the Three
Gorges Area where China's largest dam project is underway.
</P>
<P>
The find is expected to tell scholars more about the state,
from which there are few relics, said Yu Weichao, curator of
Beijing's Museum of Chinese History and head of a cultural relics
protection group for the Three Gorges Area.
</P>
<P>
The 100,000-sq.m. site is on the Daning River, a tributary of
the Yangtze, in Wushan county in southwest China's Chongqing city.
</P>
<P>
A fine bronze cup 80 cm high, a bronze ingot, and copper
deposits were found nearby, suggesting a high degree of bronze
smelting ability for the Ba, according to Yu, who noted that the
find has led to a break with the traditional view that the Ba were
a brave but culturally-undeveloped people.
</P>
<P>
According to historical records, they helped the Zhou People
overthrow the Shang Dynasty (16th-11th Century BC) and were
allowed to set up Ba state on the middle reaches of the Yangtze
River. They helped the Qin State kill tigers that existed in large
numbers in the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770-221 BC) and later helped
Liu Bang, first emperor of the Western Han (206 BC-24 AD), take
over Hanzhong in modern-day China's Shaanxi province, a gate to
the political center of the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC).
</P>
<P>
The Ba kept moving westward some 4,000 to 2,000 years ago,
under the threat of the Chu people, who finally ruled the middle
reaches of the Yangtze river.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 years ago, the Ba settled near present-day Chongqing
city but gradually vanished over a period of time. Archaeologists
had seen none of their relics until the mid-1960's when a
3,500-year-old site was discovered in Zhongxian county in the
eastern part of Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
But it was not a bid enough find to describe the main features
of the state, gaps which the new site is expected to fill in.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary exploration of the new site has revealed the
remains of a 50,000-sq.m. salt-making center some 80-km away, and
that it was an economic center of the Ba State.

PARIS -- The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and
Russia will sign on Tuesday in Paris a "historic" agreement on
bilateral relations, also called "Founder Act", which is designed
to note a period to the history of the Cold War. The "Founder

Romania and Slovenia later.

Lebanon Army militia in the Jezzine area in the north sector of

JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has

project on Tuesday's summit with Egyptian President Hosni

would bring the Palestinians back to the negotiating table without
a construction freeze on Har Homa.

YANGON -- The United States' recent economic sanction could
hardly have any effect on Myanmar since the country have already

banning new U.S. investment in the country.

ROME -- The Italian-led multinational force in Albania is
likely to stay in the crisis-hit country after its mandate runs

<HEADLINE> Chain Hotel Giant establishes Israeli presence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Howard Johnson International
Inc., an international hotel chain, has announced that four
local Israeli hotels have joined its chain as the first
stage of a Near East program of the firm.
</P>
<P>
Today's Jerusalem Post said that the US-based chain, making
its first appearance in Israel, also plans in the coming
year to open six more hotels in Israel and launch several
in Cyprus, Greece, Turkey and the Palestinian Autonomous areas.
</P>
<P>
"We aim to have 15 to 20 hotels across the region by
1998," says Shlomo Groffman, chairman of the Israel Land
Development Hotels Corporation, which holds the franchise for
Howard Johnson in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli hotels which joined the chain are the Ruth
Rimon Inn in Safed and the Galei Kineret in Tiberias, both
in northern Israel, and the Galei Eilat and Neptune in
Israel's Red Sea resort of Eilat.
</P>
<P>
All the Israelis hotels, in the three to five star range,
belong to the Israel Land Development Hotels Corp. and have been
upgraded to meet Howard Johnson standards.
</P>
<P>
They will operate as franchise hotels under the company's
top brand name, Howard Johnson Plaza, in return, Howard
Johnson will receive an undisclosed percentage of their
prospective profits.
</P>
<P>
"Joining Howard Johnson is good for us," Howard Johnson
Israel general manager Micky Schwartz said. "We get the brand
name and the international reservations system."
</P>
<P>
"To be a domestic hotel chain is no longer enough in
today's market," said Schwartz. "The future in hotels belongs
to worldwide names."
</P>
<P>
Johnson, one of the most aggressive international chains, is
owned by HFS Incorporated, the New Jersey-based holding company
which includes the Days Inn, Ramada and Park Inn chains, and
has an annual turnover of 800 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Losing Faith in Peace Process: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian's faith in the
Middle East peace process is draining as a poll registers a
further drop of optimism from two months ago.
</P>
<P>
The poll, whose results came out here today, was conducted
among 1,185 Palestinians on May 15-16 by the Jerusalem Media and
Communication Center.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, optimism toward the future and support
for the peace process slipped to 69 percent, from 73 percent in
April, apparently due to the current stalemate in peace talks
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations have been stalled since March, after Israel
started to build a controversial Jewish settlement at Har Homa
(Jabal Abu Ghneim) on the southeastern outskirts of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians demanded that Israel stop the construction before
talks can be resumed, whereas Israel insisted that the
Palestinian Authority must crack down on terrorism and
re-establish full security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Asked how they felt about the United States' role as a peace
broker, only 4 percent of the interviewed thought it is neutral,
while 91 percent believed it is biased in favor of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Also dropped was support for Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat, whose supporting rate had been generally stable
despite a growing disillusion with the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Only 54 percent judged Arafat's overall performance as good,
down from 68 percent in April; while those thought Arafat the
most trustworthy leader declined to 40 percent from 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
A growing number of 25 percent, up from 18 percent, has faith
in no one, shows the poll, which was declared as having a 3
percent margin of error by the sponsor.
</P>
<P>
However, the radical opposition has not made significant gains
from the disillusionment.
</P>
<P>
Support for military operations against Israel stood at 34
percent, but support for suicide bombing has declined from 40
percent in April to 24 percent, with 65 percent against.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Netanyahu Open Talks in Sharm el-Sheikh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHARM EL-SHEIKH, EGYPT, May 27 (Xinhua) -- In an attempt to
break ice in the Middle East peace process, Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak met with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
here today, but a breakthrough remains in doubt.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli premier made no statement upon his arrival at the
Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh before rushing straight to a
five-star hotel for a second meeting this year with Mubarak to
curb the mounting crisis in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has reportedly proposed a new initiative on salvaging
the peace process, which collapsed in mid-March when Israel broke
ground for a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem,
sparking weeks of Palestinian violence.
</P>
<P>
Keeping the details secret, Egypt said further contacts are
needed to crystalize it.
</P>
<P>
During today's talks, Netanyahu is expected to seek Mubarak's
support for ending the current crisis and building common ground
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
However, the hope is slim for narrowing the gap as Netanyahu
insisted on not stopping the disputed Har Homa project, a
contentious issue at the heart of the current crisis, at the
summit.
</P>
<P>
"It is not on the agenda, not on mine," Netanyahu told Israeli
press ahead of the talks with Mubarak, who he hoped could encourage
the Palestinians to return to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
During the past few days, Mubarak has been trying to bridge the
differences between the Palestinian and Israeli sides through a
flurry of telephone contacts with Netanyahu as well as meetings
with Arab leaders. The president also sent his top advisor Osama
el-Baz to see Israeli top officials twice in three days in
preparation for today's summit and possibly to sound out his new
plan with Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that under Mubarak' five-point initiative, there
should be a "political solution" to the Har Homa issue. The plan
also envisages the resumption of Palestinian-Israeli security
cooperation, a halt to Jewish settlement building in the West
Bank, an immediate resumption of talks on further redeployment of
Israeli troops in the West Bank and the final peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
While Jordan, the European Union and the United States have
apparently supported the plan, it is unknown whether Palestinian
National Authority President Yasser Arafat has endorsed it.
</P>
<P>
Although the Sharm el-Sheikh summit was intended to give
impetus to the Palestinian-Israeli peace track, the lack of
Israeli concession on the settlement issue at one point put the
convocation of the meeting in question.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians were also pessimistic that Egypt would
succeed in reviving peace negotiations, something U.S. Middle
East Peace Coordinator Dennis Ross has failed to deliver in his
last three rounds of shuttle missions in the region. They fear
that Israel's assertion of sovereignty over Jerusalem kills their
hope for a future capital in the city's eastern part.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, after visiting Cairo last
week, said that unless Israel gave up its settlement policies,
there could be no way out of the peace deadlock and the region
would be heading for the "abyss of tensions."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who has intensified his diplomatic drive to reverse
the deadlocked process, has vowed to give peace a chance. "I
cannot confirm that our efforts will succeed one hundred percent
as circumstances are difficult, but the current situation is
worth a drive by any means," Mubarak told a press conference
after a few-hour meeting with Jordan's King Hussein last Saturday.

<HEADLINE> China Expects Good Summer Grain Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- China is expecting a record summer
grain harvest this year thanks to warm spring weather, ample
rainfall, expanded crop-growing areas, and improved management.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in provinces in the southern and southwestern parts of
China have finished the harvest, while around the Huaihe and
Hanshui river basins they are busy getting in the crop, and in north
China preparations are under way.
</P>
<P>
China has 31.8 million ha of summer grain crops this year,
333,300 ha more than last year, according to Wang Zhicai, an
official with the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
To make the fullest possible use of the limited amount of farm
machinery, the ministries of agriculture, public security,
telecommunications, and machine-building industry, along with
government departments will organize inter-regional cooperation in
using combines for harvest summer grain crops.
</P>
<P>
A total of 19 provinces and autonomous regions in the north,
northwest, northeast, and southern parts of China will share
combines according to time differences, and on a bigger scale than
last year.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 30,000 combines will travel most of the country,
6,600 more than last year, in 19 provinces on an area that
accounts for 55 percent of the wheat growing areas there.
</P>
<P>
Inter-province harvesting can save labor, reduce grain loss,
accelerate the process of mechanization, and pave the way for the
development of rural industry and service trade, said Wei Kejia,
director of the Ministry of Agriculture's Department of Farm
Machinery Management.
</P>
<P>
Central China's Henan Province, a major wheat producer, will
organize 13 million tractors, 250,000 reapers, 14,000 combines,
and 570,000 threshers for the summer harvest on 4.9 million ha of
land.
</P>
<P>
Shandong Province in east China will use combines to harvest
a sixth of the four million ha of wheat this year.

<HEADLINE> Report: Jerusalem's Jewish Growth Rate Dropping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The growth rate of Jewish
population in Jerusalem is decreasing gradually, but the Arab
population will increase to 31 percent in the year 2010, according
to a report released today.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1995-1996 yearbook of Jerusalem published by
the Jerusalem Institute for Israeli Studies, the overall
population in Jerusalem at the end of 1996 stood at 603,000, of
which 422,100, or 70 percent, were Jews. Palestinians comprise
the remaining 30 percent, 90 percent of the Palestinians are
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The overall population in the holy city has grown at 139
percent since the 1967 Six-Day War when Israel occupied East
Jerusalem, with Jews growing by 114 percent, compared with 163
percent of Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Since 1967, the growth rate of Jewish residents among the
population decreased from 74.2 percent to 70.5 percent in
1995. About 55 percent of the city's population lived in areas
that were added to the city after the 1967 war, and of this group
Jews accounted for 48 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem is getting more and more religious as the
ultra-orthodox Jewish population continues growing faster than
that of the secular sector.
</P>
<P>
Projected figures for the year 2010 show the number of
orthodox Jews will reach 214,000, or 26 percent of the total
population and 38 percent of the Jewish population. But the city
will remain mostly secular, as non-orthodox Jews are expected to
make up 62 percent of the Jewish population.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed that Jerusalem is among the poorest
cities in Israel, with 37 percent of children living below the
poverty line in 1995, compared with the average of 23.2 percent
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The poverty line is defined as 3,379 shekels (about 1,100
U.S. dollars) a month for a family of five.
</P>
<P>
Poverty, housing shortage, lack of opportunities and
increasingly restrained relations between orthodox and secular
Jews are preventing new immigrants from choosing to live in
Jerusalem. Only 5.9 percent of new immigrants coming to Israel
in 1995 chose to settle in Jerusalem, compared with eight percent in
1991, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmer claimed earlier that this justified
his demand for more house-building, like the controversial Har
Homa project that has again stalled the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process.

<HEADLINE> Shanxi Leads in North China's Industrial Technology Renovation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Shanxi province in north China has
made some progress in renovating key industrial enterprises since
1990.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 alone, the province put 800 million US dollars and
special state loans of 300 million US dollars in technology
renovation, four and seven times the average of the four previous
years, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Among the 18 autonomous regions and provinces in northwest and
central China, Shanxi ranks first in amount of special loans for
technology renovation.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi has 187 projects as part of the state technology
renovation plan, with investments totalling 1.5 billion US
dollars, and special loans of 900 million US dollars. The province
plans to raise 110 million US dollars for 400 projects in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, it has renovated 50 coal, electricity, iron and
building materials projects.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the opening-up policy since the late 1970s, large
state-owned enterprises attracted 38 million US dollars of foreign
investment in technology renovation in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Some enterprises raised renovation funds by issuing stocks
overseas, collecting a total of 30 million US dollars in foreign
funds for technology renovation in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Israel-Backed Militia Attacked in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Two members of Israel's surrogate
militia in south Lebanon were wounded in a guerrilla attack on an
armored personnel carrier in the Israeli-occupied border strip,
local newspaper Daily Star reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said guerrillas detonated Monday evening a roadside
bomb targeting the APC of the South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia in
the Jezzine area in the north sector of the Israeli
self-proclaimed "security zone."
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, which
spearheads a guerrilla warfare in south Lebanon to oust Israeli
occupation forces, claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
"The attack left all the collaborators of Israel, who were in
the APC, either wounded or dead," the Shiite Islamic organization
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the 2,500-strong SLA militia, which patrols the
Israeli self-carved buffer zone, confirmed the guerrilla attack,
and admitted that two militiamen were wounded in the blast.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier statement, Hezbollah said that its fighters also
fired mortar shells at the Toumat Niha outpost in the Western
Beqaa, which is manned by the SLA.
</P>
<P>
"Direct hits had been scored on the outpost," the Hezbollah
statement added without specifying casualties.
</P>
<P>
In response to the guerrilla offensives, Israeli forces
launched Monday evening an air raid against suspected Hezbollah
bases in the Western Beqaa, some 80 kilometers southeast of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli jets swooped down on the hills between the towns of
Mashghara and Ain Al-Tineh, firing four air-to-surface missiles,
security sources said. But there was no report of the casualties.
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by Muslim guerrillas on the border strip
and retaliatory bombardments and air raids by Israeli forces
constitute a daily scene in south Lebanon, the last active
battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state established the 1,100-square-km "security
zone" in 1985 ostensibly to protect northern Israel from
cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Bagbandy Elected New Mongolian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Nachagyn Bagbandy of the
People's Revolutionary Party was elected new president of Mongolia
during the May 18 presidential election, defeating incumbent
President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat.
</P>
<P>
Bagbandy, 47, won 60.81 percent of the votes, said Lhagvasuren,
chairman of the Election Committee, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the Mongolian law, a candidate who gains more than half
of the votes will become the president.
</P>
<P>
President Ochirbat, from the ruling Democratic Union Coalition
of the National Democratic Party (NDP) and the Social Democratic
Party (SDP), collected 29.81 percent of the votes, said
Lhagvasuren.
</P>
<P>
The Great Hural of Mongolia (parliament) will hold a meeting
soon to decide the swearing-in date for Bagbandy, who served
as chairman of the parliament from July 1992 to July 1996.
</P>
<P>
The declines of the economy and people's standard of living are
thought to be the main reasons for the defeat of Ochirbat, who did
not take into account the bearing capability of enterprises and
people in implementing his economic and social policies.
</P>
<P>
However, Bagbandy will cooperate with the parliament which was
controlled by the NDP and SDP to move on the country's economic
and social reforms. To reduce the unemployment and poverty will be
the major tasks for Bagbandy.
</P>
<P>
Some 85 percent of the 1.15 million eligible voters turned out
in this second direct election in the country.

<HEADLINE> 161 Military Officers Dismissed in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A total of 161 officers and
non-commissioned officers were removed from the Turkish Armed
Forces on alleged "disciplinary" charges, local newspaper Daily
News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Islamic Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, who is under
pressure from the secular establishment, agreed to the dismissal
at the Supreme Military Council (SMC) meeting on Monday under
his own chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
Reliable military sources told the paper that 85 percent of
these armymen, three of them colonels, were dismissed on grounds
of their radical Islamic tendencies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the top brass led by Chief of General Staff
Ismail Hakki Karadayi also agreed in principle to reconsider the
status of a high-ranking military official, who had publicly
slammed Erbakan for his last April Hajji trip to Mecca, Saudi
Arabia, in return for the Prime Minister's signing of the
dismissal.
</P>
<P>
During the six-hour meeting, Erbakan was informed about the
military concern about the growth of the fundamentalists in
the country and also Turkey's cross-border military operation in
pursuit of the PKK rebels in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted sources close to the meeting as saying
that the generals complained about the Welfare
Party-led coalition government's reluctance in implementing the
anti-fundamentalism measures adopted at last February National
Security Council (NSC).
</P>
<P>
The removal of the 161 officers was the first move of
its kind this year, compared with 119 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that this was part of the military
efforts to force the Islamic Prime Minister to take tough
measures agaisnt the increasing fundamentalist force in the
secular Muslim country.
</P>
<P>
The SMC meeting, which is different with the NSC chaired
by the Turkish president with a broader scope, usually meets
twice a year in August and December. The Monday meeting was
convened under the request of General Karadayi.

<P>
PARIS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and Russia will sign today in Paris a
"historic" agreement on bilateral relations, also called "Founder
Act", which is designed to note a period to the history of the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and French President Jacques
Chirac said Monday evening that the agreement will bring a "new
era of peace" to Europe.
</P>
<P>
The 16-page agreement will be signed at 10:30 (08:30 GMT) at
the Elysee presidential palace by Yeltsin and heads of state or
governments of 15 NATO countries, led by U.S. President Bill
Clinton, as well as NATO secretary general Javier Solana.
</P>
<P>
The "Founder Act," agreed upon two weeks ago in Moscow after
months of negotiations, will give a green light to NATO's plan to
take in Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary this year, and
probably Romania and Slovenia later.
</P>
<P>
It also agrees that NATO will not deploy nuclear arms or large
numbers of troops in the newly admitted member countries.
</P>
<P>
Russia has warned that no former Soviet republics should be
absorbed by NATO in the next wave of its expansion, especially the
three Baltic republics which Moscow regards as its traditional
sphere of influence.
</P>
<P>
NATO and Russia will also set up a permanent council to
exchange information and cooperate in NATO peace-keeping missions,
but Russia will not have the right to veto NATO decisions, as has
been requested by Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Publish Plan on Sale of National Airline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government is
expected to publish its plan next week for the privatization
of El Al, Israel's national airline, Israel Radio reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Transport Ministry Director-General Nahoum
Langental as saying that the committee responsible for deciding
the nature of El Al's privatization will publish its blueprint
"within seven to 10 days."
</P>
<P>
It is still unclear what form the sale will take, with
differences of opinion still thought to exist between Langental
and the other two committee members, Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu's economics adviser Moshe Leon and Government Companies
Authority Director-General Tzipi Livni.
</P>
<P>
The issue of sale by public floatation or controlling shares
was not discussed during a joint meeting of the Economics and
Labor and Social Affairs committees of the Knesset (Israel's
parliament) earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The company reported 80 million U.S. dollars in losses last
year, the first year in the red since 1985.
</P>
<P>
"If the company remains in its current format, it will
soon cease to exist," Knesset Speaker Dan Tichon said in
calling for an immediate sale which includes full protection
of workers' rights.
</P>
<P>
The joint Knesset committee later issued a statement which
recommended that the company not be privatized if the full
rights of workers are not guaranteed and that there be no
government discussion of the privatization until comprehensive
talks have been held with employees.
</P>
<P>
However, Transport Minister Yitzhak Levy said that "the
operation of El Al is highly efficient, therefore we have no
argument over the place and importance of workers in the
company."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Artists to Perform Ballet Classic "Don Quixote" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The ballet classic "Don Quixote"
will be performed in Beijing tonight as part of the '97 China
International Opera and Ballet Year.
</P>
<P>
The National Ballet Troupe of China (NBTC) performed the ballet
classic "Swan Lake" and a modern Chinese ballet "the Red
Detachment of Women" earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Ping, an official with the China Performing Arts Agency
said that the agency has arranged many cultural exchanges between
the NBTC and leading ballet troupes from a number of countries
like France, Switzerland, and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and foreign ballet stars have performed together in
many ballets like "Giselle", "Don Quixote", "The Nutcracker", and
"Sleeping Beauty", Yuan noted, and that three young artists from
NBTC will take part in a world ballet competition in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"Don Quixote" is based on the novel of the same name by Miguel
Saavedra de Cervantes, one of Spain's most prominent Renaissance
literary figures. Cervantes' novel tells the story of a hapless
knight who tries to save the world.
</P>
<P>
The ballet was first performed by a Russian ballet troupe at
the Moscow Grand Theater in 1896.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Organize ASEAN Energy Business Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will organize the
first ASEAN Energy Business Forum next month in a bid to
facilitate greater private sector participation in the
capital-intensive sector.
</P>
<P>
The forum, to be opened by Acting Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim
on June 5, will see the exchange of business ideas, opportunities
and concerns of the energy industry not only in Malaysia but also
in the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) region as
well, according to a statement issued here today.
</P>
<P>
The forum is expected to bring together about 200 corporate
officials within the energy and power sector to brainstorm on
issues of common interest, it said.
</P>
<P>
Papers to be presented cover Gas Grid Development in ASEAN,
ASEAN Power Grid Development and Funding Options for Energy
Projects in ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
The forum is being organized in view of the fact that the fifth
ASEAN summit in Bangkok in December 1995 stressed the important
role the private sector has to play in enhancing economic
cooperation particularly in the field of energy.
</P>
<P>
At present, private sector involvement in the deliberations of
the Senior Officials Meeting on Energy and the ASEAN Ministers on
Energy Meeting is at the discretion of the respective member
countries and limited to national oil and power companies.

<HEADLINE> Survey Indicates Improved Standard of Living in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey on the Tibet
Autonomous Region's economy and social conditions by the regional
government shows considerable improvement in the standard of
living.
</P>
<P>
Per capita income of urban residents in 1996 was 5,036 yuan,
almost three times that of 1990, and annual income of Tibetan
farmers and herdsmen was 960 yuan, more than twice that of
1990. The income also came from diverse activities.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that Tibetans are eating less grain and more
nutritious foods like fresh meat, eggs, dairy products, and
processed bean products.
</P>
<P>
Urban residents spent 774 yuan on clothes on average, 3.7 times
the 1990 figure, and were paying closer attention to up-to-date
styles, and the quality and color of cloth. Wool and silk were
very popular.
</P>
<P>
In the countryside, ready-made clothes took the place of
home-made, and rural youths were emulating their city cousins.
</P>
<P>
Per capita living space of urban residents went from 11
sq.m. in 1990 to 15 sq.m. in 1996, with more people living in
multistory buildings with better facilities.
</P>
<P>
On average, the living space of farmers and herdsmen rose from
19 sq.m. in 1990 to 20 sq.m. last year, and more houses are being
made of bricks and wood instead of earth and wood.
</P>
<P>
With more income, Tibetans have more fixed assets and household
items. The survey found that in larger cities there were 98 color
TV sets, 78 washing machines, and 50 refrigerators every 100
households, and 76 bicycles and 35 sewing machines for every 100
rural households. With the radio and television programs now
available, there are more TV sets and cassette recorders in rural
homes.
</P>
<P>
The survey also indicates that urban people spend more money on
recreation and telecommunications, while rural people like to buy
modern tools.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China's Health Care For Women, Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
in northwest China has worked on improving health care facilities
for women and children in its large farming and pasture areas.
</P>
<P>
From 1992 to 1995, regional authorities spent 13 million yuan
(1.6 million US dollars) annually for building rural clinics,
providing equipment, and training professionals in farming and
pasture areas.
</P>
<P>
The region now has 38 hospitals now for infant care that
recommend breast-feeding, and all hospitals at and above the
county-level have an obstetrics and gynecology department and one
for pediatrics, while ob-gyn departments in township-level
hospitals are much better equipped than before.
</P>
<P>
With the improved facilities and better personnel, the infant
mortality rate and that of pregnant women and women in labor have
dropped to 6.8 percent and 28 per 10,000, respectively, and the
vaccination rate for children is 88 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the 1990-1995 period, some 3.6 million women and
children in Xinjiang have also benefited from a
1.26-million-US-dollar project undertaken jointly by the Chinese
government, the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations
Population Fund, and the World Health Organization.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Rules Out Har Homa Deal at Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu has ruled out making a deal on halting the
controversial Har Homa project at today's summit with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published on today's The Jerusalem Post,
Netanyahu said he hoped Egypt would produce a solution that
would bring the Palestinians back to the negotiating table
without a construction freeze on Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that he had no intention of stopping the Har
Homa project because it was part of the government policy of
preventing the redivision of the holy city and ensuring there
is no return to the 1967 borders.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is departing for the Egyptian resort city of
Sharm el-Sheikh this morning to hold the summit with Mubarak.
He will be accompanied by Foreign Minister david Levy, Cabinet
Secretary Danny Naveh, the UN Ambassador-designate Dore Gold, and
senior advisers Uzi Arad, David Bar-Illan and Yitzhak Molcho.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the Sharm el-Sheikh summit, Mubarak's
senior adviser Osama Baz visited Israel twice in the past
week to hold talks with Netanyahu and other officials. Mubarak
also held talks with Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat and Jordanian King Hussein to coordinate their positions.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Netanyahu held consulations with Levy and
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai on Monday to pave the way
for today's summit, an indication that some kind of agreement
was reached.
</P>
<P>
Despite low expectations for a dramatic breakthrough, Israeli
sources estimated that Netanyahu would possibly make some
gestures or concessions in an attempt to break the ice in
the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is expected to offer some concessions on issues
such as building more Arab housing in Jerusalem and opening
safe passages between West Bank and Gaza Strip, Gaza airport
and seaport.
</P>
<P>
Israeli television Channel I reported Monday night that
Netanyahu would demand a meeting with Arafat, who has refused
to talk to Netanyahu since Israel began the Har Homa project
in late March.
</P>
<P>
Arafat held talks with Mubarak in Cairo Monday, in which
he reportedly asked the Egyptian president to make the
Palestinian demand of halting the Har Homa construction clear
at today's summit.

</P>
<P>
Economy -- sustained economic growth pushed per capita gross

<HEADLINE> Local Elections in Parts of Nepal Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Polling has been postponed in
many places for Nepal's second phase of local elections after
clashes between rival factions of different political parties.
</P>
<P>
The local polls were postponed Monday at some 270 polling
stations, about 10 percent of the total, in the country's central
and eastern regions, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Officials here said Monday evening that the polls in 35
districts concluded peacefully despite some sporadic incidents.

worker, died in separate violent incidents relating to the polls.
Two of the three deaths were confirmed by the Home Ministry.

between activists of major political parties in different
villages.
</P>
<P>
Another man was reportedly shot dead by an unidentified sniper
hiding in a haystack when he was waiting to cast his ballot in a
queue. The assailant managed to escape.

and blank shots to bring the situation under control in many of
the confrontation cases, the Home Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Election officials estimated that the voter turnout rate of
Monday's polls was a little more than 50 percent, similar to that
of the local elections' first phase held on May 17 in West Nepal's

<HEADLINE> Large-scale Cotton Farming in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A growing number of farmers in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have increased
their incomes by being ambitious enough to run an entire cotton
farm.
</P>
<P>
Kalatale Township in Aksu city in the Tarim Basin has even
begun to get a reputation for this as farmers there become owners
of large-scale cotton farms. More than 80 percent of the farmers
in the township grow cotton on at least two ha, and three even
manage over 600 ha each.
</P>
<P>
Wang Guoze is one outstanding example. The 60-year-old man
operates 1,500 ha of cotton and more than 600 ha of paddies, as
well as another 600 ha of farmland several hundred kilometers
away. He has already been a millionaire for some time now.
</P>
<P>
Yusan Hasan is following in his tracks, with more than 133 ha
of cotton, and plans to reclaim 2,000 ha of wasteland in three
years. "If my reclamation project goes smoothly this year, I will
catch up with Wang and be alongside him pretty soon," said the
Uygur farmer.
</P>
<P>
Yusan plans to spend six million yuan of his own money and
apply for a loan from a World Bank agriculture project being
undertaken in the Tarim Basin.
</P>
<P>
He has also returned 20 ha of farmland on which he had a
contract to the village, as he is turning more wasteland into
fertile land. He has sold more than 1,000 tons of cotton in the
past six years and is prepared for further development. He has
nearly 100 migrant workers in his employ.
</P>
<P>
But he only had one bulldozer when he started reclaiming
land. To his undying gratitude, Wang came to help him with his own
bulldozers, tractors, and seeders. "Wang is the pioneer, and I
have learned a lot from him," explains the 45-year-old Yusan.
</P>
<P>
The Uygur farmer has invested all his money in cotton
production and says, "I will spend several million yuan opening a
school when my reclamation work pays off, and I will give my
cultivated land to villagers if I am not able to do it. What I
want to leave behind is a good reputation."
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang is China's largest cotton producer, with more than a
quarter of the national output annually. The growing number of
cotton farms in the Tarim Basin and elsewhere speak for themselves.
</P>
<P>
The emergence of these cotton farms is not only an economic

<HEADLINE> Analysis: Thai Bourse Computer Crash: Fishy or Not </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The ailing Stock Exchange of
Thailand (SET) suffered a further setback when it was "choked" by
a computer breakdown.
</P>
<P>
The stock market on Monday halted at 10:03 a.m., only three
minutes after the morning trading session began. During the three
minutes, the SET index nosedived as much as 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
It was only at 16:15 that the market resumed, and with the
resumption, the index nosedive also continued.
</P>
<P>
Trading ran for only 30 minutes until 4:45 p.m., 15 minutes
after the usual closing time of 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
The index closed 12.77 points (2.2 percent) down on 568.36
points for the day.
</P>
<P>
The question that has emerged is: Was the computer breakdown
accidental or intentional?
</P>
<P>
SET executive Vice President Surat Palalikit claimed that the
stock exchange's computer hardware simply failed, categorically
denying allegations that the SET was "locked up" on instruction by
"authorities".
</P>
<P>
However, some brokers and traders are suspicious that the
sudden closing of the market was not accidental, saying the SET's
computer system might have been shut down "intentionally" to
prevent an even bigger decline.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts say the SET authorities were worried about a
possible meltdown in the financial sector in the fallout following
the cancellation of the Finance One merger.
</P>
<P>
Analysts' suspicion was not without reason.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday they already predicted that the news of the
breakdown of the proposed merger between the country's biggest
finance company, Finance One, and Thai Danu Bank could lead to a
stock market crash when trading opened on Monday.
</P>
<P>
And SET authorities were equally aware of this possibility.
</P>
<P>
The much-vaunted merger between the debt-ridden Finance One and
the respected Thai Danu Bank collapsed when Thai Danu pulled out
amid reports that non-performing loans on Finance One's books were
greater than expected.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government had hoped the merger would succeed and set
a model for smaller finance firms burdened with non-performing
loans from the floundering property sector.
</P>
<P>
The 2.2 percent index loss for 33 minutes' trading proved that
the analysts' suspicion was not without grounds, although the
index loss could not indicate if the computer crash was
"manipulated" or "unintentional".

MEXICO CITY, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's exports to Southeast
Asia have reached more than 300 million U.S. dollars so far this
year, an official with Mexico's foreign trade bank said here today.
</P>
<P>
The exports, including food, chemical, petrochemical, steel and
marble products and synthetic fibers, mostly were from the eastern
state of Tlaxcala, said Felipe Zertuche, of the Bancomext.
</P>
<P>
They went to Brunei, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, said Zertuche, who is the bank's
assistant manager in charge of the Southeast Asian market.
</P>
<P>
These countries, he noted, have a total of 430 million
consumers and the entire region has a combined gross national
product (GNP) of 685 billion dollars growing at 9 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the bank official said, there are sufficient
resources among those consumers to acquire products from
Tlaxcala.

<HEADLINE> International Force in Albania to Extend Mandate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Italian-led multinational force
(MPF) in Albania is likely to stay in the crisis-hit country after
its mandate runs out on June 28, the European envoy to Albania
Franz Vranitzky said here today.
</P>
<P>
It would be "ridiculous" for the MPF to leave the Balkan state
when general elections are being held on June 29, the envoy told a
joint session of the Italian parliament's foreign and defense
committees.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky, former Austrian Chancellor now acting as envoy to
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in
Albania, said, "I expect to see a request for an extension, and
an extension there will be."
</P>
<P>
But he ruled out the possibility that the mission could in any
way offer "guarantees" for the elections, which are being held to
try and end the chaos which has gripped the country since February
when opponents of President Sali Berisha took to the streets in an
armed rebellion.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky said it would be impossible for the 6,400-strong MPF
to protect all polling stations.
</P>
<P>
A "maximum of support and cooperation can be given, but we
can't give our guarantees," he said.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky is in Italy to attend a preparatory meeting for an
international conference on aid for Albania on June 18.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting, with Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini in
the chair, was also attended by Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim
Fino and representatives from the MPF, Russia, the United States,
the European Union, the OSCE, the United Nations, NATO and the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
All the representatives at the meeting expressed their support
for Albania's national reconciliation government, a caretaker
government led by Fino.
</P>
<P>
But they said the government must guarantee the holding of free
and fair elections.
</P>
<P>
A document issued after the meeting called on all Albanian
political forces to try to end the inter-party strife which has
threatened the elections scheduled for June 29.
</P>
<P>
International aid to Albania will depend on the coordination
offered by the Albanian authorities which must guarantee domestic
security and a well-run election.
</P>
<P>
The international community also called for the Albanian regime
to carry out sound monetary and financial policies, which is
another condition for the provision of aid to reconstruct the
chaos-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Fino told reporters after the meeting that the extensive
domestic problems were still hindering prospects for successful
elections.
</P>
<P>
In particular, he urged "immediate repeal" of the two-month
state of emergency and noted the lack of guarantees offered by the
present police force, and the extensive security and public order
problems.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky also hoped that more of the OSCE's 54 members would
play a direct role in assisting Albania.
</P>
<P>
"We need the support of more countries," said the envoy, who
travels to Brussels on Tuesday with the same message.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sanction Can hardly Affect Myanmar: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States' recent economic
sanction could hardly have any effect on Myanmar since the country
have already had many foreign investments from other countries, a
senior government official said.
</P>
<P>
The United States announced on May 20 to impose economic
sanctions on Myanmar, banning new U.S. investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
The New Light of Myanmar today quoted Minister for Hotels and
Tourism Kyaw Ba as saying that "If we survived through our own
self-imposed isolation for 30 years, the USA's economic sanction
could hardly have any effect on us at this specific moment when
our economy is moving rapidly towards a market-oriented economy."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of an International Hotels and Tourism
Training Program here on Monday, Kyaw Ba said "We were in
isolation for nearly 30 years in the past, and yet we have all
along been self-sufficient." "There was no event of our people
suffering from famine or starvation," he added.
</P>
<P>
There are 428 hotels with 9,910 rooms in Myanmar and over
230,000 tourists visited Myanmar in 1996, according to the latest
available official figures.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in the hotels and tourism sector amounted to
762.56 million U.S. dollars in 39 permitted projects at the end of
March this year.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Extremists Kill Five in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Suspected members of the Muslim
extremist Abu Sayyaf group have executed five of the seven people
they abducted last Friday in Basilan province, the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Citing police reports, today's local newspaper reports said the
bodies of the victims were recovered Sunday by Army soldiers
pursuing the Abu Sayyaf rebels in the province.
</P>
<P>
Police said the other two captors were later released unharmed
by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The seven people were abducted after refusing to pay the rebels
a "revolutionary tax" for protection, according to the police.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf, a Muslim extremist group, has been notorious
for a series of murder, kidnapping, extortion and robbery in
Basilan and nearby provinces.
</P>
<P>
A previously unknown group, the Abu Sayyaf grabbed the
headlines when it launched a lightning attack on Ipil town in
Zambonga del Sur province in Mindanao Island some three years ago.
</P>
<P>
The attack killed at least 56 people, wounded many others and
destroyed millions of pesos worth of property.
</P>
<P>
But the military said the Abu Sayyaf has degenerated into
little more than isolated bandits, elusive in their mountain
enclaves. The group has shunned peace talks with the government.

Yongchaiyudh is optimistic that Thailand's economy will gradually
recover after it has hit rock-bottom, according to local press
reports today.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit said Monday that all the measures adopted by the Thai
government to address the economic doldrums would soon show
positive results.
</P>
<P>
Exports, for an instance, will pick up with a total value
expected to reach 1,500 billion baht (60 billion US dollars) this
year while revenue from tourism is like to gross 200-300 billion
baht (8-12 billion dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Bank of Thailand Monday released a revised
forecast that put economic growth for the year at 5.9 percent, the
lowest since 1986.
</P>
<P>
The export growth forecast was also lowered to 7.2 percent from
7.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
It was the second downward revision in five months, and the
bank's governor Rerngchai Marakanond acknowledged the economy had
slowed more than planners had expected.
</P>
<P>
Last December, the bank forecast economic growth for 1997 of
7.1 percent. It lowered the figure in March to 6.8 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 27 (Xinhua) -- New motorcycle factories and
breweries can be build without restriction in Thailand, according
to Thai Government House spokesman Varathep Rattanakorn.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has revoked the ban on expanding or
building factories making motorcycles with engine capacities below
150cc.
</P>
<P>
While, the 70 percent content requirement for motorcycle
assembly has been waived, allowing all plants to choose local-made
or imported content, or both.
</P>
<P>
The move would spur competition and free trade, and it would
attract foreign investors and force manufacturers to improve
quality and keep down prices, Varathep was quoted today by local
press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Turning to breweries, Varathep said more breweries would create
jobs and provide more tax revenue, he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Thailand has eight breweries with a combined annual
production capacity of 2.519 million liters. Imported beer last
year totaled a record of 1.7 million liters.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Price reforms in China's medicare
system may help control rising medicare costs in the Chinese
capital, according to a report in the People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
The reforms are intended to hold the increase of medicare costs
to below 25 percent, and especially to keep hospitals' profits
from prescription drug sales to below 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Medicare costs in the city have been rising rapidly in recent
years. It spent a total of five billion yuan on all forms of
medical care in 1995, and 6.6 billion (795 million US dollars) in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Expenditures will reach 8.7 billion yuan this year if they
continue to grow at the same rate.
</P>
<P>
Controlling medicare costs and drug prices is difficult under
the present system, with most drugs being bought from hospitals.
</P>
<P>
A trial reform was started at three hospitals last October, and
focused on benefitting patients and providing better service.
</P>
<P>
At Tongren Hospital, one of the three, medicare costs during
the trial period from October of 1996 to this April totaled 128
million yuan, a drop of 22 million yuan from the growth in the
same period of the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Invite More Foreign Firms for Mining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Arrangements are being made to
invite more foreign companies for the third time for exploration
of new mineral deposits in Myanmar, Minister for Mines Kyaw Min
was quoted by today's New Light of Myanmar as saying.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Myanmar Foreign Investment Commission here
on Monday, the minister disclosed that 14 blocks were granted to
six foreign companies in 1994 for the first time and nine others
to five companies in 1995 for the second time for exploration of
gold, copper, lead, zinc and nickel in prospective areas in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Of the first 14 blocks, those in Banmauk, Thabeikkyin areas
were most promising and could become major mines with five other
areas such as Letpadaung, Kwinthonze, Popa, Banmauk and Pinlebu
showing encouraging signs, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the results of the second nine blocks were unknown yet
</P>
<P>
since they are being under survey, he added.
</P>
<P>
In addition to cooperating with foreign companies for
exploration of new mineral deposits, Myanmar also expanded the
existing and already established mines of its state-owned
enterprises in production of copper, gold, lead, zinc, silver,
iron ore, steel and coal with foreign companies which include
those from Canada, the United States and Australia respectively
undertaking copper, gold and other mining in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official statistics, foreign investment
in Myanmar's mining sector amounted to 498 million U.S. dollars in
42 permitted projects at the end of March this year.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's gross domestic product of mines increased 6.5 percent
in the 1996-97 fiscal year over the previous year's.
</P>
<P>
The sector enjoyed an average annual production growth of 10.5
percent during the previous four-year short-term national economic
plan (1992-93 to 1995-96).

<HEADLINE> Yellow River Water Resources Should Be Used Wisely: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese central government
departments are urged to improve water resource controls in the
Yellow River valley to ease the strain during dry seasons.
</P>
<P>
According to some experts, the river's lower reaches became dry
19 times from 1972 to 1996, with the waterless period lasting an
average of 36 days each time. Estimates are that the river will
run dry every year for the next century, or at least eight to nine
times in a decade, if no steps are taken, they say.
</P>
<P>
The increasingly serious seasonal dry runs in certain sections
of the nation's "Mother of Rivers" have had bad effects on
economic and social development in nearby areas, and on the
ecology by affecting groundwater supplies, and decreasing the
bio-diversity and health of the land. Some of these are
disastrous, experts say.
</P>
<P>
They suggest that a strict water distribution program be
developed in the river valley as soon as possible, and that no new
diversion works be approved, and that those now in effect be
strictly controlled.
</P>
<P>
They say that growing demand for water in the river valley
should be reduced, and that water conservation be encouraged. They
propose that water use fees be adjusted, irrigation techniques and
equipment be improved, water-consuming industries be controlled,
and the recycle rate of water for industrial use be increased.
</P>
<P>
In addition, experts have called for the central government to
set up a mechanism as quickly as possible and developed areas in
the river's lower reaches compensate those at the river's source
to improve the region's ability to protect its ecosystem.

The new constitution, passed by the Polish parliament on April
2 and approved by President Alexander Kwasniewski, is the first
since the tremendous changes which swept the country in 1989 and
will take effect in just over three months.

The constitution broadly retains the current political
system while weakening the presidency. It sets caps on the
government's spending but obliges it to support employment and
home building.

It has been strongly attacked by Solidarity Electoral Action
(AWS), an alliance of small parties grouped around the Solidarity
trade union. It sees Poland's history as bound up with the
majority Roman Catholic faith and wants the charter to clearly
invoke God, put religious values above man-made law and include a
clause effectively banning abortion, now legal.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Relief in Chinese Ethnic Minority Region Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region in southwest China has brought the number of the poor in
the region down from 15 million in 1985 to 4.8 million at the end
of last year, and increased per-capita income of farmers in 49
poor counties to 1,208 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The central government provided more than five billion yuan in
poverty relief to the province in the past decade. governments at
different levels provided 1.5 billion yuan during the Eighth
Five-Year Plan (1991-1995) period, while other poverty relief
funds came from other parts of society.
</P>
<P>
The financial support has helped poor farmers build 15,000 km
of road in mountainous areas and more than 9,000 drinking water
projects. Farmers covered two-thirds of the total cost by
providing labor and materials.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi has changed its former relief-centered practice of
aiding the needy to one of development-oriented projects focusing
on providing adequate food and clothing through planting,
livestock, and processing.
</P>
<P>
Financial assistance for prefectures or counties has also
changed to one of direct support for the poor. Specific villages
or families are singled out, and every possible effort is made to
help them escape poverty.
</P>
<P>
The regional government's efforts to encourage the whole of
society to assist the poor have paid off. People donated nearly 70
million yuan for the relief work in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (107-108) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (107-108) in a
question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: Why was a provisional legislative council
established? What is its function?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Sabotage by the British side has derailed the "through
train" arrangement and, as a result, it is impossible to establish
the first legislative council on July 1, 1997 or soon after the
date, leaving a temporary legislative vacuum.
</P>
<P>
But, after the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR, many affairs
need handling and participation by a legislative body. New laws,
in particular, need to be enacted to govern the transfer of
government. These required a body to act on behalf of a
legislative council prior to its establishment. No other options
were appropriate.
</P>
<P>
If the NPC were to act by proxy, it would mean the enactment of
laws for Hong Kong by the central authorities on behalf of Hong
Kong's local legislature, a move that goes against the policies of
"Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and "a high-degree of
autonomy."
</P>
<P>
If the Chief Executive were to act by proxy, it would run
counter to provisions of the Basic Law on a relationship of checks
and balances as well as cooperation between the executive and
legislative bodies.
</P>
<P>
The political affairs sub-group, therefore, proposed that a
provisional legislative council be selected by the Selection
Committee for the First Government of the Hong Kong SAR organized
by the Preparatory Committee, and that the provisional legislative
council handle busy legislative affairs in the period immediately
after the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR. This was a legal,
reasonable and practical option.
</P>
<P>
The main functions of the provisional legislative council
are: first, to enact laws and regulations that are urgent and
indispensable in the period immediately after the establishment of
the Hong Kong SAR; second, to amend some laws in urgent need of
amendment so that they remain applicable; and third, to terminate
laws that do not need to be preserved.
</P>
<P>
Facts will prove that the provisional legislative council will
play an important role in safeguarding the legal system and social
stability of Hong Kong and that it is necessary step taken by the
Chinese side in ensuring a smooth transfer of government in Hong
Kong 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Can a smooth transition be achieved and long-term
prosperity and stability maintained in Hong Kong?
</P>
<P>
Answer: The answer is yes.
</P>
<P>
First, the basic policies of the Chinese government concerning
the Hong Kong question are correct and conform with realities in
Hong Kong. They are conducive both to the long-term stability and
prosperity of Hong Kong and to socialist modernization in the
inland.
</P>
<P>
Second, the Chinese government has strong determination and
utmost sincerity in implementing the "one country, two systems"
policy and all provisions of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has first written its "one country, two
systems" commitment regarding Hong Kong in the Sino-British Joint
Declaration, thereby making it known to the whole world, and then
had related policies enshrined in the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Third, the Chinese government has always been genuinely
concerned about maintaining the stability and prosperity of Hong
Kong. It has provided support and cooperation for whatever benefit
Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
For example, when the Hong Kong stock market crashed in 1987,
the central government showed great concern and was ready to offer
help.
</P>
<P>
Apart from satisfying Hong Kong's increasing demand for water
supply and foodstuffs, out of concern for the interests of Hong
Kong compatriots, it has exerted great efforts in helping maintain
public security in Hong Kong, cracking down on crimes that involve
the inland and Hong Kong, and promoting inland-Hong Kong exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side has also worked hard in areas handled by the
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group and the Sino-British Land
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, all Chinese living in the inland and Hong Kong hope
that the "one country, two systems" policy will succeed and that
their motherland will become stronger and more prosperous.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the Chinese of both places have never been
closer than they are today. Mutual support and mutual assistance
have become the order of the day.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong people have given generous donations for the Hope
Project (aid for education in poor areas), disaster relief and
poverty relief in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
People in the inland will not forget the pouring of Hong Kong
relief materials and money to flooded east China in 1991 and
flooded south China in 1994.
</P>
<P>
This generosity proves that blood is thicker than water. It can
be predicated that, after the return of Hong Kong to the
motherland, relations between Hong Kong and the inland will
develop further and that Hong Kong, in the embrace of the great
motherland, will have greater economic prosperity amid political
stability. Hong Kong will have a more beautiful tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan Government, Rebel Forces to Sign Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Nicaraguan government and the
rebel North 3-80 Front have agreed to sign a peace agreement here
on Friday, the Defense Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
Government officials and representatives of the rebel group,
known as FN 3-80, met last Sunday in the northern department of
Matagalpa to examine the disarmament of the rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, which took place at the home of Defense
Minister Jaime Cuadra, the two sides agreed to sign the peace
document in the presence of Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman.
</P>
<P>
Expressing concerns about their own safety after signing the
agreement, the FN 3-80 representatives demanded the demobilization
of other armed groups in this Central American country.
</P>
<P>
The groups referred to by the FN 3-80 reportedly included the
Andres Castro United Front, the Ramon Raudales National Front and
the rebel force headed by a person nicknamed "El Lobo," or Wolf.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry said about 20 rebel commanders will be at
the signing ceremony on Friday, where each of them will present a
list of subordinates to be granted selective amnesty.
</P>
<P>
The exact number of FN 3-80 members who will be granted amnesty
is still unknown but is believed to be between 400 and 600.
</P>
<P>
It was also agreed that two new safe zones will be created in
the country's north and central parts: one in the municipality of
Waslala and the other at Santo Domingo in the department of
Chontales.

<HEADLINE> Women Judges Meet to Discuss Rights Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Forty women judges, from China
and other countries, are attending an international symposium in
Beijing on the theme of protecting women's rights, today's China
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The four-day event, which opened yesterday, has been organized
by the China Women Judges Association (CWJA). It is being held to
keep up the momentum started at the Fourth World Conference on
Women in Beijing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Matha C. Daughtrey, circuit judges with the United States court
of appeals for the 6th circuit, and Shao Wenhong, executive
council member of CWJA, gave speeches on the work of protecting
women's personal rights in both countries.
</P>
<P>
The event is a chance for women judges from across China and
abroad to discuss the judicial protection of women's rights, said
Ma Yuan, director of CWJA.
</P>
<P>
Ma said particular emphasis was being given to rights of the
individual, physical exploitation, rights of property and work,
and legal recourse for victims of domestic violence.

The CWJA and its branches have over the years handled many
cases involving protection of women's rights.

<HEADLINE> Cuba to Produce Less Sugar This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Cuba's sugar output this year is
expected to fall below last year's total of 4.45 million tons due
to the damage caused by Hurricane Lily last October.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the hurricane damage in the central provinces,
officials in the Sugar Ministry said today, late arrival of
financial resources and current rains were also to blame.
</P>
<P>
The financing problem delayed the start of the season for
planting sugarcane, a major crop of the Caribbean island nation.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the output of sugar, Cuba's main hard currency
earner, will be at least 200,000 tons less this year, a setback
first acknowledged by President Fidel Castro to the press on May 1.
</P>
<P>
Between May 1-20 this year, the production of sugar reached
200,000 tons, officials said, but the harvesting of sugarcane is
being carried out only in the provinces of Tunas and Holguin.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Australian newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
All major newspapers carry front-page reports that Prime
Minister John Howard expressed deep personal sorrow Monday over
the stolen generation of aborigines but did not apologize on
behalf of the nation. According to an official inquiry report,
about 100,000 aboriginal children were removed from their families
during 1910-1970 under Australia's infamous assimilation policy.
</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- If Australia cut its tariffs on motor vehicles below 15
percent, the major Japanese investors in the Australian automobile
industry would withdraw from Australia, a leading Japanese
industrialist said Monday. A proposal has been made to cut car
tariffs to 5 percent after 2004 by a government committee.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- Almost two-thirds of Australians believe all Australian
parliaments should officially acknowledge the nation's
responsibility for previous laws and policies which lead to the
forcible removal of aboriginal children from their parents, a poll
has found.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- Treasure Peter Costello Monday warned the four big banks to
deliver Friday's interest rate cut in full to borrowers or face
the prospect of having their market share slashed. The banks have
made a decision to reduce rates by 0.35 percent instead of the 0.5
percent cut in official rates.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- A leading mining industry figure attacked a key speech on
aboriginal reconciliation given Monday by Prime Minister
describing it as "totally inappropriate," disappointing aboriginal
leaders, international observers by offering a personal but not a
national apology to the aboriginal "stolen generation".

<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio
Guterres met with visiting Chinese leader Li Ruihuan here today.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), spoke highly of the
steadily growing friendship and cooperation between China and
Portugal, saying that China attaches importance to and is
satisfied with the Sino-Portuguese relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government appreciates the positive attitude of the
Portuguese government in pushing the European Union to improve and
expand its relations with China, Li said, adding that the Chinese
government appreciates the Portuguese government's adherence to
the "One China" stand on the issue of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Li also briefed the Portuguese prime minister on China's
political and economic situation. He said there is more room for
the further growth of the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese people will unswervingly adhere to Deng
Xiaping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
charateristics. Deng died in February this year.
</P>
<P>
Guterres expressed welcome to Li, saying that it is a priority
of Portugal's foreign relations to expand ties with China. "We
will continue to follow the constructive policy toward China."
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes bilateral relations will grow not only in the
political field, but also in the economic domain.
</P>
<P>
He said he has no doubt about the continuation of China's
reform and opening up, a cause initiated by Deng Xiaoping.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Since the Chinese Communist Party
(CPC) and the Communist Party of Cuba are ruling parties, the
exchanges between the discipline inspection departments of each
party in anti-corruption, building clean and honest governments
will benefit the development of the two parties as well as the
opening-up drive of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Hu Jintao, member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee,
during his meeting with a discipline inspection delegation of the
Cuban Communist Party headed by Jorge Cuevas Ramos, member of the
Central Committee of Cuban Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Hu, also member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee, expressed his satisfaction with the long-term friendly
ties between the two parties and the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Hu lauded the achievements Cuban people have scored under
the leadership of the Cuban Communist Party Central Committee
headed by Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>

countries has deepened in recent years, as proved by the exchanges
of the visits between the officials of the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Central Committee Formed to Promote Ethical, Cultural Progress (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Party committees and governments at all levels have improved
their work on ethical and cultural progress following the Sixth
Plenary Session of the 14th Party Central Committee, Jiang noted,
saying that they have furthered education efforts on patriotism,
collectism and socialism, and praised a large number of those who
serve as models in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"To sum up, with correct publicity and press guidance, a sound
social atmosphere has been encouraged and a favorable situation
has emerged in which party and governmental leaders have
strengthened leadership, all sectors participate in ethical and
cultural construction and all people are actively joining the
work," Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang emphasized that Deng Xiaoping's theory on building
socialism with Chinese characteristics is the basis of China's
ethical and cultural construction. He urged cadres to learn from
and better understand Deng's thoughts and words on the subject.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that the strategic significance of ethical and
cultural construction need to be emphasized from time to time.
</P>
<P>
"Socialist society should be one with all-round development and
progress. History has proved that a nation should not be poor in
material goods nor in ethics and culture. Only when a nation is
rich in both material goods and ethics and culture can it be
ensured with vitality and cohesive forces," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that ethical and cultural progress is of
tremendous importance for the future of the Party and the country,
and has a great bearing on the status of the Chinese nation in the
world.

LONDON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain's new Labor government
announced today that it would rejoin the United Nations
Educational Scientific Organization (UNESCO) on July 1 after a
12-year break.
</P>
<P>
Clare Short, Britain's Secretary of State for International
Development, was quoted as saying in a statement: "My government
has decided to rejoin UNESCO and my aim is that this should take
effect from July 1 this year."
</P>
<P>
"The object is to maximize UNESCO's effectiveness and impact,
particularly in poorest countries and for the poorest people. That
is an important goal for us in all our development endeavors,"
she said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain, two major contributors to
UNESCO, left the international organization in 1985, complaining
of wasted resources and excessive politicization of the
institution.
</P>
<P>
British diplomatic sources reportedly said that radical reforms
had since been made in the running of UNESCO, and the organization
was now carrying out important work in which Britain wanted to be
involved.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Cut General Spendings in Fiscal 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Japan is to cut its general spendings
in the national budget in fiscal 1998 for the first time in 11
years in a bid to help restoring deficit-ridden state finances,
Kyodo News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Spendings for the year which begins in April 1998 will total
some 43.5 trillion yen (378.3 billion dollars), down 0.5 percent
from the initial spending for fiscal 1997, the Japanese news
agency quoted sources at the Ministry of Finance as saying.
</P>
<P>
The spending cut reflects a austere policy in line with a
proposal unveiled today by a governmental panel.
</P>
<P>
An interim report compiled by the Conference on Fiscal
Structural Reform proposed drastic cuts for public works, revision
of farm support subsidies and reduction of social welfare and
defense spending.
</P>
<P>
Spending on public works will be reduced by seven to 10 percent
from the 9.84 trillion yen (85.6 billion dollars) of fiscal 1997,
while defense spending and official development assistance will be
lower than the year-earlier level of 4.94 trillion yen (43 billion
dollars) and 1.16 trillion yen (10.1 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, social security outlays will grow 2.1 percent from
the previous year's 14.55 trillion yen (126.5 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
To cover a likely shortfall in revenues, the government
considered to issue 7.47 trillion yen (65 billion dollars) in
deficit-financing bonds next year, the same as in the fiscal 1997,
according to the sources.

BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China is willing to develop a
long-term stable state-to-state relationship of comprehensive
cooperation with Niger, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said here

The friendly cooperative link between the two countries is
entering a new period, and is currently enjoying a good

flowers and the freshness of the season.

Paying a visit to China at this time of the year symbolizes
that the bilateral relationship is witnessing a new spring, Jiang
said, adding that he believes Mainassara's visit is sure to
further enhance the friendly cooperation in various sectors
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"China and Niger have re-established sincere and friendly
relations of cooperation in politics, economy, trade, public
health, culture and education, which fully demonstrates that the
two countries cherish the promotion of bilateral friendly
relations of cooperation," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Restoring and developing the bilateral relations are the common
aspiration of the two peoples, he added.

"The current China-Niger relations are experiencing a positive
development trend and the bilateral friendly ties of cooperation
are entering a new period, with which we feel satisfied," he said.

The Chinese president said that China and Niger, as developing
nations, share a wide range of common interests and a similar
stance on many major international issues. The two countries also
have very good cooperative relations in some international arenas,
including the United Nations, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people treasure their friendship
with Niger, and are willing to further deepen consultation and
cooperate even more closely on international issues in a bid to
safeguard the rights of the developing nations and to set up a
fair international new order, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China is willing to develop with Niger a
state-to-state relationship of all-round cooperation in a
long-term and stable way and in line with the Five Principles of
Peaceful Co-existence.

Jiang explained that the sound political relationship between
the two nations provides a strong guarantee for the bilateral
economic and trade cooperation, while the normalization of

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China established a national legal
aid foundation and a legal aid center today to provide help for
the poor and disabled.
</P>
<P>
Wang Guangying, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, spoke at today's meeting celebrating
the founding of China's Legal Aid Foundation and the Legal Aid
Center under the Ministry of Justice, saying that the legal aid
system enables every Chinese citizen to enjoy his or her equal
rights as established by law.
</P>
<P>
He called on the people's congresses and governments at various
levels to pay close attention to the work by providing necessary
funding and improving the legal aid system.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Xiao Yang said the founding of China's Legal
Aid Foundation and the Legal Aid Center under the ministry
indicates that China has taken a substantial step in creating and
using such a system.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the Chinese government introduced the concept of a
legal aid system, and in 1996 enacted the Law of Criminal
Procedures and the Law of Lawyers, and started to prepare for the
founding of the Legal Aid Center under the Ministry of Justice and
China's Legal Aid Foundation.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, some 17 provinces, autonomous
regions, municipalities, and 50-plus large and medium-sized cities
throughout the country have set up or are working to form their
own legal aid centers.
</P>
<P>
The ministry says that over the past three years, the scope of
legal aid in China has been expanded from involving criminal
procedures alone to civil procedures. The list of those eligible
for legal aid has been expanded to include the elderly, the
disabled, women and children, and the legal aid provided has been
standardized gradually.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, legal aid centers in Guangzhou,
Shanghai, Wuhan, Qingdao and Zhengzhou have handled 7,600 free
legal consultative cases of various kinds since 1995, and dealt
with nearly 1,400 criminal and civil cases.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, some 34 governmental institutions, and
enterprises and more than 100 individuals donated a total of 10.5
million yuan to China's Legal Aid Foundation.

ISLAMABAD, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Islamic militia
Taliban have started imposing strict Islamic law in newly-captured
provinces of northern Afghanistan, closing all educational

</P>
<P>
The Islamic militia, who expelled northern warlord Rashid

<HEADLINE> US Not to Impose Peace on Israelis, Palestinians: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. official said
today that his country would not impose a solution to the current
crisis between Israelis and the Palestinians, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Haifa University in northern Israel, U.S.
Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk said that it was important for
the U.S. to remind the parties involved in the peace process that
"we are not the one to fix the problem."
</P>
<P>
Indyk said that he did not believe that a peace imposed by
the U.S. on Israel and the Palestinians would be a lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador stressed that it was up to Israel and the
Palestinians to recognize that they have no better alternative
than to make peace with each other.
</P>
<P>
In order to make peace with each other, Indyk said Israel and
the Palestinians must restore the partnership between
themselves, and most importantly, to rebuild trust.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have been
stalled since March when Israel started to build a controversial
Jewish neighborhood at Har Homa on the southeastern outskirts of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians have said that Israel must stop the construction
before talks can be resumed, while Israel insisted that the
Palestinian National Authority must crack down on terrorism and
reestablish full security cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Official: Turkish Citizens Start to Evacuate from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- About 44 staff members of the
Turkish General Consulate, who evacuated from Mazar-e-Sharif in
war-ridden northern Afghanistan to Uzbekistan, will arrive in
Turkey Tuesday, a Turkish official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Another five Turks will stay in northern Afghanistan with their
own will, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer Akbel at a press
conference. He added that all the Turkish citizens are in good
health.
</P>
<P>
Akbel said Turkey has no representative in Kabul, the capital of
Afghanistan and has no official contacts with the Afghan Islamic
militia Taliban.
</P>
<P>
When asked how long Afghan northern Warlord Rashid Dostum will
stay in Turkey, Akbel said that the period of his stay all depends
on Dostum himself.
</P>
<P>
Dostum together with his family and a group of his friends
arrived here early Sunday morning after his headquarters,
Mazar-e-Sharif fell to the Taliban Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Dostum said at a press conference here Sunday that he would
stay in Turkey until his injured arm recovers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a group of about 100 Afghan migrants today paid
a visit to Dostum in Stad Hotel where Dostum stays.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Warns Africa of Expected Urban Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Economic Commission
for Africa (ECA) today warned Africa of the expected urban
explosion, saying there is urgent need for the continent to form
and carry out urban policies.
</P>
<P>
Africa's growth rate of urban population hit 4.4 percent per
annum between 1990 and 1996, said Paulina Makinwa-Adebusoye,
Chief of ECA Food Security and Sustainable Development Division,
on behalf of ECA Executive Secretary K.Y. Amoako.
</P>
<P>
The figure surpasses Africa's annual population growth rate of
2.8 percent, she added, when opening a five-day ad hoc expert
group meeting on measures for urban environmental health problems
in Africa here today.
</P>
<P>
Although African urbanization level is relatively low with
only 35 percent of people living in urban areas by 1996, the
urban population there will rise by nearly two and half times
from 201 million in 1990 to 468 million in 2010, she predicted.
</P>
<P>
"It is expected that by 2025, half of the population of Africa
will be living in urban centers," she said.
</P>
<P>
"This rapid expansion of cities particularly the national
capitals, has created a number of problems" including the
shortages of housing stock, infrastructural and social services,
she added.
</P>
<P>
The bottlenecks such as transportation, water supply, health
and educational facilities "have been spread beyond tolerable
limits and have become inadequate to meet growing demand," she
warned.
</P>
<P>
She stressed the urban policies in Africa should pertain to
environment and public health,
</P>
<P>
She urged the meeting to discuss how to improve the economic
base of cities, the urban health facilities, infrastructural and
social services, information systems, community participation by
local groups including women's groups and so on.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also review the environmental health problems
of African cities and make recommendations on strategies for
maintenance and creation of a healthy and sustainable urban
environment on the continent.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Criticizes Demirel's Statements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
today lashed out at the statements by his Turkish counterpart
Suleyman Demirel that his country will continue to occupy 37
percent of the Cyprus island to ensure the security of Turkish
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read out today by government spokesman Manolis
Christofides, in response to references on Cyprus made by Demirel
in a recent interview with a private Greek TV channel, Clerides
stressed that Turkey occupies part of the island "for her own
interests."
</P>
<P>
Turkey sent troops and took control of the northern third of
the island in 1974 following a Greek Cypriot coup seeking union
with Greece. Around 30,000 Turkish troops have remained on the
island since then.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the issue of Cyprus' accession to the European
Union (EU), the president also dismissed the Turkish president's
position that according to the Treaties (of Guarantee and
Establishment) through which the Republic of Cyprus was
established in 1960, Cyprus cannot join the EU.
</P>
<P>
"This stems from a wrong and arbitrary interpretation of these
agreements," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for the EU full membership in 1990, and the EU
decided on March 6, 1995, to start accession talks with Cyprus
six months after the end of the Intergovernmental Conference
(early 1998).
</P>
<P>
The spokesman criticized the Turkish president for making
these statements only days before direct negotiations for a
solution to the protracted Cyprus problem begin.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash, initiated by the U.N., are expected to take place in
New York in early July.

<HEADLINE> US Prisons Jammed with Growing AIDS Inmates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 26 (Xinhua) -- As sentencing law have put more
drug users behind bars, many states in the United States are now
dealing with large numbers of prisoners who have AIDS or are
infected with H.I.V, the virus that causes AIDS, the New York
Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
AIDS now infects the nation's prisoners at nearly six times the
rate of the rest of the population. The Federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention also reported that 1994 figures,
the latest available, showed that 5.2 AIDS cases for each 1,000
inmates, as compared with 0.9 cases for each 1,000 adults outside
prison. With hundreds of thousands of drug addicts locked up in
the last decade, prisons have become a repository of infectious
disease, the report said, adding that health care experts view
prisons as a prime place to attack the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
The impact of the disease have been most felt in New York
City's Rikers Island jails, where 26 percent of the women and 12
percent of the men are H.I.V-positive, with about 3,000 inmates at
any time requiring AIDS services, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The New York State prison system, which is reported to be the
highest rate of infection of any system, last year housed an
estimated 9,500 H.I.V.-positive inmates, or about 1 percent of all
AIDS-infected Americans.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the growing number of infected inmates to
prison population growth which has become "explosive". Uneven
medical care and short supply new treatment are also attributable
to the growing numbers of infected inmates in prisons throughout
the country.

<HEADLINE> OAU Deplores Sierra Leone Coup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim, Secretary
General of the Organization of African Unity, has expressed
serious concern about the coup toppling the civil government and
president in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"It is lamentable that some soldiers should decide to
challenge the legitimate position of the people," Salim said here
when marking the African Liberation Day which fell on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This development "is a loss for Africa" and will not be
welcome on the continent, he was quoted by the Zimbabwean News
Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The coup has come at a time when international organizations
such as the OAU, the United Nations were in the forefront of
trying to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in Sierra
Leone, he said.
</P>
<P>
Salim's views were echoed by Zimbabwe's Foreign Minister Stan
Mudenge who said the coup "is a serious setback for the people of
Sierra Leone and the entire continent."
</P>
<P>
"The government of Zimbabwe condemns in the strongest terms
the perpetrators of this betrayal of the will of the people of
Sierra Leone," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the international community to "urgently render
all the necessary support to help the people of Sierra Leone
regain their inalienable right to democracy and the rule of the
law."
</P>
<P>
Reports from Sierra Leone said the coup leader, Jolly Paul
Koroma, addressed the nation today and claimed himself as the
country's new president.

<HEADLINE> British Steel Demands Suppliers to Cut Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- British Steel (BS) is demanding its
1500 suppliers of goods and services to make sharp and sustained
price cuts to help boost its profitability and competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Managers at the privatized company are meeting suppliers after
a series of letters that are believed to have demanded price cut
of more than 10%, according to the British media report today.
</P>
<P>
Brian Moffat, chairman of BS, said: "We have decided that this
time, as well as going for efficiency ourselves, we will put the
squeeze on the guys who supply us."
</P>
<P>
"We are asking them what they are going to do to help us stay
competitive and justify being with us in the long term," he added.
</P>
<P>
Suppliers are desperately trying to resist the price squeeze
but BS is sticking to its demands, blaming tough world prices and
the strength of sterling.
</P>
<P>
The company said that it was trying to work with suppliers on
potential price reduction. It is thought to be trying to encourage
cuts of about 12.5% in order to meet its own targets for plants.
</P>
<P>
BS believes the cost-cutting measures will trigger a shake-out
of suppliers as some firms in return for higher volumes on a
longer-term basis.
</P>
<P>
The intensive effort is part of BS's three-pronged strategy,
including job cuts at its plants and rapid expansion of
information-technology net-works, to cut the cost base and shore
up crumbling profits.
</P>
<P>
Analysts estimate that the exchange-rate changes will wipe
about 550 million pounds (880 million US dollars) off pre-tax
profits in the current year, reducing them to about 140 million
pounds (224 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 jobs are being cut from BS after the five-year
cost-cutting program was recently escalated to combat the damage
of the strong pound.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Holds Consultations Before Summit With Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu held consultations with senior ministers today to
prepare for Tuesday's summit with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak aimed at breaking ice in the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu held meetings at his office this afternoon with
Foreign Minister David Levy and Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai to discuss the ways of breaking the Israeli-Palestinian
deadlock caused by Israel's construction of the Har Homa
settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Before departing for the Egyptian resort city of Sharm
el-Sheikh Tuesday morning, Netanyahu is also to meet President
Ezer Weizman for further consultations. Netanyahu will be
accompanied by Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh and his senior
advisers Dore Gold and Uzi Arad.
</P>
<P>
This afternoon, Netanyahu dispatched an advance team to Sharm
el-Sheikh to make technical arrangements for the summit. Netanyahu
and Mubarak are expected to hold the summit at 11 a.m. followed by
a joint press conference.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Mubarak also held another round of consultations
with Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat
in Cairo today in preparation for the Tuesday summit. Earlier on
Saturday, Mubarak met with Jordanian King Hussein in Jordanian
city Aqaba to coordinate their positions before the summit.
</P>
<P>
Despite the importance of the summit, both Israeli and
Palestinian officials have played down the possibility of
achieving dramatic breakthrough in reviving the stalled
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Top at the agenda of the Netanyahu-Mubarak meeting is the Har
Homa project, to which the Egyptians have reportedly proposed a
temporary halt as a confidence-building measure. But Israel has
rejected any compromise on the issue, saying the construction
would continue whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's spokesman Marwan Kanafani reasserted today that as
long as Israel continued its settlement activities, the peace
process would not move forward.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu's media adviser David Bar-Illan said that
while expecting no dramatic breakthrough from the
Netanyahu-Mubarak summit, he hoped it would make some progress
"in bridging the gap between the Palestinian National Authority
and Israeli government."
</P>
<P>
Several Israeli ministers reiterated that Netanyahu should not
make any concession on the Har Homa issue. Hardline National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon said that, instead of making
compromise on the Har Homa issue, Netanyahu should demand the PNA
fight terrorism and honor its commitments to the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani also rejected the
idea of halting the Har Homa project, though he expressed
hope that the Netanyahu-Mubarak summit would achieve progress in
breaking the ice and reviving the Israeli-Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
Some Israeli analysts have expressed the fear about a renewed
flare-up of Palestinian violence if the summit fails to produce
any results. For this reason, Netanyahu is expected to offer some
concessions on issues beyond the Har Homa project, such as opening
safe passages between West Bank and Gaza Strip, the Gaza airport
and Gaza seaport.
</P>
<P>
Israeli opposition leader Shimon Peres said in the Knesset
(Parliament) today he hoped the Sharm el-Sheikh summit would find
a formula to restart the peace process. But he warned about the
failure of the meeting, if both sides refused to change their
respective tough positions.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his advise on how to achieve success at the
Netanyahu-Mubarak summit, Peres replied: "Wisdom and Compromise."

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Croats Deny Charges of Secession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Croat leaders deny that the
establishment of the Croat Community of Herceg-Bosna (HZHB) is a
step on the way of secession, the Sarajevan daily Oslobodjenje
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kresimir Zubak, the Croat member of the Bosnian Presidency and
one of the Croat officials interviewed by Oslobodjenje, said that
HZHB intends to represent all aspects of Croat interests based on
the principles of reciprocity and solidarity with full regard to
the Bosnian and federation constitutions.
</P>
<P>
President of the Bosnian Federation Vladimir Soljic said that
the community does not have any elements of a state institution,
while Bozo Rajic, head of the Croat Democratic Union, said that
HZHB was intended to be an advisory body that will channel Croat
potentials in Bosnia into various political streams, governmental
bodies and other institutions.
</P>
<P>
HZHB was formally launched on Saturday, after the so-called
"Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna" had to be abolished as required
by the agreements with Bosnian Muslims.
</P>
<P>
But the move has apparently worried their Muslim partners, who
have accused HZHB of representing "secession tendency" and argued
that it was just a Croat community.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Chief Supports Forming Permanent Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Commander of the West African
Peace-Keeping Force (ECOMOG) in Liberia, Major-General Victor
Malu, said today he personally supported the idea of transforming
ECOMOG as a permanent sub-regional peace-keeping force.
</P>
<P>
At a press forum on ECOMOG operations in Liberia held here, he
described it as "quite a good idea."
</P>
<P>
"I personally support that aspect of retaining ECOMOG as a
regional force that can be used to intervene in problems like the
one in Sierra Leone," he said.
</P>
<P>
"ECOMOG's experiment in Liberia is one of the best things that
happened within Africa in recent times and has set a good example
for other sub-regions in Africa to do the same," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian head of state and chairman of the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS) General Sani Abacha has proposed
recently that ECOMOG be transformed into the nucleus of a
sub-regional permanent peace-keeping force after accomplishing
its mission in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Mulu said that other sub-regional organizations in Africa have
tried to consult with ECOMOG on how it is organized and how it is
running.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the U.S. proposal of an African crisis response
force, he said that "the suggestion is good but it came through a
wrong source."

during World War II, also known as "Nazi Gold."
</P>
<P>
Britain agreed to host the conference during a visit by British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook in Washington last week.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette and the U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright have also agreed that the
tripartite committee in charge of returning Jewish properties
detained by the central banks of occupied Europe should
"accelerate its work."
</P>
<P>
The tripartite committee was set up in 1946 and comprises the
United States, France and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The United States proposed the holding of the conference in a
200-page report published recently accusing Switzerland of helping
Nazi Germany prolong its war efforts.
</P>
<P>
The report also suggested that the United States, Britain and
France pay to the survivors of the Holocaust "an important part"
of some 70 million U.S. dollars deposited by the Jews in European
banks before the war.

<HEADLINE> Black Economy Costs Britain A Lot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain's black economy has grown
rapidly since the mid-1980s and now cost the Treasury 20 billion
pounds (32 billion US dollars) a year, according to a report for
the European Commission released here.
</P>
<P>
The study, by Deloitte &AMP; Touche, the accountants, calculates
that the black economy last year was worth about 80 billion pounds
(128 billion US dollars), the equivalent of 12 percent of gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
It estimates that the cost to the exchequer, in lost value
added tax receipts and other taxes, could be the equivalent of
nearly one third of last year's income tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
The report is part of a five-country study into the size and
budgetary costs of the European shadow economy launched last
november by the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
Previous studies have put the size of the black economy at
about 6-8 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
But Dilip Bhattacharyya, an economist at Leicester University
who co-authored the report, said that unmeasured economic activity
has risen sharply in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"In 1984 the shadow economy was running at around 8 percent
of GDP," he said in the report. "But there seems to have been a
sharp change in behaviour around the time of the 1987 stock
market crash."

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia today formally
recognized the Taliban authority in Afghanistan, official Saudi
Press Agency reports said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came during a cabinet meeting that was
chaired by Saudi King Fahd Bin Abdul Aziz, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is the second country that recognized the Taliban
government in the war-torn Asian state, following Pakistan which
announced its recognition of the Taliban authority Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A statement carried by the agency said the Saudi government
looked forward to continuing "the good relationship between the
two countries," noting that the decision was made following the
latest developments in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Militia Taliban seized Mazar-E-Sharif on Saturday,
the headquarters of Afghan Northern warlord Rashid Dostum, who
fled to Turkey Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban authority appealed for world recognition after its
sweeping victories over the former government troops.
</P>
<P>
Taliban and its allied forces of general Abdul Malik Pehlwan
have taken over Kunduz and Samargan provinces without much
resistance and the forces of former President Burhanuddin Rabbani
and commander Ahmed Shah Masood are now confined to Baghlan
province which could fall at any time, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Diarrhoea Breaks Out Again in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mogadishu, May 26 (Xinhua)-- There are reports of renewed
outbreak of severe diarrhoea in the central and southern regions
of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 people have died for the disease in the last
three months. The disease which broke out in Galgudud region of
central Somalia has spread to the districts and villages of
Dhusamareb,Guri-El,Ja'ar, Dirri and Awsweyne and Bargan.
</P>
<P>
The latest victims include three children who died in
Dhusamareb town, about 500 Km North of the capital yesterdy. 11
more people have also died in Guri-El district in the last 20
days.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of Guri-El town told the journalists that fever
accompanied by intermittent cough hits the victim who
subsequently starts having diarrhoea. The chairman, Mr Ahmed
Moallim Hussein, said the disease has also victimized more than
hundred people who are mainly children and elderly.
</P>
<P>
In the same region, 10 people have died for the disease in
Bargan village where more than 30 others are also being treated
in the nearby districts of Galhareri and El-Bur. Chief elders in
the area said the lack of health centers and adequate treatments
have worsened the spread of the disease to the other villages of
Dirri, Ja'ar and Awswevne.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the southern Lower Shabelle region is also ringing
the alarm against cholera. Doctors in Merca town, the capital of
the region 100 km South of Mogadishu, have confirmed the
existence of cholera and confirmed the death of nearly 50 people
throughout the region. Dr Omar Osman Ahmed, a pediatrician in the
general hospital of the town said they recorded 720 cases since
February this year. Nearly half of this number have been the
inhabitants of Merca town itself.
</P>
<P>
According to Dr Ahmed, the change of the weather and the
on-going rainy season which caused heavy floods have now resulted
the easy revival and the smooth going of the endemic disease.
Outside Merca town, the doctor said victims of the disease are
mainly those displaced by the recent floods that swept away their
farms and houses. The doctor said the heat, moisture and the poor
sanitation are all supporting the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The doctor has also announced an increasing severe
malnourishment saying that they received 90 malnourished patients
within this month. Dr Ahmed disclosed that 30 of these patients
have died for malnourishment related diseases including the
cholera. The doctor blamed the relatives of these patients for
not bringing them to the treatment centers at the appropriate
time.

<HEADLINE> Chirac to Speak to French People on Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- President Jacques Chirac will make a
radio-television speech to the French people Tuesday evening in an
effort to prevent the leftwing opposition from winning a
parliamentary majority in the second round of the legislative
elections to be held next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Elysee presidential palace made the announcement after
Prime Minister Alain Juppe said this afternoon that he would not
be prime minister on June 2 -- one day after the holding of the
second round of the legislative elections, even if the
center-right coalition wins the election.
</P>
<P>
In the center-right majority, many have called on President
Chirac to speak to the French people again to remind them of the
risk a cohabitation, or sharing of power with the opposition,
could bring to France.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Socialist Party and Communist Party won 33.73
percent of the votes in the first round of the general election,
against 29.93 won by the Rally for the Republic and Union for
French Democracy, according to a final account by the French
Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The leftwing oppositions are rallying with the Ecologist Party,
which won 7 percent in the first round, before the second round of
voting in an effort to form a leftwing majority in the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
After he dissolved the National Assembly on April 21, Chirac
made two interventions in the time between -- one on May 7 by
publishing an article in newspapers, another by making a brief
statement when he was meeting German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on May
20.

BEIRUT, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon confirmed today its two
citizens have been killed amid chaos in Sierra Leone, noting that
the Lebanese government is striving to ensure a safety for some
2,000 Lebanese in the Western African state.
</P>
<P>
"We have learned the death of Lebanese citizens Mr. Hassan
Jamil Said and Mr. Walid Roumih," Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz said at a press conference in his office, adding that
there are two other Lebanese citizens wounded amid the turmoil
prevailing in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said that his government has failed to establish a
direct contact with the Lebanese in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
However, "contacts are taking place with them through our
embassies in London and in capitals of the African countries near
Sierra Leone," the Lebanese foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
He announced that the Lebanese government is holding contacts
with Britain, France, Nigeria and Ghana to seek "either a safe
evacuation of the Lebanese or an asylum for them."
</P>
<P>
Over 6 million Lebanese are living overseas, much more than the
population of 3.1 million inside Lebanon, and the remittance from
abroad constitutes a major income for the Lebanese citizens.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the situations of the Lebanese in Sierra Leone,
Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a son of Lebanese nationals in
Sierra Leone, has canceled all his appointments, the state-run
Lebanese National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A turmoil has prevailed in the country since coup soldiers
ousted the civilian government in Sierra Leone Sunday and clashed
with Nigerian troops protecting President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah who

BONN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Germany has maintained its position as
the third largest shipbuilding nation of the world despite heated
competition on a growing global market, a German shipbuilding
group said today.
</P>
<P>
According to Heinz Ache, Chairman of the German Shipbuilding
and Marine Technology Association, German shipbuilders achieved
deliveries of 89 new merchants ships in 1996 with a total tonnage
of 1.1 million and turnover of 5.4 billion German marks (3.2
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
With a world market share of about seven percent, Germany
remained world's No.3 in shipbuilding, tracing Japan with a world
market share of 35.9 percent and South Korea with 21.5 percent, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The global shipbuilding industry had experienced continuing
growth in the past few years, Ache said. According to his
predictions, the global shipbuilding capacity would increase to 19
million tons in 1997 from 16.8 million in 1996. South Korea alone
is expected to create new capacity more than the existing one in
Germany.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The ministers of economy of 29
members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) today agreed that the reduction of public
deficit in their countries is a priority for creating conditions
for sustainable growth.
</P>
<P>
"Many countries of OECD still have their levels of budgetary
deficits or debt too high, while the aging of their population
risks to push the public spending higher," said OECD in a
communique issued following the first day of the ministerial
meeting.
</P>
<P>
It said that since the tax rates are already high in OECD
countries, "the principal effort" in the reduction of the
deficits should rest on cutting public spendings.
</P>
<P>
Experts attending the OECD meeting also predicted that the
unemployment rate in Europe will be reduced by half and drop to
around 5 percent in the next 20 years, while the average wealth of
Europeans will double from now to the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
"The high unemployment rate which began in the 1970s would
thus be reversed," said an OECD report published today.
</P>
<P>
The wealth of the industrialized countries of the world will
increase by around 80 percent from 1995 to 2020, while the average
economic growth rate of these countries will be around 3 percent
in that period of time, said the experts.

<HEADLINE> Kenya, Uganda Pledge to Ensure Border Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The governments of Kenya and
Uganda have pledged to curb gun trafficking and cattle rustling
along their borders within the framework of the East African
Cooperation (EAC), The Kenya News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The two governments said in a joint communique at weekend at
the end of their sixth bilateral peace meeting that they have
agreed on a number of peace initiatives.
</P>
<P>
The communique noted that the two sides are resolved to
intensify border patrols, re-open border police posts and
exchange intelligence to help forestall cattle rustling.
</P>
<P>
The two eastern African countries also agreed to work out a
system for implementing, monitoring and reporting security
matters.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting held in Moroto town, northeastern Uganda,
Mohammed Yusuf Haji, the leader of the Kenyan delegation, urged
the governments to hold regular peace meetings to ease tension in
the border areas.
</P>
<P>
Haji, who is also Rift Valley Provincial Commissioner,
suggested that boarding schools be opened on either side of the
border to improve interaction and end hostility.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the Ugandan government handed over six
Kenyan citizens to the Kenyan delegation.
</P>
<P>
The six were among a group of Kenyans who crossed over to
Uganda last year in search of grazing pasture after Kenya had
been ravaged by a prolonged drought.
</P>
<P>
Then, a member of the Dototh community in Uganda, mistaking
them for cattle rustlers, opened fire on them and killed 11
people.

<HEADLINE> Minister: Lebanon Worries Over Turkey's Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz expressed his country's worry over Turkey's military
operation in northern Iraq and warned Ankara not to dislodge its
domestic problems to the outside.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz recalled Ankara's military cooperation with Israel,
saying that the recent Turkish-Israeli military agreement, their
joint military manoeuvre and the movement of the Turkish army
outside the Turkish borders toward Iraq have repeatedly caused
Beirut's concerns.
</P>
<P>
"Of course we do not want to link these two cases," the
foreign minister told a press conference in his office, adding
that the Turkish operation is a reminiscence of an attempt in
Israel to make the internal problems explode outside the country.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz had attributed an escalation of tensions in south
Lebanon last week to an intention of Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu's wright-wing government to distract attentions
from governmental and political confrontations inside the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
"We really do not want to see another attempt in Turkey to
move the domestic problems to the outside. Anyway, we hope
Turkey's local and regional considerations to be separated from
its relations with Israel and its relations with other
countries," the Lebanese official underlined.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking with a deep worry to what is happening on the
Turkish-Iraqi border and we hope there is no link between these
events and other wider and more comprehensive schemes," the
foreign minister pointed out.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 Turkish troops, reportedly allied with the
Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP), have poured into northern Iraq in
pursuit of Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants who use
northern Iraq as a base to launch raids into southeast
Turkey.

market, confirming a thrust by the country's new rulers to
liberalize the economy.
</P>
<P>
Qatari Minister of Finance, Economy and Trade Sheikh Mohammed
bin Khalifa al Thani today inaugurated an authorized stock
exchange, named the Doha Securities Market which will start
trading officially from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During a telephone interview with Xinhua today, an official
from the ministry who preferred anonymity said only Qatari
nationals are allowed to trade initially, and at the second phase
-- expected at the end of the year, the bourse will open to
nationals of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar and
the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Three banks, known as Qatar National Bank, Doha Bank Ltd. and
the Commercial Bank of Qatar have been appointed official brokers
while 18 companies have been listed at the bourse with a market
capital of 1.9 billion U.S. dollars, he added.
</P>
<P>
Brokers here said that the legitimate market will replace
unofficial stock trading now conducted by unlicensed
stock-brokers via telephone.
</P>
<P>
The open of the stock market is a step to further boost Qatar's
economic liberalization drive, called for by Qatar's Emir Sheikh
Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani after a bloodless palace coup brought
him to power in the gas-rich country in 1995.

NICOSIA -- Greek exports to Cyprus reached 133.9 million Cyprus
pounds (267.8 million U.S. dollars) in 1996, up by 11.5 percent
compared with that of 1995.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed today by Chrissanthi Passadi, Greek trade
and economic representative to Cyprus, at a press conference at
the Cyprus International State Fair Greek pavilion.
</P>
<P>
She said that Greece ranked fourth among countries exporting
to Cyprus in 1996, following the United States, Britain and
Italy, adding that economic and trade relations between the two
countries are substantially increasing.
</P>
<P>
According to the Greek official, total transactions between
Greece and Cyprus in 1996 reached 171.5 million pounds (343
million dollars), compared with 153.4 million pounds (306.8
million dollars) the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' exports to Greece reached 37.6 million pounds (75.2
million dollars) in 1996, an increase of 12.7 percent compared

AMMAN -- Different interests on Jordanian dinar and foreign
currencies make dinar deposits rise and foreign currencies
deposits fall over the past months, Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) has reported an increase in
time deposits in Jordanian dinars of 5.9 percent over the past
four months, the state-controlled English daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The deposits in dinars rose from 2.38 billion at the end of
December 1996 to 2.52 billion at the end of April this year and
the increase margin was 141 million dinars (about 199 million
U.S. dollars), according to the combined balance sheet compiled by
the CBJ for all licensed banks and financial institutions in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the time deposits in foreign currencies dropped by
2.5 percent over the same period and the drop margin was 68
million dollars, according to the CBJ balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks in Jordan are required to put 14 percent of
their foreign currency deposits into the state-owned CBJ as
"statutory reserves," so the banks could not afford to give their
clients the same interest rates offered internationally on dollar
and other currencies, said Jawad Hadid, the general manager of the
Arab Banking Corporation (Jordan).

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Government to Refer New Press Law to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN,May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian government promised
today to refer the controversial amendments to the 1993 Press
and Publication Law to the Parliament soon for approval while
opposition deputies are trying to muster a majority in the 80-
member power organ to rescind the law.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Information Affairs Samir Mutawe today
said that the amendments, now only a temporary law under the
government, will be submitted to the Parliament to be elected in
November.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks after Prime Minister Abdul Salam
 Majali discussed the amendments this morning with president and
members of the Jordan Press Association (JPA).
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the JPA members present a memorandum on
their stand about certain article of the new law. He said that
the government is open to dialogue with the press community and
Majali surely will look into their complaints.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jordan's opposition parties' deputies are now
trying to muster a necessary majority of 41 signatures to call
the 80- member parliament into an extraordinary session to
rescind the new law.
</P>
<P>
The amendments are aimed at gagging severe restrictions on
coverage and to close down a daring weekly newspaper industry,
some deputies said at a press conference Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The amendments were earlier enacted by King Hussein and later
introduced as the third temporary law under the current
government.
</P>
<P>
They are widely believed to target the weekly tabloids which
have been blamed for "slinging mud on the royal family, leaking
military secrets and intruding citizens' privacy."
</P>
<P>
In 1993, after widespread riots demanding for more democracy,
Jordan passed the Press and Publication Law to free up
journalists at state-controled publications and allow for
independent newspapers, which enjoyed autonomy in publishing
modest criticism about the government.

<HEADLINE> OECD Urges Development of Free Trade, Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) today urged its 29
industrialized member countries to further develop free trade and
reform their labor market to scrap all unnecessary regulations.
</P>
<P>
In a report written by OECD experts and published today, the
economic think tank of the industrialized nations said that
unemployment rate in Europe will drop by half to 5 percent in 20
years, while the wealth of world industrialized nations will
double from 1995 to 2020.
</P>
<P>
However, the experts stressed that this blue print is
accompanied with "a political will without fail" by the
governments to continue to develop free trade and reform the labor
market to give it greater flexibility and reduce regulations.
</P>
<P>
They called on the governments to resist "protectionism" and
"social pressure" from within their countries.
</P>
<P>
In the report which was published belatedly because of a
dispute from Germany and France over its proposals on labor market
reform, the OECD noted that developed countries have less advanced
in the field of labor market reform than liberalization of trade.
</P>
<P>
It warned that if industrialized countries fail in these
fields, their economic growth rate over the next 20 years will be
only 2 percent, instead of 3 percent, while their wealth will
increase by 50 percent in 25 years, instead of doubling.

TUNIS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian President Zine al-Abidine
Ben Ali met here today with Syrian Vice President Abdul Halim
Khaddam on the current developments in the Arab world and
inter-Arab economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Tunisian news agency quoted Khaddam as saying after the
meeting that the two leaders also discussed the need to work for
inter-Arab economic cooperation in order to engage in the
globalization of economy.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Khaddam said, he conveyed a message from
Syrian President Hafez Assad to Ali on issues of concern to the
Arab nations, including the present situation of the Mideast peace
process and the necessary steps to implement the Arab summit
resolutions, to strengthen Arab solidarity and coordinate Arab
stances.
</P>

He asserted that views of the two sides were identical on all
issues discussed.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian vice president said that Ali had entrusted him with

HARARE, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan
Mudenge today urged African countries to strive for
socio-economic development so as to eradicate poverty,
illiteracy, hunger and disease.
</P>
<P>
"There is need to broaden and deepen our level of mutual
cooperation in addressing the great humanitarian issues of our
time," he said at the opening of the three-day meeting of African
ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
The meeting preceded the upcoming African summit scheduled for
June 2-4.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge said African countries should also make far more
efforts to restructure their economic systems to make them
profitable and safe destinations for investment.
</P>
<P>
He said Africa should benefit from the changes in the present
international economic system.
</P>
<P>
"We must also take concrete steps to harmonize and integrate
our economies and achieve our shared vision of an African
economic community," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mudenge said African countries should give priority
to ending conflicts on the continent as they discouraged
investment, disrupted productive pursuits, destroyed
infrastructure and led to wastage of all kinds of resources.
</P>
<P>
Africa, he said, needs to develop an effective capability for
resolving disagreements and disputes before they degenerate into
war.

<HEADLINE> Canada Seizes U.S. Vessels in Salmon War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian Coast Guard has seized
three U.S. fishing boats in the escalating Pacific salmon dispute,
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Two vessels, the Janet G. and the Nautilus, were apprehended
Sunday as they were passing through Canadian waters, said a
spokesman for Canada's Fisheries and Oceans Department.
</P>
<P>
The action was taken when the U.S. fishing boats failed to
comply with Canadian regulations requiring them to hail in and
stow their gear, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The two vessels were escorted into Port Hardy, where the
captains are to appear in court Tuesday, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Early today, the Canadian Coast Guard took into custody a third
U.S. vessel--the Four Daughters--in the waters off northeastern
Vancouver Island for failing to hail in, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Canada stepped up enforcement of measures requiring foreign
vessels to contact Canadian authorities as they pass through
Canadian waters following last week's collapse of talks with the
U.S. on a new Pacific salmon treaty.
</P>
<P>
Under the regulations, vessels that violate the regulations can
be inspected, required to go to a Canadian port or face arrest.
</P>
<P>
Canada and the U.S. have indicated their willingness to resume
their talks on the salmon dispute as early as this Friday.

<HEADLINE> More Light Shed on Sierra Leone's New Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Army Major Johnny Paul Koroma, who
declared himself head of state of Sierra Leone today was among
the 20 soldiers freed in the coup from a jail in Freetown, a
report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The report, quoting a close family source to Koroma, shed more
light on the Sierra Leone new leader who was almost totally
unknown to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Koroma, 33, was a fortnight ago charged with coup attempt
against the civilian government of President Ahmad Kkabbah,
together with nine other officers.
</P>
<P>
They have been on trial but not been convicted, as the trial
has been repeatedly adjourned, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Koroma was freed from the Pademba Road Prison in Freetown on
early Sunday by the coupists, together with hundreds of inmates
in the prison.
</P>
<P>
Koroma and the other some 20 soldiers were then whisked away
in waiting trucks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Koroma has served in the Sierra Leonean military forces for 10
years and is said to be very popular among junior officers.
</P>
<P>
He was trained in London, Nigeria and Ghana and once assumed
office as the commanding officer of the battalion attached to
Sierra Leone's Bauxite Mine in the southern district of Myamba.
</P>
<P>
Koroma is married with four children -- two boys and two
girls.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Calls for Cooperation to Help Solve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Turkish official
said today that cooperation would help solve the existing
disputes between Turkey and Greece, the semi-official Anatolia
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Turkish-Greek Forum's third meeting in Turkey's
largest city of Istanbul, Minister of State Abdullah Gul said that
"cooperation will be for the benefit of the two countries."
</P>
<P>
Noting that both Greece and Turkey are important countries in
this region, the minister called on business personages attending
the economic session to play a more active role in the settlement
of the two countries' problems.
</P>
<P>
He said businessmen's cooperation in the economic field would
certainly exert a positive influence on the political relations
between the two countries, adding that the Turkish government
would continue its support to these cooperation as it did in the
past.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish official also expressed the hope that such
business contacts would help the solution of the Cyprus issue,
which has been a long-standing obstacle to the normalization of
Turkish-Greek ties.
</P>
<P>
Business people from both the rival Greek and Turkish
communities in Cyprus are also present at the meeting which is
jointly sponsored by the Turkish-Greek Business Council and Greek
Entrepreneurs Association.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the Istanbul meeting took place amid
the improvement of relations between Ankara and Athens, and
would be helpful for the forthcoming U.N.-sponsored direct talks
on the Cyprus issue between the two communities on the island.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, two traditionally rival countries, have
long been at odds due to some sensitive issues, including the
Aegean sovereignty and the settlement of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unsolved since 1974 when the
island became divided after Turkish troops invaded and took
control of the northern third of the island in the wake of an
Athens-backed coup.

<P>
PARIS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) today predicted a rosy picture
of gross domestic product (GDP) growth in developing countries,
saying that the GDP of third world countries can double or even
triple from now to 2020.
</P>
<P>
In an experts' report published today by the OECD, the economic
think tank of the world's 29 industrialized nations said that in
an optimistic scenario, the developing countries will increase
their GDP by 270 percent by 2020.
</P>
<P>
If they fail to take proper measures to meet all the challenges
on the way, their GDP will also grow by 100 percent, said the
experts.
</P>
<P>
They said that the world's economic geography is experiencing
an upheaval now, as the GDP of developing countries will increase
from the current 40 percent of global GDP to 60 percent within 20
years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the global trade, which now represents 30 percent of
global wealth, will increase to half of the world GDP by 2020,
they said.
</P>
<P>
In 2020, the per capita GDP in developing countries will be
equal to 30 percent of that of developed countries, against 15
percent today, said the experts.
</P>
<P>
They also said that developed countries will welcome a number
immigrants from developing countries in the next 20 years, to
rebalance the insufficiency of labor force caused by a growing
aged population.

HARARE, May 26 (Xinhua)-- Ambassadors of member states of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) today condemned Sunday's coup

constitutional order there.
</P>
<P>
They said at an urgent meeting here that the coup by "elements

The meeting was to hammer out proposals to be presented to the

</P>
<P>
In a communique issued at the end of the meeting, the

The OAU considered this development as a setback not only for
Sierra Leone but also for Africa, especially at a time when the
continent was forging ahead with the process of democratization,

The communique called upon all African and non-African
countries "not to take any action which would have the effect of
giving comfort or strength to the leaders of the coup".

<HEADLINE> Canada Welcomes Initiating of Adjustments to Humane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government today
welcomed the initiating by Canada and the European Union of
adjustments to the International Agreement on Humane Trapping
Standards.
</P>
<P>
"It is an important step toward an eventual agreement and an
excellent example of how countries, working together, can
negotiate resolutions to difficult trade issues," said
International Trade Minister Art Eggleton.
</P>
<P>
When it comes into force, the agreement will "ensure the
viability of an important industry that employs many thousands of
Canadians and Europeans," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The initiating of these adjustments also marks an important
milestone in the protection of animal welfare by committing both
Canada and the EU to strict, humane trapping standards for all
trapping situations," he added.
</P>
<P>
The initiating comes after five months of intensive talks
between the EU and Canada, and is expected to ease the dispute
over the EU's ban on Canadian furs for using leg-hold traps.
</P>
<P>
In November 1991, the EU passed a resolution banning the use of
leg-hold traps, which was expected to prevent the import of most
furs from Canada, the United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The three countries have been negotiating with the EU since
July 1996 to set up an agreement that would prevent the
application of this import ban.
</P>
<P>
Russia is also expected to initiate the agreement with the EU
shortly.
</P>
<P>
The fur industry in Canada employs up to 100,000 people and
generates up to some 450 million U.S. dollars every year.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Farm Net Cash Income Dips in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Farm net cash income in Canada
dipped 8 percent in 1996 from 1995 as higher operating expenses
more than offset an increase in receipts, Statistics Canada said
today.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the net cash income of Canada's farm businesses was
3.96 billion U.S. dollars, compared with 4.25 billion dollars in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Operating expenses jumped 8 percent to 16.49 billion dollars,
due to higher costs for feed, crop and hail insurance, land
rental, fertilizer, and machinery and heating fuel.
</P>
<P>
Cash receipts rose 5 percent to 20.45 billion dollars, with
livestock revenues leading the way, the federal agency said.
</P>
<P>
Crop and livestock products accounted for 96 percent of total
receipts in 1996 and program payments the other 4 percent. It rose
from a low of 84 percent in 1992, as improved weather and
commodity prices reduced program payments.
</P>
<P>
After adjusting for inflation, net cash income in 1996
represented only 45 percent of the record-high 1975 level, the
agency noted.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, adjusted receipts were 5 percent above 1975 figures,
but expenses were 54 percent higher, reflecting the industry's
increased independence on purchased inputs such as fertilizers,
pesticides, machinery fuel and hired labor.
