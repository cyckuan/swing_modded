   WASHINGTON _ After 18 years in the Capitol Police force, Jacob
Chestnut was looking forward to his retirement, just months away.
But Chestnut, 58, remained so ebullient and outgoing with tourists
that one senator said he seemed like the Capitol's official
greeter.
</P>
<P>
   Special Agent John Gibson, 42, another 18-year veteran of the
force who was married to the niece of a congressman, worked in the
plainclothes division, assigned to guard Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas,
the third-ranking member of the House Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, both men gave their lives to stop a gunman who barged
into the Capitol and opened fire. The Senate historian said it was
the first time that Capitol Police officers had been shot to death
in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich said, ``The officers who were killed, and
those who apprehended the gunman, are true heroes of democracy and
every American owes them a deep debt of gratitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men were members of the Capitol's own police force,
formed shortly after an 1828 incident in which a journalist slapped
President John Quincy Adams' son, who was on official business for
his father at the Capitol. Now the force comprises about 1,200
officers who guard the doors and entrances on Capitol Hill,
investigate threats against members of Congress and provide them
with personal protection.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he knew the two men, the usually crusty Rep. Bill
Thomas, R-Calif., choked back tears as he said: ``We passed them
multiple times during a day. And you exchange, you know, `How are
you?' You don't expect an answer. And they're there every day. And
no one expects this to occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut, members of Congress said, was shot in the chest when
he stopped the gunman and told him to go through the metal detector
at the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson was at his post at the unmarked back entrance to the
suite of offices used by DeLay and the whip staff. He ordered staff
members, who were celebrating the House's passage of health care
legislation, to get farther back in the room and to get down on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   He was killed as he exchanged gunfire with the intruder.
</P>
<P>
   ``John gave his life to protect me and members of my staff,''
DeLay said. ``There is no doubt that if John had not acted quickly
and with great bravery as he did, others would have been killed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Chestnut's sister-in-law, Betty Johnson, said the officer had
been planning to retire in September. His neighbors in the Maryland
suburb of Fort Washington and lawmakers described him as a cheerful
man involved in civic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very outgoing guy,'' said Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D.
``He acted almost like an official greeter; he was so good with
tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerome R. Goldring, a neighbor, said Chestnut was ``wonderful
and cheerful, and I wish I had more neighbors like him. I remember,
a few years ago, there was a kind of sickly neighbor and he would
go up there and cut her lawn. He was a great man.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn E. Gravely-Moss, another neighbor, described how the
officer loved to jog around the neighborhood. ``He and my husband
would talk about retirement. What they would do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Family members said Chestnut had met his wife, Wenling, in
Taiwan in 1974 when he was stationed there as an Air Force police
officer. He began his career as a Capitol Police officer after
retiring from the Air Force in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Chestnut's children, Karen and William, are both in
college. Capitol Police said Chestnut had at least one other child
from a previous marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Gingrich, along with Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla.,
stopped at the Chestnut home to see the officer's family. Earlier,
the two lawmakers visited with Gibson's family at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told their kids what great heroes their dads had been,''
said Andrew Weinstein, a spokesman for Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, a Massachusetts native who lived in Woodbridge, Va., was
married to the niece of Rep. Joseph Moakley, D-Mass. A neighbor
described him and his wife, Lynn, as inseparable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere they went, they went as a family,'' said the
neighbor, Kevin J. Murphy. ``He had barbecues with his family,
everything was with his family.''
</P>
<P>
   He had three children: a 17-year-old daughter and two boys, ages
15 and 14.
</P>
<P>
   Virgil VanFleet, a 28-year veteran of the Capitol Police, once
worked in a scout car as Gibson's partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved the protection detail,'' VanFleet said. ``John was a
very good man, very conscientious.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson was known around his neighborhood as a handyman and was
often doing projects or helping others with them.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said his neighbor did not talk often about his work, but
was clearly proud of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talked about liking it,'' Murphy said. ``He had a lot of
admiration for his job.''

BATTLE FOR BOYS' LIVES BRINGS FAMILIES TOGETHER

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Doctors in China told Yongxin Deng his son
Shao-Han was destined for death. It took the Internet and the
compassion of a family to bring his son to America for the
life-saving surgeries that Deng said now give him hope.
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosed with a congenital heart disease, the tiny but
strong-willed 3-year-old underwent the second in a series of
surgeries at the University of California, Los Angeles, pediatric
hospital Wednesday that is bringing him closer to correcting his
heart defect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very hopeful, more than hopeful,'' Deng, 32, said in an
interview Friday at the hospital. ``We're very confident because
he's strong, and the doctors here are very good. The best in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Relieved with the successful surgery, his two young parents
spent the day comforting the boy nicknamed Shao-Shao. He is a
wide-eyed youngster who loves bikes, tricycles and visiting parks _
and was born with a heart equipped with only one pumping chamber
instead of two.
</P>
<P>
   Yongxin Deng was in Australia last summer working on his
doctorate when his wife, Han Dan Deng, 28, told him that doctors
discovered a congenital heart disease in Shao-Shao during a routine
check-up. He was filled with despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors told me it was hopeless and he was dying,''
Yongxin Deng said. ``I felt hopelessness. I just wanted to try to
get some help for him.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend recommended he tap into the Internet for medical
information. He sent 500 e-mail messages to doctors, institutions
and anyone who might listen.
</P>
<P>
   One of the messages found its way to Brenda and Bill
Isaacs-Booth through an Internet support group for parents of
children with heart defects. Like Shao-Shao, their son Liam suffers
from a congenital heart defect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yongxin was told that his son was inoperable, that nothing
could be done, and we had been told the same thing about Liam,''
said Brenda Isaacs-Booth, a sitcom and commercial actress who
helped create a fund that has raised $160,000 for Shao-Shao's
medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   Isaacs-Booth put the Dengs in contact with doctors at UCLA and
contributed $6,800 _ gathered from family members _ toward the
$12,000 deposit the Dengs needed for Shao-Shao's first visit to
UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   The Dengs said the donations and outpouring of support from
complete strangers has completely changed their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made us know that people in this world really love each
other and care about other people's needs,'' Yongxin Deng said.
``Almost all of these (donors) are strangers to us. We can't even
remember all their names, but still, they helped us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dengs and the Isaacs-Booths have found mutual support in
each other. When Liam underwent surgery three weeks ago, the Dengs
traveled by bus every day for a week to visit him.
</P>
<P>
   Shao-Shao is like a second son for Brenda Isaacs-Booth, whose
face lights up when she speaks of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This surgery is what really let us know that it worked, that
this was meant to happen,'' said Isaacs-Booth, as her voice cracked
and tears came to her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here this child was defying the odds, showing us that we were
right in fighting for him.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA doctors said Friday that Shao-Shao's prognosis is good.
</P>
<P>
   ``This surgery went surprisingly well, and the outlook looks
very good,'' said Hillel Laks, director of UCLA's pediatric heart
surgery program.
</P>
<P>
   With more surgeries in store for his son, Yongxin Deng, who has
a master's degree in soil science and a bachelor's degree in
physical geography, said he is looking for a job to support his
family. When he recovers, Shao-Shao might enter preschool here.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to reciprocate all that's been given, the Dengs said they
will now help other families abroad who are in similar predicaments
seek medical help. Already Isaacs-Booth and the Dengs are arranging
for a 2-year-old Chinese girl to visit UCLA to treat her heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't repay anyone now, but what I can do is try to help
other people,'' Yongxin Deng said. &UR; !end! &QL;

NICKLAUS FIGHTS, FLOYD LEADS, MOST COMPLAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The last, best hope of the U.S. Senior Open spent
most of the day listing noticeably to favor a sore hip. Afterward,
when he got weary of standing in one position, he had to lean
against the statue of Ben Hogan that stands sentry on a hill at
Riviera Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus, in an obviously diminished physical state, might
not be able to overtake the leaders at this major senior
tournament, but it's obvious there is a great deal of fight in this
golden bear. Just what this event needs.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his tour brethren are complaining about those exacting
playing conditions at Riviera this week. Veteran crowd-pleaser Chi
Chi Rodriguez, who missed the cut at 17 over par Friday, hissed,
``I think Dr. Kevorkian should do a job on that golf course. No
wonder O.J. Simpson quit (the club). They went to an extreme. We're
senior golfers. At our age people should come here to see us have
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus, arguably the greatest ever to play this game, takes an
entirely different view. Bring it on, he says. Let's see who's
toughest.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of attitude that might shake this tournament out
of some of its lethargy and roust L.A.'s golf fans from wherever
they're holed up.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus drew another enormous gallery Friday. Imagine the
excitement he would generate if he could climb a few slots higher
on the leaderboard today.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of that stack is Raymond Floyd, who duplicated a
1-under-par round of 70 to take a two-stroke lead over Roy Vucinich
and Bruce Summerhays, both of whom are at even par (142).
</P>
<P>
   Dave Stockton and Isao Aoki are tied another stroke back, at 1
over.
</P>
<P>
   The tour's top money-winner of the last two years, Hale Irwin,
showing no ill effects from the huge chip that sprouts on his
shoulder whenever he meets the media, is lurking just off the pace
(3 over, following a tournament-best round of 68). So is his chief
rival on the tour, Gil Morgan, also at 3 over.
</P>
<P>
   And, for the sake of sentiment, it was probably appropriate that
the cut just barely missed Arnold Palmer, who survived at 12-over
154 (76 on Friday).
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is true that only five of 308 rounds of golf played in
this thing have been under par. But Nicklaus, 4-over par following
a round of 72, believes that should be the course's charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the golf course is set up beautifully,'' he said. ``I
think it's very, very good for the seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   Lightning greens? Wicked pin placements? Ball-gulping rough?
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus: ``I love to hear them complain about it. That just
sends them home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to love to walk in the locker room (and hear), `Oh, see
how tough this course is? See how fast those greens are? See how
hard those greens are? See how deep that rough is?' You just write
each one of them off. That's just one less guy to beat this week.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the guy to beat is obviously Floyd, who is doing
some steady work out on that course.
</P>
<P>
   He has hit 20 of 28 fairways, reached two-thirds of the greens
in regulation and balanced seven birdies with five bogeys. ``You
try to keep an even keel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tell Summerhays about it. He was 3 under for the tournament with
three holes to play Friday, the lead his for the taking. But he
instead staggered to three consecutive bogeys to close out his
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always look back and say, `Wow, it could have been
better,''' Summerhays said. ``But would you take it (a 71) at the
first of the day? You would say yes, so I'm not going to brood over
those bogeys.''
</P>
<P>
   Wise strategy, since there has been plenty of brooding to spread
around this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The USGA is very prone to putting a golf course on the edge,''
said Morgan, ``and sometimes they go over the edge. We understand
they're going to make it as goofy as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nicklaus has no quarrel with that. Even when he has to
attack such a course without being able to stand up straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think the other (senior) tournaments are very
tough,'' said Nicklaus, who has said this will be his last
competitive event of the year. ``I think what's happened _ and I
don't like it _ they got on a kick where they thought 63, 64 is
what you should shoot every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I think the game of golf is par. I think par should
be protected to a certain degree.''
</P>
<P>
   The USGA has gotten its wish in that regard _ so far, the
average score on this par-70 layout is 78.57.
</P>
<P>
   Now the senior tour should hope that its wish comes true:
Nicklaus climbing gingerly over the dozen players ahead of him and
really making a go of this.

NEW YORK MAYOR VETOES PLAN FOR VOTE ON STADIUM  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By NICK RAVO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani vetoed on Friday the City
Council's plans for a public referendum on whether city funds
should be used to build a new baseball stadium, calling such a vote
premature, unnecessary, legally flawed and politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also contended that approving the referendum could
prompt the New York Yankees to leave the city. The team's principal
owner, George Steinbrenner, has signaled his unhappiness with
Yankee Stadium, and the mayor has warned that the city may lose the
team to New Jersey if Steinbrenner is not accommodated with either
a Manhattan stadium or a better one in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does anyone want to see the Yankees reach the same fate as the
baseball Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants, as well as the
football Jets and Giants?'' he said in a statement released on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A local law that would place a referendum on the ballot and
ask voters of the city to decide whether public money can be spent
on a new stadium in Manhattan would unjustifiably eliminate a
viable option that could potentially insure that the Yankees remain
in New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the referendum, however, countered that Giuliani
was denying city voters the right to have a say in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This mayor has got to stop dictating public opinion and learn
the difference between political pandering and real democracy,''
the council speaker, Peter Vallone, said in a statement on Friday.
``The council will send that message loud and clear when we
override this veto.''

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, July 24 -- The following chart shows how senators and
house representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the
last week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: GUNSAFE1
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Monday passed, 72-28, a measure to require gun
dealers to offer child-proof safety devices to gun purchasers.
Supporters said the amendment was more flexible than a Democratic
proposal that would have required each gun sold to include
child-proof safety devices. Opponents argued that the amendment
lacked substance because it did not include an enforcement
provision. A ``yes'' vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: GUNSAFE2
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Monday rejected, 61-39, an amendment that would
have required handguns to be sold with child-proof safety devices.
Supporters said the amendment would protect children from handgun
accidents. Opponents said the amendment was an unnecessary federal
regulation and would not accomplish its purpose. A ``yes'' vote
favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: GUNS
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday rejected, 69-31, a measure that would
have allowed federal prosecution of gun owners whose weapons were
used by children in a crime if the guns were stored insecurely.
Supporters said the measure would have kept guns out of children's
hands by requiring people to keep their guns out of reach.
Opponents argued that innocent people could have been held
responsible if children found a way to access the guns, even though
they were properly stored. A ``yes'' vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: GAMBLE1
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday rejected, 82-18, an amendment that would
have exempted Indian tribes from a measure that bans gambling on
the Internet. Supporters said the ban interferes with the Indian
Gaming Regulatory Act, which already regulates Indian gambling.
Opponents said there is no way to confine Internet gambling to
Indian reservations. A ``yes'' vote favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   5) BILL NUMBER: GAMBLE2
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday passed, 90-10, a measure that would
outlaw gambling on the Internet. The amendment to the
Commerce-State-Justice bill institutes a fine on people who gamble
by telephone or wire to online casinos. Supporters said the ban
prevents children from gaining access to gambling sites while on
the Internet. Opponents said it is already illegal to gamble by
wire and that this bill would only provide exceptions to the
existing law. A ``yes'' vote favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   VOTE : 1 2 3 4 5
</P>
<P>
   --- --- --- --- ---
</P>
<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: HOUSING
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, July 17, the House approved, 230-181, a measure that
would reform public housing laws and increase the income level at
which families are elegible for public housing. Supporters said the
bill would allow more people with different income levels to live
in public housing and would benefit inner-city communities.
Opponents said the bill would eliminate preferential housing for
the very poor and give it to people who are less needy. A ``yes''
vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: UNIONS
</P>
<P>
   The House on Monday rejected, 248-150, an amendment that would
have required unions to disclose spending of each activity in which
they are involved, including political activities. Supporters said
that the public has a right to know how much unions spend.
Opponents argued that the amendment unfairly singled out unions,
while protecting corporations. A ``yes'' vote favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: NEA
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday approved, 253-173, an amendment to restore
$98 million in funding to the National Endowment for the Arts.
Supporters said NEA funding benefits state and local programs in
underserved communiites and that last year's reforms addressed many
of the criticisms NEA opponents have voiced in recent years.
Opponents argued that only artists who know how to work the system
get grants and that the arts already receive sufficient funding
from other government sources. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: CHINA
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday voted, 264-166, to defeat a measure that
would have revoked China's ``most favored nation'' status, a label
which allows normal trade relations with a country. Supporters
argued that maintaining trade with China was the best way to
influence Chinese domestic policy. Opponents argued that the nation
should hold China accountable for human rights violations by
withholding normal trade status. A ``yes'' vote favors revoking
China's status.
</P>
<P>
   5) BILL NUMBER: ABORTION
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 296-132, an override to
President Clinton's veto of legislation banning certain late-term
abortions. The vote exceeded the two-thirds majority needed to
override a veto. The measure will go before the Senate, where
Republicans have been unable to get the two-thirds support.
Supporters said the procedure is gruesome and should be illegal.
Opponents said the ban criminalizes a medical procedure that is
needed to save women's lives. A ``yes'' vote favors the ban.
</P>
<P>
   6) BILL NUMBER: KYOTO
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 226-198, a measure that would
protect education programs from a bill that would limit funding for
environmental agencies trying to implement the Kyoto Protocol, an
international environmental agreement. Supporters said educational
programs facilitate an open debate on environmental issues.
Opponents said funding should not be allocated for the Kyoto
Protocol until it has been ratified by the Senate. A ``yes'' vote
favors the measure.

YEAR AFTER EATING L.A. CHIHUAHUA, SNAKE LOOSE IN DEEP SOUTH

   LOS ANGELES _ Alissss is missing again. But she's not hungry
this time.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year after the 7 1/2-foot boa escaped from its
suburban Los Angeles home during a heat wave and ate a 2-pound
Chihuahua, the snake has disappeared again.
</P>
<P>
   This time, police and animal control officials think the
infamous snake may have been stolen from her owner's Birmingham,
Ala., apartment. Aspiring rock star Angus Johnson moved there from
Los Angeles last month after giving up waiting for the city to
issue the snake permit promised him.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, in hopes of luring the serpent back to his home,
Johnson set an amplifier up on his balcony, hooked up his guitar,
and started playing _ with the volume cranked to 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just associates those vibrations with me. Hopefully this
will help lead her home to me,'' he said. ``Hopefully she'll
recognize the vibrations.''
</P>
<P>
   When the snake disappeared July 11, police and animal control
officials concluded it was unlikely the 20-pound snake could have
escaped via the 20-foot high balcony or a nearby tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their opinion was definitely that she had been stolen,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Police advised him only to tell his immediate neighbors about
the missing snake, in hopes that the crooks would be dumb enough to
try to sell the snake locally.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said a snake of that size would normally be worth about
$300, but because of the international notoriety the snake garnered
a year ago, she might fetch more.
</P>
<P>
   On the Fourth of July, Johnson took the snake to a fireworks
show in Birmingham. ``A lot of people recognized us from `The
People's Court,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Johnson appeared on the syndicated show, where he
was deemed the loser in a court case brought by Flossie ``Jackie''
Torgerson, whose Chihuahua, Babette, had been eaten by Alissss.
</P>
<P>
   An August heat wave had sped up the boa's metabolism, animal
experts surmised, sending it in search of food ahead of its monthly
feeding schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Friday that he's worried about getting his beloved
pet back, but doesn't think she's a threat to anymore miniature
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd just eaten three huge rats. She's not due to eat for
sometime,'' Johnson said.

ASIAN WOES, LOW PROFITS AMONG ANALYSTS' REASONS FOR SLOWDOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- American equity markets are going to stay anemic
for the near future as continuing woes about Asia, concern about
corporate earnings for the second half of 1998 and high valuations
rein in investor enthusiasm, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   While many don't believe the bull market is over, investment
experts are expecting choppy waters to continue at least until the
end of the year in a fashion similar to the volatility the market
has experienced this year but with small rallies from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   The markets were mixed Friday, after four days in which stocks
overall got hammered. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at
8937.36 on Friday, up 4.38 from Thursday. Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index rose 1.05 to 1140.80 while the technology-heavy Nasdaq
composite index came in at 1930.99, down 4.23.
</P>
<P>
   This week alone, the Dow has given up 400 points, or 4.3
percent, from its July 17 all-time high; the S&AMP;P's 500 declined by
45.95, 3.9 percent; Nasdaq gave up 77.77, 3.9 percent; and Daily
News/Bloomberg dropped 3.63, 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough week,'' said Alfred Kugel, senior investment
strategist at Stein Roe &AMP; Farnham, a mutual fund and asset
management company in Chicago. ``We lost about half of what we
gained in the previous five weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   He said this week's blood bath resulted from profit-taking by
traders who saw an excuse to dump stocks in light of disappointing
earnings from several high-profile firms such as Merck, The Walt
Disney Co., Hewlett-Packard and Boeing, and warnings of corporate
weakness to come.
</P>
<P>
   Also causing damage were Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan's double-sided comments about inflation concerns due to
rising wages and unabated problems in Asia continuing to hurt
American companies, Kugel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Greenspan) put a dose of reality on people, and they started
to pull back on the market,'' said Don Wellenreiter, president of
Defined Risk Asset Management in Newbury Park, a money-management
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Wellenreiter sees continued volatility for the near future. He's
troubled by the market's breadth narrowing -- fewer stocks
advancing than those losing ground -- and warns especially of the
Asian crisis hurting earnings in the next two quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and a few other Asian nations are
saddled with massive debt they are struggling to repay. Japan is in
a recession. Their currencies have been devalued, making American
goods more expensive to buy. Hence, American sales to that region
have dropped greatly, hurting corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Wellenreiter doesn't expect Asia to recover until 2000. He also
believes the American stock market will remain lackluster as money
managers shift investments from high-priced state-side equities to
bargains overseas.
</P>
<P>
   But he stopped short of declaring the bull run to be over.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Arnold Kaufman, editor of the S&AMP;P Outlook, an investment
newsletter in New York, doesn't believe a bear market is upon us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any evidence that the bull market is
over. It's been showing a remarkable resiliency for 3{ years now,''
he said. ``It should be expected that buying into weakness will
emerge again -- that's a reasonable bet given the record. ... The
market is innocent until proven guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   For the year, the Dow is up 13 percent; S&AMP;P's 500, 17.56
percent; and the Nasdaq, 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kugel also argues that companies aren't doing badly overall.
Discounting energy-related stocks in S&AMP;P's 500, which have been
hurt by weak oil prices, two-thirds of the remaining 385 stocks
have profit gains of 10 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   He expects large capitalization stocks, such as blue chips, to
continue to do better than mid- to small-cap issues as investors
fly to more stable companies.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he said, most of the new money recently pouring into
mutual funds is going into growth-and-income and index funds that
invest in large-cap stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Further supporting blue chips are foreign investors, mainly
Europeans, who tend to favor companies they know in American stock
markets, Kugel added. Large-cap stocks are helped as well when big
companies buy back their own shares with extra cash.
</P>
<P>
   Kugel recommends cherry-picking for one's stocks, favoring
companies without much or any Asian exposure and whose earnings
remain solid.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Wellenreiter told clients to short the market -- they
would profit in a market drop -- as his technical indicators point
to a coming decline. But he expects a short-term rally to come
soon.

SUMMERHAYS IS ON A MISSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Before Bruce Summerhays gave in to temptation and
became a touring golf pro, he and his wife Carolyn called the kids
together, just to make sure they approved.
</P>
<P>
   Which might not have been as simple as it sounds. There are
eight Summerhays children and 10 Summerhays grandchildren. To call
a family meeting, Bruce and Carolyn didn't need a telephone, they
needed the House Republican Whip.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, a quorum was achieved, and the vote was unanimous: Dad
had held out long enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Go for it!''' he said, thinking back to that night
of decision four years ago in Heber City, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Whereupon Bruce Summerhays, owner of the best reason ever for
not attempting the PGA Tour, set about making up for lost time on
the Senior PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   To Bruce and Carolyn, family is always the first priority. Even
on mornings like Friday, when he was leading the U.S. Senior Open
at Riviera Country Club and she was quietly thrilling to his early
birdies and mourning his three late bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn travels everywhere she can with Bruce, no mean feat
since he has been the Cal Ripken Jr. of the senior tour the past
four seasons, playing 96 consecutive tournaments in one ironman
stretch. When it's possible, some of the kids travel too. Four of
them are trudging through the kikuyu in Pacific Palisades this
week, rooting Dad on. Plus a couple of the grandkids, one of them
in a stroller, tagging along with oldest daughter Shelly.
</P>
<P>
   One of the children, 25-year-old William, is Bruce's caddy,
following in the spike marks of six of his brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   At times in this sparsely attended second round, the Summerhays
cheering section consisted mostly of Summerhayses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any money (in 1994),'' Carolyn said as she
walked beside the ninth fairway, ``but we decided, anyway, we'd
always get me there (to tournaments) and we'd always get the kids
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a wimp,'' she said of her 54-year-old husband. ``He gets
lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   There's another, larger reason Summerhays keeps his family
around him. They're Mormons. For them, there's only one thing more
important than being with the family, and that's being with the
family on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Since Summerhays is often working on Sundays _ he has finished
in the top 10 in four of the past five tournaments _ observing his
faith is more work than a buried lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're supposed to keep the Sabbath day holy,'' Carolyn said.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen holes is holy?
</P>
<P>
   ``But you're also supposed to provide for your family,'' Carolyn
said with a shrug, looking embarrassed to sound as if she's
rationalizing. ``It's not as if Bruce is the only Mormon on the
tour.'' (Johnny Miller is Mormon. Billy Casper is Mormon. The NFL's
Steve Young is Mormon; he does most of his best work on Sundays.)
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Bruce's schedule will include the final round of this
major tournament; attending church somewhere in Los Angeles; and
hymns and Bible lessons in his hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the Scriptures on tape and on our computer,'' Carolyn
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Such attempts to replicate hearth and home in a Hilton or Hyatt
would have been unimaginable to the Summerhayses 30 years ago, when
Bruce abandoned prospects of a PGA Tour career after a single
near-miss at qualifying school.
</P>
<P>
   He had been a college All-American at Utah, a top sectional
player and a record-holder (60) on the Olympic Club Ocean Course in
San Francisco, where he was the assistant pro before moving on to
coach at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   But as for big-time golfing glory, he assumed he had renounced
that forever. He confined his tournament play to sectionals and the
occasional Bing Crosby Pro-Am, tying for third in the latter in
1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was better (for the family) to have me home, I think, at
that time,'' he said Friday. ``For me, it was the right decision. I
really don't have any regrets at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knew that by the time almost all the kids were grown _
Carrie, the youngest, just graduated from high school _ there would
be a tour for the 50-and-up set?
</P>
<P>
   And that Summerhays would become a walking advertisement not
only for Ping golf clubs but for delayed gratifiG5;%5n.
</P>
<P>
   Summerhays won his first senior topt[,[Y7

QUITTING JUST NOT AN OPTION  
 DRIVER KEEPS GOING DESPITE LOSS OF LEG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It happened so suddenly and frighteningly, the two men washing
the pickup truck had no time to blink. Or run.
</P>
<P>
   The four-door sedan came to a screeching halt, pulling within
inches of the truck's rear fender. Three individuals jumped out,
all waving guns _ and all pointing them at Dan Ruth and his
20-year-old son, Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to think,'' Dan Ruth said.
</P>
<P>
   Ordered inside the family-owned karting shop located near
McDowell Road and 27th Avenue, the Ruths were forced face down on
the floor and tied with duct tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of them kept saying, `Where's the money? Where's the
money?' '' the elder Ruth said. ``He had his gun stuck to my
temple. I think there was still an imprint of a (barrel's) ring on
my head three weeks after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Distracted by a noise coming from another room, the assailants
left the Ruths to investigate, closing a large rolling door behind
them.
</P>
<P>
   A second later, the Ruths heard a shot.
</P>
<P>
   Enik Sanders, who leased space from the Ruths to build kart
engines, was shot in the midsection and died at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The three men returned, but were unable to reopen the sliding
door because there was no outside handle. One of the men attempted
to regain entry through another door leading to the same room, but
his path was blocked by a large tool chest the intruders had placed
earlier to prevent entry by potential passersby.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, the man reached around the tool chest and fired
several shots at the Ruths. One of the bullets from the .44-magnum
struck Dan Ruth in his right ankle, shattering it. Another lodged
below his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Ruth, who had partially worked himself free, rolled to a
blind spot and was not hit.
</P>
<P>
   It was Nov. 18, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen days later, Dan Ruth's right leg was amputated below the
knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police never have been able to catch those guys,'' said
Dan Ruth, who underwent 10 operations to try to save the leg. ``But
I'll never forget. My new leg won't let me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth's new leg is a $16,000 artificial limb constructed mostly
of carbon fiber. He owns three of them, one of which has been
specifically designed for racing. Ruth manipulates the accelerator
with the prosthesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't done much kart racing the past five years before (the
shooting),'' said Dan Ruth, who moved the family karting shop to
Glendale in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I started racing when I was 4. I raced quarter-midgets
with Sleepy Tripp. My dad used to own Indy cars. Jerry Sneva and
(Duane) Carter drove for him back in 1977 through 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to try midget and sprint-car racing, and being
as close to death as I was, it made me want to do it more than
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   In October, Ruth, 46, purchased a midget race car formerly
driven by Denise Bennet. Ruth bought another midget three months
ago from Larry Curry, whose drivers were Tony Stewart and Andy
Michner.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth, who has raced twice since the shooting, drove the Curry
machine first in May at Tucson Raceway Park, where he finished 13th
in a U.S. Auto Club Western States midget race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was very respectable in what would have to be
considered a stellar field of cars,'' said Tommy Hunt, USAC Vice
President/Western Operations. ``It's a pretty tough circuit, and
(Indy Racing League driver) Davey Hamilton also was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at (Ruth) in practice to see if he was able to
handle himself in a capable fashion and whether he was capable of
getting out of the car under his own power in a reasonable amount
of time. In both cases, (Ruth) did quite well. He looked good.''
</P>
<P>
   Too good, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like (him racing) a bit,'' said Joyce Ruth, Dan's
wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's adapted so well to (the amputation), I don't think of
it as a disability.'' &QL; 
Others worried &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, according to some people within the Valley karting
community, Ruth enjoys racing too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been known to be too risky on the racetrack,'' said a
driver who wished to remain anonymous. ``It's a good story how he's
overcome adversity and is racing again. But a lot of people don't
care for the way he races.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Ciliberti, another racer, isn't one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a heart of gold,'' Ciliberti said. ``What he's
overcome is a lesson in courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth acknowledged he races hard even when the stakes are merely
trophies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I hold the record for the longest suspension at the
club level,'' Ruth said. ``(Before the shooting), myself and
another driver crashed in one of the turns and they (Phoenix Kart
Racing Association officials) said I was overly aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth received a 120-day suspension and the other driver received
60 stitches in his leg when a chain from Ruth's machine ripped open
a gash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan is a guy, who when he gets in a racing situation, will
press the issue,'' PKRA President Duncan Thompson said. ``He's not
going to back off.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth's definition of racing, however, contains no boundaries.
Whether its club racing or racing for money, Ruth always races to
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second place means you're just the first loser,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth figures there will be many non-winning performances in the
days, months and years ahead. But he remains undeterred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider myself physically challenged,'' Ruth said.
``I mostly wear shorts to work, and a lot of times I won't even
park in the handicapped spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I'm racing again is because I'm an adrenaline
junkie. I'd like to race the rest of my life or at least until I
lose the desire to win.'' &QL; 
``One of them kept saying, `Where's the money? Where's the money?'
He had his gun stuck to my temple. &QC;

BIG THINGS EXPECTED FROM STEPANOVA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   `` Maria. We've just met a girl named Maria. And suddenly we've
found ... that we haven't seen anything yet.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Stepanova's ``West Side (of Russia) Story`` is only
beginning to be told. Mercury fans display signs proclaiming ``We
(Heart) Tall Blondes'' and ``Will U Marry Me Maria?'' with no more
to go on than her good looks and a vague sense that one day the
6-foot-8 teenager will transform into one of basketball's best
players.
</P>
<P>
   Carrie Graf, the Australian National Team/Mercury assistant
coach who has seen Stepanova since she was 17 and the youngest
Russian basketball player at the 1996 Olympics, punctuates that
promise. ``No question, she'll be a franchise player because of her
size and she's not just a big dork. She's not a geeky, lumbering
6-8.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can be a running 4 (power forward) type of player at 6-8,
and that's hard to stop in women's basketball. I think she's got
more potential than (Margo) Dydek.''
</P>
<P>
   Dydek, the Utah Starzz 7-2 rookie, is averaging 12.8 points, 7.6
rebounds and a league-high 3.5 blocks while starting and playing
27.7 minutes per game. Stepanova has gotten off the bench in 13 of
the Mercury's 18 games, missing three while on the injured list,
yet for her 7.2 minutes has respectable averages: 4.2 points, 2.5
rebounds, .62 blocks (15th in the league).
</P>
<P>
   ``She's shown signs she can score and get it done, and she's
still quite raw,'' Graf said. ``But imagine her in five years.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when Grandmama (34-year-old Jennifer Gillom) will really
be in the rocking chair, with any luck polishing her 1998 MVP
trophy, and the Mercury is reshaped around Stepanova (19), Brandy
Reed (21), Umeki Webb (23) and Kristi Harrower (23).
</P>
<P>
   ``Maria has definitely taken a load off me this year,'' said
Gillom, whose minutes are about the same as last season but
production is up (15.7 points to 19.5, 5.4 rebounds to 7.3, 1.32
steals to 2.0). ``She's given me a lot of rest this year _
something I didn't expect to come from a 19-year-old. She's done an
excellent job of coming in and putting in quality minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheryl, thank you!''
</P>
<P>
   Mercury Coach-General Manager Cheryl Miller saw Stepanova at the
Atlanta Olympics and with Graf's endorsement was not shy about
spending the team's first-round draft pick (eighth overall) on a
player not at the WNBA pre-draft combine.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix officials believe that if Stepanova, then with the
Russian national team preparing for the World Championships, had
been fully scouted at the camp, she would have been next off the
board behind the 24-year-old Dydek.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunate, too, that Stepanova had not progressed as rapidly as
she might have had in Russia, which did not medal in Atlanta, and
not switched national-team coaches to Evgueny Gomelsky. ``He's from
the old school where the older players play,'' said Michelle
Griffiths, now Stepanova's Mercury teammate. ``She was getting to
play just before Atlanta, then at the World Championships they went
back to the old way.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay Kallam, publisher of ``Full Court Press,'' was at the World
Championships in Germany. Stepanova played little, he said, because
``she has trouble with the physical style of play. When she did
play, she wasn't effective. But I think she's going to be a fine
player.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second-year of the WNBA, only Dydek is taller than
Stepanova. Detroit's Razija Mujanovic and Los Angeles' Haixia Zheng
also are 6-8, and neither has Stepanova's mobility. The kind of
speed that but for an unanswered letter might have put her on a
different Olympic track.
</P>
<P>
   When his younger daughter was already taller than her teacher in
fourth grade, Alexande Stepanova wrote a letter to high jumper
Tamara Bykova, the bronze medalist at the 1988 Olympics. When no
reply came, he began calling the sports schools in St. Petersburg,
trying to find a basketball home for a girl whose paternal
great-grandfather stood 6-11.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were reluctant to take her because the girls she was
playing with were in the sport already for five years or so,'' said
Stepanova, a surgeon who with his wife, Valentina, arrived in the
United States for the first time on July 16 to spend more than a
month with Maria.
</P>
<P>
   After just a year in basketball, said her mother, a high-school
Russian literature teacher, Maria had progressed from a girl who
ran down the court clutching the ball instead of dribbling to the
equal of those with greater experience.
</P>
<P>
   For five years, Stepanova commuted two hours each way by train
from her town, Lyuban, to St. Petersburg to study basketball. ``She
wrapped five times around the earth,'' making that trip, her father
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stepanova was able to live in St. Petersburg at a sports school
for two years of high school, then returned to Lyuban to graduate.
After that, the national team, Russian pro league and WNBA came
calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day brings her more information, and she's trying to
saturate it as a real . . . sponge,'' said Stepanova through her
interpreter, Irina Viktorova, who reaches for the correct word.
``Everything is new here. It's a good school. She loves this
country so far, and she really likes Phoenix more and more every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   This might be more than Stepanova's summer home for the next
decade. Talks already are under way with her agent, Boris
Lelchitski, for Stepanova to return in the coming off-season for
weight training with Suns/Mercury conditioning coach Robin Pound.
And, of course, to learn English.
</P>
<P>
   ``She ran up to me all excited about a week ago and said (in
English), `Michelle, yesterday we went to Sedona,' `` Griffiths
said. Surprised and impressed, Griffiths pressed the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it good?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Very nice,'' Stepanova said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was there?''
</P>
<P>
   Look of panic. Time to find Viktorova, who ultimately translated
the answer: ``Red rocks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She understands what switch means and shoot, strong, rebound,
those sorts of things,'' Griffiths said. ``I don't think anyone can
really see her potential as yet because the language barrier is
there. Her potential on defense is just unlimited, but people can't
see that because the main thing on defense is a lot of talk. She
can read the play, but she can't necessarily understand the
communication.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as a changeup off the bench, Stepanova has moments. Like the
11 points in 10 minutes in the second half vs. Washington on June
28. And 15 points and 8 rebounds in 20 minutes at Detroit on July
8.
</P>
<P>
   Stepanova said she came here to become a dominant player. If so,
these first-season highs are just appetizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always can set your goals higher, and that's what she's
doing,'' Stepanova said through her interpreter. ``She can't say
right now that she has achieved a lot. She has a definite goal in
life, but it's hard for her to say right now whether she has
approached her goals or not.''
</P>
<P>
   When she does, if the predictions are correct, there will be no
doubt be giant results. &QL;

CARDINALS TO TILLMAN: `EASY, FELLA' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF _ We are happy to report the Cardinals enjoyed a quiet
lunch Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, some veterans had worried that Pat Tillman might leap
from his chair in the cafeteria and run headlong into the yogurt
machine, or tackle a teammate as he carried a tray of soup.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches have spoken to the kid about his high-spiritedness. They
gently remind that this is only the first week of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Work on learning the X's and O's of free safety, they tell No.
40. Don't feel it necessary to rearrange the internal organs of
every wide receiver and running back who comes your way.
</P>
<P>
   Son, we're on the same side. These are your ``teammates.''
Someone could get hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Tillman, a bright fellow, nods in understanding. Then someone
shouts ``Hut!'' and a competitive toggle switch clicks in his head.
Juices flow. Pat's eyes become laser beams.
</P>
<P>
   Something inside him _ more than the calculated effort to
impress the coaches, although that's part of it _ takes over.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals saw it on film before they drafted him the seventh
round. Some of us are born to paint. Others to play concert piano.
Tillman was born to play football. He glories in the roughness of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of practice, the 5-foot-11, 200-pound defensive
back unloaded on four different players, hitting them with all he
had. The collisions brought to mind a fight scene in a ``Batman''
comic book, with Tillman providing the sound effects. POW! OOOMPH!
SPLAT! ARRGHH! &QL; 
 &QL; 
`Bad judgment' &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Cardinals saw more of the same Friday morning after rain clouds
chased the team into Walkup Skydome. During a skeleton drill,
fullback Cedric Smith caught a short pass and headed down the
sideline. When he met No. 40, Smith felt the reception all the way
down to his bones.
</P>
<P>
   Bracing himself, Tillman separated the runner from the ball. The
250-pound fullback sat upright on the turf, legs splayed like a kid
in a sandbox. For a moment he just sat there, surprised that
Tillman would deliver such a ferocious shot or stunned by the
force, or both. When he climbed to his feet, he was limping.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Tobin wasn't happy. At least not publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to see that,'' the coach said. ``If this was live
(a full scrimmage), I would love it. That's how you get people
hurt. Youthful exuberance is good. But he's not in college
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year doesn't know how
to respond when asked about his play. The rookie is wise enough to
know not to sound boastful. But he was born to play football. It
isn't his nature to apologize for playing the game all-out. As
teammate Aeneas Williams said, in the rookie's defense, it's ``the
only way he knows how.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat, how about the shot to Cedric?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was bad judgment,'' Tillman said. The TV cameramen
were smiling. ``I, uh, tried to protect myself.'' Was that true? Is
that what he wanted to say? ``I don't know,'' Tillman said,
finally. ``It's hard to answer that question.'' Then, ``The coaches
have to tell me I've gone too far.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Secretly smiling &QL; 
 &QL; 
They will, again. But you have to believe Tobin and his staff are
smiling behind closed doors. The rookie has something. What he has
can't be taught or instilled. ``An interesting player,'' Tobin
said. An instinctive player. A tireless player. Unafraid.
</P>
<P>
   Time will tell how quickly he can make the transition from
outside linebacker where he played at Arizona State to a position
where the Cardinals need help. Last month, Tillman served as an
instructor at Jake Plummer's kids summer camp in Boise, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ``I taught the DBs (defensive backs),'' Tillman said with a
smile. ``I haven't played the position, so they probably didn't get
their money's worth.''
</P>
<P>
   My guess is the Cardinals will. Pat Tillman has a lot to learn.
But no one needs to teach him how to run to the football. Or
encourage him to tackle. &QL;

REMAINING SENIOR FIELD EASY TO RECOGNIZE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When a field that started with 156 players
officially hit the midway cut point just before 8 p.m. Friday, the
63 weekend survivors included plenty of familiar names.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Floyd, the only player under par (2-under 140) led a
group that included legends Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus, former
USC star Dave Stockton and international standouts Isao Aoki, Hugh
Baiocchi, Vicente Fernandez, Brian Barnes and Simon Hobday.
Pre-tournament favorites Hale Irwin and Gil Morgan also advanced,
as did two-time senior player of the year Jim Colbert.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most visible players in golf also made the cut, as
television commentator Gary McCord advanced with a 74-74_148
showing that left him tied for 22nd.
</P>
<P>
   Qualifier update: Agoura Hills' Gary Klahn finished at 161 and
Simi Valley's Bill Brooks at 172, both failing to make the cut of
154.
</P>
<P>
   Sage advice: Midway-leader Floyd, who has not led a PGA Senior
Tour event after 36 holes since the 1996 Northville Long Island
Classic, has a simple rule for staying out of greenside kikuyu
trouble: Don't hit your approach shots into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might get lucky and get it up and down once or twice, but
it's going to get you in the long run,'' he said. ``So you have to
put your ball on the green.''
</P>
<P>
   Faces in the crowd: Ventura residents and longtime volunteers Cy
and Mary Bauer, working the media tent leaderboard again this week,
average about 12-15 professional tournaments a year and have been
familiar faces to PGA Tour, Senior PGA Tour and LPGA Tour players
since 1983. But Mary has not seen a pro swing a club in a
tournament since giving up greenside scorekeeping nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The best shots she's never seen? She has two favorites: the putt
that Bruce Devlin holed to win a rainy playoff in the 1995 FHP
Health Care Classic at Ojai and the putt that made Fernandez a
tearfully appreciative first-time senior tour winner in the '96
Burnet Senior Classic at Coon Rapids, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Week after week: Some television series have not lasted as long
as ``Duval,'' which is appearing on network TV for a second
straight weekend. In each episode, a different member of the Duval
family plays for a national golf championship.
</P>
<P>
   Today and Sunday on NBC, former club pro and second-year PGA
Senior Tour member Bob Duval can be seen contending for the U.S.
Senior Open title at Riviera. Last week on ABC, his son David _
leading money winner on the PGA Tour _ was seen playing in the
British Open at Royal Birkdale.
</P>
<P>
   More Duval: Bob Duval, who made this week's cut by a stroke with
a 79-74_153, doesn't yield much to his long-hitting son when it
comes to distance off the tee. The elder Duval ranked third in
senior tour driving, averaging 277.7 yards coming into the U.S.
Senior Open and led the 156-man field in Thursday's opening round
with an average of 272.0.
</P>
<P>
   50-year reunion: The USGA is hosting a national championship at
Riviera for the first time since 1948, when Ben Hogan won his first
U.S. Open at the Pacific Palisades course. Hogan, who shot 276 to
win by two strokes over Jimmy Demaret, earned $2,000 for his
victory _ $265,500 less than this week's winner will receive.
</P>
<P>
   Riviera getting tougher: When Hogan won the 1948 U.S. Open, the
field's 54 cut survivors finished with just 21 rounds in the 60s
during their four rounds. Hogan had three, including a
tournament-best 67.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's 63 cut survivors have totaled one round in the
60s _ the 68 Hale Irwin shot on Friday. &QL;

VAUGHN BOOED AS SOX BOW TO JAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Distractions? What distractions?
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with the Red Sox _ from manager Jimy Williams to general
manager Dan Duquette to shortstop Nomar Garciaparra _ would insist
they knew nothing, saw nothing, and heard nothing inflammatory in
the aftermath of Mo Vaughn's comments that on the whole, he'd
rather be in Toronto next season.
</P>
<P>
   But if you glanced at the Fenway Park scoreboard Friday night
after six innings _ from which glared a 10-0 Toronto lead _ or
heard the lusty boos Vaughn received from the crowd of 33,139 when
he was introduced during the announcement of the lineups, you would
have thought otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's latest comments seemed to cause a big-time distraction,
indeed.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox almost succeeded in taking some of the heat off their
first baseman with another stirring comeback, but this one fell
short as they lost to the Blue Jays, 10-6.
</P>
<P>
   A night after rallying from a five-run deficit for an 8-7,
10-inning win, the Sox came up empty when Damon Buford's drive to
right faded on the warning track, 2 or 3 feet from the bullpen wall
and a tie game, as he just missed his second grand slam in as many
nights.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn declined to comment after the game, saying, ``I've got
nothing to say, gentlemen,'' before hurriedly dressing and
departing the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm not deaf,'' said Williams when asked about Vaughn's
reception from the fans. ``If I were, I'd have a hearing aid and
I'd have it off. We just move on. We're just trying to win games. I
can't control the other things. I feel good about the way he's
playing, swinging the bat. Those other things I can't control.
These kids just keep coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as they had in erasing a 6-1 eighth-inning deficit
Thursday, the Sox got started late, doing all their scoring in the
last three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto starter Juan Guzman (5-12), who took the mound feeling
poorly, went 6 1/3 innings, allowed four hits, and was charged with
three unearned runs in the seventh. But by then, he owned a 10-run
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pitched outstanding for about seven or eight games,''
said Toronto manager Tim Johnson. ``Finally, we got him some runs,
and you saw what he did. He was a little under the weather today,
and that's why I took him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sox starter Steve Avery was taken out because his pitching was
under the weather. He spotted the Blue Jays a 2-0 lead in the
first, then gave up a 377-foot homer to Ed Sprague and allowed two
more runs on Shannon Stewart's two-run, bases-loaded single up the
middle during Toronto's six-run fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``After (Thursday) night's win, I would've liked to come out and
kept the momentum going for us,'' said Avery (7-3, 5.18), who again
struggled to find the proper slot on his release point. ``But I
just couldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither could relievers Rich Garces and Dennis Eckersley, who
made his first appearance since May 31 after a seven-week stint on
the disabled list to heal a right shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   Garces relieved Avery in the fourth and inherited two runners.
They weren't on base long as Jose Canseco blasted a towering
three-run shot that sailed 422 feet into the gloaming in left
field, where it struck the Coke bottle and fell back to earth. Hey,
Jose, have a Coke and a smile. It was homer No. 28 for the former
Sox slugger.
</P>
<P>
   Eckersley took over at the start of the fifth but was unable to
stop the hemorrhaging. He yielded a two-run homer to Tony Phillips
that gave Toronto its 10-0 lead. ``I felt great,'' Eck said. ``But
I threw a changeup he hit out. (Expletive) that changeup.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first three pitchers they trotted out gave up homers,
the Sox turned to veteran lefthander David West, summoned from
Pawtucket Friday in the sixth. He issued back-to-back walks to
Carlos Delgado and Mike Stanley but got out of the jam when he
induced Tony Fernandez to fly to right and struck out Sprague and
Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the huge deficit and a growing crescendo of boos every
time Vaughn appeared at the plate, the Red Sox began to claw back
in the seventh, parlaying one hit and a pair of errors by second
baseman Craig Grebeck into the three runs.
</P>
<P>
   DH Midre Cummings halved Toronto's lead in the eighth with a
two-run homer off reliever Bill Risley.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the ninth, and a chance at redemption for Vaughn. With
two men on, he rapped a run-scoring single up the middle off Robert
Person that scored Keith Mitchell. After Garciaparra reached on a
fielder's choice, Billy Ashley, in the game for left fielder Troy
O'Leary, drew a walk to load the bases for Buford, who came a few
feet shy of turning the tide.
</P>
<P>
   For the Red Sox. And for Vaughn.

 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1993, the Mississippi River surged past its
levees and drowned Valmeyer, Ill., population 900, under 20 feet of
water. One of the people made homeless in the flood was Russell
Eugene Weston Jr., the 41-year-old suspect in Friday's killings at
the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The entire town was relocated. For three years, its people lived
in an emergency settlement, packed into trailers. Some of them
derisively called their temporary town Femaville, for the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, the government service that promised
to help them.
</P>
<P>
   Weston, a blue-eyed, blond-haired man who never settled down,
began drifting away, neighbors in Valmeyer said on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boy relocated to Montana,'' said one, Denise Fisher, who
lived about a quarter-mile from where Weston and his parents had
their home. Weston, known to neighbors as Rusty or Junior, left
town in a 13-year-old Chevrolet pickup, although he returned from
time to time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rusty was a loner; he didn't have many, if any, friends,''
said a neighbor from Valmeyer, who identified herself as Mrs. Henry
Rahe and said that she attended church with Weston's parents and
that the community was devastated by the shootings at the Capitol
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, months before the government finished building a new
Valmeyer, Weston was questioned by law-enforcement authorities in
Illinois and in Montana, where he owned a small plot of land where
he panned for gold, about having made threatening statements
directed at government officials, including President Clinton,
federal officials said on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Those statements included a variety of paranoid ramblings about
the power of the government, fantasies about the Central
Intelligence Agency and an accusation that federal officials had
planted land mines on his Montana property, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The statements were strong enough to attract the attention of
the Secret Service, they said. Weston was questioned by the Secret
Service in April 1996, they said, and the agency's Presidential
Protective Detail has maintained a file on him ever since.
</P>
<P>
   That May, the Secret Service classified him as a probably
harmless but potentially dangerous man, law-enforcement officials
said on Friday night. The Secret Service made that assessment after
reviewing interviews with Weston conducted by local mental health
authorities, they said.
</P>
<P>
   So Weston's name was filed away among those of thousands of
Americans who have delusions about the government, its power and
its nature, they said. If he ever showed up in Washington in any
way that registered officially, the Secret Service would take
notice.
</P>
<P>
   Weston's Montana property is in the little town of Rimini, a
collection of old homes and cabins about 15 miles west of Helena on
a dirt road. A neighbor there, Kenneth Moore, agreed on Friday that
Weston's conduct had often seemed paranoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to convince him that the government wasn't after
him,'' Moore said. ``He wasn't wild or agitated, just paranoid. He
claimed the government was listening in on his conversations with
my satellite dish. He said people were prowling around his cabin,
but I never saw anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, though, Weston was in Valmeyer. He left there that
day heading east and carrying his father's old .38-caliber Smith &AMP;
Wesson, government officials said on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, he drove to the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``He parked off to one side, and he came through the Capitol,''
said Rep. Bill Thomas, a California Republican who heads the House
Oversight Committee, which oversees House security and works with
the Capitol Police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Weston went around the magnetometer,'' the metal detector,
Thomas said. ``There was an exchange of gunfire'' in which Officer
Jacob Chestnut was fatally shot.
</P>
<P>
   He approached ``a door that says, `Private. Do Not Enter,' a
door that goes to the back hallway of Majority Whip Tom DeLay's
office,'' Thomas said. Then he shot Officer John Gibson, also
fatally, and was shot in return, apparently four times. Sen. Bill
Frist of Tennessee, a heart surgeon, massaged his heart and pumped
his chest.
</P>
<P>
   In Valmeyer on Friday, Susan Stanka, a neighbor of the Weston
family, said that property there had been reappraised since the
flooding and that the resulting increase in taxes had been a source
of anger throughout the community. Her own taxes are up $400 this
year, Ms. Stanka said, a hardship for someone on a fixed income.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, many townsfolk gathered at a tavern, the
Fountain Inn, to watch television accounts of the events at the
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the evening, as the sun was setting over the
Mississippi, a police car drove up to the Weston family home, near
a set of railroad tracks where a train of grain and coal cars was
rumbling by.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Monroe County sheriff was talking with the father on the
front porch to break the news to him,'' said Mrs. Fisher, one of
the neighbors. The father, Russell Sr., a local Democratic Party
committeeman, is 66, and looked ``elderly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had his head drooped,'' she said, ``and walking toward the
police he looked kind of sad.''

VAUGHN FEELS HE'S FINISHED IN BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Three months before he will have the right to walk away of his
own volition as a free agent, Mo Vaughn all but declared that his
career with the Red Sox is over.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in a TV interview by Channel 4's Steve Burton Friday
whether he has seen his last days in Boston, Vaughn said,
``Honestly, I think I have. And it's a shame to say, but I think I
have. I think I have for the wrong reasons, but sometimes, you
know, things don't go the way you want to go, either.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, general manager Dan Duquette said Friday
night, the team is prepared to move on. But Duquette said it was
``doubtful'' the club would attempt to deal Vaughn before next
Friday's trading deadline. If Vaughn leaves as a free agent,
Duquette said, the money the club would have spent to re-sign him
will be used to sign other players.
</P>
<P>
   Until October, apparently, the best-case scenario will be an
uneasy truce between a team and its star slugger in the midst of a
playoff chase after one of the most bizarre nights in Red Sox
annals since Buddy LeRoux's attempted palace coup on Tony C in
1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Roger) Clemens left, and it took a while to replace him, but
we did with Pedro Martinez,'' said Duquette, who took the unusual
step of appearing on Channel 68, the Red Sox' flagship station, in
the middle of Friday night's game to answer questions about
Vaughn's situation. ``If (Vaughn) doesn't want to stay here, the
Red Sox organization is prepared to move on. Ten million dollars
will get you a pretty good hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette acknowledged, as he has in the past, that the team
asked Vaughn to sumbit to an alcohol evaluation after he was
charged with drunken driving last January in connection with his
accident on Interstate 95, charges of which Vaughn was later
cleared.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were concerned about the use of alcohol in a potentially
fatal incident,'' said Duquette, who would not say whether other
incidents had contributed to the club's concerns about Vaughn. ``We
requested he undergo evaluation for alcohol dependency.''
</P>
<P>
   But Duquette denied claims made by Vaughn Friday that the team
has had him followed by private investigators and that the Sox ever
raised the issue of drug use with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not personal,'' Duquette said. ``We made several
efforts to re-sign him. He's looking for more money. There isn't
anything personal about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``To accuse the organization of (using) a private investigator?
No one in the organization has ever considered that. And
insinuations regarding narcotics and crack houses? We've never done
that. I have no idea where that's coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, asked Friday about published comments that he would
prefer to play for the Toronto Blue Jays over returning to the Red
Sox next season, had said, ``What would you do if you played for an
organization that tried to get you to take an alcoholic evaluation?
What would you do if they had a private investigator following you
around? What would you do if they brought up the issue of
narcotics? That's not my style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got these kids to deal with,'' added Vaughn, referring to
his status as a community role model. ``It's not about the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I said, there's many, many things that go along with this
contract situation besides just the dollar amount. There's a lot of
bad blood, and that's what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that bad blood spilled into the stands, where a sellout
crowd of 33,139 in Fenway Park greeted Vaughn with the loudest
booing he has heard in his seven years with the team. The
atmosphere was not improved by the 10-6 beating inflicted on the
Red Sox by the Blue Jays, Vaughn's self-identified team of choice
for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing to say gentlemen,'' Vaughn said after the game.
``I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jimy Williams acknowledged that he had heard the booing
of his star slugger. ``I'm not deaf,'' he said. ``I don't wear a
hearing aid. We're just trying to win a game. I can't control the
other stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Channel 4 that was aired less than an hour
before Friday night's game, Vaughn again addressed his belief that
the club suspected him of drug use, echoing his prediction this
spring that the team would launch a ``smear campaign'' against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you play if there had been people talking about
narcotics use and, you know, affiliations with crack houses and all
different types of things?'' Vaughn said. ``Would you play under
those circumstances? If it were for $25 million a year?''
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Vaughn said he was on the verge of signing a
three-year deal with the team worth close to $30 million, but talks
broke off when the Red Sox signed newcomer Martinez to a six-year,
$75 million deal. Negotiations took an ugly turn after Vaughn's
arrest in January and his subsequent refusal to undergo an alcohol
evaluation. That prompted the club to propose a two-year deal in
spring training, which was immediately turned down.
</P>
<P>
   At the All-Star Game in Denver, Duquette made another offer,
this one for four years and $37 million. That, too, was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's agents had no comment Friday night, but sources
familiar with the year-long negotiations said that at no time did
the Red Sox raise the issue of drugs with Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates either declined comment or were generally supportive.
``He's a tough guy,'' said catcher Scott Hatteberg when asked about
the crowd's reaction. ``He has thick skin. I can't say enough good
things about him and I wish he was understood.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams responded tersely to questions about Vaughn's status.
``Mo's a professional,'' Williams said. ``He'll go play and he'll
try to win a game tonight. That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last week in Boston, presumably after Vaughn
erupted at Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy, Duquette said he had
met with Vaughn and recommended that the first baseman set aside
contract issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's regrettable he has seen a need, that he feels compelled
to discuss his contract at this point,'' Duquette said.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette intimated that Vaughn was emboldened to raise the
subject by the presence of the Blue Jays and former teammates
Clemens and Jose Canseco.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a couple of these outbursts with the Toronto ball
club around,'' Duquette said.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn will have 15 days after the season to file for free
agency. The Sox then would have about another month to negotiate
with him before losing that right. In 1996, the Clemens
negotiations went down to the December deadline before the pitcher
announced he had signed with the Blue Jays. That scenario, one
Duquette had vowed would not repeat itself with Vaughn, appears
likely to do exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to have Mo stay,'' Duquette said, ``but he will have
earned the right to be a free agent at the end of the year. If he's
not interested in playing baseball in Boston, I'm sure there will
be other clubs that will sign him and the Red Sox will move on.''

IMMINENT PARTING POOR REFLECTION ON SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Next year is already impossible. He'll be far from Boston by
then. The only No. 42 we'll see in Fenway Park on July 25, 1999, is
the ironic one that now hovers above right field, a blue-and-white
tribute to Jackie Robinson. No, Mo Vaughn will not call this park
home next year. He may not even make it to next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lone glimmer in the seedy tale of Red Sox vs. Mo: We
will never have to read about another contract squabble between
Vaughn and Dan Duquette-John Harrington. There will be no more
squabbles because there will be no more offers. This relationship
is finished. Divorce court is now based on Yawkey Way.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about the first-inning boos during Friday night's 10-6
loss to the Blue Jays. You knew they were going to cling to Vaughn
as soon as he approached the batter's box. And forget about Vaughn
waving at a Juan Guzman sinker, simultaneously striking out and
raising the anger of 33,139 people.
</P>
<P>
   The organization should be concerned that its best player stood
in a hallway, teary-eyed, and told Channel 4's Steve Burton that
the Sox have accused him of associating with crack dealers; that he
feels he is being followed by private investigators hired by the
team; that he is still angered by their request that he take
alcohol evaluation tests; and, yes, that he told a reporter from
Toronto he wants to play there next season.
</P>
<P>
   Those who were privy to negotiations say drug issues never came
up during contract talks. And Duquette denied that the team was or
is having Vaughn followed. But some friends of Vaughn insist the
team was having its slugger followed early in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Friday Duquette and Vaughn were only a few feet away from each
other in the Sox locker room. They did not speak. The general
manager was asked if he planned to speak with Vaughn. ``No,'' he
said. Friday night Vaughn dressed quickly and joked that he may not
be allowed in the building.
</P>
<P>
   At least he wants to be in the building, probably the most
telling note of this rift. Duquette said the $10 million Vaughn
rejected can bring the team a good hitter. He's right. But since
when is build-and-destroy the sanest route to general managing? The
Sox like to tell you they got Pedro Martinez when they lost Roger
Clemens. I say: Why did it have to be either/or? Both of them would
have been nice. That may not have been financially reasonable, but
the fact is that championship teams don't ``replace'' good players
with good players to get better; they add to the players they
already have. But that's the least of the problems here.
</P>
<P>
   I have always maintained that Duquette would be haunted by his
quote _ ``The Red Sox are back in business'' _ after trading for
Martinez in November. What kind of business is this? It doesn't
make sense that three years ago, Vaughn was the model of what a
professional athlete is supposed to be. After he won the American
League's Most Valuable Player Award, the team held a press
conference on Blue Hill Avenue at Vaughn's youth center. How many
pro athletes spend time on Blue Hill Avenue talking with children?
The Sox actually had a man who made black kids want to sport the
scrolled ``B,'' not an easy task when you consider that a trip to
Fenway is like being caught in the middle of a whiteout.
</P>
<P>
   It will not surprise me if Vaughn announces at his Toronto press
conference that he has signed a four-year contract worth $37
million, the same numbers the Sox offered him earlier this month.
In Boston, he wanted respect before he wanted market value. The Sox
have given him neither. You will not find many 30-year-old black
men not from Boston who claim to love the city. That's a fact.
Perception rules, and many blacks outside New England still view
Boston as the First City of Racism. It's not an accurate label,
considering that this country is rife with racial problems (see
Jasper, Texas). But it's there. Still. The fact that alcohol and
crack have been mentioned during this time is hurting the Sox.
Because of this, they have put themselves in a dangerous position:
They will forever be known as the organization that has a problem
with black players.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn came to town in 1991 and said he was willing to face a
city with a tough racial reputation and an organization plagued by
racial warts. There was the rejection of Robinson in 1945. There
were no black players here until 1959, when the Sox became the last
team in the majors to integrate (even the Bruins had a black player
before them). There were negative comments from Reggie Smith and
Tommy Harper. There was only one black Sox player early in '91
(Ellis Burks). And now a black man who was willing to say he loved
Boston is run out of town, feeling his employers think he
associates with crack dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Think about that. Now ask yourself: If you were a black major
leaguer, would you come to Boston after seeing what happened to
Vaughn? Not only wouldn't I do it, I would tell other players to
stay away, too. Thirty-seven million or one hundred thirty-seven
million; it wouldn't matter. Not many respectable people will sell
their souls for the right to be disrespected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me ask you this,'' Vaughn said early Friday. ``What would
you do if they brought up the issue of narcotics? That's not my
style. I've got these kids to deal with (as far as his reputation).
It's not about the money.''
</P>
<P>
   For once, it's not about the money. And it's not completely
about race. Take all sentiment aside and ask yourself: How do you
feel about losing a hitter capable of batting .300-plus
(lefthanded) with 35 home runs and 125 RBIs? And this: If you were
one of the people applauding Vaughn for selflessly embracing cancer
patients four years ago, do you really believe he suddenly morphed
into a '90s player, obsessed with cash?
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad. Mo Vaughn will be gone soon, leaving two No. 42s
as Fenway memories. The Sox are back in business. And it's a sad
day in Boston.

RICE JABS AT FORMER TEAMMATE'S CRITICISM  
 BUT ALSO ADMITS TO HAVING `VERY BAD YEAR' IN '97 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD

<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF _ Simeon Rice has a message for the critic Eric Hill,
the former Cardinals middle linebacker who has ripped Rice in
several recent interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric Hill had a great season; we went 4-12,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   The sarcasm came without a wink.
</P>
<P>
   Rice said he doesn't care that Hill questioned his off-season
work habits (Rice played in the United States Basketball League
last summer) or that Hill blamed him for much of the team's
defensive struggles a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said opponents figured they could run at Rice and did so
with success. The Cardinals finished 27th in the NFL against the
run last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's got an opinion,'' Rice said. ``I take that as kind
of a compliment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a point. Looking back at it, I had a very bad year. But
I'm looking to the future . . . Me having my worst season and him
having his best _ who would you roll with?''
</P>
<P>
   Rice, the third player chosen in the 1996 draft, tied an NFL
record with 12{ sacks his rookie season. He had five last year.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Vince Tobin said Rice was hurt by missing all but the
first day of training camp a year ago because of a viral infection
that was first diagnosed as altitude sickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``My play did hurt the team; that's true,'' Rice said. ``If I
had a really good (training) camp, even had a camp or would have
been healthy . . . things would have gone right. But that never
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   This year is the first time Rice has been at training camp for
two consecutive days of practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work is invaluable,'' Tobin said. ``That's where you get
your fundamentals, and he never had advantage of training camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice, who didn't play basketball this summer, said he thinks his
hard work in the off-season will help him have his best year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to position myself as one of the dominant players, the
premier, dominant players of the '90s and to the next millennium,
to take this team to new heights,'' Rice said. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ The Diamondbacks re+eaved a scare Friday night
against the Los Angeles Dodgers when rookie first baseman  &UR; Travis
Lee was forced to leave the game because of a strained left groin.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who was replaced in the lineup by  &UR; Brent Brede, &UR; will
e(evaluated further today, and his status is day to day. Lee missed
two games in mid-May because of a strained right hamstring.

   Friday night's injury occurred in the bottom of the third
inning. The Dodgers had scored two runs, and  &UR; Juan Castro was at
second base with two outs.

COYOTES RE-SIGN TRIO  
 FIVE REMAIN UNSIGNED; TALKS RE SUME WITH TKACHUK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Right wing Dallas Drake avoided salary arbitration by agreeing
to terms with the Coyotes on a two-year contract worth $2.1
million.
</P>
<P>
   A restricted Group II free agent, Drake, 29, will earn $1
million next season and $1.1 million the next after earning
$600,000 in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, defensemen Deron Quint and Jason Doig also signed new
deals. Quint received a multiyear contract. Doig accepted the
team's one-year qualifying offer. Terms were undisclosed on both
deals.
</P>
<P>
   Drake was scheduled for an arbitration hearing on Aug. 3, but
both sides felt all along they could hammer out a deal beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   The signing of the three leaves the Coyotes with five unsigned
free agents: defenseman Keith Carney, center Bob Corkum, left wing
Louie DeBrusk, right wing Shane Doan and goalie Scott Langkow.
</P>
<P>
   Corkum and DeBrusk are the only other Phoenix players to have
filed for salary arbitration. Corkum's hearing date is set for Aug.
7. DeBrusk's is Aug. 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making good progress with most of these guys,'' Coyotes
General Manager Bobby Smith said. ``I expect to have continued
talks with Corkum right up to his arbitration hearing, and we'll
have more contact with DeBrusk's agent as well. We've had ongoing
discussions with Keith Carney, but there is still a significant gap
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Carney, who made $700,000 last season, was seeking a multiyear
deal worth at least $1.4 million and now probably will be more
based on recent free-agent signings around the league. &QL; 
Tkachuk talks resume
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a month of silence, discussions between Smith and
the agent for captain Keith Tkachuk resumed when the two sides
talked at length Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Smith broke off talks indefinitely regarding a contract
extension for the Phoenix captain on July 1 after Tkachuk and agent
Bob Murray rejected the team's three-year extension worth a total
of $33 million over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good conversation,'' Murray said Friday. ``We didn't
talk dollars, but the lines of communication are back open, which
is good, and we'll continue to talk. Nothing productive or
constructive happened . . . but hopefully, we can move ahead a
little bit now.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Murray will speak again next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a point of saying, `Let's not be so foolish as to say
who's going to pick up the phone and call first,' '' Smith said.
``It was a good conversation, but we're still a long way from a
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk, who has two years remaining on his current deal worth
$2.8 million this coming season and $3 million the next, reportedly
wants a restructured deal upward of $8 million a year. &QL; 
Essensa doubtful
</P>
<P>
   Smith confirmed he made a pitch to sign Edmonton free-agent
goalie Bob Essensa as a backup, but said Friday he expects the
former Winnipeg Jet to re-sign with the Oilers, possibly for less
than what Phoenix offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spoke with (agent) Mike Liut, and we talked about it, but
my feeling now is he'll end up back in Edmonton,'' Smith said. ``We
weren't willing to pay him what he thinks he's worth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes reportedly offered Essensa a $400,000 contract that
could escalate in price if certain incentives, including games
played, were met.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than I made last year, so it's pretty good in that
sense,'' Essensa, who made $300,000 in 1997-98, said Friday of the
Phoenix offer. ``We'll see what happens, but I've always said
Edmonton was my first choice, so we wouldn't cut them out of the
equation.''
</P>
<P>
   As for returning to the Oilers for a third season, Liut said,
``It looks like that's the direction we're heading in, yes.'' &QL;

WILL NEW FACES BRING NEW RESULTS?  
 CARDS REVAMP DISAPPOINTING BACK FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF _ Adrian Murrell, meet Mario Bates. Mario, say hello
to Michael Pittman. Michael, here's Eric Metcalf. And, of course,
you all know Larry Centers, don't you?
</P>
<P>
   During these early days of training camp, the Cardinals
offensive backs ought to be wearing those ``Hi, My Name Is . . .''
stickers on their shoulder pads.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Cardinals played running back by committee. A
wise guy might suggest that it was a committee of none. Considering
that the club had the league's worst rushing attack _ 78 yards a
game _ and that the ballcarriers primarily responsible for that are
gone, even the Cardinals seemed to agree.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a new season and a new committee. A more experienced,
more instinctive, more competent committee, if such a conclusion
can be drawn on the basis of two days in pads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly think we've upgraded the position,'' Cardinals
Coach Vince Tobin said. ``We've got four guys who we think are
capable of carrying the ball in this league. Now we'll let the
cream rise to the top.''
</P>
<P>
   At the top is Murrell, who creamed AFC East foes for more than
1,000 rushing yards each of the past two seasons before he was
traded to the Cardinals. He becomes what new offensive coordinator
Marc Trestman calls ``our featured'' back.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our primary objectives in camp is to establish the
threat of the run, and Adrian certainly is capable of giving us
that,'' Trestman said.
</P>
<P>
   For Murrell, it's simply nice to be wanted. After New York Jets
Coach Bill Parcells signed free agent Curtis Martin, Murrell's days
as the Jets' featured back were over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the West Coast offense before,'' Murrell said.
``I know what it's about.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot that goes into a running game. It starts with
the scheme, and Marc has a good one. He knows what he's doing. That
helps. He's got some tricks up his sleeve. The guys up front in the
line help. Then the line and the backs have to mesh together. With
all of our new backs that is what we are working on in camp. Even
though it is a new group, it is an experienced group that's been
around and knows the game.''
</P>
<P>
   With Murrell in his sixth season and Bates in his fifth, ``we're
much further along at running back than we were a year ago,''
according to Tobin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murrell is what we thought he was, an experienced guy who is
smart and can make people miss,'' Tobin said. ``Mario has had one
good year in this league, but as far as talent he has a lot. Plus,
he is big and strong, and now he's back home.''
</P>
<P>
   Talent never has been an issue with Bates, who grew up in Tucson
and played at Arizona State. It always was whether he had the
motivation to use it.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving ASU early for the pros, he ran for 1,530 yards in
his first two seasons with the Saints. That production dropped to
1,024 the past two seasons combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys sometimes get labels put on them that stick,'' Bates
said. ``But I guess everybody needs to be kicked in the butt
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said he sat down with Bates before he signed on as a free
agent to discuss Bates' reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I laid it out for him to the best of my ability,'' Tobin said.
``I do that with all free agents to the point that if they don't
like it they can go somewhere else. I talked to Mario about a lot
of my concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like what I've seen of him so far. He has caught the
football a lot better than I had been led to believe he could. He's
picked up the system. I'm encouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   Pittman, a fourth-round draft pick from Fresno State, is pushing
Bates for the No. 2 spot. Metcalf, acquired in a trade from San
Diego, is primarily the return specialist and third wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we want to work Eric in at running back in passing
situations and on first down,'' Tobin said. ``If we can interchange
guys so the defense doesn't know if we're in a passing set or a
running set, that versatility will make us a more effective
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   At least for Metcalf, the numbers back up that thinking. In his
best season, he had 611 rushing yards in 1994 to go with 539
receiving and 882 return yards. In the past two seasons, however,
he has been used primarily as a receiver, rushing for 3 yards on
six carries.
</P>
<P>
   With Ron Moore, acquired late last season, trying to crack the
running back rotation, and with fullback Centers getting an
occasional carry to complement his pass receiving, the question
becomes whether there will be enough opportunities for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like 20 to 25 carries to really feel like I'm in rhythm,''
Murrell said. ``There's definitely enough to go around, though.
It's going to be important when you get an opportunity to go 110
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the tools here now to have a good running game.'' &QL;

HIGH-FLYING ORIOLES DOWN MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ On a lyrical summer evening by Chesapeake Bay, in
the same stadium where their 1997 season ended, the Mariners played
a game Friday night that had a hint of demise in 1998 in it.
</P>
<P>
   With Billy Swift off on another streak, Seattle lost to
Baltimore, 7-4, blowing a chance to pick up ground on both Texas
and Anaheim. After three losses in four games, the momentum Seattle
gained in the six-game winning streak after the All-Star break has
dissipated, and the M's must get it back against the teeth of their
schedule in the next 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get going,'' said Alex Rodriguez. ``We have a very
challenging stretch ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Swift is streaking and so are the Orioles. Winners of 14 of
their last 15, Baltimore, given up for dead at the All-Star break,
is over .500 for the first time in more than two months and has
nosed within seven games of Boston in the American League wild card
race.
</P>
<P>
   Swift did not hang around the Mariner locker room to discuss his
four innings-plus, four that gave him a 9.77 earned-run average in
his last three starts. If Swift (9-6) has been a bonus for the
Mariners, he has also been curiously hot and cold.
</P>
<P>
   He began the year going 2-0 and 3.75 over four starts; followed
with 0-3 and 9.82 in his next four outings; and rebounded with his
best stretch of the season, going 6-1 with a 3.38 ERA in eight
starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy was OK,'' insisted Mariner catcher John Marzano, ``he
just made a couple of pitches he wasn't supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it didn't seem that Swift had his trademark sinker
working. He got fewer ground-ball outs (seven) than he allowed hits
(10). Worse, he yielded three home runs, two by Rafael Palmeiro and
another erasing a 2-0 lead by Rich Becker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two guys in their lineup win the ball game,'' groused Marzano.
``Freakin' guys were hittin' everything. Palmeiro hit a sinker away
for a home run and a cutter in.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it goes when you're 14-1 since the All-Star
break, agreed Palmeiro, who got his first multi-homer game of 1998.
He has 18 homers in his last 40 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Ray (Miller, the manager), my approach was going to be,
hit a couple of singles, because Swift has the sinker away,''
Palmeiro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evidently, he feels pretty comfortable against us,'' said
Mariner manager Lou Piniella, referring to Palmeiro. ``And at the
same time, we're probably not making as good pitches as we can
make.''
</P>
<P>
   Becker, a June castoff by the Mets, also hinted that he didn't
see Swift with his primary calling card.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told he was going to try to sink it away,'' said the
stumpy Becker, like Palmeiro a left-handed hitter. ``I was looking
away but he was coming in, so I don't know ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Against Mike Mussina, the pitcher who so dominated them in the
'97 playoffs, the Mariners got a quick grip on the game, breaking
ahead 2-0 in the first as Mussina expended 30 pitches. But Mussina
struck out Russ Davis with two on to avert further damage and
having allowed four hits, he gave up only another three before
exiting in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike, for some reason, really pitches well against us,'' said
Rodriguez. ``That's the least I've seen him throw fastballs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr., a career .130 hitter against Mussina, had a
double in the first but struck out his final three at-bats and
stayed put on 40 homers.
</P>
<P>
   Becker's two-run homer tied it in the second, and Palmeiro and
Marzano matched homers, making it a 3-3 game in the fifth.
Wednesday night, Marzano hit his second homer in a decade; this was
his second homer in three at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   But Palmeiro crushed the 19th-ever ball hit to Eutaw Street
beyond the right-field wall in the Oriole fifth for a two-run homer
and Becker took Heathcliff Slocumb to a near-grand slam in the
seventh, his double off the top of the left-field fence accounting
for two more runs and a 7-3 Baltimore lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was a festive night at Camden Yards. Fans wore floppy-orange
Oriole hats offered in a giveaway, and along with their team,
continued to scent the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we appreciate what it's like to be in this situation,''
Mussina said. ``I hope we don't take it for granted and get
lackadaisical.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners hope they haven't already.

LATEST DODGERS TRADE QUESTIONED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Everyone from several Dodgers players to the media
questioned why Tommy Lasorda made a trade with the San Diego
Padres, of all teams. Despite the criticism, the interim general
manager said Friday he will continue to do whatever it takes to
help his club.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers traded disgruntled reliever Jim Bruske to
divisional-rival San Diego for minor-league right-hander Widd
Workman on Thursday. The deal marked the first time the two
National League West clubs swapped players since 1969. Although
there were several other teams interested in Bruske, he
surprisingly landed with the division-leading Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda was not available to comment about the trade Thursday
since he was on his way to Cooperstown, N.Y., to take part in the
National Baseball Hall of Fame induction ceremony weekend.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Lasorda said he made the trade because pitcher Mike
Judd, who was recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque, has been
impressive and made Bruske expendable. Judd, who will be used as a
reliever, had a 2.30 ERA in his previous four outings with the
Dukes and struck out 10 Las Vegas batters on July 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``There always has to be a first time,'' Lasorda said over the
phone about trading with San Diego. ``I don't care who I deal with.
If it helps (San Diego), fine. But I don't want to be scared to
help this ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait and see attitude: The Dodgers' Eric Karros did notice that
divisional-rival San Francisco traded for outfielder Joe Carter,
closer Jose Mesa, infielder Shawon Dunston and pitcher Al Morman on
Thursday. But while the Giants netted some veterans, the Dodgers'
first baseman felt it didn't match the deal San Francisco
consummated with the Chicago White Sox on July 29 _ trade deadline
day _ last season.
</P>
<P>
   That deal sent six Giants prospects, including White Sox
starting shortstop Mike Caruso, to the White Sox for reliever
Roberto Hernandez and starters Wilson Alvarez and Danny Darwin. It
was instrumental in helping the Giants win the 1997 NL West title.
</P>
<P>
   Karros questioned how Carter would fit in the Giants' outfield
and get used to playing at 3Com Park, and the dealing of set-up
reliever Steve Reed, who had a 1.48 ERA, to Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, that was an awesome trade for the Giants,'' Karros
said. ``That trade was one-sided and it helped them win the
division. Is this (trade) going to have the same impact? Time will
tell. Looking at it right now, I can't imagine it.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc: Dodgers trainer Charlie Strasser wasn't certain whether
Eric Young will be able to return to action Tuesday. The second
baseman, who has been bothered by right quadriceps strain, is
eligible to come off the 15-day disabled list Monday, an
off-day.... Lasorda will be at Yankee Stadium today for the
Old-Timers' Game.... Arizona's Travis Lee left in the fourth inning
with a strained left groin and will be re-evaluated today.

PARK REMAINS SWEET AT HOME FOR DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Unbeknownst to Chan Ho Park, home is continuing to
be sweet to him.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander pushed his unbeaten home streak to 11 straight
decisions _ over a span of 17 starts _ allowing just one run and
tying a career-high with 11 in eight innings as the Dodgers beat
the Arizona Diamondbacks 3-1 Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Park (9-5) lasted eight innings and allowed only two hits before
closer Jeff Shaw came in to the ninth for his 29th save.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old Park is one win shy from tying the Los
Angeles-record held by Orel Hershiser, who won 12 straight home
decisions from Sept. 30, 1984-Oct. 2, 1985. Park's streak began
July 10, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know about the streak,'' said Park, who also fanned
11 on July 20, 1997 at Atlanta. ``Home games make me more
confident. The fans helped me feel more comfortable out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I had good balance when I was warming up in the
bullpen. Tonight, I was trying to throw the ball with more snap and
it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (53-50) moved a season-high three games over .500
for the third time this season. In the wild-card race, the Dodgers
are four games behind the Chicago Cubs, who were swept in a
doubleheader Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is home, where he likes the mound,'' Dodgers manager
Glenn Hoffman said about Park. ``And that is a big plus when he
does that at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers scored all the runs they needed with a three-run
third inning. Charles Johnson led off with a single off Arizona
starter Amaury Telemaco. One out later, Wilton Guerrero singled and
both Dodgers moved forward one base after a passed ball.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Castro, known more for his stellar defense, showed some
punch at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers shortstop hit a two-run double that scored Johnson
and Guerrero and gave the Dodgers a 2-0 lead in the third. Gary
Sheffield, who has reached base in 35 of the last 36 games,
followed with an RBI single that scored Castro and gave the Dodgers
a 3-0 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel more happy because people say I always contribute with
my glove and I contributed with my bat tonight,'' said Castro, who
is batting just .199.
</P>
<P>
   During the first 42/3 innings, Park did not allow a hit and
struck out seven Diamondbacks. But Arizona's Yamil Benitez ended
the Korean's good fortune by hitting a two-out home run _ his
second of the year _ to trim the Dodgers' lead to 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Park) didn't let (Benitez's home run) get to him,'' said
Johnson, the Dodgers' catcher who added that Park's fastball was
``explosive. He rebounded and threw an outstanding game.''
</P>
<P>
   Telemaco (3-4) pitched a decent game but was overshadowed by
Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pitched better than me,'' said Telemaco, who allowed three
runs on eight hits in seven innings. ``That's why he won the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The game seemed to be safe for Park when Shaw took the mound
fresh from a day of rest. Although Park was going strong, Hoffman
was only going to let him pitch the ninth if the Dodgers had scored
in the eighth, which they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Danny Klassen put some fear in the Dodgers by leading
off with a single to bring the tying run to the plate. But a double
play and a Devon White ground out ended Park's duty.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, who has earned a save in each of his last four
appearances, said, ``I expect to be called every night. When the
phone rings (in the bullpen), I jump up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Park pitched good out there tonight and I just wanted to come
in and close the door.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A gunman who had been investigated by the Secret
Service burst into the Capitol on Friday afternoon, officials said,
and killed two police officers in a corridor shootout that left a
tourist and the gunman lying wounded as terrified bystanders darted
for cover.
</P>
<P>
   Without uttering a word, the intruder stormed past a weapons
detector at an East Front entrance about 3:40 p.m. and immediately
opened fire, mortally wounding a Capitol Police officer on guard
duty and setting off a gun battle by the office suite of Rep. Tom
DeLay, the Texas Republican and majority whip.
</P>
<P>
   As the first officer, Jacob Chestnut, lay dying, DeLay's
plainclothes Capitol Police guard, Special Agent John Gibson, drew
his weapon and intercepted the intruder a short distance into the
building. As screams and gunfire reverberated through the halls of
power, Gibson suffered mortal wounds before the gunman was brought
down in a burst of a score or more bullets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't expect someone to come in with guns blazing,'' John
P. Feehery, DeLay's spokesman, said after the gunman was felled in
a matter of minutes in a bloody exchange near the legislator's
office and a gift shop busy with tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman was identified as Russell Eugene Weston Jr., 41,
described by the authorities as a man with a criminal record and a
history of mental disturbance who had been on the Secret Service's
watch list of hundreds of possibly troublesome individuals after
reports that he had made threatening remarks about President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many people the Secret Service has investigated,
Weston was not considered a major danger, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Weston's driver's license listed his address as in Valmeyer,
Ill., according to the police, who said he also had recent ties to
Helena, Mont. Authorities said he had used a six-shot .38-caliber
Smith &AMP; Wesson revolver in his attack, a 29-year-old handgun they
said was taken from his father in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``The carpet in our office is covered in blood,'' Tim Berry, 30,
a policy adviser to DeLay, said in describing the scene as the
gunman, in khaki pants and a green fedora with a feather, was
finally shot down. ``Ten police officers surrounded the suspect
with guns trained at his head.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry was drinking champagne and celebrating the passage of
health care legislation with members of DeLay's staff in the
congressman's suite of offices when the gunman burst into the
Capitol, about 30 yards from DeLay's inner office. Some of the
aides dived under desks, others darted for the back of the suite.
</P>
<P>
   The incident began shortly after both Senate and House had ended
their debating business for the week. Alerted in minutes about the
casualties, Sen. Bill Frist, a Tennessee Republican who is a heart
surgeon, rushed from the Senate offices in the northern end of the
Capitol, administering to one of the dying police officers as well
as to the gunman.
</P>
<P>
   The police later reported that the gunman had been shot twice in
the chest but was not in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was focused on keeping their heart and lungs going,'' Frist
said later, after riding with emergency workers to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very serious catastrophe,'' he added, speaking
shortly before the extent of the incident was confirmed by the
lowering of the Capitol flag to half-staff in honor of the two
police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The tourist injured in the crossfire, identified by the police
as 24-year-old Angela Dickerson, was listed in serious condition
with wounds in the face and shoulder.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   There was potential for far greater mayhem, for the gunman had
rushed past the weapons detector at one of the Capitol's main
public entrances, the Document Door passage that opens past the
gift shop, with the historic Crypt area beyond, below the Great
Rotunda.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds of tourists at nearby turnings were suddenly propelled
into panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone was making a purchase and I heard shots to my right,''
said Tyvon Crawford, a 20-year-old student and employee at the
gift-shop kiosk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked, and jumped down into the booth, and then a tourist
jumped in with us. I was able to see downed bodies. The gunman came
in and fired one shot and security guards fired back at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Beamish, a 69-year-old tourist from Gloucester, England,
stood recalling the scene later, his pants stained with blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard the shots go off,'' he said. ``Everybody scattered. I
saw an officer hit the floor. I went over to him and felt his
pulse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was trying to say something to me,'' Beamish continued. ``I
yelled, `Get a stretcher!' There was blood coming from his head,
and one eye looked as if it were gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Just beyond, at the museum display cases on the Crypt floor,
Judson Threlkeld and his wife, Rachel, were studying Capitol
history when gunfire and screams startled them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard a bang,'' he said later. ``She dropped to the floor
and I got on top of her. There was a pause and we were afraid he
was going to come into the open space and start firing.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple ducked behind a pillar as the Capitol Police came
through. ``They yelled, `Get out! Get out!' and about 20 of us ran
out of the building.''
</P>
<P>
   Searching in grim hindsight, federal authorities said Weston had
a record of personal disturbances, including threatening statements
about government officials, and a variety of paranoid ramblings
about the power of the government.
</P>
<P>
   These included fantasies about the Central Intelligence Agency,
the authorities said, and an accusation that federal officials had
planted land mines on his Montana property.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of murder, Weston could face the death penalty
under federal law, which allows capital punishment in the death of
federal police officers. In gathering evidence, a Capitol Police
officer guarding the crime scene said on Friday night that
investigators might be aided by a video camera posted above the
Document Door entrance and that presumably taped much of the
shootout.
</P>
<P>
   The police said they arrested about 10 Capitol visitors a year
for carrying guns. The visitors usually have proper state permits
but do not realize that handguns are generally illegal in the
District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was about to depart for his Camp David retreat in
Maryland when the Capitol attack occurred about a mile to the east.
He was kept apprised, keeping to his schedule just as legislative
officials emphasized that the Capitol would be open on Saturday,
with no curtailing of its routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not shut down the Capitol,'' Rep. Bill Thomas,
R-Calif., said.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds of tourists stood on the Capitol steps as the shooting
went on in the building. In minutes, they saw emergency vehicles
and the police pour into the East Front parking area. They stood
transfixed as helicopters dropped down to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitol grounds were secured, and nobody was allowed to
leave until cleared by teams of investigators from the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, the Capitol Police and the Washington Metropolitan
Police, with the latter eventually assuming the lead role in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Some legislators were among the tourists as word spread about
the fatal shootout.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be out of your mind to do something like that,''
Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., said as the Capital was cordoned and vetted
as a crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Dan Nichols of the Capitol Police delivered the news that
two officers had died. ``This is a tough day for the United
States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The gun battle was the most serious in the Capitol since 1954,
before the era of weapons detectors, when three Puerto Rican
nationalists burst into the House and wounded five lawmakers. But
the building has been the scene of bombings, shootings and other
forms of mayhem since the early days of the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Weston was interviewed more than two years ago by Secret Service
investigators _ as hundreds of people have been _ and rated as a
minor problem, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Capitol on Friday night, from behind a barrier of
yellow police tape, police technicians could be seen still poring
over the first-floor entrance where the gunfire had erupted.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of small pieces of white tape were stuck to the floor as
investigators tried to reconstruct the gunman's lethal intrusion
into the heart of the nation's lawmaking citadel.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, he shot his way into the Capitol,'' said Rep. Thomas.

   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT &LR;  (``e'' code)
</P>
<P>
   ARTISTS-MIDDLE-CLASS (Undated) _ Artistic disgust with the
bourgeoisie has been a defining theme of modern Western culture.
Since Moliere lambasted the ignorant, nouveau riche bourgeois
gentleman, the bourgeoisie has been considered too clumsy to know
true art and love (Goethe), a Philistine with aggressively unsubtle
taste (Robert Schumann) and the creator of a machine-obsessed
culture doomed to be overthrown by the proletariat (Marx and
Engels). Flaubert was perhaps the most ruthless in his disgust,
calling himself a ``bourgeoisophobe.'' Generations of avant-gardes
have single-mindedly sought to shock the bourgeoisie and overturn
its retrograde tastes. In doing so, they have drawn the battle
lines for a century's esthetic battles. By Edward Rothstein.
</P>
<P>
   ANTHOLOGIES (Undated) _ What inevitably prompts the most
discussion about an anthology isn't what's put in, but what's left
out. Reviews of ``The Dictionary of Global Culture,'' (Alfred A.
Knopf, 1997) for example, ticked off the included and the excluded.
Schubert in, Schumann out; Homer in, Horace out; Franklin Roosevelt
in, Ronald Reagan out; Joe Louis in; Arthur Ashe out. By Robin
Pogrebin.
</P>
<P>
   TRANSLATION-DEBATE (Undated) _ In describing his craft, the
translator John Ciardi said that practitioners could try for ``no
more than the best possible failure.'' Yet scholarly translators
have split over how to achieve even that modest goal.
</P>
<P>
   EOS-MUSIC-REVIEW (New York) _ Lincoln Center Festival: EOS
Orchestra, ``Literally: Bernstein'': Jonathan Sheffer, conductor;
at Alice Tully Hall. Reviewed by James R. Oestreich.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SPORTS &LR;  (``s'' code)
</P>
<P>
   BBA-ARATON-COLUMN (New York) _ Sports of The Times column on
Yogi Berra and the Yankees. By Harvey Araton.
</P>
<P>
   TOUR-DE-FRANCE (Cap d'gde, France) _ The Tour de France is
unraveling in full view as three banned Festina riders admit that
they took performance-enhancing drugs, including the drug EPO.
Meanwhile, riders from a Dutch team are being questioned following
the discovery of drug paraphanalia and masking agents in their
hotel, and angry riders delay the start of Friday's stage. By
Samuel Abt.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (``i'' code)
</P>
<P>
   SUDAN-ASSESS (Nairobi, Kenya) _ Hunger has been a weapon of war
since Homer's time, but perhaps nowhere have starvation and food
supplies been so entwined with military tactics as in Sudan's
interminable civil war. By James C. McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-OBUCHI-PROFILE (Tokyo) _ For someone who has been plying
the treacherous waters of Japanese politics since 1963, Keizo
Obuchi has made scarcely a ripple. He is not identified with any
major government policies, has no memorable personality traits, and
has not been tarred by any scandals. Yet political experts here say
it is precisely Obuchi's unobtrusive style that brought him to the
top of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party and has made him the
designated successor to Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. By Mark
Landler.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (``w'' code)
</P>
<P>
   CAPITOL-SHOOTING-RDP (Washington) _ Two police officers are
killed and two people, including the gunman, are injured in a
shootout near the Majority Whip's office in the Capitol Building.
By Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL GENERAL &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   NC-BAPTISTS-WOMEN (Raleigh, N.C.) _ Like others here in the
prestigious, influential First Baptist Church of Raleigh, Mabel
Claire Maddrey cannot understand why, in 1998, any woman would vote
to sacrifice the independence of other women. The 184-year-old
church, a mainstream Baptist church but one that has historically
included women in leadership roles, is expected to vote sometime in
the next few months to break from the Southern Baptist Convention,
the nation's largest Protestant denomination. By Rick Bragg.
</P>
<P>
   NY-COLLAPSE-RDP (New York) _ New details on the scaffolding
collapse, including that an investigator who has been at the site
describes how unstable the structure is _ that the scaffolding is
being held up by the elevator tower, instead of the other way
around.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SCIENCE &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BREAST-IMPLANTS (Washington) _ A panel of experts convened
by the Institute of Medicine hear testimony by women who say they
have been injured by silicone breast implants. By Sheryl Gay
Stolberg.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINANCIAL &LR;  (``f'' code)
</P>
<P>
   TVDINNER-TRANSFORM (Cherry Hill, N.J.) _ Vlasic, which was spun
off from Campbell Soup a year ago, is trying to revitalize a group
of food businesses that its old parent company decided it did not
need. Some analysts think the effort could produce healthy profits.
By Constance L. Hays.
</P>
<P>
   AIRLINE-COMPETITION (Undated) _ Attorneys general from 25 states
voiced their support Friday for a Clinton administration proposal
to promote more competition in the airline industry. If the
initiative fails, however, the states may file an antitrust suit
against the major carriers, the leader of the group said. By
Laurence Zuckerman.
</P>
<P>
   BIZGLANCE (Undated) _ Digest of the day's financial stories.
</P>
<P>
   CREDIT (New York) _ Treasury prices declined Friday, as the
stock market steadied itself from a sharp falloff the day before.
By Robert Hurtado.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-ECON (London) _ The pound's strength is causing pain for
many British exporters. By Alan Cowell.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COMMENTARY &LR;  (``k'' code)

<P>
   RICH-COLUMN (Washington) _ COMMENTARY: CULTURE FIRE SALE. By
Frank Rich. (I would have felt sorry for Chelsea Clinton if I
hadn't been so busy feeling sorry for myself.)
</P>
<P>
   FRIEDMAN-COLUMN (Undated) _ COMMENTARY: TWO SICK NATIONS, ONE
CURE. (Is there really any difference between Boris Yeltsin and
Suharto or between Russia and Indonesia?) By Thomas L. Friedman.

<HEADLINE>
A DAY LATER, GIANTS LOOK GREAT 
BY HENRY SCHULMAN
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hours before the two big trades were announced
on Thursday, second baseman Jeff Kent said this about the Giants'
free-fall since the All-Star break:
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone can give you excuses and reasons why, they can make
trades and sit guys on the bench, but if anyone had the real
answers none of this would be happening to us. There is no lack of
effort, no lack of emotion, no lack of work ethic. There is just a
black cloud over Candlestick right now, and we can't get out from
under it.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe they can. Thanks to Kent, and the emotional lift of the
trades, the Giants can see a glimmer of light peeking through.
</P>
<P>
   With newcomers Joe Carter, Jose Mesa, Al Morman and Shawon
Dunston on hand, and Carter starting in right field, Kent went
batty against the Cincinnati Reds on Friday night. He homered
twice, including a grand slam, and drove in a career-high seven
runs as the Giants, who seemed almost incapable of scoring lately,
rolled to a 12-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts with excitement,'' manager Dusty Baker said. ``You
have to be excited, and there hasn't been much excitement around
here in a long time. There's new energy, new voices, new
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``To come out and get 11 runs like that (in the first four
innings), we haven't seen that in a long time,'' Baker said.
``There was a lot of energy in the clubhouse. We needed that
badly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' third win in 12 games since the All-Star break moved
them within two games of the Chicago Cubs in the wild-card race.
The Mets, who swept Chicago in a doubleheader Friday, are 11/2
games behind the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Kent hit his 10th and 11th homers and had the most RBIs by a
Giant since Barry Bonds drove in seven against the Dodgers on Oct.
1, 1993. His offensive explosion came out of the blue, considering
he was hitless in 21 at-bats and 4-for-41 before he hit a two-run
homer in the first inning, a sacrifice fly in the third and a grand
slam in an eight-run fourth inning that doomed the Reds to their
eighth straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   Kent has taken enough extra batting practice to bruise his
hands. That, plus a new knee brace that allows him a little more
mobility, contributed to his best offensive night ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you miss four weeks of major-league baseball, it's hard
to step in right where you took off,'' he said. ``It's hard to
perform with a knee brace that restricts the back side of your
movement. You have to continue to make adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonds, Darryl Hamilton, Rey Sanchez and J.T. Snow also had two
hits each to propel Mark Gardner to his eighth victory. Gardner
pitched eight innings of two-run ball and gave way in the ninth to
Mesa, who pitched a scoreless get-acquainted inning and endeared
himself to the crowd of 16,931 by striking out Bret Boone to end
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said he was glad both trades happened at once to ``relieve
some anxiety in the clubhouse.'' But with a week left before the
trading deadline, everyone knows the dealing may not be over. The
incumbent Giants have a wait-and-see attitude about the deals
already made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time will tell,'' Hamilton said before the game, ``but if it's
done to shake things up and break the streak we're in, it's a good
move. We need something, and harsh language isn't going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter started in right field and went 1-for-5 with a double and
run scored, but his bat was hardly needed as Kent and the Giants
battered Reds starter Scott Winchester for 10 runs in 32/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds started the battery with a first-inning single to right
with two outs. Kent followed with one of the longest Giants homers
of the year, a blast down the left-field line that bounced halfway
up the permanent seats beyond the bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   Kent hit a sacrifice fly in the third inning to make it 3-0, and
the Giants stormed ahead 11-0 with their eight-run fourth that
included a two-run Charlie Hayes homer and Kent's grand slam, which
came after the Reds walked Bonds intentionally to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Krivda relieved Winchester, and Carter greeted him with a
double into the right-field corner for his first hit as a Giant.
Hayes singled him home for his second hit of the inning and an 11-0
lead. &QL;

MESA, CARTER ADD LIFE TO CLUBHOUSE 
BY HENRY SCHULMAN
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If the two Giants trades were meant to infuse
life into their clubhouse, they succeeded. The room sounded like
Grand Central Station on Friday as the team welcomed a gaggle of
new players.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner, outfielder and first baseman Joe Carter gave
Barry Bonds a big bear hug. In another corner, an almost giddy
reliever Jose Mesa renewed acquaintances with old friend Julian
Tavarez.
</P>
<P>
   Left-handed reliever Al Morman sat quietly at his new locker
filling out forms, while infielder Shawon Dunston was stuck on a
freeway somewhere. After flying in from Cleveland he had to drive
to his house in Fremont to drop off his son, who was traveling with
him. An hour before game time, Dunston had not reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've added some excitement and electricity to this team,''
manager Dusty Baker said. ``With Jose Mesa and Robb Nen, we've got
a double closer, equal to the days when we had Mike Jackson and Rod
Beck here. That's big. And if there's a man on base, Joe Carter
knows how to bring him home.''
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to reverse the fortunes of a team that lost 11 of 13
games after the All-Star break, the Giants acquired Carter from the
Baltimore Orioles late Thursday night for minor-league pitcher
Darin Blood. They also sent reliever Steve Reed and minor-league
outfielder Jacob Cruz to Cleveland for Mesa, Morman and Dunston.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest question mark in the deal is Mesa, once a dominant
closer who became a pariah in Cleveland after blowing the Indians'
ninth-inning lead in Game 7 of the World Series last October.
Before that, he was subject to the humiliation of a rape trial, in
which he was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   This trade will be judged on whether Mesa, 3-4 with a 5.17 ERA
this season, can be the workhorse reliever the Giants expect and
pitch as well as the departed Reed, who was having a stellar season
(2-1, 1.48). Orel Hershiser, who played alongside Mesa for three
seasons in Cleveland, gave Mesa the best endorsement a starting
pitcher can give a reliever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked with Jose in Cleveland for three years, and I'll hand
the ball to Jose anytime,'' Hershiser said. ``He's awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Giants management sought Hershiser's opinions on Mesa, both as a
pitcher and a person, and Hershiser responded with a glowing
review.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jose is a solid guy, a lot of fun to have on a team. He's a
good leader,'' Hershiser said. ``People are going to read into
either side of those comments his past problems. My response would
be, a little grace and forgiveness go a long way. He definitely had
a wakeup call and has straightened his life out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa looked and sounded thrilled to be in San Francisco as he
met his new teammates. He told reporters he pitches best when he
works three or four days in a row, which should be music to Baker's
ears. Mesa has 104 career saves, but no illusions that he will
fight for that job here with Nen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the main guy. He's got 27 saves already and I've got one.
He's the man here,'' Mesa said. ``Here I might be in long relief
today, I might start tomorrow. I don't know. Whatever they want me
to do, I'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Brian Sabean said three scouts, ``guys I would
trust my life with,'' watched Mesa pitch for more than a month and
were convinced he had the velocity and control to be a dominant
reliever. Mesa was sought by several other teams, sources said,
including the New York Mets and Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   While Mesa had a 7.02 ERA in Cleveland, where he was constantly
booed, he had a 2.18 ERA on the road. That's the Mesa the Giants
believe they acquired.
</P>
<P>
   Carter arrived from Baltimore tired but hungry to play, after
finishing an Orioles game against Oakland at 12:45 yesterday
morning. Baker was planning to give Carter a few days on the bench
so he could first practice playing the tough outfield here, but
Carter talked Baker into putting him into the lineup right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Dusty I didn't sleep at all last night, I got on a 7
a.m. flight after playing in a game until 1 a.m., and I didn't fly
all day out here just to sit,'' Carter said. ``I've been sitting
for the last two months. I can do that real good. I want to get
right into the frying pan.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter became a bench player in Baltimore, where he hit .246
with 11 homers and 33 RBIs. He was happy to be dealt to the Giants
because he knows he'll be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chance for me to play,'' Carter said. ``I'm always
excited about that. I'm excited to be playing for Dusty. He's one
of the few managers I played  &LR; against.  &LR; I'm looking forward to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's presence probably means less playing time for Stan
Javier, who was gracious about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's going to come in here and help the team, I'm glad,''
Javier said. ``I know it's going to have an impact on me and
(Darryl Hamilton), but you never know what's going to happen. I
hope he does a great job for us. I don't take this personally.''

<P>
   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Intense heat will scorch the interior Northwest on Sunday, with
temperatures exceeding 100 degrees in parts of eastern Washington
and eastern Oregon. West of the Cascades, sea breezes will suppress
hot weather at the coast, but heat will likely build into Portland
and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Relentless heat will continue to grip Texas as an expansive,
very warm high pressure system holds steady several thousand feet
over the Texas-Louisiana border. Tropical moisture streaming north
from Old Mexico on the western flank of the unyielding high will
fuel showers and thunderstorms from the mountains near the Big Bend
of Texas to the high ground of New Mexico, Colorado, Utah and
Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   However, the weather pattern over Arizona and Nevada, which had
been rather stormy earlier in the week, will not be as active
Sunday as a high pressure system building east from California at
high altitudes curtails the flow of moisture from the tropics.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered clusters of showers and thunderstorms will blossom
along and south of a stationary front spanning from the lower
Mississippi Valley to the Carolinas. Near the Gulf Coast, a sea
breeze front forging ashore will incite thunderstorms from southern
Louisiana to the Florida panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian cool front slicing south into the upper Middle West
will trigger scattered showers and a few thundershowers over parts
of the upper Mississippi Valley and western Great Lakes. Farther
east, a jet stream disturbance will produce isolated, light showers
over the mountains in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Fleeting Twisters
</P>
<P>
   Many tornadoes last only a few minutes. Many twisters have a
diameter of a few hundred yards or less. Thus, unlike
thunderstorms, which have spatial and temporal scales on the order
of tens of miles and tens of minutes (or longer) respectively, many
tornadoes are fleeting and small and inflict little or no damage on
populated areas. Friday, two small tornadoes were spotted in
Arapahoe County to the east of Denver. One lasted one minute and
the other lasted four minutes. Neither tornado caused any damage.
Sunday, fleeting twisters are possible along the Front Range of the
Rockies. &QL;

EDITORIAL: FAMINE _ THE MAN-MADE DISASTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, July 26:
</P>
<P>
   The pictures from the Sudan are heartbreakingly familiar _ the
sunken cheeks and spindly legs of famine, which could kill half a
million people this year. In the past few years the world has
improved its ability to spot famine and feed the starving. But in
the Sudan and North Korea those efforts are not enough to prevent
widespread death from hunger and its related diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Nature causes floods and droughts, but most societies have found
ways to get food to those afflicted most of the time. Human folly
causes famine, which occurs when those ways are blocked. Harvard
economist Amartya Sen argued that there has never been a serious
famine in a country _ even an impoverished one _ with a democratic
government and a free press. The press acts as a warning system and
the pressures of democracy dissuade rulers from famine-producing
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Both North Korea and the Sudan are suffering famine because
devastating policies compounded natural disaster. North Korea's
Stalinist regime at first refused to ask for help, and until
recently would not accept donors' demands that food shipments be
tracked. In the Sudan, the main culprit is a 15-year civil war.
People must flee their farms and marauders loot stores of seed and
burn crops.
</P>
<P>
   Politics has also complicated the world's response. South Korea
discouraged countries from giving food to the North. A new
government in South Korea has now stopped using food as a weapon. A
consortium of United Nations-led groups has been flying food into
the Sudan since 1989. But it underestimated this year's emergency,
which worsened as the war intensified and Khartoum imposed a ban on
food flights last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Even the United Nations' reduced appeal for help was only
half-met, although more money has been raised with recent
publicity. Food, however, must move through the Kenyan port of
Mombasa and be trucked to an airfield to be flown to the Sudan, an
expensive process hindered by floods and a truckers' strike.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month the warring sides agreed to a three-month
cease-fire to allow food to come in.
</P>
<P>
   The world's capacity to respond to famine has greatly improved
in the last decade. Nineteen countries that received U.S. emergency
food this year have no famine. Prediction is more accurate with
monitoring systems at the United Nations and the U.S. Agency for
International Development that use satellite data and commodity
prices. But by the time donors are sure enough to begin aid, it can
be too late. Large shipments from the United States to Africa take
four to six months, mostly due to requirements that food come from
U.S. commodity surpluses and travel mainly on U.S. ships. European
Union aid, which can be bought near the emergency site, is quicker
and cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Preventing famine requires more flexibility and planning. The
failure to get corn seed into the Sudan in time for a July
planting, for example, means the next harvest will also fail.
Washington is experimenting with keeping foodstuffs stored in silos
in the Philippines or Tanzania, which cuts two or three months off
response time. In some cases, Washington can authorize private
relief groups to buy a small amount of food near the emergency.
These programs should be expanded.
</P>
<P>
   The key to renewing the world's commitment to food aid is to
accompany necessary food with programs that help countries become
more self-sufficient, from small-scale farming projects to more
rational economic policies, which are now helping raise food
production in Africa. But in many cases of famine, the world's best
investment is in peace negotiations. &QL;

</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, July 26:
</P>
<P>
   People who wondered what the Republican Party would use for an
agenda once the Contract With America faded into the history of
political flapdoodle may now have their answer. The party's two
historical wings _ the corporate pro-business faction and the
populist social conservatives _ seem inclined to spend eternity
canceling out each other's proposals. Voter pressures make that
unwise. But it makes for a good show.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, the Republicans have been split into two camps,
one obsessing about abortion and family values, the other fixated
on the capital-gains tax. But lately they have seemed particularly
short on common ground. Last week the Senate bowed to the concerns
of businesses with markets overseas and killed a bill dear to
social conservatives' hearts, which would require the government to
take action against countries that countenance religious
persecution. But meanwhile, the House leaders, in their attempts to
placate the party's isolationist right wing, outraged those same
business and farm interests by sitting on a bill that would approve
American contributions to the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Such intramural squabbling gets dangerous as Congress closes in
on the campaign season. Republicans have yet to establish a record
on which to run this November. Members of the rank and file who
worry that they will be seen as obstructionists or do-nothing are
continually comforted by the leadership, which has endless polls
showing that the public is not worried about anti-tobacco
legislation or campaign finance reform. Such polls, of course, have
a way of changing when the public focuses on election issues in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican House leadership, which wanted to run on big tax
cuts, was rebuffed last week by the Senate. Republicans there fear
that President Clinton would be able to brand any sizable tax cuts
as a blow against the solvency of the Social Security system.
Recent political history suggests they are right, particularly when
the tax plan is as irresponsible as the one the House has been
brewing up. The gibe by John Kasich, the House Budget chairman,
that the Senate has not even been able to pass ``a spending-cut
bill'' seems peculiar, since Kasich's own chamber cannot agree on
cuts either.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of the encroaching elections was behind passage of a
patients' rights bill in the House on Friday, although the
Democrats will try to brand the Republican version of the bill as a
shield for the insurance industry. Election pressure has also
increased the influence of the GOP moderates normally given
leftovers and hand-me-downs. In a welcome move last week, the House
calmly approved funding for the National Endowment for the Arts,
the longtime whipping boy of the social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The NEA budget will be tied up with restrictions aimed at
keeping any money from artists whose endeavors might offend Middle
America, but it is still a noteworthy case of the Republican
leadership's allowing moderates to sit at the big folks' table. The
leaders have been far less accommodating when it comes to the
moderates' pursuit of campaign finance reform. Their intransigence
on this issue may shed light on the party's real strategy for
winning this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than producing legislation the voters like, they seem to
be betting that they can hold their own by collecting masses of
money from special interests like the tobacco lobby, to finance
enough television ads in key districts to keep the party's slender
majority intact.

<P>
   NORFOLK, Va. _ President Clinton on Saturday condemned the
shootings at the Capitol on Friday as ``a moment of savagery at the
front door of American civilization'' and hailed as heroes the two
law-enforcement officers killed in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``To every American who has been shaken by this violent act, to
the millions of parents who have taken your children through those
very same doors, I ask you to think about what our Capitol means,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That majestic marble building is the symbol of our democracy
and the embodiment of our nation,'' he said. ``We must keep it a
place where people can freely and proudly walk the halls of their
government. And we must never, ever take for granted the values for
which it stands or the price of preserving them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Speaker Newt Gingrich praised the ``heroic
actions'' of the officers who died in the shooting and the ``tragic
loss'' suffered by their families. ``And finally I want to
emphasize that this building is the keystone of freedom, that it is
open to the people because it is the people's building,'' Gingrich
continued. ``And that no terrorist, no deranged person, no act of
violence will block us from preserving our freedom and from keeping
this building open to people from all over the world, and to every
American who wants to come and visit the center of their
self-government.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, speaking before boarding Air Force One to fly to
Norfolk for the commissioning of the Navy's newest aircraft
carrier, the USS Harry S. Truman, called the two slain officers
part of ``a special breed of men and women who pin on their badges,
put on their uniforms, kiss their families goodbye, knowing full
well they may be called on to lay down their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also cited the ``many acts of heroism, by strangers who
shielded children with their bodies, by officers who fanned across
the Capitol, by Dr. Bill Frist, a renowned heart surgeon before his
election to the Senate from Tennessee.'' Frist tended to one of the
victims and to the shooting suspect, Russell Eugene Weston Jr. &QL;

STARR IS SAID TO SUBPOENA CLINTON TO TESTIFY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This story has been added to the Sunday, July 26, Page 1 of
The New York Times.) 
(bl) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr. and JOHN M. BRODER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton was subpoenaed by Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr to testify this week before the federal grand
jury investigating the Monica Lewinsky matter, two lawyers close to
the case said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the first sitting president to be summoned to appear
before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   It could not be determined Saturday when Clinton was summoned to
testify on what he knows about Ms. Lewinsky, the 25-year-old former
White House intern who prosecutors believe had a sexual
relationship with the president and was urged to lie about it. It
was also not known how the summons for the president's appearance
was served.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers said that prosecutors delivered the grand jury
subpoena last week to David Kendall, the president's personal
lawyer. And since then, Kendall has resumed discussions with
Starr's prosecutors to try reach an agreement that would allow
Clinton to ``provide information'' to the grand jury without
appearing at the federal courthouse a few blocks from the White
House. If an agreement is reached, the subpoena could be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoena of the president has profound legal and political
consequences for both Clinton and Starr. It is also a strong
indication that Starr's six-month-old inquiry may be nearing its
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Because there are only a few witnesses who have still not
testified in the sex-and-cover-up inquiry, the grand jurors are
waiting to hear from the two people who know the most, Clinton and
Ms. Lewinsky. And the prosecutors have chosen to seek Clinton's
testimony first.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lawyers close to the case, who insisted on anonymity, said
Saturday that Clinton was willing, even anxious, to answer the
grand jurors' questions in some form. However, the president
recently told senior advisers that he preferred not to appear in
person before the federal grand jury, where he would be required to
answer questions without his lawyers present.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the president prefers to provide prosecutors with a
videotaped deposition at the White House. The videotape could be
played later in the grand jury room.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman James Kennedy said he had no comment about
the matter Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing Friday, White House press secretary Mike McCurry
announced that Kendall was discussing how Clinton could ``provide
information'' to the grand jury. McCurry had told reporters that he
did not know if a subpoena had been served.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bakaly, a spokesman for Starr's office, declined
Saturday to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers and political advisers to the president have been
weighing the political and legal risks if the president should
choose to rebuff the subpoena on constitutional grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The president has said very little about his relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky. He denied in late January that he had ``sexual
relations'' with her. At that time he pledged to answer the many
questions surrounding the Lewinsky matter ``sooner rather than
later.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite repeated requests from Starr that Clinton
voluntarily provide testimony in the Lewinsky inquiry, the
president has refused to agree to answer prosecutors' questions.
</P>
<P>
   Starr and his predecessor, Robert Fiske, have taken the
president's testimony under oath at the White House on several
occasions on a variety of Whitewater-related matters. Portions of
his testimony were later read to grand jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Since late January, the grand jury has investigated whether
Clinton had a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and then
encouraged her to lie about it under oath to lawyers for Paula
Jones, who in a civil lawsuit had accused the president of sexual
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are also investigating whether Vernon Jordan, a
friend of the president, attempted to find Ms. Lewinsky a job in
exchange for her silence. Both Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky have said
under oath that they did not have a sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   White House political and legal strategists always knew that
Starr could subpoena the president. Those strategists are now
discussing how the public would react if Clinton did not answer
questions before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   As many as six times, Clinton has refused requests of Starr's
prosecutors to voluntarily appear before the grand jury. The
president's lawyers have given prosecutors several explanations for
the refusals, including Clinton's busy schedule and the White House
view that Starr's inquiry is unfair and motivated by politics.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton chooses to try to block the subpoena, it could
trigger a serious constitutional crisis. Most legal scholars and
experts are sharply divided on whether a sitting president can be
compelled to testify or, if he refuses, held in contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
   Although the White House believes that only the House of
Representatives holds that power, some lawyers in Starr's office
may be willing to test that question before the courts.
</P>
<P>
   There could also be political risks for Clinton if he declined
to cooperate at this stage of the inquiry. Some House Democrats,
fearful of potential fallout in the November elections, have said
publicly in recent weeks that they hope the president cooperates
and answers all of the grand jury's questions.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the president's staunchest supporters have said in
recent days that they believe Clinton should answer Starr's
questions in a timely manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my judgment that the White House and the president's
lawyers see the end game is very near and that the country wants
this over with,'' said former White House deputy counsel Lanny
Davis, an outspoken defender of Clinton. ``This is the right time
for the president to come forward.'' &QL;

LAWYER CANCELS BRIEFING IN CLINIC BOMBING CASE

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDREWS, N.C._ A lawyer representing the mother of a man wanted
in the bombing of a Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic canceled his
plans to meet with reporters here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Woodham, an agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms and a spokesman for the agencies searching for the
fugitive, Eric Robert Rudolph, said the lawyer notified authorities
Saturday morning that he would not make an appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Woodham identified the lawyer as David Payne of Asheville, N.C.,
who is representing Rudolph's mother, Patricia Rudolph. But he said
Payne had not explained why he canceled his briefing after
notifying the authorities on Friday that he would have something to
say. He also said that the authorities would make no comment
Saturday on the progress of their search.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach Payne were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have been searching for months in mountains near
here for Rudolph, a 31-year-old carpenter. He has been charged in
the bombing of the abortion clinic, in which an off-duty police
officer was killed, and is wanted for questioning in three bombings
in Atlanta, including one that killed one person and injured more
than 100 others in the 1996 summer Olympics.

<P>
   CAPITOL-SHOOTING-RDP (Washington) _ The U.S. Capitol reopened
for the people's business Saturday as police investigators
reconstructed the movements of the gunman who shot two police
officers to death in a frightful bout of violence in the summer
tourist season. By Francis X. Clines. Page 1.
</P>
<P>
   (With two day-after photos.)
</P>
<P>
   CAPITOL-SUSPECT (Rimini, Mont.) _ Russell Eugene Weston Jr. was
a quiet loner who drifted back and forth between a cabin in the
Montana mountains and a modest house in rural Illinois, all the
while becoming an increasingly troubled figure who eventually was
hospitalized two years ago after writing ``threatening letters'' to
government officials, according to officials and people who knew
him. Page 1.
</P>
<P>
   CAPITOL-THREATS (Washington) _ On Friday morning, a man matching
the description of Russell Eugene Weston Jr., the suspect in the
killings at the Capitol, approached a stranger in Lafayette Park,
across the street from the White House. ``Millions of people are
going to die because of the people in that house,'' he said,
pointing at the president's mansion, according to testimony from an
eyewitness that was given Saturday to the Secret Service. The
Secret Service knows many such people. By Tim Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   CAPITOL-SECURITY (Washington) _ Congressional leaders said
Saturday they planned to reassess security in the wake of the fatal
shootings of two police officers in the U.S. Capitol. But the
overwhelming sentiment from President Clinton down through the
congressional leadership was to keep the majestic, white, domed
home of Congress accessible as ``the People's House.'' By Alison
Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   CAPITOL-SCENE (Washington) _ Eric Driessen trained his video
camera on the expanse of the Capitol's Great Rotunda on Saturday.
He was not really listening to the official tour guide, who spoke
cheerily of the building's architecture and history but made no
mention of the bloody shootout on Friday in which two Capitol
police officers were killed. ``There's an ache-in-the-heart feeling
because of what happened yesterday,'' said Driessen, a 25-year-old
psychology student visiting from Milwaukee. By Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   CAPITOL-POLICE (Washington) _ Beginning in 1801, John Golding,
the first _ and for 25 years the only _ Capitol police officer, was
charged ``to take care of the property of the United States.'' In
the nearly two centuries since, periodic violence, disastrous
fires, and potentially unruly demonstrations by citizens
petitioning the government led to the evolution of the current
professional force of 1,295 people who guard the Capitol and
surrounding grounds. By Neil A. Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   CAPITOL-CLINTON-REACT (Washington) _ President Clinton on
Saturday condemned the shootings at the Capitol on Friday as ``a
moment of savagery at the front door of American civilization'' and
hailed as heroes the two law-enforcement officers killed in the
attack. By Richard W. Stevenson.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On Friday morning, a man matching the description
of Russell Eugene Weston Jr., the suspect in the killings at the
Capitol, approached a stranger in Lafayette Park, across the street
from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millions of people are going to die because of the people in
that house,'' he said, pointing at the president's mansion,
according to testimony from an eyewitness that was given Saturday
to the Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Nazi Germany,'' he said. ``Millions of people are
going to die because of their beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than six hours later, Weston shot up the Capitol, killing
two police officers and wounding a visitor, law-enforcement
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   If the man in Lafayette Park proves to have been Weston, the
brief and odd statements were those of a man who had been formally
judged to be mentally ill and a danger to himself and others in
1996, the year he first came to the attention of the Secret
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Weston's Secret Service file was only one among thousands kept
on people who have threatened the president and other government
officials. Though Weston believed that the government was spying on
him through a neighbor's television satellite dish, his threats did
not result in his being placed under any kind of surveillance by
law-enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service knows many such people. ``We conduct 200
threat investigations a month,'' a senior Secret Service agent
said, ``and they don't all have tinfoil on their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   But many are, in fact, mentally ill. A recent study found that
328 people had tried to enter the White House grounds over a
three-year period, and that 91 percent were later judged to be
schizophrenic, and 66 percent were paranoid schizophrenics, said
Dr. Irving Gottesman, a clinic psychologist who has written
extensively on the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The delusions voiced by such people are familiar to anyone who
has worked at a courthouse, a newspaper or a police precinct. A
surprising number of people think the CIA has placed transmitters
in their molars, or that the Pentagon is beaming death rays through
their televisions, or that the White House is secretly controlling
their brains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know the root cause of delusions,'' Gottesman said.
``But their content is culturally determined.''
</P>
<P>
   Weldon Kennedy, a former deputy director of the FBI, was quick
to recall that Timothy McVeigh, who blew up the federal building in
Oklahoma City in April 1995, killing 168 people, believed that the
Army had implanted a computer chip in his buttocks.
</P>
<P>
   There has never been a finding that McVeigh was insane; in fact,
as Kennedy said, the Oklahoma City bombing revealed that of
``salt-of-the-earth people, a good portion believe that government
itself is evil, and there's much more of that than anyone ever
realized.'' The government's policing such people is a practical
impossibility as well as a common paranoid fantasy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Secret Service created a new security perimeter around the
White House in 1994 after one man sprayed the mansion with gunfire,
and another crashed a light plane onto the White House lawn.
</P>
<P>
   It closed off Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House,
creating a pleasant and patrollable walkway between the mansion and
Lafayette Park, where the man who closely resembled Weston on
Friday confronted the eyewitness, John Broder, a White House
correspondent for The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The man was carrying something that resembled an Army ammunition
bag, and began the encounter by asking: ``Do you know what the
storm clouds of war are?''
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service cannot lock up or look in on the countless
numbers of people who could potentially threaten the public
representatives of a government they find threatening. But the
attack at the Capitol was the latest in a long string of assaults
on public figures _ like John Hinckley's shooting of President
Reagan in 1981 _ by people who have both a mental illness and a
handgun.
</P>
<P>
   Gottesman stressed that he was not attempting to evaluate a man
he had never met. But he said he found the accounts of Weston's
recent history _ the delusional rage at the government for planting
land mines on his half-acre grubstake in Montana and beaming
mind-control rays through his neighbor's satellite dish _
``frighteningly familiar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds prototypical of the kinds of people who approach the
White House,'' he said. ``Those are textbook cases of paranoid
schizophrenia _ a preoccupation with systematized delusions, often
a theme of a persecution. You are an individual important enough so
as to warrant the intervention of these powerful forces. This is
the misguided logic of a person suffering from severe mental
illness.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for law enforcement, said Kennedy, now the vice
president of Guardsmark, a private security firm, is that a tiny
but growing fragment of the larger population increasingly holds
beliefs that resemble the ravings of a madman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been out there all along, but it is a growing
phenomenon,'' he said. ``The investigation of the Oklahoma City
bombing really focused the FBI on the fact that there was a much
larger problem here than the FBI had at that point estimated. It
existed in more than just isolated pockets. After Oklahoma City we
realized that there's a lot more people out there than a few
isolated groups that think this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a larger part of the society itself'' that believes that
the government is out to get them, he said, and some of these
people have reached ``the point where they feel it's necessary to
take action.''

POLICE EVOLVED FROM RIDICULED TO RESPECTED

   WASHINGTON _ Beginning in 1801, John Golding, the first _ and
for 25 years the only _ Capitol police officer, was charged ``to
take care of the property of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In the nearly two centuries since, periodic violence, disastrous
fires, and potentially unruly demonstrations by citizens
petitioning the government led to the evolution of the current
professional force of 1,295 people who guard the Capitol and
surrounding grounds.
</P>
<P>
   In the intervening years, the Capitol Police were celebrated for
occasional heroic feats, but just as often derided as useless Civil
War veterans or patronage employees.
</P>
<P>
   President John Quincy Adams directed that a regular police force
be established at the Capitol in 1827, the year the force
identifies as its formal founding. Some accounts said that Adams
decided to act after his son was assaulted in the Capitol by a
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who is an assiduous historian of the
Capitol, said that the Capitol Police in 1852 were described
accurately as an ``ununiformed squad of ancient watchmen.'' Mark
Twain complained in 1868 that the small Capitol Police force of his
day had grown lazy and fat, spending its days reclining against the
just-completed building's marble pillars.
</P>
<P>
   But Byrd has said that events moved Congress to expand and
improve its police force.
</P>
<P>
   The event that had one of the greatest impacts on the force was
on March 1, 1954, when Puerto Rican nationalists fired shots from
the visitor's gallery at the lawmakers below, wounding one. Soon
the police were issued weapons for the first time, and had to meet
stringent standards to serve. Byrd said that only about a fifth of
the officers of the time could qualify under the standards.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen years later, on March 1, 1971, an explosion ripped
through a restroom in the Senate wing. The so-called Weather
Underground took responsibility. No one was ever charged with that
crime, but it led to all visitors and their possessions being
checked for weapons and explosives, Byrd said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, all Capitol Police officers undergo rigorous training
including a 16-week program. Half of that time is spent at the
federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   For the past several years, the Capitol Police have expanded
their jurisdiction to the sometimes dangerous neighborhoods around
the Capitol where they ``maintain a presence'' and make arrests,
according to the Capitol Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are federal law-enforcement officers and the
killings on Friday of two of their number occurred on federal
property, government lawyers say that if convicted of the shooting,
the gunman may face the death penalty. In 1994 Congress expanded
the federal death-penalty statute to include the murder of a
federal officer. &QL;

STRONG ECONOMY FUELS NANNY WAR AMONG THE AFFLUENT

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was upsetting enough when her nanny quit to go
work for another family, but what shocked Carroll Bogert was the
salary used as a lure: $800 a week, plus health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did think the sum was rather stunning,'' said Ms. Bogert, a
Manhattan mother of two whose job as a spokeswoman for Human Rights
Watch requires a lot of traveling. ``She'd worked for us for two
and a half years, and we paid what I thought was the rather
princely sum of $550.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories like Ms. Bogert's are sending shivers down the spines of
well-to-do parents in Manhattan and its pricier suburbs, where a
nanny war has broken out among parents vying to find and keep the
modern Mary Poppins.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the fight is the strong economy, which is giving some
families more money to spend on nannies, housekeepers and other
household workers while giving the workers more job options and
higher wages.
</P>
<P>
   The winners in the escalating nanny war appear to be
millionaires _ like the ones Wall Street mints every minute _ who
can afford to pay a nanny up to $1,000 a week after taxes. The deal
often includes health insurance, a retirement plan, use of a BMW
and perhaps a guest cottage behind the main mansion.
</P>
<P>
   The losers are the merely prosperous, particularly single-parent
and two-income families who consider a nanny a necessity. They say
they are being priced out of the market for even an average nanny _
who, according to local employment agencies, now makes at least
$400 a week, regardless of whether she receives room and board _ by
the largess of the very rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, they've set a standard that a lot of nannies
have come to expect,'' said one Westchester County mother of two
who works at a Manhattan consulting firm and who spoke on the
condition that her name not be used. ``Not everyone is worth a few
billion or even several million.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most American parents cannot afford at-home child care,
much less the expensive nannies who are hired through agencies and
get paid on the books. The majority of women who work in at-home
child care get paid under the table and are likely to earn less
money than career nannies; some are illegal immigrants and others
do not speak fluent English. Au pairs _ the foreign students who
have traditionally provided inexpensive child care for American
families under a program sponsored by the federal government _ have
fallen out of favor with many families.
</P>
<P>
   But wages for premium nannies _ college-educated women with
experience and drivers' licenses _ have been rising for several
years, according to executives at employment agencies. ``We have
definitely seen a step up in the cost of maternity nurses and
nannies,'' said John Battaglia, owner of the Fox Agency in
Manhattan, adding that since 1993, ``the $600 range has come along;
$500 range was the top at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   The women who work as nannies _ and they are almost entirely
women _ say the increase is an overdue recognition of their long
hours, grueling work and heavy responsibilities. ``If a nanny is
running the household, running the show, I don't think $600 should
be balked at _ I don't think it is out of line at all,'' said
Cathrine Weaver, a longtime nanny in Westchester who has just
completed her nursing degree. ``I feel for the families, but they
made a choice.'' The rise in nannies' wages appears to be a
national phenomenon. A survey by Nanny News of 300 readers found
that the median weekly wage is now $350. That's up from $250 two
years ago, said Mary Clurman, who publishes the newsletter and runs
Apple Pie USA, a placement agency based in Cottonwood, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Wages are much higher in New York, especially in Manhattan and
the northern suburbs. ``I get people calling from Long Island who
pay $275, and they want to pay that or maybe $300 a week,'' said
Leigh Tripathi, who stopped working as a nanny four months ago to
open an agency, Real Kidz Care, in Tuckahoe, N.Y. She cannot help
these families, she said, noting that nine years ago she made $325
a week, but her most recent job paid $600.
</P>
<P>
   Nannies have become far more savvy about wages and benefits,
thanks in part to the information that employment agencies post on
the Internet. And given the hard work involved, many young women
who might have gone into child care are finding other jobs, said
Alan Friedman, co-owner of the Manhattan franchise of A Choice
Nanny.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for all household help is increasing, said Maurice
Wingate, president of Best Domestic Services, a national employment
agency. In addition to nannies, housekeepers and gardeners, he
said, he is placing personal assistants, who for $700 a week help
plan dinners, arrange entertainment and make travel plans.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, the number of people
working in homes as nannies, cooks, cleaners and drivers grew by
about 7,000 between 1992, when the regional economy began to
recover, and 1996, the most recent date for which figures are
available, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
That works out to an increase of 23 percent _ five times faster
than private employment growth in the region, said John Wieting,
regional commissioner of the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly is a very rapid growth industry,'' he said,
``and there is no reason to expect that this kind of growth has not
continued.''
</P>
<P>
   Employers can suffer from sticker shock, especially families who
move to New York from other areas or overseas. ``In Europe, you can
hire American nannies for half the price you pay here; you can get
college-educated women for $200 a week,'' said Penelope McDonnell,
a mother of four who moved two years ago from Belgium to
Ridgefield, Conn. Mrs. McDonnell, who recently hired a nanny, said
she had not had trouble finding applicants for the post, but used
an agency because she worried about the quality of the applicants.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, mothers like Mrs. McDonnell might have turned to au
pairs. But many families have grown reluctant to sponsor au pairs
because of Louise Woodward, the au pair from England who last year
was convicted in the death of an infant in her care.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Au pairs have also become increasingly expensive. Under federal
guidelines, au pairs make $139.05 a week plus room and board, up
from $100 in 1995. Additional costs like training, transportation
and insurance can bring the cost to more than $200 a week, even
though au pairs must attend school and work no more than 45 hours a
week.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the number of au pairs, which in the mid-1990s
reached 11,000, last year was about 3,000, according to estimates
from the U.S. Information Agency, which oversees the program.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in nannies' wages is so striking that one of Wall
Street's most widely read investment gurus has cited it as a sign
of the overheated stock market. Barton Biggs, chief global
strategist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, described the situation
in Greenwich, Conn., where he lives, in a July 6 report to his
firm's clients, ``Say `Hi' to the Nanny Bubble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The latest escalation that has outraged Greenwich is that a
family new to town enticed a nanny by buying her a new car (which
she helped choose) with the proviso that if she sticks around for
two years, it's hers,'' Biggs wrote. ``Brilliant, except that now
other nannies are demanding similar deals. I would bet you it will
be a long time before that particular family gets into a country
club.''
</P>
<P>
   While buying a car is unusual, nannies and parents agree,
anxious or grateful employers have paid off their nannies' debts,
financed their educations and covered their gasoline costs.
</P>
<P>
   Nannies who work in some parts of Connecticut can make $600 to
$800 a week, said Donna Levandoski, who until July 17 was a live-in
nanny and the leader of a support group for her peers. ``Fairfield
County is such a freak of nature, it's not the norm,'' she said.
Between the wealthy wives of corporate executives and the actresses
and actors, she said, picking up the children from school is ``a
social event, a job in itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Manhattan can be even more extreme. One
30-year-old woman, who spoke on the condition that her name not be
used, worked until March as the third nanny for a very wealthy
couple with one child. For being on call on nights and weekends for
30 hours a week, she received a bedroom and private bath in an
apartment on the Upper West Side overlooking Central Park. When she
was called on to work _ about 15 hours a week _ she was paid $14 an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   She left after more than a year, mostly to get more privacy, she
said. Although the family she worked for lived in a separate
apartment, she shared hers with the second nanny, and, during the
day, other members of the staff.
</P>
<P>
   She also found the family's requirements were exacting, which is
not uncommon among the very well-to-do, said Jackie Williams,
president of I Love My Nanny Inc., a nationwide agency that
specializes in live-in child care.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're willing to pay more, but they expect more,'' she said.
``The expectation is, if their children wake up in the middle of
the night, the nanny is going to get up.'' &QL;

LEADERS SAY PUBLIC MUST HAVE ACCESS TO CAPITOL

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional leaders said Saturday that they
planned to reassess security in the wake of the fatal shootings of
two police officers in the U.S. Capitol. But the overwhelming
sentiment from President Clinton down through the congressional
leadership was to keep the majestic, white, domed home of Congress
accessible as ``the People's House.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich, briefly overcome with emotion during a
radio address Saturday morning, called the Capitol the ``keystone
of freedom.'' He insisted that ``no terrorist, no deranged person,
no act of violence will block us from preserving our freedom and
from keeping this building open.''
</P>
<P>
   In Arkansas, where he was campaigning for a Senate candidate,
Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, echoed the
sentiment. But Lott also said that he would press to move ahead
with a design that had been proposed earlier that would create an
underground visitors' center on the East Front plaza of the
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Not only would it serve as an orientation point for tourists,
but it would also involve initial screening of tourists, by
officers and metal detectors, farther away from the Capitol
building. The plan has long been stalled over its cost, about $121
million.
</P>
<P>
   For years, and especially after the terrorist bombings of the
World Trade Center and Oklahoma City federal buildings, lawmakers
have debated how to balance security with public access to the
Capitol complex, which draws up to 23,000 visitors a day.
</P>
<P>
   After an explosive device blew up in a hallway outside the
Senate chamber in November 1983, lawmakers decided to put up thick
concrete planters outside the building as a first line of defense
against attack.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress has rejected many other security proposals,
refusing to close off the Capitol plaza or to erect a wrought-iron
fence around the Capitol's 127-acre grounds like the one that
encircles the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, in response to security concerns raised by the Oklahoma
City bombing, the stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the
White House was closed to traffic. The street has since become a
playground for in-line skaters and roller hockey players.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Saturday asked that Congress not be barricaded. ``All
around the world, that majestic marble building is the symbol of
our democracy and the embodiment of our nation,'' he said in his
radio address. ``We must keep it a place where people can freely
and proudly walk the halls of their government.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, Congress approved $20 million for an overall security
plan for the Capitol complex and grounds.
</P>
<P>
   A far more elaborate plan to create the subterranean visitors'
center has been on the drawing boards since 1991. But it has always
faltered because of cost.
</P>
<P>
   The design calls for tourists to enter the Capitol from a block
away and to descend to a 446,000-square-foot underground visitors'
center where theaters would show films about Congress.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Christina Martin, a spokeswoman for Gingrich, said he supports
the plan. Laura Nichols, a spokeswoman for Rep. Dick Gephardt,
D-Mo., the House minority leader, said Gephardt had discussed the
proposed visitors' center with Gingrich during a recent joint trip
to Israel and that Gingrich had told him he preferred to raise
private funds to finance the building of the center.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours after Friday's gun battle in the Capitol, many
lawmakers simply insisted that the nation's law-making chambers
remain accessible. ``We do not want to make the People's House a
fortress,'' said Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's
House delegate.
</P>
<P>
   With the latest shootings as a reminder, Rep. Paul Kanjorski,
D-Pa., recalled being on the House floor 44 years ago as a
16-year-old page when four men seeking independence for Puerto Rico
fired shots from a public gallery, wounding five Congressmen.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he said Congress should not seek to barricade itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never have 100 percent security,'' Kanjorski, who has
served on a House task force that looked at proposed security
restrictions, said. ``And when all was said and done, we would have
been encased in glass.''

THE ASTERISK THAT SHOOK THE BASEBALL WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: The 6-paragraph precede above James Reston's byline should be
italicized) 
(bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    As Roger Maris chased Babe Ruth's home run record through the
summer of 1961, he carried a burden that Mark McGwire, Ken Griffey
and the other players now pursuing Maris do not have: he knew that
even if he set the record, it might not count.
 &HT;    Baseball commissioner Ford Frick ruled during the season that a
home run record would be official only if it was achieved in 154
games; otherwise it would go in the books beside Ruth's mark, with
a notation that it was set in a 162-game season.
 &HT;    Maris hit 59 home runs through 154 games, 1 short of Ruth. Major
league baseball would later remove the notation _ the so-called
asterisk _ from the record books, but it appeared at the time that
Maris had missed his chance to own the record outright.
 &HT;    James Reston, one of America's most influential journalists
during 50 years as a correspondent, columnist and editor for The
New York Times, took issue with Frick's decision in an article
published on Oct. 1, 1961, the last day of the season.
 &HT;    Reston, who died in 1995, began his career in 1934 as a
sportswriter for The Associated Press, and before that was briefly
the traveling secretary of the Cincinnati Reds.
 &HT;    On the day this article appeared, Maris hit his 61st home run of
the season.

<P>
   Sports are particularly popular in America these lovely Indian
summer days, not only because they take your mind off Nikita
Khrushchev but because, unlike international politics, they are
tangible and definite.
</P>
<P>
   They are not like a foreign policy: you don't have to wait 25
years to see how the thing comes out. They start at a time certain.
They provide a little pageantry in our unceremonial country. They
have a beginning, a middle and an end. You generally know who won
when it's all over, and they provide controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Maris vs. Ruth illustrates the point. In the last
session of Congress, 2,783 bills were passed for the relief of
injustice or undue hardship to private citizens of this country,
but for some mysterious reason, nobody introduced a bill for the
relief of Roger Maris of the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The facts are not in dispute and are even fairly well known.
Maris, a tax-paying professional baseball player, hit 60 home runs
this season, but because another player, one George Herman (Babe)
Ruth, hit 60 in a slightly shorter season, Maris was reduced to an
asterisk or footnote in baseball history. This was done on orders
from Ford Frick, the high commissioner of baseball, and it may well
go down as the worst judgment since Sherman Adams took that rug
from his old friend Bernard Goldfine of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, it is not hard to understand why Roger Maris is a
national figure in America today. A man cannot follow Khrushchev
for long, because he is vague and he goes on like a stuck whistle.
But Maris can be seen. His goal is clear, and you don't have to
make a career out of analyzing his motives or anticipating his
moves.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder, then, that America turns to the sports pages before
it turns to the editorials and pays more attention to the case of
Maris vs. Ruth or New York vs. Cincinnati than Khrushchev vs.
Kennedy or Moscow vs. Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Maris is more than a ball player. He is a momentary antidote to
the confusion of our times, a brief escape from frustration and a
particularly attractive figure as the symbol of bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   In a small way he is now even part of that gallant company of
men and women who didn't quite make it, not only the Hank
Greenbergs, the Jimmy Foxxes and the Hack Wilsons, who came close,
but the also-rans of history, who tried hard and failed in the end.
</P>
<P>
   The world's politics are full of them _ Richard Nixon, Adlai
Stevenson, Tom Dewey, Al Smith, William Jennings Bryan, Henry Clay
and Jefferson Davis in our own country; Trotsky, Malenkov and
Molotov in Russia _ and many others.
</P>
<P>
   The world's storytellers, likewise, have been fascinated for
centuries by the gallant failures of life: Ponce de Leon, who never
found the fountain of youth; Ahab in ``Moby Dick,'' who was killed
by the White Whale in the end; Ophelia, who struck out on Hamlet,
and Casey Jones, who never got his train to the end of the line.
</P>
<P>
   Frick, the high commissioner, merely thought about the
mathematics and not the philosophy of the Maris case, and he did
nothing about the psychology of it at all. The essential difference
between Ruth and Maris was not merely that Maris was a better all
around ball player but that Maris had to worry about Ruth and Ruth
didn't have to worry about Maris.
</P>
<P>
   The Babe swung with a free mind, and, as I remember it, often
with an empty mind. The difference wasn't that Maris had a livelier
ball or bat than Ruth but that he had a livelier imagination _ and
that is no advantage to a ball player practicing his profession
under savage pressure in a howling stadium.
</P>
<P>
   No asterisk can properly explain this story, and, besides, Frick
put it in the wrong place.
</P>
<P>
   He should have listed Maris with Ruth among the heroes and let
the asterisk explain that it took Maris a little longer.
</P>
<P>
   Having failed to do so, Frick could easily wind up himself as an
asterisk under the name of his illustrious predecessor, Kenesaw
Mountain Landis.

PROTECTING PLAYERS FROM THEIR AGENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Concerned about the quality of the agents representing its
players, the National Football League Players Association decided
to literally put agents to the test. In late 1996, the union sent a
basic quiz to agents on a subject they should have known well: the
collective bargaining agreement, the bible for player contract
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The voluntary test was not exactly astrophysics. Agents could
use the collective bargaining agreement for reference, and there
were only several dozen questions. But of the 200 to 250 agents who
bothered to take it, some 40 percent either failed or scored
poorly, missing some of the most elementary questions about what
players are entitled to and what teams can demand in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were disappointed with the results,'' said Arthur McAfee,
staff counsel for the players union.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, the troubling experiment underscored the union's
growing fears that too many unqualified agents were operating in an
increasingly lucrative and opportune football marketplace. The
1,200 players now in the NFL are the most ever, and the players
are, on average, making salaries three times what they were a
decade ago. The number of agents has grown, too, to 800 this year
from about 500 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The union's sense of unease about the men and women representing
its players has only deepened lately. Complaints made to the
arbitrator who settles disputes between football players and agents
have risen dramatically in the last two years, dwarfing, for
instance, those arising in professional baseball.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission
launched a criminal investigation into whether agents have
illegally served as financial advisers to their clients.
</P>
<P>
   In the most serious recent example of misconduct, a financial
planner in San Diego who had often portrayed himself to NFL players
as an agent was sentenced last December to 10 years in prison for
stealing $11 million from his clients, many of them football
players. Darren Woodson, the defensive back for the Dallas Cowboys,
lost $3.7 million alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the wild, wild west out there,'' said Brad Blank, an
agent who has represented NFL players since the early 1980s. ``The
things agents are doing to each other, to their clients, is worse
than I can remember. The reason is pretty simple: there is more big
money, but few hard-core punishments to serve as a deterrent to an
agent who breaks the rules or breaks the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The union's concern is so great that it has begun implementing a
range of safeguards to protect players. Earlier this year, for
instance, the union rolled back the maximum percentage that agents
can charge players to negotiate a contract from 4 percent to 3
percent, the lowest cut in sports.
</P>
<P>
   The union, which for years required virtually nothing in the way
of credentials for agents, also plans to institute a more strict
application process, one that, come next February, will make
passing a test mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   And the players association is not alone in its worries. Several
states have enacted laws making it illegal to have improper contact
with college players. In Pennsylvania, Jeffrey Nalley recently
pleaded no contest to a charge of unlawful activity by an agent
after buying more than $1,000 worth of clothing for Curtis Enis,
the former Penn State running back who is now with the Chicago
Bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think for a player these days it is hard to find an
agent,'' said Enis, who, after the misadventure in college, has
already had two agents in his first few months in the NFL ``There
are always people coming at you, wanting something.''
</P>
<P>
   Misconduct by agents happens in all sports. But the Major League
Baseball and National Basketball Association unions say they have
long had mechanisms in place to protect their players. The union
for NBA players, for example, has a grievance process and a code of
conduct, and new agents must complete a 24-page notarized
application.
</P>
<P>
   While it is impossible to say precisely why more incidents of
misconduct by agents may be taking place in professional football,
it is not hard to list some of the ingredients contributing to the
more volatile environment.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL, which signed a $17.6 billion television deal during the
off season, is hip-deep in cash. True free agency for players,
which came to football well after it had become a reality in sports
like baseball and basketball, has led to an increasing number of
contracts that would have been unthinkable even several years ago.
Last week, Terrell Davis of Denver signed the richest deal ever for
an NFL running back and in the history of the Broncos _ a
nine-year, $56.1 million package with an $11 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   And there are simply more players available for agents to
traffic in. Baseball has only 750 players, compared with the NFL's
1,200.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very afraid of what the business has become,'' said Joe
Linta, a veteran agent for NFL players. ``It has gotten out of hand
_ the amounts of money involved, how crazy other agents are.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League Players Association, like other
sports unions, functions in dual roles. First, it is a union for
the players and negotiates with the owners. Second, it is the
entity that certifies, monitors and, if necessary, punishes member
agents.
</P>
<P>
   But over the years, the union has done very little to serve as
an aggressive gatekeeper against problem agents. To be certified by
the union, prospective agents simply fill out a 14-page application
that asks questions about such things as an applicant's education
and whether the applicant has ever been convicted of a felony.
</P>
<P>
   With little screening, and the big money of NFL deals serving as
a powerful magnet, it is no surprise that some questionable
characters have become agents, according to players, team officials
and agents themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, seven agents have been found to have broken union
rules and have been punished, with two suspended for a year and
fined $5,000 for improperly providing cash to college players,
according to a union disciplinary summary statement.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the arbitrator who handles disputes between football
players and their agents, Roger Kaplan, said he has handled 88
cases in the last two years, a huge bump in business, he added, and
far more than have taken place between agents and players in other
sports. Baseball officials say there have been roughly a dozen such
cases in the last seven to eight years. Most of the disputes Kaplan
arbitrates involve disagreements over fees. Agents say other
disputes stem from the stealing of clients away from other agents
in violation of the rules. But Kaplan said the sport's expanding
money has been driving the number of complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now football players make enormous amounts of money,'' Kaplan
said. ``Therefore, when all this money is involved, there are bound
to be disputes.''
</P>
<P>
   The fights that agents wage to acquire the most promising
clients have also intensified, in part because the NFL's draft of
college players has been reduced from 30 rounds several decades ago
to only seven now.
</P>
<P>
   One agent claims to have received a tape-recorded death threat
last winter from another agent who thought he was trying to steal a
veteran client. And it is not uncommon for agents to circulate in
parking lots after practice or games, trying to woo other agents'
players. The Miami Dolphins got so tired of seeing agents hanging
around parts of their facility that they now limit where agents can
go.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there are any number of agents who represent their
players well. And players are not always angels. They sometimes
stiff agents on their fees, forcing the agent to go to arbitration.
Or a player will change agents instantly when another offers to do
a contract for a lower fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the agents in the business are good guys who take good
care of their clients,'' said Howard Shatsky, a longtime agent.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, players mostly used their agents to negotiate
contracts with teams and manage endorsement deals. But over the
years, agents have come to serve their clients in all sorts of
unorthodox, quite personal ways. Agents are now best men at
weddings, social planners, mediators of family disputes,
confessors.
</P>
<P>
   That increased role can be positive, and many agents take great
pride in looking out for their clients. But it has also blurred
traditional professional lines, and trusts have been violated.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, J.J. Stokes, the wide receiver for the San Francisco
49ers, asked John Gillette what had become of $500,000 he had given
Gillette to invest. Gillette, a San Diego financial planner who had
worked with players sent to him by their agents, told Stokes he had
invested the money in municipal bonds. In truth, though, Gillette
had stolen the half-million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette, who had often portrayed himself as an agent as well as
a financial planner, stole from a lot of NFL players. Late last
year, he pleaded guilty to 38 counts of theft and one count of
forgery for stealing more than $11 million from 25 athletes who
were clients, including San Diego Chargers linebacker Junior Seau,
Dallas Cowboys defensive back Darren Woodson and Jacksonville
Jaguars quarterback Rob Johnson. Gillette is serving a 10-year
prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gillette case was one of the worst I have ever seen,''
said Peter Longanbach, a prosecutor with the district attorney's
office in San Diego. ``The agent business itself is to blame for
some of what happened. That business attracts, in my opinion, some
of the worst people on the face of the earth. It attracted John
Gillette.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillette's scheme was simple: he stole money from players
instead of investing it as he was supposed to, using some of the
cash to buy expensive cars and charge $50,000 a month on a credit
card, Longanbach said.
</P>
<P>
   On the few occasions Gillette did invest the money, he put it in
his own investments, including a gold mine in Ghana, Longanbach
said.
</P>
<P>
   When Stokes confronted Gillette last year and demanded proof
that his money had been invested in municipal bonds, Gillette stole
stationery from the office of Patricia Frazier, head of financial
and technical services for the city of San Diego, forged her
signature and sent a letter to Stokes stating that he had bought
the bonds, Longanbach said.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes in other sports were also victimized by Gillette. Ryan
Jaroncyk, who received an $850,000 signing bonus from the Mets
several years ago, spoke at Gillette's sentencing hearing in
January. He had given Gillette $100,000 to invest, but has never
seen any of it since.
</P>
<P>
   ``John looked me in the eye and said he lived by Christian
values,'' Jaroncyk said. ``He had a picture of Jesus as a judge on
the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillette is hardly the only person accused of theft by his
former clients. Jim Kelly, the recently retired quarterback for the
Buffalo Bills, and a handful of other NFL players have charged they
were misled and later bilked of money by agents and financial
planners working for Lustig Pro Sports, a now defunct sports
representation agency based in Ohio. The agency was sued by several
former clients, but many of the lawsuits were eventually dropped or
settled out of court because the players lacked the money to
sustain them.
</P>
<P>
   In court documents, Kelly claimed the agency had invested his
money in questionable deals, bought worthless injury protection
insurance and forced him to prepay his fees to the agency, a
violation of players association rules. Other players had made
similar charges over the years, including Mike Webster, the Hall of
Fame center. Webster, despite having earned millions during his
career, was left financially destitute two years ago _ homeless and
sleeping in bus stations or the back of his car.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In one of the more extreme examples of misconduct alleged by
Kelly, the quarterback charged that the agency, owned and run by
Greg Lustig and A.J. Faigin, invested his money in a real estate
partnership called Madison Plaza. The agency's own accountant later
testified that the investments were doomed to eventually be
worthless, and that Kelly had unwittingly assumed $75,000 in debt.
The accountant, Gary Cooper, called the deal ``one of the worst
violations that I can think of for an attorney representing a
client.''
</P>
<P>
   Faigin declined to speak about the charges, and Lustig could not
be reached for comment. Faigin, though, recently sued Kelly for
libel, contending that Kelly's charges of misconduct, contained in
the quarterback's autobiography, had defamed him. An eight-member
jury in New Hampshire deliberated for two hours before finding for
Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst part about Jim's case is as sure as I am sitting
here today, what happened to Jim is happening right now to another
athlete,'' said Steve Gordon, Kelly's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Cases such as those involving Gillette and others were what
prompted the SEC to start its investigation of agents. The
commission's central interest is whether agents in all sports are
providing investment advice to their athlete clients in violation
of securities law. The commission is also exploring whether agents
used financial advisers to recruit potential clients and then paid
them kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its investigation, the SEC subpoenaed hundreds of
pages of documents from the football players union in March
relating to investment counseling and financial planning, according
to a union memo obtained by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   One area the SEC is focusing on involves agent referrals.
Because agent activities on college campuses are often highly
restricted, agents use financial planners as recruiters to solicit
new clients. If the player then signs with the agent, the planner
is given exclusive access to manage the player's financial
portfolio, plus a kickback that serves as a finder's fee, agents
say. Such a relationship could be fraud if the agent and the
planner do not disclose to the player the true nature of their
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The players association has cooperated with the SEC's
investigation and has even sought the help of agency officials in
outlining regulations to its agents, said Richard Berthelsen,
general counsel for union. Barry Barbash, director of the SEC's
division of investment management, which regulates financial
advisers, spoke in February to a meeting of agents at the NFL's
scouting combine, making sure they understood the rules.
</P>
<P>
   The damage done by problem agents goes beyond the financial
catastrophes suffered by the players. Players, agents and NFL
officials say the increased misdeeds by agents also take emotional
chunks out of players. Those distractions, and the anxiety and
anger that often come with them, can translate into poor play on
the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any distraction that has to do with their money affects a
player,'' said Giants General Manager Ernie Accorsi. ``When a
player has stable agents, it helps their careers. Players who have
bad agents have shorter careers.''
</P>
<P>
   Some teams actively stay away from players who have questionable
agents, NFL team executives said. One general manager who asked not
to be identified said his team removed a highly rated college
prospect from its draft board last year after discovering he had an
agent the team thought was unethical.
</P>
<P>
   The union thus is trying to enforce some standards and reforms.
Starting in February, McAfee said, the union counsel, anyone who
registers to become an agent must take a test similar to the one
that the players union gave to agents late in 1996. The test will
have questions on the collective bargaining agreement, salary cap
issues and free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Any agent who fails the test will not be certified, McAfee said.
Also beginning in February, current agents must take that same test
every year, and if they fail, those agents will be suspended and
possibly decertified. Any NFL team that negotiates with an agent
not sanctioned by the union is subject to a $10,000 fine from the
commissioner. Such testing will be the first of its kind in the
sports agent business.
</P>
<P>
   ``These steps are being taken to protect the players,'' McAfee
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many agents applaud the changes, but are uncertain what effect
they will have.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only people who can stop agents from doing the wrong
thing,'' said Blank, the agent, ``are the agents themselves.''

CONTROL OF BROWNS IS UP TO NFL 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a perception around the National Football League that
the group made up of banker Alfred Lerner, former San Francisco
49ers president Carmen Policy and former quarterback Bernie Kosar
is leading the pack to buy the expansion Cleveland Browns team,
which begins play next year.
</P>
<P>
   That notion was reinforced when Cleveland Mayor Michael White of
Cleveland endorsed the group at a news conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That perception, NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue says, is all
wrong. Tagliabue said in an interview Saturday that the playing
field is still very much level.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that all of a sudden someone has jumped way out in
front in Cleveland is wrong,'' Tagliabue said. ``Carmen is an
outstanding football man and we have tremendous respect for the
mayor. But the decision of which ownership group goes to Cleveland
is the decision of the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said he has had conversations with competing groups,
and even some NFL owners, who were concerned that because White
endorsed Lerner's group, it was the front-runner. Tagliabue said he
assured them that was not the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke with the mayor and he told me he was going to endorse
Lerner's group,'' Tagliabue said. ``I wanted to let him know that
the selection was the league's prerogative.''
</P>
<P>
   The other groups bidding for the Browns include one headed by
Cleveland developer Bart Wolstein, who has the backing of Hall of
Fame running back Jim Brown, and one headed by Cablevision chairman
Charles Dolan and his brother, Larry, Cleveland natives backed by
Bill Cosby and Don Shula.
</P>
<P>
   Other hopefuls include Cleveland Indians owner Dick Jacobs,
suburban Cleveland toy manufacturer Tom Murdough and New York
developer Howard Millstein, who is working with the former running
back Calvin Hill. Tagliabue said there are other potential bidders
who are not yet publicly known.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the selection process steams along. After a meeting
of NFL owners in Dallas, all applicants will have the opportunity
to make a presentation next month. Then, in early- to
mid-September, the winning group should be announced.

REGGIE WHITE'S FREEDOM TO SPEAK 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a Green Bay Packers fan named Jeff Monaghan
drove two hours from Chicago to Lambeau Field for the annual
shareholders meeting of his favorite team. He has just one share in
the Green Bay Packers, worth $200, but whether it is a single share
or 1,000, Monaghan is happy to own part of one of the best
franchises in sports.
</P>
<P>
   He also had a question to ask Packers majority owner Bob Harlan,
who was taking questions from the shareholders that day. Monaghan
wanted to ask about comments by the Packers' Pro Bowl lineman
Reggie White, who told Wisconsin legislators in March that gay life
styles violated Christian values.
</P>
<P>
   Monaghan, one of more than 20,000 shareholders in attendance,
worked his way to the microphone and told Harlan that he and his
same-sex partner were shareholders. Monaghan then said the Packers
should distance themselves from White's comments because people see
White as representing the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a member of the gay community, I felt like I had to speak
out about what White has been saying,'' said Monaghan, 35. ``I'm a
Christian like he is a Christian. All I hear from him is how gay
people are immoral. I think what he says is wrong and reflects on
the Packers.''
</P>
<P>
   White is well respected around the NFL, but his viewpoints have
put both himself and the league in an awkward position.
</P>
<P>
   White's recent comments beg this question: When does freedom of
speech cross the line from speaking your mind to possibly
embarrassing your team or an entire league?
</P>
<P>
   White ran into trouble when he appeared in a full-page
advertisement in USA Today on July 15 wearing his Packers uniform.
The ad was headlined, ``Toward an open debate on homosexual
behavior.'' Under the photo of White were the words, ``In defense
of free speech.'' It documented criticism White had received after
his speech in March. White appeared in an almost identical ad in
The Washington Times last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both advertisements violated an NFL policy that forbids use of
its logos without permission. The NFL says no request was made, and
it is very likely such a request would have been denied.
</P>
<P>
   White called the NFL late last week and said the appearance in
his Packers uniform was a mistake and would not happen again. That
satisfied the NFL, and a league spokesman said White's comments are
no longer an issue.
</P>
<P>
   But White will be appearing in more advertisements, minus his
uniform _ this time on television. He taped a commercial with his
wife, Sara, for a Honolulu political-action committee opposed to
same-sex marriage. White and his wife tell voters to support a
proposed state constitutional amendment giving legislators the
authority to ban same-sex marriages, according to a spokeswoman for
the committee.
</P>
<P>
   White, an ordained Baptist minister, has played in the Pro Bowl
for the last 12 seasons, and he gave a speech at a Honolulu church
last year while there for the game.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is a difficult one for the NFL Players have always
spoken their minds about various issues, from civil rights to the
Vietnam War to drug use. The Packers say that White is speaking as
an individual, not a team representative. White declined to discuss
the issue last week, saying he is focusing on football.
</P>
<P>
   David Smith, a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, a
gay-rights group based in Washington, told reporters last week that
``never once have we said that he does not have the right to say
whatever he wants. Our problem was that he was wearing a Packers
uniform to legitimize his message of discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   White will not be wearing his uniform in such ads again. But
there is little question that he will continue to speak his mind.

SAVVY DEALS HAVE MADE PADRES INTO REAL THREATS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite a last-place finish last season, the San Diego Padres
made not one trade involving a position player during the off
season. Not that general manager Kevin Towers wouldn't have made at
least one deal if the right one had presented itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the wintertime,'' Towers said with candor seldom exhibited
in sports, ``if we could have had a deal for Greg Vaughn, we
would've done it. If we felt it was a decent trade that moved some
salary and gave Ruben Rivera chance to play, we would have moved
Vaughn.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the trades a club doesn't make are the best trades of
all.
</P>
<P>
   No one knocked down Towers' door for Vaughn, who had batted .213
for the Padres in a full season, and now, nearly two-thirds of the
way through the season, he is one of the primary reasons the Padres
are having their best year ever and have almost as big a division
lead as the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The other division leaders were busy last winter bolstering
their lineups, the Yankees with Chili Davis, Chuck Knoblauch and
Scott Brosius; Cleveland with Kenny Lofton and Travis Fryman; Texas
with Kevin Elster; Atlanta with Andres Galarraga and Walt Weiss,
and Houston with Moises Alou and Carl Everett.
</P>
<P>
   But the Padres, even though they had gone from the second
first-place finish in their history to last, stuck with their
lineup, shoring up their pitching staff instead by trading for
Kevin Brown and bringing in a corps of new relievers.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting, Towers explained, was not the problem last year. The
Padres, in fact, had the second-best offensive team in the National
League.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some key injuries early to our rotation, and maybe we
overused our bullpen or they were exposed more,'' he said. ``When
we evaluated our team at the end of the year, we felt we didn't
need a major overhaul except for the bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   So the familiar names continue to populate the lineup _ Tony
Gwynn, Ken Caminiti, Wally Joyner, Steve Finley, Quilvio Veras. And
Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key thing is the emergence of Vaughn,'' Towers said. ``He
put up numbers at the halfway point that I would have been content
with at the end of the year. He's had big hits, critical hits. He's
also made some great defensive plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget that Towers would have welcomed a trade for Vaughn last
winter; the general manager had already traded the left filder
last summer, to the Yankees. Only the Yankees' decision to back out
of the deal kept Vaughn in San Diego. The Yankees said they did not
like the condition of Vaughn's right shoulder, but officials of
other teams suspected the Yankees decided they did not want to take
on the $11 million in Vaughn's contract. The decision, for whatever
reason, kept the Padres from getting Kenny Rogers, who is a 10-game
winner with Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt he's had operations on his shoulder, but we knew that
and they knew that going in,'' Towers said. ``It's not going to be
a normal shoulder. I had dinner with Rogers and his wife the night
he came in for his physical. He asked me if the deal was contingent
on physicals. I said yeah, and he said, `Well, this thing isn't
over yet.' He was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Remaining with the Padres and given a chance to play every day,
Vaughn has flourished, playing even better than the player the
Padres thought they were getting when they acquired him from
Milwaukee two years ago. He has played so well he is a leading
candidate for the most valuable player award. A .242 career hitter,
he has become a .300 hitter this season. Entering Saturday's games,
he had hit 36 home runs, third most in the league, and he had
driven in 88 runs, fourth most. He led the league with 62
extra-base hits, was second with 251 total bases and was second to
Mark McGwire with a .677 slugging percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's offensive surge has been especially critical because
Gwynn, Caminiti and Finley have not produced at their usual levels.
Gwynn entered Saturday with a .307 average, lower than any
season-ending average he has had in his other 16 years in the major
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres' pitchers, on the other hand, have contributed
significantly to the runaway division lead. Brown, picked up in the
Florida Marlins' fire sale, has a 12-3 record and a 2.57 earned run
average. Andy Ashby, having the best season of his seven-year
career, has a 14-5 record and a 2.49 ERA. Trevor Hoffman,
considered by many to be the league's best closer, has converted
all 32 of his save opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two starters,'' Towers said, ``have pitched us into the
seventh or eighth inning every outing and given our bullpen rest,
which they didn't have last year.'' Last year, he added, the
bullpen went from being one of the best to one of the worst. ``I
think a couple guys got complacent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gone from the 1997 relief corps are Sean Bergman, Doug Bochtler
and Tim Worrell. In their place are Dan Miceli, Donne Wall and
Brian Boehringer. Last week, the Padres reacquired Jim Bruske, whom
Los Angeles had claimed on waivers last October.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Padres are printing playoff tickets just yet, but
their post-season prospects have picked up in recent weeks with the
improvement of Joey Hamilton, their No. 3 starter. Hamilton had
virtually pitched himself onto the trading block, but then saved
his job with the Padres by winning his last four starts while
allowing only five earned runs in 27 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew he had it in him,'' Towers said. ``We just didn't know
how long we could wait. Once his name went out on the trade block,
he picked it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The general pitching improvement also has led to an improved
defense, Towers said. ``We made a lot of errors last year,'' he
said. ``Guys were playing back on their heels. This year we're
getting good pitching performances, and guys are on their toes.''
</P>
<P>
   The facts support Towers' assessment. Last year the Padres were
13th, next to last, in pitching and tied Montreal for last in
fielding. This season, the Padres are fourth in pitching and first
in fielding. And lots of games ahead in the NL West.

FATHERHOOD AND CIGARS: LOGIC STRIKES OUT  
 AS BATTERS SOAR, BONDS SAGS  
 THE OLD ALBERT BELLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Logic Strikes Out
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball has sent a message to minor league players
about childbirth. The message, unfortunately, was not completely
clear, so players might take it to mean they should not have
babies, or if they do have babies, they should not celebrate their
birth, or maybe it was just that if they have babies and celebrate,
they should not do it in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   In a tradition as American as baseball and apple pie, Lee
Tinsley, an outfielder with Ottawa of the International League,
handed out cigars to his teammates last month to celebrate the
birth of a child. Mike Thurman and Bob Henley, members of the
Montreal Expos' 40-man roster, put the cigars in their lockers at
Victory Field in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's tobacco police spotted the cigars and reported the
players to the commissioner's office. Shortly afterward, Thurman
and Henley received letters informing them they had been fined $300
each for violating minor league tobacco rules that ban possession
as well as use in ball parks and during team travel. They were also
offered medical assistance if they needed help to quit using
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Upon learning of the fines, the Players Association informed the
commissioner's office of the reason for the cigars and prevailed
upon the tobacco police to rescind the fines. The players, however,
were nevertheless reminded that they had violated the policy and
that withdrawal of the fines would not constitute a precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a request from the Players Association, the
commissioner's office has not told the players that it erred in
issuing the fines initially and that it is permissible to accept
cigars from happy fathers.
</P>
<P>
   As Batters Soar, Bonds Sags
</P>
<P>
   In a year of extraordinary hitting, Barry Bonds has become an
ordinary hitter. While Mark McGwire, Ken Griffey Jr. and others
capture the attention of fans everywhere, Bonds plays on
anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   His statistics at the All-Star Game break were camouflaged in
the list of also-rans _ .283, 18 home runs, 59 runs batted in _ and
he has slumped since. In 14 games after the break before Saturday,
Bonds hit .231, dropping his average to .276. Entering Saturday, 13
National League hitters had slugged more homers than Bonds (20),
and 15 had driven in more runs (68).
</P>
<P>
   The Old Albert Belle
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle lives. Except for news of his gambling losses,
which surfaced in Cleveland court cases, not much has been heard
about Belle since he moved to Chicago last year and lost some of
his hitting prowess. But Belle has resuscitated his hitting in the
past month. In his first 77 games this season, through June 24,
Belle batted .262, hit 16 home runs and drove in 59 runs. Then he
went on a 24-game tear, hitting .457, socking 14 home runs and
knocking in 31 runs. During that stretch, he hit 12 home runs in 14
games. Belle's surge of production raised his numbers to .309, 30
home runs and 90 RBI.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Capitol reopened for business Saturday as
police investigators reconstructed the movements of the gunman who
shot two police officers to death in a frightful bout of violence
in the summer tourist season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shooting at the United States Capitol yesterday was a
moment of savagery at the front door of American civilization,''
President Clinton said of the Friday gunfight just inside the East
Front entrance to the nation's lawmaking forum.
</P>
<P>
   A summer ritual became a demonstration of national resolve as
visitors in shorts and sneakers gingerly approached the gleaming,
white domed building once more. They were politely met by Capitol
guards, their badges tinged in black, who bolstered public
checkpoints that try to balance the needs of openness and wariness
in a democracy liberally tolerant of the individual's right to bear
arms.
</P>
<P>
   The suspected gunman, Russell Eugene Weston Jr., was reported in
critical condition after surgery for gunshot wounds of the chest,
back, left thigh and right arm. Capitol police shot him down after
he made his short, deadly foray amid the crowds of citizens
visiting the nation's centerpiece of law and order. Doctors at D.C.
General Hospital rated Weston's chances of survival at 50-50 after
four hours of surgery and heavy bleeding that left him heavily
sedated and thus far beyond questioning by investigators.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth person hit by gunfire, Angela Dickerson, 24, a tourist,
was released from George Washington University Hospital on Saturday
after being treated for wounds to the face and shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   When Weston was briefly questioned by emergency room doctors
Friday, he was ``combative'' in responding, the doctors said. A man
who closely matched the published likeness of Weston taken from his
driver's license approached a reporter for The New York Times, John
Broder, on Friday morning in Lafayette Park across the street from
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In the encounter, less than six hours before the shooting at the
Capitol, the man gestured at the White House and said in an even
but intense voice, ``Millions of people are going to die because of
the people you put in that house.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack led some lawmakers Saturday to reconsider security
measures at the Capitol. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott urged
construction of a new visitors center to bolster weapons checks of
the building's thousands of annual tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Lott praised the effectiveness of the current system, in which
the two police officers were slain after the gunman darted beyond a
weapons detector at the Capitol's East Front entrance. But he said
he would press hard to begin building a previously proposed Capitol
visitors center, which would impose initial security checks more
remote from the Capitol and be connected to the building by a
tunnel under the building's East Front plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is America,'' Lott said during a political trip to Little
Rock, Ark., citing just one of a number of ideas expected to
surface in a fresh look at the Capitol's physical security. ``We're
not going to let one crazy person drive us into a lockbox.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed by tourists at the Capitol Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that we continue the tours and not let
terrorists take away our freedom,'' said one visitor, DaLesia Boyd
of Richmond Va., exiting the Capitol beyond a dozen bouquets left
by the Document Door entrance where the gunman shot his way inside.
</P>
<P>
   One family, Janet and Dick Puglisi of Tampa, Fla. and their
children, Dominic, 9, and Janet, 12, had to duck behind a pillar
Friday as they waited to tour and suddenly heard the nearby gun
battle. They resolved to return and toured a more peaceful Capitol
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday was filled with fear,'' said Mrs. Puglisi, ``But
that was erased today as we were able to see the history and the
beauty of the building. We wanted to have that memory instead of
the one from yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott's proposal for a separate visitors center has been on the
drawing board for more than a decade. Whether it gathers momentum
or remains a talking point in the wake of the shootout remains to
be seen, but he said the center, which would also offer historic
exhibits and foul-weather shelter, has $25 million set aside for
possible construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Capitol, the people's house, is safe and secure,'' Lott
said. ``The security system worked,'' he said, describing the
proposal as offering an additional margin of caution against
gun-wielding Americans.
</P>
<P>
   A team of federal and city detectives led by the Metropolitan
Police Department's homicide squad maintained a cordon around the
blood-soaked crime scene at a leadership office suite east of the
Capitol's central Crypt and Great Rotunda.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on his defense and his history of unstable behavior,
Weston could face execution under federal law if convicted of the
murder of the two officers, Jacob Chestnut, 58, and John Gibson,
42, both 18-year veterans of the Capitol police.
</P>
<P>
   Weston, 41, has a record of paranoid ramblings and of having
made threatening remarks about the president and other government
officials. But he was rated a minor threat two years ago in an
initial Secret Service vetting of his case _ one among hundreds of
tips and complaints the service must attend to annually.
</P>
<P>
   Under heavy guard, Weston was formally arrested and charged
Saturday with homicide in the killing of an on-duty federal
officer. The authorities said he would be arraigned in absentia in
Washington, with additional charges likely.
</P>
<P>
   The bloody intrusion left the capital city in a withered mood.
The shock of a primal crime at the seat of law and order cut into
the Capitol's garrulous, dispassionate routine.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich fought back tears as he told of
visiting the families of the dead officers and announced the
creation of a charitable trust for their survivors, the Capitol
Police Memorial Fund.

   ``No terrorist, no deranged person, no act of violence will
block us from preserving our freedom and from keeping this building
open to people from all over the world,'' he said, speaking
sorrowfully in the Capitol. ``Those who hate or fear freedom
sometimes seek to attack this Capitol and those in it. Precisely
because they symbolize America, self-government, authority and the
process of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The Capitol police were a study in pride and sorrow as they
resumed their posts for the unthreatening majority that
respectfully streamed down halls of power lined Saturday with
mortal implications. More than the lawmakers who use the building
as a kind of national sound stage, it is the Capitol force of 1,200
police officers who give the Capitol complex of buildings a sense
of small-town community. They mundanely maintain their posts each
day and come to know the hordes of legislative staffers, news
reporters and other workers who come and go through the weapons
detectors of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Usually amiable but invariably vigilant, the police intercept
about 10 ordinary Americans a year packing guns. Most have gun
licenses in their home states and strap on their weapons for
vacation visits to this gun-ravaged city where handguns are
generally outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   The display of gunplay at the lawmakers' doorway knocked the
capital city's political agenda askew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look like an idiot,'' said Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y.,
reflecting on the ironies of his making a solitary speech on the
House floor about Puerto Rican nationalism and its violent excesses
in history just as the shootout erupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I start skipping pages,'' he declared Friday night on CNN's
Larry King Live, describing how he received word of the gunplay
just as he was about to mention the Puerto Rican radicals' shooting
attack on the House in 1954 when five lawmakers were wounded.
``Page after page, because I didn't want to bring up that subject
at that moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the dead Capitol guards, Clinton said to their survivors:
``Nothing we say can bring them back. But all Americans pray that
the power of a loving God and the comfort of family and friends
will with time ease your sorrow and swell your pride for loved ones
and the sacrifice they made for their fellow citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   As tourists arrived through the day beneath the Capitol flags
set at half-staff, Clinton addressed his appeal for a rededication
to lawfulness ``to every American who has been shaken by this
violent act, to the millions of parents who have taken your
children through those very same doors.''
</P>
<P>
   John Walker and his family, of Pekin, Ill., took the president
at his word. ``I had no objections in bringing my family today,''
Walker said amid the Capitol's renewed flow of citizens. ``There is
perhaps a somber mood, especially with the police force. I still
think it's safe.'' &QL;

AT CAPITOL, THE TOURISTS FILE IN AS USUAL

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Eric Driessen trained his video camera on the
expanse of the Capitol's Great Rotunda. He was not really listening
to the official tour guide, who spoke cheerily of the building's
architecture and history but made no mention of the bloody shootout
on Friday in which two Capitol police officers were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an ache-in-the-heart feeling because of what happened
yesterday,'' said Driessen, a 25-year-old psychology student
visiting from Milwaukee. ``The morbid curiosity in everyone would
like the tour guide to say something. It could give an emotional
closing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, ``it's better to carry on.''
</P>
<P>
   Driessen was one of thousands of tourists who carried on
Saturday, passing through the glass doors _ and metal detectors _
of ``the People's House,'' eager to assert that the resilient
American spirit was undiminished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it should be opened,'' said John King, 39, of
Gaithersburg, Md., as a child squiggled in his arms and he played
host to a flock of family and friends. ``Why should one person be
able to close the Capitol?'' he said of the gunman. ``You shouldn't
let him think that he had any impact on what happens here.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the number of tourists Saturday was expected to
be about 10,000, typical for a summer Saturday and about half the
number who visit on a summer weekday. ``Everyone here is
grieving,'' said Ted Daniel, the director of visitor services.
``But it's back to normal. It's a public building.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the tourists craned their necks in awe of the Rotunda's
180-foot-high canopy and mugged for cameras in front of the
larger-than-life statues of a dashing Jefferson and a benevolent
Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dome is made of cast iron,'' one tour guide intoned,
unwittingly capturing the sense of endurance that many visitors
invoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very safe here,'' said Lynn Chilton, 49, a professor of
nursing visiting from Columbus, Miss. ``I'm proud I live in a
country that allows us to visit our nation's Capitol. It's a symbol
of freedom. It's very sad, what happened, but Americans have a long
tradition of giving up their lives for what they believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   At first light Saturday morning, as Capitol workers prepared to
reopen the world's most-recognized symbol of democracy after
Friday's evacuation, a heavy solemnity hung in the air.
</P>
<P>
   A House aide on his way to work said he had mixed feelings about
business resuming at the Capitol. ``You don't want to give in to
it,'' he said of the pall that the gunman had cast over Capitol
Hill. ``But you don't want to show any disrespect, either.''
</P>
<P>
   A few visitors Saturday morning said they wished for some public
way to honor the fallen officers _ the first killed at the Capitol
in the line of duty _ and the Capitol itself. ``They should give it
a mourning period,'' said Mollie Frenza, 15, of Watertown, Conn.
She stood in the Rotunda, where the bodies of Presidents Kennedy
and Lincoln have lain in state, and she contemplated the dead
officers and wondered aloud about who got to decide who earns such
a worthy farewell.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sgt. Dan Nichols of the Capitol Police had said Friday night
that officers from other jurisdictions would cover for them
Saturday ``while we grieve and mourn.''
</P>
<P>
   But many were still at their posts, a strip of black crepe
stretched across their golden breast badges. Two officers stood
guard in front of the office of Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the
majority whip, where the gunfire erupted Friday. The office, now
known as ``the crime scene,'' was sealed off Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   By afternoon, tourists were surging across the open fairway in
front of the Capitol, and bouquets of flowers were piling up on the
steps.
</P>
<P>
   Notes attached to the flowers, most of them wildflowers wrapped
in cellophane, were addressed to the families of the slain
officers, Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson. ``Thank you, heroes, for
our freedom,'' one read.
</P>
<P>
   Frank and Pat Ledford, who live nearby in Virginia, rode their
bikes to the floral bounty. ``Nobody's safe from terrorism,
regardless of where they are,'' said Mrs. Ledford, as the scent of
lilies overpowered the air. ``You have to appreciate the freedom we
have when someone tries to take it away,'' her husband added.
</P>
<P>
   Some visitors, like Karen Santoro, 39, of Bernville, Pa., were
quick to dismiss it as an isolated incident. ``People like that,''
she said of the gunman, identified as Russell Eugene Weston Jr.,
``are always going to find some way of getting in and doing some
kind of damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Santoro said she felt relatively safe at the Capitol _ safer
than in New York City, where she had been visiting. ``Anything's
safer than that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other visitors acknowledged an uneasiness. ``It's kind of scary
being here,'' said Linda Asher of Harlan, Ky. ``But I'm glad
they're keeping it open. This is the people's building, it's their
government, and we should have the right to visit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Luo, 57, a librarian from China, was on his first trip to
the United States. Like many of Saturday's visitors, he had been
here Friday, only to be barred from the Capitol. He was thrilled to
be allowed inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``This building is famous for USA,'' Luo said. ``From this
building, we can know better about U.S. history.''

IN TRUCE, RIDERS AGREE TO CONTINUE TOUR WITHOUT DISRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By SAMUEL ABT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARPENTRAS, France _ A truce was declared Saturday morning in
the Tour de France, allowing the bicycle race to continue with no
threat of disruption by the riders like the two-hour strike staged
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Tour and the International Cycling Union, which
governs the sport, met with representatives of most of the 21
teams. Laurent Jalabert of France, who led the Friday protest, was
instrumental in initiating the meeting. Officials and riders
announced that they would carry on with the three-week race, which
finishes in Paris on Aug. 2, and hold further talks at the end of
the season in October.
</P>
<P>
   They also decided to coordinate _ a deliberately vague word _
policies to counter the spreading drug scandal that has blackened
the sport of professional bicycle racing and threatened the Tour
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Baal, first vice president of the cycling union, called
on the international news media to focus on the sporting aspect of
the race rather than the drug scandal that has caused one team,
Festina, to be expelled and another, TVM, to be placed on alert
that it may be expelled.
</P>
<P>
   When the Swiss star Alex Zuelle and his compatriot Laurent
Dufaux admitted Friday that they had taken part in an organized
system of doping, it meant that five of the nine Festina riders
have now confessed to taking the drugs. The drug, EPO
(erythropoietin), can be used to increase oxygen-carrying red blood
cell levels, which enhances endurance. In an interview published
Saturday in the Swiss newspaper Blick, Zuelle said drug use was
``part of the business'' of professional cycling.
</P>
<P>
   Still proclaiming their innocence are Richard Virenque, the
four-time King of the Mountains, his French compatriots Pascal
Herve and Didier Rous and the Australian Neil Stephens. Herve has
taken his denial a step further and plans to sue four publications
for naming him in a story over the trafficking of doping
substances, his lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Two officials of the TVM team, which is based in the
Netherlands, continued to be held in police custody in the Pyrenees
where they were seized Thursday. A search of the team's hotel
revealed ``doping materials'' and illegal masking agents, according
to a magistrate there.
</P>
<P>
   The officials are Cees Priem, the team's directeur sportif, or
coach, and Andrei Mihailov, the team doctor. Judicial authorities
announced Saturday morning that the two will be transferred Monday
to the French city of Rheims, where the police arrested two TVM
mechanics in March and found illegal performance-enhancing drugs in
the team car.
</P>
<P>
   Tour officials warned Saturday that if the TVM officials admit
that they doped their riders, the team will be expelled. Whether
this would set off another rider revolt was uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The protest Saturday was directed at the press, which has been
assiduous beyond what riders consider the call of duty. Jean-Marie
Leblanc, the Tour's director, singled out a French television
segment in which the garbage of the Asics team from Italy was
sifted and medical paraphernalia were supposedly found.
</P>
<P>
   Public reaction to the scandal was mixed. While there was an
immense crowd at the start, fans along the route appeared to be
fewer than usual, especially for a Saturday. An opinion poll
Saturday morning in the newspaper France-Soir said that 57 percent
of the respondents thought the Tour should continue and 39 percent
thought it should be halted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason the Tour shouldn't continue,'' Baal said
after the meeting. ``It's a demanding job and the riders deserve
our respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, the 147 riders of the 198 who started in
Dublin on July 11 rolled out of the Mediterranean resort of
Frontignan la Peyrade for the 13th stage, a 121-mile slog in the
heat to Carpentras in Provence. In a sprint finish among the six
survivors of a long 12-man breakaway, Daniele Nardello, an Italian
with Mapei, edged Vicente Garcia-Acosta, a Spaniard with Banesto.
Nardello was timed in 4 hours 32 minutes 46 seconds, a speed of 43
kilometers an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth across the line was Marty Jemison, a U.S. Postal Service
rider from Park City, Utah, who dug deep in the sprint but finished
a bicycle length behind.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Ullrich, a German with Telekom, continued to wear the
overall leader's yellow jersey by crossing the line in the main
pack, 2:51 behind the winner. There was no change in the top five
overall standings although Stephane Heulot, a Frenchman with La
Francaise des Jeux, rose from 20th place to eighth by participating
in the long breakaway.
</P>
<P>
   On the day's only climb, Ullrich, the defending champion,
benefited from the work of Bjarne Riis, his 34-year-old Danish
teammate and the 1996 Tour champion, who went to the front and
rallied Telekom when the German's rivals showed signs of attacking.

HANGING TIMES SQUARE SAFETY NET TAKES LONGER THAN EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Five days after New York City's worst construction
accident in a decade shut down the heart of Manhattan, Times Square
remained closed Saturday as construction executives and city
officials struggled to overcome unexpected complications in their
efforts to make the area safe.
</P>
<P>
   A swath of midtown Manhattan, from Fifth Avenue to Eighth
Avenue, remained cordoned off as workers continued to erect an
enormous sheath of nylon mesh over the partly collapsed scaffolding
on the Conde Nast building, at Broadway and 43rd Street. Once in
place, the mesh is intended to keep debris from falling to the
street as workers remove the broken and bent scaffolding from the
side of the building.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Saturday, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani confirmed
that investigators seeking a cause of the accident were focusing on
a section of the scaffolding that was supposed to have been
fastened by four large nuts and bolts. ``Three of the nuts are
missing,'' he said. ``Whether they were never put there, whether
they came loose or whether when the crane hit the tower it knocked
it loose, we don't know the answer to that yet.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, in what proved to be unduly optimistic predictions,
officials said that the mesh would be erected by early Saturday
afternoon. But by then, only one of 18 separate panels of mesh was
in place. Officials said that each of the others would require a
delicate process in which construction workers, dangling from a
crane at the top of the building, would be lowered slowly to unfurl
and secure the mesh.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the delay was the need to remove several
previously overlooked gas canisters and a large toolbox sitting on
the upper levels of the 47-story scaffold. If any of that equipment
had been knocked to the street _ including canisters that may have
been filled with explosive gas _ the accident could have turned
catastrophic, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's delayed because of loose equipment that had to be secured
that was found on one floor of the scaffolding,'' the mayor said,
adding that he hoped the curtain would be up by Sunday
</P>
<P>
   Police barricades kept crowds of bemused tourists and frustrated
office workers at bay on Saturday, despite earlier assurances by
senior city officials that enough of the clean-up would be
completed to open most of the area to vehicles and pedestrian
traffic by midday.
</P>
<P>
   So uncertain was the prognosis for intricate engineering work
that remained to be completed on the scaffolding and elevator shaft
that peeled away from the building on Tuesday morning, that
officials declined to go on record predicting when the area would
be reopened.
</P>
<P>
   One expert involved in the clean-up, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, predicted shortly after noon Saturday that streets and
sidewalks in the area would remain closed at least until nightfall,
and would probably not be open until after daybreak Sunday morning.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This is a tedious, dangerous procedure for construction
workers,'' said Richard Kielar, senior vice president for Tishman
Realty and Construction Co., the main contractor at the
construction site, where 100-person crews have been working in
shifts steadily since the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has never been done before, and no one can predict a
definite schedule,'' he said. ``We are asking for patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Central to the engineering effort Saturday was the painstaking
aerial feat of covering the construction site's 600-foot-high
scaffolding, bent so severely in places that it looked like warm
pasta, with mesh. ``It has to be a finely choreographed curtain
drop,'' said Sonny Mindel, a spokeswoman for the mayor's Office of
Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   Taking place at nearly the same height as low-lying clouds, and
blocks away from police barricades, the engineering work was beyond
the view of most onlookers in the area of Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   To out-of-towners, the spectacle of the police, firetrucks and
barricades was apparently just part of the thrill of a visit to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Danielle Bracco, a 35-year-old visitor from Italy, found it all
oddly reminiscent of his home in Genoa. ``We close the center,'' he
said. ``It's a problem for traffic, but you can live better because
people are walking.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Watkins, a 60-year-old Englishman, visiting Manhattan with
his wife, Sheila, said the efficiency of the police in the Times
Square area would be considered ``brilliant'' in his hometown of
Essex.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins said he had been prevented from strolling through Times
Square on Friday night, but still hoped to do so Saturday night.
``I'm sure tonight this will be exactly what we expected,'' he
said, in yet another prediction about the Times Square clean-up
that seemed certain to prove false.
</P>
<P>
   As the third day of the accident stretched into a fourth,
residents and business owners in the area, hundreds of whom had
been displaced, were far less sanguine than the tourists.
</P>
<P>
   A disaster relief center, established by the American Red Cross,
had been moved Saturday from the Martin Luther King Labor Center on
43rd Street just west of Eighth Avenue to the Red Cross offices at
66th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, and those showing up for
assistance were provided with a free shuttle bus to the new
location.

SPORTS COLUMN: JOYNER-KERSEE TAKES ONE LAST LEAP ON TWO STEADY
FEET
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (bl)  
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDWARDSVILLE, Ill. _ Jackie Joyner-Kersee was to take the final
long jump of her brilliant 15-year career here Saturday night.
There is talk of some overseas farewell. But in Joyner-Kersee's
mind, and in the minds of those who have followed her, the curtain
was to finally fall.
</P>
<P>
   There would be tears at Saturday's night's event, a grand prix
meet at the Southern Illinois campus here. It was a moment some
never thought would arrive, and others admitted they never
envisioned. Her father, Al Joyner, thought back on the days when
his little girl was a ballerina, then a gangly novice runner. He
recalled watching her take her first jump shot. Last week he
watched her compete in her final heptathlon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I ever asked is that she learn to stand on her
own two feet, and whatever decisions she made, she made them with
her heart,'' he said. ``I never figured her career would turn out
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   For Joyner-Kersee, Saturday night's final leap would mark a
symbolic jump away from the past, with its rich treasures of
Olympic medals and world championships, to a future filled with
great hopes and challenges. The biggest reason for retiring at the
age of 36 was not any physical breakdown; not the asthma that she
worked so hard to control. Her other activities simply crowded
training out the picture: there was the sports marketing business
to run, the sports agent business to learn, a new recreation center
to build. Most important, there is the sport of track and field to
save.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee is part of an era gone by of tough, hard-nosed
athletes with pioneering spirits. Her greatest challenge is to show
a younger generation how to survive, how to build endurance.
</P>
<P>
   In winning her final heptathlon at the Goodwill Games last week,
Joyner-Kersee left her young competitors with something to think
about. In the past she won with pure strength and stamina; she
outworked them and outlasted them. Last week, as she pushed herself
through the 800 meters just fast enough to outpoint Dedee Nathan,
she beat her opponents with her mind and her indomitable spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell Dedee and the others that it's not just the physical
aspect, it's the mental,'' she said. ``They thought that I was
going to drop out.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard work is only beginning. Joyner-Kersee is committed to
helping to rebuild and revitalize nearby East St. Louis, Ill., her
hometown, where she makes her home and operates her business.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the East St. Louis Board of Education, ignoring a hue
and cry, voted to close Lincoln High School. It was established in
1896 largely as a result of a protest by black children who were
not allowed to attend other East St. Louis public high schools. For
more than a century it educated large numbers of East St. Louis
children. Al Joyner was one, as was his son Al and his daughter,
Jackie. Miles Davis was another.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie led Lincoln to three Illinois state track and field
titles; she led the basketball team to a state championship. Her
portrait hangs in the school cafeteria. She led the battle against
the closing, once flying more than 3,000 miles to speak on behalf
of the school. But now that the decision is made, Joyner-Kersee
moves on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt sad, but if, in the long run, it's better for the kids,
then I'm for it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee is a builder. Tear down something old to build
something new. She is currently building that recreation center in
East St. Louis, one that will be larger than the Mary Brown
Community Center that helped catapult her to UCLA and international
fame. Her center, she hopes, will catapult a new generation of
young women into even greater stratospheres.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be an emptiness there,'' Gail Devers, the
100-meter gold medalist at the Atlanta Olympics and a longtime
friend, said of Joyner-Kersee's retirement. ``I don't know if
anyone grasps what she has done. Jackie had 15 great seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Carl Lewis _ and virtually no one else _ Joyner-Kersee gave
track and field a presence in the United States. But while Lewis
has withdrawn since retiring, Joyner-Kersee will play a more
visible and viable role in increasing the sport's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever way I can promote the sport, I'll do,'' she said.
``It's not really about me, Jackie Joyner-Kersee. I just hope the
sport doesn't get caught up in `the world's best athlete' and `the
world's fastest.' Instead, ask, `How can we make the sport better?'
It can't be me, me, me.''
</P>
<P>
   She will not cling to the past, and the past includes her
records. She lectured her father, who clung to her records and
mourned the ones that fell. ``She'd say, `Daddy, the records were
made to be broken,''' Al Joyner recalled. ```It's good for the
sport.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Joyner-Kersee jumped her final jump Saturday. She leaped
into the future, a future she has no fear of. She wants the new
buildings built, she wants the records broken, and she welcomes the
new day. This is the true mark of progress.

OLD HANDS STEP IN TO LEAD MOB FAMILY, INVESTIGATORS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.J.)  (js) 
 By SELWYN RAAB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With their boss, Vincent Gigante, imprisoned and his
replacement disabled by a heart attack, two veteran mob soldiers
have stepped in to oversee the Genovese crime family, the nation's
most powerful Mafia group, law-enforcement officials and
investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   Based on intelligence gleaned from court-authorized electronic
eavesdropping and from informers, the officials identified Lawrence
Dentico and Frank Illiano as the family's interim street bosses.
The officials said they believe that Gigante authorized the
leadership change after Dominick Cirillo, who had been running the
family for more than a year, had a heart attack in May.
</P>
<P>
   Dentico, who will turn 75 next month, and Illiano, 70, have been
linked to Mafia activities for more than 30 years by the
authorities in New York, New Jersey and the federal government. But
until recently, investigators had viewed both men as loyal soldiers
in the middle ranks of the Genovese family, not as potential
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, however, the racketeering convictions of
most of the gang's hierarchy, combined with Cirillo's illness, have
created a leadership vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Genovese power shift is viewed by law-enforcement
officials as another sign of the weakening of the Mafia's influence
in the metropolitan region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Organized crime is by no means dead,'' said Daniel Castleman,
the head of the investigation division in the Manhattan district
attorney's office. ``But crime families cannot function without
bosses or without leaders, and they also need sufficient time to
develop strategies for operating smoothly run organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the FBI and state agencies, the Genovese mobsters
are the country's largest Mafia faction, with 200-250 active
members. The gang is also supported by about 1,000 associates who
assist its illegal activities in the metropolitan region, New
England and Florida.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Investigators said that Dentico, who has an extensive background
in Genovese operations, probably has the lead part in the two-man
committee. The committee, the investigators added, is viewed as a
transitional measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dentico and Illiano appear to be the elder statesmen in the
family to keep things running until someone takes control,'' said
Robert Buccino, the deputy chief of the organized crime and
racketeering bureau in the New Jersey attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Most officials and investigators said that Dentico and Illiano
are expected to be advisers to the family's capos, or captains, who
supervise about 20 mob units, or crews. The investigators said that
Dentico and Illiano would probably try to resolve disputes between
crews or conflicts with the four other major Mafia families based
in the New York area.
</P>
<P>
   The family's financial bedrock is illegal gambling and loan
sharking in New York and New Jersey, which the authorities say
generate hundreds of millions of dollars in profits each year. The
family is also entrenched in labor racketeering and extortion in
the construction, waterfront and trucking industries in New York
and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   John Pritchard, who was in charge of the FBI's Genovese squad
from 1983 to 1987, said the promotions of Dentico and Illiano were
an attempt to maintain stability in the family. ``Many Mafia
families have had negative experiences in recent years of turning
over high positions to younger people,'' explained Pritchard, who
is Westchester County's inspector general. ``If the Cosa Nostra's
way of life is going to survive, they have to return to their
roots, and these old guys know how to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dentico, who is known in the underworld as Larry Fab, worked in
the 1950s for Vito Genovese, who was then the boss, and for whom
the family is named. He later was a top aide in New Jersey to Louis
Manna, the former consigliere, or No. 3 leader, when Gigante was in
charge.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949 and in 1952, Dentico served brief prison sentences for
selling heroin. He was convicted in 1981 on federal charges of
fraud and conspiracy involving the bribing of officials in Union
City, N.J., to rig public construction contracts. He served a
six-year prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an old-line, classy, top-shelf gangster,'' Joseph
Coffey, the former head of intelligence for New York state's
Organized Crime Task Force, said of Dentico. ``He has been a major
guy in the family for almost 40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Dentico has unlisted telephone numbers at homes in Yonkers and
in Seaside Park, N.J., and could not be reached to respond to the
accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Illiano, whose nickname is Punchy, lives in Brooklyn and was a
member of the notorious Gallo gang, a rebel unit in the Colombo
family, until he switched to the Genovese family in the mid-1970s,
according to Coffey. In 1974, during a war between rival Colombo
factions, Illiano was shot by a sniper in the right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Court records show that Illiano has been arrested 17 times on
charges including rape, assault and bookmaking, but he was
acquitted on most of the charges. His longest jail term was six
months. Confidential New York Police Department reports assert that
he has been active in gambling and loan-sharking rackets in
Brooklyn and that he is suspected of siphoning funds from street
fairs in Brooklyn controlled by the Genovese family.
</P>
<P>
   Illiano, who has an unlisted telephone number, could not be
contacted at his home in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Gigante, 70, is serving his 12-year term for racketeering and
conspiracy to commit murder at a federal prison medical center in
Springfield, Mo., because of a heart condition.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the prison sentence, federal and local authorities
believe he still exercises some authority over important decisions
in the Genovese family. Gigante, whose underworld nickname is Chin,
was known for his erratic behavior of wandering around Greenwich
Village in a bathrobe. His family has long maintained that he is
mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Cirillo, 69, suffered a heart attack on May 8 and was released
from a Manhattan hospital on May 24. His son, Nicholas Cirillo,
denied in a telephone interview that his father is a Mafia member.
He said the elder Cirillo is very sick and confined to his home in
the Country Club section of the Bronx.

<P>
   GENEVA _ Countering decades of promoting ``breast is best'' for
infant nutrition, the United Nations is issuing recommendations
intended to discourage women infected with the AIDS virus from
breast-feeding. The much-debated step aims at preventing
transmission of HIV, the AIDS virus, from mothers to babies in what
U.N. officials say is ``a runaway epidemic'' in many developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said they were reluctant to issue a blanket
warning because the decision should be left to each mother and
because no simple message could encompass the diversity of
environments where women live. Women may become stigmatized for not
breast-feeding in some cultures, and in some places alternatives
like formula can be unaffordable or unsafe, but the United Nations
wants that to change.
</P>
<P>
   In its directive, the United Nations said it was deeply
concerned that advising infected mothers not to breast-feed might
lead many mothers who are not infected to stop breast-feeding. To
reduce that possibility, it is advising governments to consider
bulk purchases of formula and other milk substitutes and to
dispense them mainly through prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The compelling reason for the action is the soaring HIV
infection rates in much of the world, said Dr. Tomris Turmen, a
U.N. official. As many as 70 percent of women at a prenatal clinic
in one city in Zimbabwe and 30 percent of women in major urban
areas in six African countries were found to be infected in recent
surveys.
</P>
<P>
   In desperately trying to deal with a crucial aspect of
mother-to-child transmission of HIV, the United Nations is up
against a fundamental, even ideological, pediatric practice. It
also risks stirring memories from decades past, when international
corporations promoted formula, and babies died after it was mixed
under unsanitary conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who have seen babies die needlessly because they were
fed with formula made from dirty water are worried that it might
happen again,'' said Dr. Susan Holck, an expert on breast-feeding
at the World Health Organization. But she added in an interview,
``Others say it is unethical to deliberately, consciously
breast-feed an infant milk that you know has HIV in it.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the affected areas, some anxious women and families are
beginning to demand that their governments provide information
about HIV and breast-feeding, and to offer alternatives, the United
Nations said. The rights of children to be born uninfected are also
being invoked for personal and public health reasons because the
overwhelming majority of infected children and adults in developing
countries are doomed to die from the lack of anti-HIV drugs and
standard health care. The epidemic has altered population
demographics in some African countries.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. directive advises that all HIV-infected women be
informed of the risks of breast-feeding before deciding whether to
let a newborn suckle. That goal, however, is hindered by the fact
that about 90 percent of infected people in developing countries do
not know they are infected. Worldwide, about one-third of pregnant
women receive no prenatal care and 60 percent deliver at home.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy has emerged after years of internal debate that
has sometimes been as emotional as scientific. Even now, the
guidelines are cause for some dispute within the three U.N.
agencies that put them out: UNAIDS, Unicef and WHO.
</P>
<P>
   The Dangers Presented by a `Double Message'
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Piot, executive director of UNAIDS, the agency that
has pushed hardest to discourage infected mothers to breast-feed,
said he was deeply concerned about sending to Third World countries
a ``double message'' that tells some women breast-feeding is best
for their babies but tells others that breast-feeding could kill
their babies.
</P>
<P>
   But ``we urgently need to find solutions'' to the AIDS epidemic
and these recommendations are part of that, Piot said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Odhiambo of Nairobi, Kenya, a representative of African
nongovernmental organizations, said at the recent 12th World AIDS
Conference in Geneva that ``it becomes unethical to continue not to
do anything about it knowing very well that children are getting
infected daily.''
</P>
<P>
   The directive comes at a critical time in the United Nations'
efforts to stop mother-to-child transmission of HIV. A primary
objective is applying on a broad scale findings from a study in
Thailand made public in February. The study showed that AZT pills
taken twice daily from the 36th week of pregnancy and continued
through labor halved the rate of transmission of the virus from
mother to child, to 9.2 percent from 18.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For scientific reasons, the study involved only women who did
not breast-feed. Studies to determine the effect of the
short-course AZT therapy on breast-feeding women and infants are
continuing and findings are not expected before the end of the year
at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   The use of a drug to prevent mother-to-child transmission has
been hailed as one of the rare triumphs in the war against AIDS.
However, concern is growing that it could become a hollow victory.
The very same babies spared HIV infection during pregnancy and
delivery could, just a few months later, become infected through
breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the elephant in the room,'' said Dr. Kevin De Cock, an
AIDS expert at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta, which helped pay for the Thai study.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the use of AZT during pregnancy and
delivery has helped to reduce greatly the incidence of HIV-infected
babies, and health workers hope to bring down the number to near
zero. In 1985, when HIV was first detected in mother's milk, U.S.
Public Health Service officials issued recommendations applicable
only to the United States that infected mothers not breast-feed.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. directive represents a significant change in policy, De
Cock said in a telephone interview. For large agencies that have
worked hard and long promoting breast-feeding ``to say that women
with HIV should avoid it, if possible, has been a very difficult
policy pill to swallow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, breast-feeding accounted for up to a third of the
600,000 children in the world who became HIV-infected, said Dr.
Bernhard Schwartlander, the chief epidemiologist for UNAIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of infection varies with the duration of
breast-feeding, which lasts up to two years.
</P>
<P>
   Why some babies breast-fed by infected mothers do not get
infected is not known. A partial answer is that a baby's risk of
becoming infected rises significantly if a woman becomes infected
during pregnancy or breast-feeding or has advanced AIDS, said Dr.
Philippe Van de Perre of Bobo-Dioulassa, Burkina Faso. He was among
the first scientists to recognize the hazards of HIV and
breast-feeding.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has prepared two books of guidelines that Van
de Perre and other leading experts developed after they met at WHO
last year. They are the first the United Nations has prepared for
dealing with breast-feeding and HIV, and they are being sent to all
governments. One book is for government and other policy-makers.
The other is for health care workers.
</P>
<P>
   Books of Guidelines Emphasize the Practical
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines spell out the need for training in the
nitty-gritty of providing alternatives to breast milk. If
commercial formula is not available, the guidelines describe what
to do to cow's milk to make it safe for babies to drink and how to
avoid mistakes that would endanger a baby.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasis is on practical advice, like the need to prepare a new
batch every time an infant is fed. For women using formula, the
guidelines explain the need to boil water and then not keep the
mixed formula in the hot sun for hours.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines reinforce the United Nations' unwavering belief
that breast-feeding is the easiest and best source of nutrition for
an infant, promotes bonding between the mother and infant, allows
for a newborn's natural reflex to suckle, provides longer spacing
between births, and protects against many life-threatening
infections _ other than HIV _ in the first few months of life.
</P>
<P>
   For infected mothers who choose not to breast-feed, the United
Nations recommends that all countries make safe, affordable
alternatives available. Among them are replacing mother's milk with
commercial infant formula; home-prepared formula made from fresh or
processed cow's or goat's milk that is diluted with sugar water;
HIV-negative wet nurses; breast-milk banks, and mother's milk that
has been heated to kill HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United Nations has policing powers in battle zones,
it lacks them in health matters and thus relies on moral suasion to
implement and enforce health directives and guidelines. Success
will ``depend on the political will'' of the United Nations and
countries, said Dr. Isabelle De Vincenzi, a UNAIDS epidemiologist.
</P>
<P>
   As a start, the United Nations intends to conduct pilot projects
in 11 countries in Africa and Asia where women have high infection
rates, and it is seeking donations from governments and foundations
to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the pilot projects is to expand HIV testing and
counseling to introduce replacement feeding, short-course AZT
therapy and a number of other measures.
</P>
<P>
   Financing is a major obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of providing breast milk substitutes to all women
needing them in Tanzania, for example, dwarfs the present health
budget in Tanzania and dwarfs all of Unicef's funds in Tanzania for
the next two years,'' David Alnwick, a Unicef official in New York
City, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He and other officials acknowledged that the recommendations
would not immediately save many lives.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Tulloch, a WHO official, said the United Nations
viewed its directive as part of a package intended to have
longer-term benefits. Doctors and local health officials will gain
leverage to obtain more counseling, testing and resources for
women. The hope is that as more women learn they are infected and
talk to others in the community, the HIV problem will become more
visible and lead to political action to raise the quality of
maternal health services.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines also spell out the risks of not breast-feeding,
which are particularly great for women in communities where
producing babies is considered a woman's obligation and a symbol of
status. But many women in Africa and elsewhere have been thrown out
of their homes when families have learned that they carry HIV.
Thus, a grave concern is the stigmatization of an infected mother
who does not breast-feed and is seen using bottles or cups to feed
an infant.
</P>
<P>
   Experts, while criticizing the lack of strong studies, also
worry that not breast-feeding could cause psychological harm to
mothers and infants.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Felicity Savage, a WHO official, expressed extreme caution
about the new guidelines, citing the risk of contamination of
breast milk alternatives in areas that lack clean water and loss of
nutrients if a woman mixes water and formula inaccurately. Such
hazards could ``endanger a lot of lives that would otherwise not
have been at risk at all,'' and could produce more deaths among
those receiving replacement feedings than AIDS among those
breast-fed by infected women, Savage said.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1985, many scientists have documented that HIV can be
transmitted through mother's milk, but for years U.N. officials
were skeptical about the public health significance of the finding.
In 1992, the United Nations first confirmed that mother's milk
could transmit the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   That year, WHO recommended that, in most developing countries,
where malnutrition and infectious diseases remain the paramount
threat to infants, ``breast-feeding should remain the standard
advice to pregnant women, including those who are known to be
HIV-infected, because their baby's risk of becoming infected
through breast milk is likely to be lower than its risk of dying
from other causes if deprived of breast-feeding.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1992 through last month, up to 1 million babies in the
world had become HIV-infected through breast-feeding, Schwartlander
said.
</P>
<P>
   WHO Expert Cites Paucity of Information
</P>
<P>
   Holck, the WHO expert, said she ``was struck by how much denial
there was around 1990 of the evidence we had that HIV could be
transmitted through breast-feeding.'' Much of the denial, Holck
said, ``undoubtedly was fed by people who had invested so much in
promoting breast-feeding and feared what confirmation of that
transmission might do to the gains that were made in
breast-feeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Holck also said that she ``was struck then by the lack of
information on the risk of not breast-feeding, and that is still
the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Alnwick of Unicef said ``it is fair to say that the U.N. did not
think that alternatives to breast-feeding were practical in any
particular sense.`
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are seeking drugs and other ways to make it safe for
women with HIV to breast-feed, at least for a time. With such
safeguards, Alnwick said, ``three months' breast-feeding would be a
lot better for an infant than no breast-feeding at all.''

   RIMINI, Mont. _ Russell Eugene Weston Jr. was a quiet loner who
drifted back and forth between a cabin in the Montana mountains and
a modest house in rural Illinois, all the while becoming an
increasingly troubled figure who eventually was hospitalized two
years ago after writing ``threatening letters'' to government
officials, according to officials and people who knew him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had something against'' President Clinton personally and
the government, said Jerry Swihart, an employee of the Warm Springs
State Mental Hospital. ``He was possessed by it. He went on and
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Weston, the suspect in the Capitol building shootout that killed
two police officers on Friday, was involuntarily committed to Warm
Springs by court order on Oct. 11, 1996, according to Andrew
Malcolm, a spokesman for Gov. Marc Racicot of Montana. He was
released on Dec. 2, 1996, because the hospital ``deemed him no
longer a threat to himself or others,'' Malcolm said. After Weston
was released, a hospital employee drove him to his cabin here with
the understanding that he would close it for the winter and return
to his parents' home outside Valmeyer, Ill., where he had a series
of appointments at a mental health center in nearby Waterloo. But
it remained unclear on Saturday whether he kept those appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that year, Weston's anti-government statements,
including an accusation that officials had planted land mines on
his property in Montana, were virulent enough to attract the
attention of the Secret Service, federal officials said. Weston was
questioned by agents in April 1996, and the service's Presidential
Protective Detail has maintained a slim file on him ever since.
</P>
<P>
   That May, the Secret Service classified him as a minor threat _
a probably harmless but potentially dangerous man, law-enforcement
officials said. The Secret Service made the assessment after
reviewing interviews with Weston conducted by local mental health
authorities, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The portrait of the 41-year-old Weston emerging from interviews
with the few people who noticed him in the two tiny towns where he
lived _ Rimini, a former gold mining hamlet 17 miles southwest of
Helena, Montana's capital, and Valmeyer, a Mississippi River town
south of St. Louis _ was of a withdrawn, introverted loner who grew
increasingly angry and alienated over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when invitation letters went out for a 20-year reunion
of the 63 members of his 1974 graduating class at Valmeyer High
School, his came back scrawled with obscenities and a warning never
to contact him again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a few expletives,'' said Gary Baum, whose wife,
Sandy, was the class president. ``Basically, he said you could put
the letter where the sun doesn't shine.''
</P>
<P>
   The anger apparently exploded when he drove his battered red
pickup truck to Washington, officials said, and stormed past a
metal detector into the Capitol, firing his father's .38-caliber
revolver and killing the two officers.
</P>
<P>
   In Rimini, an old prospector's haunt in a thickly forested
valley on the eastern shoulder of the Continental Divide _ not far
from where the convicted Unabomber, Theodore Kaczynski, lived
unremarked upon by his neighbors _ residents said they generally
steered clear of Weston but thought he was harmless.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was on his medication, he was fine, he would wave and
talk,'' said May Moore, a longtime resident, as she stood Saturday
morning on the village's main street, a dirt road leading to the
Helena National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was off the medication, he was paranoid, you just
didn't know,'' Mrs. Moore said as FBI agents began to search the
cabin where Weston spent most of his summers. ``His grandmother and
his parents used to check in on him with the lady next door.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Moore, her husband, pointed to his 9-foot television
satellite dish and recalled that Weston used to accuse him of
aiming it at his cabin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would say, `That's pointing at my house, they're watching
me,''' said Moore, the settlement's unofficial mayor, who added
that while he was not afraid of Weston, he generally preferred to
avoid him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was a little leery,'' he said. ``He was never
violent, but you never know.''

</P>
<P>
   Weston was arrested in Helena on suspicion of selling drugs on
Aug. 7, 1991, but no formal charges were filed.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20 miles south of here, near Clancey, Weston had an earlier
run-in with the authorities, recalled Tim Campbell, undersheriff of
Jefferson County.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, Weston threatened the undersheriff and several
other county officials. ``He confronted me and said something along
the lines of, `You better watch your back,''' Campbell said on
Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he never made it intimidation. He knew where to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The threats stemmed from an incident in 1983 when an 86-year-old
woman, Dorothy Cole, hit Weston on the head with her cane while
trying to evict him from a cabin he was renting from her. Similar
to the cabin here, it had no sewer hookup.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Weston sued Mrs. Cole, but the suit was thrown out on
the grounds that he had waited too long _ three years _ to file. He
appealed to the Montana Supreme Court, but the lower court ruling
was upheld in 1982. At the time, Campbell said Weston embarked on a
letter-writing campaign to local newspapers and to Montana's
governor and ``even called a radio talk show.'' He was angry at
Jefferson County officials because they refused to file charges in
the assault. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Around Valmeyer, whose population of about 900 was cut in half
by the great flood of 1993, Weston, known as Rusty, was remembered
only vaguely; his family lived out in a rural, unincorporated area
a half dozen miles north of town. Townspeople said he moved to
Montana soon after getting out of high school in 1974 and only
returned once in a while to visit his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand, it was the early '70s when we were in
high school and graduated,'' said Baum, his old classmate. ``It was
the end of the Vietnam War. We were way out in the sticks and a
little bit behind the rest of the country with the whole drug
scene.''
</P>
<P>
   He remembered Weston from the seventh grade on, mostly as ``one
of the forgotten middle kids, kind of on the fat side, not a sports
guy, never went out with any girls. Only had a couple of friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Then around the 11th grade, Baum recalled, ``he started getting
into the drug scene, smoking marijuana. He and a group of other
kids, they all went out to this place in Montana. They wanted to
get away, to be free. It was to be some kind of self-sufficient
commune. I heard he had a gold claim out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Knobloch, who was a senior at the 200-student high school
in 1974, when Weston was a freshman, said, ``He was not a person
who participated in sports or music or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just a quiet, shy kid,'' she remembered after leafing
through her high school yearbook. ``Not a troublemaker. He didn't
stand out as anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Knobloch said her husband, Dennis, a high school classmate
who as mayor and later village administrator was a major force in
rebuilding the destroyed town above the flood plain, could not
remember having seen Weston since they graduated. But she, too,
remembered the talk about Weston falling in with the clique of
marijuana smokers that developed in the mid-'70s.
</P>
<P>
   Alberta Reichman, whose son, Perry, went to school with Weston,
remembered him as ``a chunky kid in school, with curly hair''
looking different from the gaunt visage on the Montana license she
saw on television. She said she thought he had left town soon after
he got out of school.
</P>
<P>
   In the Montana mountains on Saturday, a bomb disposal squad from
the Air Force was searching through the lot where Weston lived.
April Callahan, Weston's sister, bought the property, a former
gold-mining claim known as the Minie Lea Lode, in the early 1990s.
The lot, on the site of an old railroad turntable, has three
weather-beaten shacks and is littered with three trucks and a car.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Siewert, 54, a self-employed construction worker and
prospector, whose land abuts the lot, said he last saw Weston in
mid-June. He said he had talked to Weston several times over the
last four years. Conversations always started out normally, he
said, but quickly turned to talk that the CIA and FBI were out to
kill him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was paranoid but not violent,'' Siewert said. ``Everyone
and everything was out to get him. Satellite dishes were messing up
his mind. He said he had been an inside member of the Kennedy clan,
and for some reason the FBI and CIA were out to assassinate him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was paranoid about people breaking into his house. I had
some surveyors up here setting some pins on the land, and he
claimed they broke into his house and were going through his stuff.
I checked with the surveyor, and he said no way.''
</P>
<P>
   Rimini grew up as a mining town in the 1880s with a population
that once numbered 3,000, but it has dwindled to about 30 residents
in the winter. But with its 5,300-foot altitude, offering cool air,
meadows of clover and daisies and hillsides of spruce and lodgepole
pine, the village is undergoing a minor boom in the construction of
log cabins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community is changing, where people like him are
leaving,'' said Ted Topolski, a real estate investor here,
referring to Weston. ``It is becoming a bedroom community for
Helena. There are plans for a ski resort.''
</P>
<P>
   In Valmeyer, people who knew Weston said that when he returned
home in recent years, he mainly kept to himself. He spent much of
his time in the family home on B Road, an isolated rural route
where the frame houses are stitched together by vast fields of
soybeans and corn.
</P>
<P>
   He spent a lot of time gardening and chopping up some of the
hundreds of dead trees that are the detritus of the flood of 1993,
when virtually all of Valmeyer was washed away and the town, to
save itself, moved to higher ground. Unlike many of their
neighbors, the Westons, who have lived for at least 50 years on the
land here, about six miles north of Valmeyer, stayed behind after
the flood.
</P>
<P>
   Weston was close with his sister, Ms. Callahan, whose nickname
was Becky. They frequently talked on the phone, said Joe
Schellhardt, who knew Weston when he was younger. Ms. Callahan and
her husband, Ron, live in a pale yellow frame house with an
American flag out front, next door to a grain elevator, in Fults, a
two-street town about 15 miles from the family home. They were not
home on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Schellhardt and neighbors of Ms. Callahan in Fults also said
that Weston and a group of other young men, including Schellhardt's
brother Michael, headed to Montana soon after high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got menial jobs and lived in a cabin,'' Schellhardt said.
``They went to have fun like young men do. No women went.''

BASEBALL COLUMN: RETURN OF THE PRODIGAL YANKEE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He's the prodigal Yankee, banned for two decades from
Old-Timers' Day at Yankee Stadium because he had collaborated in
writing the book ``Ball Four,'' which dared to tell that some
teammates, notably Mickey Mantle, took a drink and peeped at pretty
women.
</P>
<P>
   Still grinning mischievously at the age of 59, Jim Bouton
quietly returned Saturday to a burst of cheers when introduced with
the other Yankee old-timers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't noticed any coolness by anybody toward me,'' he had
said at a locker where his Yankee uniform had No. 56 on the back.
``It's been great.''
</P>
<P>
   His appearance was prompted by his 34-year-old son Michael's
article in The New York Times on Father's Day wishing for him and
Yogi Berra to stand together.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Sunday morning,'' Bouton recalled, ``my 33-year-old son,
David, called and asked me if I'd seen The Times. I told him I
hadn't gone out to get the paper yet, and he said, `I'm going to
read it to you.' But after the first few sentences, he was crying.
So was I.''
</P>
<P>
   What David had read was: ``Although I know an invitation to
attend Old-Timers' Day is an honor he can live without, it is what
I wish for him this year. You see, this past August my sister
Laurie died in an automobile crash at the age of 31. She was
beautiful and sweet. And as tough at it is to lose a sibling, I
cannot even fathom the loss my parents must feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the article, Michael wrote: ``I see this as an
opportunity to get my father some extra hugs at a time in his life
when he could use all the hugs he can get. ... I am not asking for
any favors, just reconsideration. That is all. Life is short. Time
is at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner reconsidered. Joe Schillan, the Old-Timers'
Day coordinator, phoned Jim Bouton, who is now a motivational
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Joe, `What brought this on?''' Bouton said of their
conversation, ``and he said: `Your son is right. It's time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yogi Berra, however, did not reconsider his vow to boycott
Yankee Stadium as long as Steinbrenner is the team's principal
owner.
</P>
<P>
   Told last Monday that Bouton would be there, Berra grunted,
``That was nice of him,'' meaning Steinbrenner. ``But he,'' meaning
Steinbrenner, ``don't even know who he is,'' meaning Bouton, who as
a Yankee right-hander had a 21-7 record in 1963 and an 18-13 record
in 1964 (when Berra was the manager).
</P>
<P>
   Although some Yankees and other major-league players apparently
resented ``Ball Four,'' none confronted Bouton.
</P>
<P>
   ``No ballplayer from any team,'' Bouton said, ``ever came up to
me and said, `You shouldn't have written what you did.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Commissioner Bowie Kuhn wanted Bouton to sign a statement in
1970 apologizing for the book. Bouton refused.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the resentment was there. Mantle once told Herb Gluck,
his collaborator on his autobiography, ``Don't mention Bouton's
name.'' But when Mantle's son, Billy, died in 1991, Bouton wrote
him a letter of condolence, adding, ``I hope you're feeling OK
about `Ball Four.''' Several days later, there was a message on
Bouton's answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recorded the tape,'' Bouton said. ``Mick thanked me for the
letter, then he said, `I'm OK about ``Ball Four.'' It doesn't
bother me that much anymore. And one more thing, I'm not the reason
you don't get invited back to Old-Timers' Day. I never said that to
anybody.' After Mick died in 1995, I was really glad I had kept
that tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mick hung out with Whitey Ford and when they wrote their books
in the late '70s, they wrote some of the same stories, plus some
new ones. Mick was the most beloved guy on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a rookie, Mick got me once. He said he was raffling
off a ham, everybody put in $5 and take a number. After he pulled
my number out of the hat, I said, `Where's the ham? When do I get
the ham?' And he said, `There is no ham.' I said, `What do you mean
there's no ham?' He just laughed and said, `That's one of the
hazards of a game of chance.'''
</P>
<P>
   At spring training a year or two later, several Yankees had
their annual fishing contest at a Florida lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pot was about $150, with two prizes: for the biggest fish
and the most fish,'' Bouton recalled. ``Mickey and Whitey usually
won, they were good fishermen, but on the way to the lake Phil Linz
and I drove by this old fish store. We wanted to buy some fish, but
they didn't have any. Then we spotted this enormous frozen sea bass
in a cooler.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we asked how much, the owner said, `That's been there for
three years; take it.' The fish had to be 30 inches long and 25
pounds. We knew we had won the prize for the biggest fish. Out on
the lake, we caught nothing, but when we got back around noon, we
lugged this big fish off the boat and put it on the grass. Phil and
I split half the pot.''
</P>
<P>
   Two or three days later, Mantle asked Bouton about that big
fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mick said, `How come your fish was gray and all the other fish
were green?''' Bouton recalled with that mischievous laugh. ``And I
said, `Oh, we caught it early in the morning.'''
</P>
<P>
   And on Saturday Bouton again was in Yankee Stadium, which might
be abandoned in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be rude to my host,'' Bouton said, alluding to
Steinbrenner, ``but this is a historic building; it should be a
national landmark.''
</P>
<P>
   He had about 50 relatives and friends watching from the upper
deck in right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half a dozen are Laurie's girlfriends; we see them every so
often,'' he said. ``I'm still feeling the pain of Laurie's death,
but the reason I'm here is that Laurie's not here. Somehow we think
Laurie pulled this off.''

A DEMOCRAT SHOWS HIS ICONOCLASTIC SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
 (js) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Rev. Floyd Flake turned up at the summer meeting
of the Republican National Committee Saturday morning, preaching
capitalism, competition for public schools and individual
responsibility to an audience of Republicans that practically
glowed in the symbolism of the moment. The speech at the Plaza
Hotel suggested Flake's emerging status as an iconoclast in New
York politics.
</P>
<P>
   Flake is a Democrat, a former member of Congress, a prominent
New York black leader and a possible mayoral candidate for 2001. He
mixed effusive praise for New York's Republican politicians _ in
particular, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, who is up for re-election this
year, and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani _ with Republican-flavored
prescriptions for urban problems in a speech that seemed to both
please and surprise this partisan breakfast audience from across
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, brother, you might not yet be a Republican, but you just
gave one of the best articulations of Republican principal and
values that we've had at this meeting,'' Jim Nicholson, the
national Republican chairman, declared once the 40-second ovation
began to fade.
</P>
<P>
   It was, for the Republican Party, a political coup, if a modest
one: One of the nation's better-known black Democrats speaking to a
nearly all-white audience of Republican leaders who, as a rule,
have not paid much attention to the problems of urban areas. He was
the first Democrat to address a Republican national meeting since
1984, when Jeane Kirkpatrick, who has since changed parties, spoke
about national security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   For Flake, the senior pastor of the Allen African Methodist
Episcopal Church in Jamaica, Queens, it was fresh evidence of the
political fluidity he has displayed in recent years, most memorably
when he endorsed Giuliani for re-election last year. A number of
the ideas he advocated Saturday _ in particular, giving parents
vouchers to send their children to private schools if they choose _
are ideological touchstones for Republican leaders, and unpopular
among many Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to get billions of dollars in federal money,
if you cannot educate every child, we will develop an alternative
that will give you the kind of competition that will force you to
either educate or cease to exist,'' Flake said. ``It's your
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans cheered.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson, in an interview, left little doubt that he hoped that
Flake might follow his Republican words with a change in party
registration. A day earlier, the party had heard from Herman
Badillo, the first Puerto Rican elected to Congress, who joined the
Republican Party with some fanfare last month.
</P>
<P>
   And publicly, at least, Flake teased his hosts about the
prospect that he was available. Every time he appeared with a
Republican, Flake said, someone asked if he was about to convert.
``We will leave that as an open question,'' Flake said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said in an interview that switching parties is
highly unlikely, at least for now. ``Not in the current
atmosphere,'' Flake said. ``I think there's still a great deal that
the party would have to do to demonstrate that it is in fact
serious about having African-Americans as part of the party.''

 NEW YORK: the party.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I think they are amenable,'' he added of the Republicans.
``But I think they have been so totally out of touch with the
African-American community that they are having difficulty finding
the kind of communication that speaks to the concerns of those
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Flake, whose church has been the beneficiary of large grants
from the city, state and federal governments for social services
and other programs, said his main motivation in appearing before
the Republicans was to increase his influence with all the parties.
</P>
<P>
   The African-American community, Flake said, should not ``allow
itself to be totally amenable to one party, given that America is
represented by a two-party system,'' he said. ``I think it's
important to maintain open dialogues and expansive communications
with both of the parties. So if one or the other is not in power,
there is still access to the political process.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic leaders expressed private concern about Flake's
willingness to, in effect, help the Republicans by lending his name
to their candidates and their efforts. But New York Democratic
leaders said they had no complaint with his appearance at the
Republicans' summer meeting, or with his inviting Republican
leaders to come to morning services at his church on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A discussion of ideas is best for everybody,'' said Andy
Grossman, the campaign coordinator for the state Democratic
Committee. ``I don't think it says anything bad about the
Democratic Party. And I don't think it says anything good about the
Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Flake's reservations about the Republican Party, he did
not express them during his 27-minute speech. He spoke warmly of
working with Gov. George Pataki in an unsuccessful attempt to pass
charter-school legislation in Albany this year. The legislation
would have let parents, teachers and others start independent
schools within the public school system, but outside the control of
school districts.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled _ as if sharing war stories with political comrades
_ the Democratic criticism he endured after he endorsed Giuliani,
adding, ``I was proud to endorse him then and I continue to give
him my full support.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And my best friend in all the world in politics is Al
D'Amato,'' he said, adding, ``We were friends before politics, we
are friends in politics, we will be friends after politics.''
</P>
<P>
   His embrace of Republicans went beyond their candidates. He
presented his own upbringing, where his parents put their children
to work at a young age, as evidence that work was the best way to
insure success. ``We must instill the will to work in every
individual,'' he said. ``Because society cannot afford to take care
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   His contention clearly had resonance with this audience, as did
his recollection of an upbringing in which his parents never took
welfare, and taught their children the value of work and faith.
``Every Sunday morning, whether or not you partied Saturday night,
you got up Sunday morning and went to Sunday school and church,''
he said. ``You might have slept in church, but you were there.''
</P>
<P>
   He urged the creation of programs that invest money in
commercial and residential development. He strongly urged against
relaxing education standards to help students graduate.
</P>
<P>
   His main appeal, though, was for school vouchers, an issue with
which he has been identified. Many Democrats have opposed vouchers,
out of fear that they would lead to the decline of urban schools as
parents take their children out of them. Flake articulated the
Republican position, that the competition introduced by vouchers
would improve the performance of public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Later in Saturday's session, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New
Jersey became the third moderate Republican leader from the
Northeast to suggest, if obliquely, that party leaders should
disregard candidates' views on such contentious issues as abortion
in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whitman, who has been criticized by many conservative
Republicans for her strong support of abortion rights, said there
was less division in the party than portrayed by the news media.
She said it was in the party's interest to avoid such
disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   Her remarks were reminiscent of what Giuliani said on Friday.
Like the mayor, Mrs. Whitman never referred specifically to
abortion.

<P>
   DEL MAR, Calif. _ They are brothers-in-law and boyhood friends
who play against each other in the same division of the National
Football League: John Lynch of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and John
Allred of the Chicago Bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the black-and-blue Central,'' said Lynch, the
Buccaneers' All-Pro strong safety, referring to the division's
nickname. ``Power football in the NFL. Before Johnny'' _ a
throwback tight end _ ``was drafted by the Bears in the spring of
'97, I was pulling for him to be on my team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Dungy said we'd take him if he lasted until the third
round. But it was over in the second, and then it hit me that we'd
be playing against each other twice during the season.''
</P>
<P>
   That seemed somehow fitting. Lynch and Allred played in San
Diego football and baseball leagues where they were indoctrinated
in smash-mouth football, as they called it. Both players were
schoolboy heroes here at Torrey Pines High School and went on to
star in college _ Lynch at Stanford, and Allred at Southern
California. Allred was like a brother to Lynch, even before Lynch
married Allred's sister Linda on Feb. 12, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are really good friends,'' said Ann Allred, John's
mother.
</P>
<P>
   And now they're both in the NFL, in the same division. Lynch, at
26, three years older than Allred, is going into his sixth year
with Tampa Bay. Allred is entering his second season with the
Bears.
</P>
<P>
   But they will have to go some way to top their dramatic first
NFL meeting, on Nov. 23 last season when Tampa Bay played at
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked a lot that week,'' Lynch said. ``We did a couple of
radio shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Then in the second quarter, Lynch, who would lead the defensive
backs in the game with a career-best 15 tackles, gave Allred a
brotherly welcome to the league. Lynch is 6 feet 2 inches and 210
pounds; Allred is 6-4 and 245 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught the ball,'' Allred said of a pass in the flat from
Bears quarterback Erik Kramer. ``I saw John. I'm not one to juke or
make a move. I just run straight ahead and tuck the ball in to me.
He hits me. It wasn't a painful hit. Not the hardest hit, but the
hit that gets you in the right place. It got me woozy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch tried to make sure he was all right, but his teammates
pulled him back to the huddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `What have I done?''' said Lynch. ``He was face
down. Limp. Our families were together in a stadium box. It seemed
an eternity. My teammates wouldn't let me go over to him. Finally,
my teammate let me go and I'm standing over him and he gives me
this smile _ the smile that says, `You'll get yours.''' The smile
said a lot to Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy, and then of course, the jokes started flying from
both huddles, the wife and mother-in-law ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch and Allred not only share family ties and a certain
football toughness, but they are also sincere about sharing their
good fortune. Both give part of their salaries to charities in
Tampa and Chicago. During the 1998 Super Bowl week, they put on a
golf tournament that raised $300,000 for the San Diego Boys and
Girls Clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any young player in the NFL is fortunate,'' Lynch said. ``I
pinch myself every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL is as healthy as ever and it's a good time to be young
and be a player in a league that is so strong with owners, fans,
and the new TV deal. There's a lot of money out there for Johnny
and myself. But that's not why we play. We love the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Allred added: ``It's dangerous, but then anything you do is
dangerous. Tight end is a hard position when you're blocking a
290-pounder by yourself and you have to outrun a guy like John and
catch the ball like a receiver. You always have to do more to stay
on the field and compete.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   So the brothers-in-law come home to Del Mar during the off
season and train at the Therapy, Health and Education Athletic
Training Camp, a Rocky Balboa-styled program devised by Pete
Egoscue.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative camp starts in May and continues for two months.
Athletes from all sports and any level participate together,
running hills, scaling fences, throwing logs, crawling, vaulting
and hopping under the taskmaster's eye of Harland Svare, supervisor
of the training facility's summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been working with both of them since they were about 13
years old,'' said Svare, who was a Giants linebacker from 1955 to
1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lynch is instinctively around the ball, putting pressure on
the line of scrimmage. Allred has always been a tough guy. He has
the size requirement and his quickness level stays up. Both Lynch
and Allred are prototype NFL players.''
</P>
<P>
   And they both give credit to their parents for instilling a
sense of responsibility, on and off the field. Lynch's father John,
played offensive tackle for the University of Arizona and had a
brief moment as a linebacker with the Pittsburgh Steelers, before
investing in radio stations in California. Allred's father played
college football and owns a real estate development company in San
Diego. Both mothers are homemakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children are the main point of our families _ the Lynches
and the Allreds,'' said Ann Allred. ``My son Johnny is so close to
Linda. We live on acreage outside the city and growing up, they
only had each other to play with. Now Linda will fly to Green Bay
to see her husband play, and then take the next plane out to
Chicago to watch her brother in the same day. We try to make all
the games. The big question after Johnny was drafted was `Which
games are you going to miss?'''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not the ones this season on Sept. 20 in Tampa, Fla.,
and Nov. 29 in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the next times Lynch and Allred will be opponents. And
it's Allred's turn to give as well as he got.

FEED THE BABY, AND THEN DO 32.2 MILES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Colo., Wyo., Australia)  (lb) 
 By KIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An early morning one-mile swim in the Hudson River,
followed by a nearly 25-mile bike race through Manhattan followed
by a 6.2-mile foot race through Central Park would probably be
complicated enough for most people as a way to start the day.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Smyers did it while listening to her baby daughter, Jenna,
scream inconsolably. Smyers, a two-time world champion in the
swimming-biking-running event known as the triathlon _ held in New
York Saturday as part of the Goodwill Games _ gave birth by
Caesarean section just three months ago. She is still nursing, so
she had to be sure Jenna was fed before the 7:45 a.m. race start.
But Jenna, who lives with her parents near Boston, was still not
happy.
</P>
<P>
   Jenna screamed as Smyers leaped into the water from a dock at
Battery Park City, and was still at it more than two hours later as
the race finished in Central Park, despite a tag-team family
support crew of handlers and cooers. Smyers, who at 36 was also the
oldest woman in the race, said her father was not above holding up
his wailing granddaughter as a motivational tool in the final laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm out on the run and he's yelling, `Your daughter wants
you,' so I would run faster,'' Smyers said.
</P>
<P>
   New York City itself also added some complications for the
international field of 25 men and 25 women. The men's winner, Simon
Lessing of England, who finished in 1 hour 46 minutes 33 seconds,
was misdirected as he entered Central Park and _ along with other
leaders in the men's group _ ended up running the wrong way. Other
runners were then stopped in their tracks and turned around.
Officials said, however, that the distances ended up being the same
for all _ 10 kilometers _ despite the confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Complications from the construction-scaffold collapse last week
in Times Square also changed the race. The 40-kilometer bike course
was supposed to wind in and around Times Square. Race officials
said that cutting out the Times Square loop reduced the bike
distance by somewhere between two-tenths and four-tenths of a mile,
and that the time constraints left no time to change the course.
</P>
<P>
   The swimming portion of the event was also supposed to take
place, race officials had promised, at what is called ``slack
tide,'' in the Hudson _ that brief window when the current is
moving neither upstream nor down. But the Hudson did not cooperate,
or the window closed too soon, and the tide at race time was
surging downstream toward New York harbor with an intensity that
left some swimmers feeling as if they were swimming in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd breathe, then I'd see the buoy ahead of me, then I'd
breathe and still see the buoy and breathe and still see the
buoy,'' said Nick Radkewich of Colorado Springs, who was the top
American finisher among the men, in sixth place with a time of
1:49.37. The top American woman finisher was Barb Lindquist of
Jackson, Wyo., who finished fourth with a time of 2:01.08. Smyers
finished in 22nd place with a time of 2:11.35.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The athletes, many of whom were making their first visits to New
York, expected that a triathlon in Manhattan would be different.
They said they were used to triathlons in rural and isolated areas
_ patterned, perhaps, after the lush setting in Hawaii where the
original three-phased event, dubbed the Ironman competition, was
created in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's race distances, which have been adopted as the
international standard _ and which will be featured for the first
time in the Sydney Olympics in 2000 _ are a fraction of the
original Ironman endurance test, which includes a 2.4-mile swim and
a 112-mile bike race, followed by a full 26.2-mile marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The race director said that in New York anything can happen,
and I guess it did,'' said Michellie Jones, the second-place
women's finisher, from Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The Australians, who have made a specialty of the triathlon
event in world competition, dominated on Saturday, as expected.
Four of the top seven women finishers were from Australia,
including the winner, Loretta Harrop, with a time of 1:59.43. Among
the men, Australia captured two of the top four spots _ second
place and fourth place.
</P>
<P>
   Smyers said that while she was disappointed by finishing so far
back in the pack, anecdotal evidence suggests that women athletes
tend to get stronger and faster after childbirth _ though perhaps,
she admitted, not perhaps quite as soon as three months after
childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest adjustment in her comeback, she said, has been
figuring out how to swim again. She swam throughout her pregnancy
and became accustomed to propelling a different body _ dramatically
altered in shape and weight distribution _ through the water.
</P>
<P>
   Medical experts agreed that women, especially in endurance
events like the triathlon, do tend to see faster times as mothers,
though there is no scientific consensus on why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these athletes who have done better may just be
training smarter,'' said Dr. Warren Scott, a triathlete and
long-time coordinator of medical services at the Ironman event in
Hawaii. ``They can't overtrain and get injured, because they don't
have the time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smyers said, though, that having a baby changed her perspective
about what, in the end, is really important about racing, and life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing that you've got this little baby that's depending on
you, you realize that the triathlon is not everything in the world,
you know.'' she said.

A RISING YOUNG TALENT IN DIVING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb)

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST MEADOW, N.Y. _ There she was, barely a teen-ager and in a
movie with Tom Cruise.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was ``Jerry Maguire.'' The scene showed her tumbling
in her living room and cut away to show her in the middle of a
dive. Cruise, playing an ambitious young sports agent, said,
``You'll see her in the next Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you will. Erica Sorgi is now 16, and diving people think
she is the best American female prospect since 16-year-old Jennifer
Chandler won the 3-meter springboard title in the 1976 Montreal
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, at the Nassau County Goodwill Games Swimming
and Diving Center in Eisenhower Park, Sorgi dived in the Goodwill
Games women's 3-meter competition. The strong field included two
Russians _ Yuliya Pakhalina, the world champion on the 3-meter
springboard, and Irina Lashko, the world champion on the 1-meter
board.
</P>
<P>
   Sorgi (pronounced SORE-jee) is 5 feet 5 inches and 115 pounds.
Her hair is bleached blond by the chlorine in the diving well where
she trains four hours a day, six days a week, in Mission Viejo,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   For someone weeks away from starting her sophomore year in high
school, she has traveled extensively. In November, in the world
junior championships in Malaysia, she won the platform title for
girls 14 and 15. (They dived from the 5- and 7-meter platforms.)
</P>
<P>
   In January, in the world senior championships in Australia, she
finished 10th on the 1-meter board, 15th on the 3-meter board.
Another youngster might have been discouraged by those placings in
Australia. Not Sorgi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there basically for experience, to compete with the
best,'' she said. ``I had no expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   She does now. As practice was ending Friday, she was having
trouble with a difficult dive from the platform, an armstand back
triple somersault.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' said her coach, Li Hongping, ``let's quit for the day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Sorgi said, ``I don't want to quit. I want to do it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   She did, and she did the dive well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was frustrated,'' Sorgi said. ``I wanted to do it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Li smiled as he recalled the moment. ``I was impressed by
that,'' he said. ``One of her best qualities is determination. She
just has to become consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach and diver say she handles the pressure well. ``I'm intense
when I dive and train,'' Sorgi said. ``I try to stay relaxed and
enjoy it. If you're not doing well, you've just got to get yourself
out of it. You have to realize that if you have a bad attitude, it
will carry on into practice and competition. It's hurt me at times,
but I've come back from bad diving.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sorgi's diving career began at age 8 when her brother, Adam, two
years younger, was taking swimming lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the diving platform,'' Sorgi said, ``and it looked like
fun, so my mother signed me up for diving lessons. I was also in
gymnastics, but diving was easier and therefore more fun. When I
was 11, the gymnastics coach said I had to choose one sport or the
other. I chose diving.''
</P>
<P>
   Li, who won 12 Chinese titles before relocating to the United
States, said Sorgi was handicapped by the American system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese and Russian divers are not more gifted or
talented,'' he said. ``But they train eight hours a day and we
train four.
</P>
<P>
   ``Erica is very gifted, very talented, very young. She never
competed off a 10-meter platform until April. She's got a lot to
learn. As long as she keeps up with her goal _ making the U.S. team
for the 2000 Olympics _ she will get better.''

ROWLAND IS RENOMINATED AS HIS PARTY TREADS ON DEMOCRATIC TURF 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Connecticut Republicans unanimously nominated
Gov. John Rowland for a second term Saturday at a convention that
was carefully scripted to send a message very different from those
of previous years: This is not your father's Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   In a marked departure from the 1994 convention, there was almost
no talk of repealing the income tax that was enacted in 1991 or
dismantling the state government, issues that caused deep splits
among Connecticut Republicans in the past.
</P>
<P>
   While speakers still touted tax cuts and spending restraints,
they also dwelled on a host of other issues _ rebuilding the
state's universities, expanding Medicaid and revitalizing cities _
that have often been considered Democratic turf.
</P>
<P>
   And the ticket that Rowland handpicked was emblematic of the
change: four of the seven candidates for statewide office are
either Hispanic or black. Republicans hope that the slate will
attract minority voters who have traditionally shunned the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not your father's Republican Party,'' Chris DePino, the
state party chairman, told the crowd of more than 1,000 delegates
at the Bushnell Auditorium here Friday night. The governor, he
added, has transformed the party from a ``tired old elephant to an
energetic, powerful young elephant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Rowland express,'' shouted DePino, who works part
time as a train conductor and was Rowland's choice in 1996 to head
the party. ``All aboard!''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that Rowland, who at 41 is the nation's youngest
governor, has a commanding lead over his Democratic opponent,
U.S.Rep. Barbara Kennelly, 62. Several Republican state legislators
said that if Rowland's success continues, riding on his coattails
could help them regain a majority in the Senate, where Democrats
now have a one-vote edge, and pick up seats in the Connecticut
House of Representatives, where they are a small minority.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican candidate for Congress, Mark Nielsen, started
running radio commercials this week that describe him as a ``John
Rowland Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Rowland, the party on Saturday nominated M. Jodi
Rell for lieutenant governor, former U.S. Rep. Gary Franks for the
U.S. Senate, Santa Mendoza for attorney general, Ben Andrews for
secretary of the state, Antonio Serbia for comptroller and Paul
Sylvester for treasurer. Mrs. Rell and Sylvester are incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians across the political spectrum agree that Rowland's
popularity is due in large measure to the turnaround in the state's
economy, which left the state with a record surplus for the fiscal
year that ended June 30 and brought the lowest unemployment rate in
at least 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans and Democrats differ sharply over whether
Rowland's policy pronouncements of the past year, initiating a
number of ambitious government programs, were a natural evolution
in his thinking or political repositioning to win re-election.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It's a crass attempt to embrace the values and principles of
the Democratic Party,'' said Lisa Cutler, a spokeswoman for Mrs.
Kennelly's campaign. ``John Rowland and the Republican Party take a
poll, look where the electorate is at and adjust their program to
fit it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Rowland, in his acceptance speech, boasted Saturday of a
new program to provide health coverage to 90,000 uninsured
children, it was only four years ago that he was elected with the
promise of dismantling the Great Society's war on poverty. Although
he vowed to eliminate the income tax in 1994 _ a move that would
probably require huge cuts in state services _ Rowland did not
mention such a goal Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Such changes suggest an evolution in Rowland's approach, but in
an interview Friday, he hinted that his wariness about government
had not disappeared. ``The word `new program' is the scariest
thought to anyone in this job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Republicans say Rowland always wanted to pursue
initiatives like increased aid to cities, preservation of open
space and expansion of health insurance for the poor, but first had
to improve the state's economy. The focus of his first few years in
office, they maintain, had to be restraining spending and cutting
taxes so that the state could afford to spend money in the future
on new programs.
</P>
<P>
   And while Rowland did not eliminate the income tax _ a goal
several Republican lawmakers acknowledged he would never achieve _
he did reduce it. In the interview Friday, Rowland blamed Democrats
in the General Assembly for making it impossible to achieve that
goal, and maintained that he had a better record on tax cuts than
Mrs. Kennelly did.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Rowland again brushed aside the criticism from
Democrats that his initiatives of the last year were examples of
political opportunism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me for saying so, but I have to chuckle when I hear
from other members of the other party who say, `Oh, my goodness,
they've gotten out in front of us on our issues,' '' he said in his
acceptance speech. ``Frankly, for the last eight years, there's
been nothing to get out in front of.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland also said that in Connecticut, there is a Republican
legacy of concern about social issues. He cited the leadership of
Stewart McKinney, a congressman who died in 1987, in addressing
homelessness, as well as congresswoman Nancy Johnson's work on
extending health care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``And please, please don't tell me or Jodi Rell that we're new
to the issues that speak to the hopes and dreams of the people of
this state,'' Rowland said.

 COUTTS IS RACING, NOT CELEBRATING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ It was as if Russell Coutts were running on
empty. His eyelids looked heavy, and his conversation lacked spark.
But Coutts, New Zealand's America's Cup skipper, was on the mend
after being laid up for nearly a month with mononucleosis, a
temporary but fatiguing malady.
</P>
<P>
   Only this past week's New York Yacht Club Race Week regatta was
able to induce Coutts back to sailing for the first time since
early June. As helmsman for Numbers, a Taylor 49 owned by John
Risley of Canada, Coutts and his 12-man crew finished second in
their class among the 102 sailboats competing in four days of
handicap racing. In the second half of the week, 110 sailboats
competed in one-design competitions as well.
</P>
<P>
   Being beaten by Rima, a new Farr 60 sailed by a mostly hometown
team led by Scott Ferguson of Jamestown, was no cause for
celebration for the Coutts team. But for a diehard in the sport
like Coutts, nothing could have been better than being back to
sailboat racing in sun, wind and sometimes fog.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rima did a good job of going the right way most of the time,''
Coutts said. ``The boat is a good cruiser-racer, and they sailed it
well.''
</P>
<P>
   With a steady breeze from the southwest most of the week, the
waves were sizable enough to jostle a sailboat without tossing it
on its ear. And the fog, well, what is fog for except to confuse
the opponent?
</P>
<P>
   No America's Cup skipper, least of all Coutts, can afford to do
anything but compete as much as possible these days. Even though
the cup trials in Auckland, New Zealand, are not scheduled to begin
for another 14 months, the focus on yacht racing's premier event is
getting sharper. More so for Coutts, who will compete as skipper
for the sole defense syndicate, Team New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Coutts conceded that it might have been better if Kiwi Cup
organizers had scheduled the next America's Cup match two or three
years after the last races in San Diego in 1994 instead of five.
America's Cup regattas before 1995 tended to be scheduled every
three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been easier to slide into it; this time, our
biggest enemy will be complacency,'' said Coutts, alluding to his
team's need to become fired up again after a stunning victory in
the 1995 America's Cup competition.
</P>
<P>
   He estimates that eight to 14 challengers will make it to the
starting line for trial races beginning in late October 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Through payment of a $250,000 bond each for competing, 16
syndicates have signed up. Of those, 12 have arranged for syndicate
compounds, at a cost of about $300,000 each, at the newly developed
America's Cup basin in Auckland. Included are all six American
challengers: three from California and one each from New York,
Hawaii and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Coutts would not venture a guess about who might be the eventual
challenger. ``Every team has its strengths and weaknesses,'' he
said. ``I guess it sounds like I'm being cagey, but in San Diego
three years ago, absolutely no one rated us very high for winning
the America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't until the fourth set of trial races that people
started saying that maybe we'd do it. And still they said, `Oh,
they'll probably crumble at the end.'''
</P>
<P>
   In that memorable finale, New Zealand's Black Magic team won the
America's Cup by beating Dennis Conner's Stars &AMP; Stripes team, 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1999-2000 series, the Kiwis have also strayed from
tradition by choosing to ignore defense trial races for themselves.
Since the advent of modern America's Cup racing in 1958, defenders
have encouraged other sailing teams to vie for the right to defend
the trophy for their motherland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first serious race will be when we pick up the tow to
start the America's Cup match,'' Coutts said about racing in
February 2000. New Zealand's opponent, which will be honed on a
four-month regimen of competition, will be the team among the dozen
or so challengers that wins the challenger trials.
</P>
<P>
   MAKING WAVES
</P>
<P>
   As many as 120 sailboats are expected to gather at the starting
line Thursday for the Cablevision Around Long Island Regatta. The
event, organized by the Sea Cliff Yacht Club, includes monohulls
and multihulls from 24 to 70 feet. The 191-mile course begins at
Rockaway Point, at the southwest corner of Long Island, N.Y., and
then heads east to Montauk Point, around Orient Point, and on to
the finish in Hempstead Harbor at Sea Cliff.
</P>
<P>
   Clever tactics and luck with the weather have placed GIOVANNI
SOLDINI, the Italian solo sailor, in a position to finish first on
Sunday in the Atlantic Alone, a 3,200-mile trans-Atlantic race. The
32-year-old Soldini, skipper of Fila, a 60-foot monohull, found a
better breeze than his four rivals by dipping south rather than
following a shorter northern route from Falmouth, England, to
Charleston, S.C.

ABRAHAM KATSH, 92, JUDAICA SCHOLAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Mass., N.J., R.I.)  (lb) 
 By NADINE BROZAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Abraham Katsh, a scholar of Judaica and Hebrew
studies who introduced modern Hebrew to American university
classrooms, and a relentless researcher who persuaded the Soviet
authorities to allow him to reproduce thousands of Jewish documents
in their custody at the height of the Cold War, died on Tuesday at
DeWitt Nursing Home in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   His family said they believed that he was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars said last week that Katsh's findings in the Soviet
Union had signaled the world that a treasure trove of Jewish
history and thought lay in the countries under Soviet domination.
They said the documents, from collections that had been kept
private, had contributed significantly to the recovery of knowledge
about Jewish culture in the Middle Ages.
</P>
<P>
   From 1967 to 1976, Katsh was president of Dropsie College in
Philadelphia, a graduate school in Judaic studies that was later
absorbed by the University of Pennsylvania. He was a professor at
both Dropsie and New York University, where he rose from instructor
to distinguished research professor and chairman of the department
of Hebrew studies.
</P>
<P>
   He founded the university's Library of Judaica and Hebraica, and
a chair was endowed in his name at the university. And for 18 years
he was director of the American Israel Student and Professorial
Workshop conducted in Israel and co-sponsored by the State
Department and the federal Office of Education.
</P>
<P>
   His scholarly production encompasses more than 20 books and
hundreds of articles and essays.
</P>
<P>
   The son and grandson of rabbis, Katsh immigrated to New York
from Poland in 1925 speaking not a word of English, and within
eight years persuaded New York University to add modern Hebrew to
its curriculum. It was a result of a campaign of sheer persistence,
his son Salem said last week, and an effort not unlike others that
he would undertake throughout his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father,'' said Katsh, ``kept filibustering the chancellor,
Harry Woodburn Chase, pleading with him to authorize a course in
modern Hebrew. Finally the chancellor said: `Mr. Katsh, you're
harassing me. What is the relevance of Hebrew in America?' My
father responded, `You're already speaking Hebrew, and you don't
even know it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He explained that the word `harass' is related to the Hebrew
word `haroos,' which means to destroy or create havoc, much like
`harass' does. The chancellor gave in, and that was the beginning
of Hebrew in American colleges.''
</P>
<P>
   Katsh's tenacity paid off again in 1956 when he talked the
Soviet officials into granting him access to libraries containing
historic Jewish documents and manuscripts that had been hidden from
Western view since the Russian Revolution of 1917.
</P>
<P>
   The papers, which had been collected by scholars in Russia
before World War I and kept in private libraries and academies,
were seized by the government, removed from public view and placed
in storage in Moscow and Leningrad.
</P>
<P>
   Katsh put thousands of the documents on microfilm, which was
then made widely available to scholars. He made six subsequent
trips, mainly in the 1960s, to collect more material. A great
portion of the material is now at the Elmer Holmes Bobst Library at
NYU.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The documents came from two collections. One was the Baron de
Gunzberg collection of more than 1,900 pieces, mainly medieval
manuscripts on all aspects of Judaica, including biblical
commentaries, law, poetry and liturgy. The collection had been
bought by Russian Zionists from the baron's widow and was to have
been given to the Jewish National Library in Jerusalem, but it was
confiscated by the revolutionary government.
</P>
<P>
   The other collection consisted of a quarter of a million pages
and scraps of paper, known as the Cairo Geniza. Among them were 427
fragments of the original Talmud _ dating from the 7th through the
11th centuries _ that corrected some inaccurate interpretations of
Talmudic material.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1979 interview with The New York Times, Katsh said the
snippets of Talmud illustrated precisely what Jewish scholars did
when faced with a contradiction in sacred text: They described new
findings as different versions of old beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the different version is in the writing,'' he said. ``For
instance, in the `Ethics of the Fathers,' it is written that one
should not converse too much with a woman. How can that be? In
Jewish law, it is believed that one who makes a woman cry destroys
the world. Throughout the Talmud, the woman is protected. Now comes
this material and adds two words to the effect that one should not
speak too much to a woman while she is menstruating. That adds a
lot and reinforces ethical practices and traditions about staying
away from the woman at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting the importance for scholars of Katsh's findings in
Russia, Dr. Neil Danzig, a professor of Talmud and rabbinic
literature at the Jewish Theological Seminary in Manhattan, said:
``He broke down the barriers of the Iron Curtain in the late 1950s
for Jewish scholars and found an enormous treasure trove of
unaccessible material. He was the font of all the material, and
Jewish scholars from all over the world would turn to him to share
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include Katsh's wife of 55 years, Estelle Wachtell
Katsh; his sons, Salem, of Manhattan, and Ethan, of Longmeadow,
Mass.; a daughter, Shelley, of Pawtucket, R.I.; seven
grandchildren, and two brothers, Rabbi Leon Katz of Clifton, N.J.,
and Rabbi Michael Katz of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1987 interview with a Jewish student newspaper at NYU,
speaking about his campaign for Judaic and Hebrew studies, Katsh
described himself as a ``shnorrer,'' using a Yiddish expression for
one who cajoles contributions out of people. ``I was met with a
great deal of opposition,'' he said. ``The difficulties were
incredible. Nobody acted in a normal way. They all felt that Hebrew
was a dead language.''
</P>
<P>
   Today about 400 colleges and universities in the United States
teach it.

TANGLED SYSTEM DECIDES PENSIONS FOR DISABLED FIREFIGHTERS  
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALAN FINDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first time he hurt his back, William Guidal says,
he was fighting a fire in an electronics store on East 86th Street
in Manhattan. Something heavy fell on him. It might have been a
television, but it was too dark and smoky to tell.
</P>
<P>
   His back pain never went away. Not until two years later, after
a skylight collapsed on him at another fire, did X-rays reveal the
reason. He had fractured his lower spine _ not in the latest fire
but sometime earlier, and it had healed improperly. After an
unsuccessful operation, Guidal had to retire as a firefighter. The
Fire Department's own doctors decreed that he was not up to the
job.
</P>
<P>
   But in a bitter twist, a separate panel of doctors rejected his
bid for the lucrative pension given to firefighters who are
seriously injured on the job. The doctors ruled that the fracture
was unrelated to any on-the-job accident.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Guidal reflects some of the strains and
contradictions of the complicated system by which New York City
decides which firefighters will get the coveted line-of-duty
disability pensions _ at three-quarters of annual pay, tax free _
and which will not.
</P>
<P>
   The common objection to the Fire Department's pension system,
heard often over the years, is that it is much too generous. But
many retired firefighters have begun to question whether the system
is sometimes too stingy.
</P>
<P>
   The pension system's excesses stem from the same underlying
flaws, many retired firefighters, their lawyers and some fire union
officials say. The system is largely closed and subjective, they
contend. It lacks written standards, formal hearings and basic
accountability.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors who decide who gets line-of-duty disability pensions
sometimes ignore medical evidence favorable to firefighters or
render decisions that contradict the facts, the retired
firefighters and lawyers say. The doctors do not even examine the
firefighters, but rely solely on paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters who believe they have been unfairly denied a
disability pension cannot bring their doctors to testify before an
impartial appeals board, nor can they cross-examine the
city-appointed doctors who rejected their claims.
</P>
<P>
   And because the pension system can appear capricious and is
seldom subjected to public scrutiny, it reinforces the fears of
critics who suspect that the city and the fire unions essentially
barter cases, rewarding friends and punishing foes.
</P>
<P>
   ``For firemen, the system is just so uneven,'' said Jeffrey
Goldberg, a lawyer who has represented firefighters challenging the
disability pension system for 20 years. ``You could present
virtually the same facts to the medical boards and get different
decisions each time.''
</P>
<P>
   For at least two decades, city officials have intermittently
denounced the fire pension system's extravagance. In the last three
years alone, federal and city investigators have exposed cases in
which firefighters with disability pensions continued to work in
construction, played in hockey leagues, ran in track meets and even
fought fires as volunteers in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators videotaped one retired firefighter, who was
collecting a disability pension but working in construction,
climbing a ladder and nailing siding on a house on Staten Island in
1995. Six former firefighters were either indicted or convicted
last year on federal charges of concealing how much they were
earning while retired on disability pensions; city rules limit how
much outside income retired firefighters can earn while receiving
the special pensions.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Department officials say such examples contradict the
criticism that the system is miserly. In the last four years, 795
firefighters won disability pensions and 267 were turned down, said
David Clinton, the deputy fire commissioner for legal affairs. The
doctors who decide pension disability cases uphold rigorous
standards and decide each case objectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters who do not get the disability pension are usually
awarded an ordinary pension, which is taxable and generally half of
their last year's salary. A firefighter with five years' experience
is paid about $45,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   When retired firefighters have sued the city to challenge
disability pension rejections, the courts have generally upheld the
city's decisions, Clinton said. ``This is a fair, reasonable
procedure,'' he said, ``which comports with all the due-process
protections that the Constitution of the United States as well as
the state constitution afford, and that point has been upheld and
recognized by the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for firefighters argue that the system is neither
open nor fair, and they say they are concerned that the traditional
route for appealing a rejection _ the state courts _ has been
effectively blocked by a recent court decision.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, firefighters could sometimes persuade a judge to
reverse the doctors' decision and award a disability pension if
they could prove that the weight of the medical evidence was on
their side. But the Court of Appeals, the state's highest court,
changed the legal standard last year: Disability pension decisions
must be upheld by judges, the court said, as long as there is ``any
credible evidence'' to back the pension system's doctors and
trustees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've made the retirement system's medical boards beyond
reproach,'' said David Jalosky, a lawyer who has specialized in
disability and retirement cases for two decades. ``Who is to review
their medical decisions? No one.''
</P>
<P>
   A Pain in the Back Would Not Go Away
</P>
<P>
   Retired firefighters claiming disabilities continue to seek
redress in the courts, even though their lawyers say the odds of
winning have decreased drastically. Guidal, for instance, is trying
to persuade the courts that the rejection of his claim was
arbitrary and inconsistent with the facts.
</P>
<P>
   After Guidal was hurt in the electronics store fire in 1989, a
Fire Department doctor told him that his back was sprained, gave
him pain killers and recommended rest. Guidal returned to the
department's doctors 23 times in the next two years, complaining of
back pain. Not until he was hospitalized in 1991, after being
injured at another fire, did doctors take X-rays and discover the
fracture in his lower spine.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But the pension system's doctors decided that Guidal could not
have broken his back in the 1989 or the 1991 fires. He must have
injured it earlier, they said, probably before he joined the
department in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The city said in its legal papers that if Guidal had broken his
back in 1989, he would have been in too much pain to return to
work. Guidal maintains, though, that the physical examinations he
underwent upon joining the Fire Department did not detect a back
fracture, and he insists he had no symptoms until he was injured in
the electronics store fire.
</P>
<P>
   Guidal was hurt just two years after joining the department, and
so, based on length of service, he got a regular pension, about
$23,000 a year less than he would receive with a disability
pension.
</P>
<P>
   Guidal, 41, moved his wife and three children to Warwick, R.I.,
three years ago, after he retired. He says he is unable to work
because his lower back pain persists, even after a second
operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never got back pain before this happened,'' he said. ``I
worked in construction before I became a fireman and I was fine.
The department gave me physical examinations when I joined and I
was fine. And yet they say I got hurt off the job?''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors' Impartiality Is Questioned
</P>
<P>
   Like many arcane corners of New York City government, the
firefighters' pension system has its own language and customs. Few
besides those directly affected have ever heard of it, much less
mastered its details.
</P>
<P>
   When a firefighter is injured and unable to return to full duty,
a three-member board of Fire Department doctors decides whether he
is permanently disabled or ``permanently partially disabled,'' and
thus no longer fit to work.
</P>
<P>
   After a firefighter retires and applies for a pension, another
three-doctor panel, known as the ``1B medical board,'' decides
again whether he is at least partly disabled and, if so, whether
his injury was caused by a line-of-duty accident, rather than a
pre-existing condition. If the answer to both questions is yes,
then the firefighter qualifies for the disability pension at
three-quarters pay.
</P>
<P>
   Once a decision is reached by the doctors on the second medical
panel, who are part-time consultants, the case goes to the pension
system's board. The 12-member board consists of representatives of
various fire unions, the fire commissioner, the mayor, the city
finance commissioner and city comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   The board can overrule the doctors on whether a disability was
caused by a job-related accident, and thus whether someone deserves
a three-quarters pension. The unions have six votes altogether, and
the city's representatives have six. The most contested cases
generally end in a 6-6 tie. Seven votes are required for the
pension board to overrule the medical panel, so a tie means the
firefighter is denied a disability pension.
</P>
<P>
   Critics maintain that, in its zeal to catch malingerers, the
pension system sometimes defies logic. Firefighters often submit
supportive letters from outside specialists, but the 1B medical
board often dismisses the specialists' opinions as not impartial.
Yet the firefighter was usually sent to the specialist by the Fire
Department itself.
</P>
<P>
   The medical board relies on its own consultants. ``The 1B
pension system refers to the impartial consultant as `our impartial
consultant,''' said Jim McGarry, a lawyer who has represented many
firefighters in disability cases, including Guidal. ``This is
someone paid for by the Fire Department, not independent of the
department.''
</P>
<P>
   Many firefighters and lawyers believe that these consultants are
anything but impartial and that they feel pressure to limit the
number of people granted disability pensions. ``Some doctors seem
to think their mission is to protect the pension system,'' said
Michael Block, the general counsel for the biggest fire union, the
Uniformed Firefighters Association.
</P>
<P>
   A Lot of Discretion and Panel Uses It
</P>
<P>
   Michael Nastasuk was a firefighter for 21 years. In 1986, he
broke bones in his left hand when he fell while working in his
basement. After surgery to repair the hand, he missed about six
months of work and then returned to full duty.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years later, Nastasuk was unloading propane cylinders from
a Fire Department truck on Randalls Island. He had trouble securing
the truck's hydraulic lift gate. The heavy metal gate closed too
quickly, smashing Nastasuk's left hand and wrist, which were
fractured in three places.
</P>
<P>
   The hand and wrist did not heal. He was eventually told that he
could not return to work as a fire marshal and would have to remain
on light duty. Nastasuk instead retired and applied for a
disability pension.
</P>
<P>
   He was turned down. The medical board decided that his
disability was directly related to his off-duty injury at home, and
that the on-duty accident in 1993 could not have caused it.
</P>
<P>
   Nastasuk, who is 47 and has three children, took an ordinary
pension, at half pay, and moved with his family to Spring Hill,
Fla., about 40 miles north of Tampa. He is a records clerk in the
sheriff's department there. If he had won a disability pension, he
would get $20,000 a year more than he does now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole system is set up for them to use as they
want,'' he said. ``They have a lot of discretionary power, and they
use it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Nastasuk had worked outside New York City, he would have been
entitled to an open, formal appeals hearing. In the state's pension
system, which applies to most firefighters and police officers
outside the city, someone denied a disability pension can request a
hearing, present testimony from doctors who favor his position and
cross-examine those who do not. An administrative law judge
oversees the hearing and decides the case.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the deputy fire commissioner, contended that the
pension system's board serves a similar role. Firefighters' lawyers
can appear before it and present medical evidence. But the board's
doctors are not usually present and are not questioned by
firefighters' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Many firefighters and lawyers said the state system is more open
and accountable than the city's. ``How do you make it fair?''
Goldberg said. ``You have to do something administratively. You
need the appearance that you're getting a fair shake.''

 PATSY SOUTHGATE, WHO INSPIRED '50S LITERARY PARIS, DIES AT 70 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr .  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Patsy Southgate, a writer and translator who helped
inspire the literary flowering of Paris in the 1950s and later
helped establish the writers' colony on eastern Long Island,
becoming a beloved intimate of many of the leading artists of her
day, died on July 18 at the Stony Brook University Hospital and
Medical Center. A resident of Springs, N.Y., she was 70, and for a
decade had been reviewing plays and writing profiles for The East
Hampton Star. Her family said the cause was a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   If her own poems, short stories, plays, and an unpublished novel
did not put her in a league with the coterie of young writers who
gravitated to her orbit in Paris, it was partly because they
included such literary luminaries as William Styron, James Baldwin,
Richard Wright, Terry Southern, a middle-aged Irwin Shaw and her
own husband, Peter Matthiessen.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Miss Southgate, a woman of fierce intelligence,
bitingly funny wit and a high-spirited sense of fun, made her mark
on literary Paris simply by being her ineffable self.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, in a city that treasures beauty she was renowned
as the most beautiful woman in Paris. A clean-cut American beauty
whose finely chiseled features were set off by surprisingly full
lips generally framing a dazzling, inviting smile, Miss Southgate,
whose animated beauty confounded the camera, was blond to her
eyelids and had such a steady, open gaze it was said that to look
into her deep blue eyes was to fall in love.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, where falling in love is easy, the only men in the
tight-knit American expatriate colony who seemed to have avoided
falling in love with her were those who were falling in love with
one another, though that was not always sufficient defense against
Miss Southgate's captivating charm: On Long Island, she became
famous for her deeply loving relationships with gay artists and
poets, most notably Frank O'Hara, the poet whose companion, Joe
LeSueur, actually moved in with Miss Southgate after O'Hara's death
in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   A native of New York who grew up in Washington, where her father
was chief of protocol for the Roosevelt White House, Miss
Southgate, a 1950 Smith College graduate, was a perennial pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   A member, along with Matthiessen, of the first class of the
Smith-Yale junior year abroad program that helped establish Paris
as a romantic way station for a generation of young Americans, Miss
Southgate was ahead of her time even in her vaunted beauty. In an
era when the Hollywood ideal was the shapely starlet with an
overflowing bosom, her trim form prefigured a later esthetic of
sturdy athleticism.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the young American writers were self-consciously
trying to recreate the fabled Paris of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest
Hemingway and other 1920s expatriates, Miss Southgate, though sane,
was the Zelda Fitzgerald of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   But if there was more meaning than madness in her madcap ways,
Miss Southgate had her transcendent moments. Once during the
tempestuous courtship that preceded their tempestuous marriage,
when a row between Miss Southgate and Matthiessen was followed by a
sulking two-day silence followed by an evening phone call that
failed to patch things up, Matthiessen was startled an hour or so
later by a late-night banging on the door of his Paris student
lodgings.
</P>
<P>
   When his disapproving landlady opened the door to Miss
Southgate, who had thrown on her clothes and traveled halfway
across Paris after the dispiriting phone call, it took her only a
moment to add to her legend as a master of the inspired spontaneous
gesture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought you needed this,'' she told Matthiessen as she
handed him an orange and departed, leaving him to marvel, as he
still does, that it was exactly what he needed.
</P>
<P>
   After marrying, graduating and returning to Paris in 1951, the
Matthiessens were instant leaders of a bohemian life that included
legendary late-night revels at the Cafe de Tournon, Le Champlain or
the Dome. Even their apartment, a multilevel, Paris-perfect studio
walkup at 14 Rue Perceval with a balcony overlooking the
Montparnasse rail yards, became the stuff of legend.
</P>
<P>
   Styron made it a major setting for his 1960 novel, ``Set This
House on Fire,'' and it was there that Matthiessen and Harold Humes
founded The Paris Review, summoning Matthiessen's boyhood friend,
George Plimpton, from his studies at Cambridge University to run
it.
</P>
<P>
   For all the publication's later acclaim, it is an open question
whether the writers who gathered there would have been as willing
to discuss the harebrained scheme if Miss Southgate had not been
present as additional lure.
</P>
<P>
   After Miss Southgate gave birth in 1952 to a child who lived
only 12 hours, the couple took the precaution of moving to a
ground-floor apartment for her next pregnancy, so she would not
have to walk up stairs. Their son, Lucas, and The Paris Review both
came out in the spring of 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Before the year was out they had returned to the United States
and settled on Long Island, where as practically the only writers
in the vicinity they fell in almost by default with their neighbor
Jackson Pollock and other artists.
</P>
<P>
   After the couple were divorced in 1956, Miss Southgate, whose
later marriage to the artist Mike Goldberg also ended in divorce,
became a fixture in the Long Island art scene, forming close
friendships with Willem de Kooning, Larry Rivers and other
acclaimed painters even as she continued her own work, contributing
to The Evergreen Review, translating a series of books from French
and eventually finding her late-life niche with The East Hampton
Star.
</P>
<P>
   While her fabled beauty faded, her appeal did not. At her death,
her hair was as blond as ever and her eyes just as blue.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by two children, Lucas and Sara Matthiessen,
both of East Northport, and two grandsons.

FRANCO ALLOWS A HOME RUN TO WIDEN WILD-CARD GAP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Even though the New York Mets swept a double-header
here on Friday, John Franco said Saturday morning that Saturday's
game was more important. With another victory at Wrigley Field, the
Mets would trail the Cubs by just a half-game in the National
League wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Franco got a chance to make it happen. But with one out in the
eighth inning, protecting a one-run lead, he left a 3-0 pitch to
pinch-hitter Glenallen Hill up in the strike zone. Hill responded
with a blast to straightaway center field for a two-run home run.
And the Cubs had a 3-2 victory over the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The homer was Hill's second in as many days. Of his five career
pinch-hit home runs, three have come off Franco. And instead of
another inspiring victory, the Mets (54-47) had suffered their
first defeat in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Franco, trying for his 21st save, had come on in relief of
Masato Yoshii, who allowed just three hits over seven and one-third
splendid innings. But Yoshii walked Kevin Orie with one out in the
eighth. And Manager Bobby Valentine made the call for his closer,
who could not close it out Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii had been able to keep the Mets in the game long enough
for Brian McRae to spark a go-ahead rally in the top of the eighth.
With the score tied at 1-1, McRae _ who leads the Mets with 43
extra-base hits _ delivered a leadoff triple to right center field
off Kevin Tapani. Three batters later, Mike Piazza chopped a
run-scoring grounder to second. And the Mets appeared on their way
to their ninth victory in the last 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Everything, it seemed, was going the Mets' way. How else to
explain the tremendous diving catch Todd Hundley made on Lance
Johnson at the left-field line for the Cubs' first out of the game?
The catch was so good, Valentine tipped his cap to Hundley from the
top step of the Mets' dugout. Predictably, Hundley _ who has often
had trouble with routine fly balls since being asked to play left
field _ could not contain a laugh as he headed back to the dugout
after the bottom of the first.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii, meanwhile, made clear that he has put his midseason
troubles behind him. One day after Armando Reynoso had pitched
eight shutout innings of five-hit ball, Yoshii blanked the Cubs
over the first five innings. The problem, from the Mets' point of
view, was that Tapani was doing the same. And so it was a scoreless
ball game heading into the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with one out, John Olerud sent a 1-1 Tapani offering to
deep right field. Olerud had just missed a homer off Tapani in the
first, doubling off the wall in right center. And the wind was
blowing in again at Wrigley on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, Olerud's drive found the bleachers for his
13th home run. And the Mets had a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But if Yoshii has one major weakness, it is that he is prone to
allowing homers himself. And with two out in the bottom of the
sixth, he surrendered one on a 2-1 pitch to Jose Hernandez. The Cub
second baseman's 16th homer of the year curled just inside the left
field foul pole. It was the 18th homer Yoshii has allowed in 20
starts this season. And the score was tied at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii's propensity for giving up the long ball is one reason
the Mets might be wary of shifting him to the bullpen. But the
right-hander has enjoyed success there in Japan. Reynoso, on the
other hand, has been a starter for his entire career.
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves Valentine with a decision to make, although not an
unpleasant one. With Yoshii enjoying his second strong outing in a
row, the question is what to do with Reynoso. By having Reynoso
start the day before Yoshii _ and with an off day on Monday _
Valentine left open the option of shifting Reynoso into Yoshii's
slot and moving Yoshii into the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   But Valentine was not revealing his hand just yet. When asked
about Reynoso's role before the game, the manager said: ``He's a
pitcher on the New York Mets major-league staff. He did well
yesterday. He's healthy. And he's a keeper. We'll let yesterday's
outing live on as long as we can until we need him.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso, meanwhile, reported that he was sore after a
spectacular return to the majors on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a good sore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Which was not quite the feeling Franco was experiencing after
picking up a numbing defeat.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   The Mets will wait until Monday's off day to decide whether they
will put REY ORDONEZ on the disabled list. The Gold Glove shortstop
strained an external oblique muscle on the right side of his
abdomen as he was swinging at a pitch during the seventh inning in
the first game of Friday's double-header. Ordonez, who hurt himself
fouling off a pitch, went down as if he had been shot after the
swing and had to be helped off the field. But he said that he felt
better after the double-header and that he thought he would miss
about five days. So Ordonez felt he would not have to go on the
disabled list. ``Rey said he was sore today, but that he felt
better,'' Manager BOBBY VALENTINE said before Saturday's game. ...
General Manager STEVE PHILLIPS and JOHN FRANCO's representatives
have not agreed on the money or length of a contract extension. But
it is believed that the 37-year-old Franco, who has 20 saves in 23
opportunities this season, would like at least a two-year deal that
would pay him around $6.5 million total. Franco is in the final
season of a two-year contract that will pay him a base salary of
$2.6 million this year. ... BERNARD GILKEY was out of the starting
lineup for the fifth straight game and the sixth time in the last
seven. For the moment, Gilkey appears to be a defensive replacement
for TODD HUNDLEY in left field. And he came in for Hundley on
Saturday in the bottom of the sixth. ``He hasn't played very
well,'' Valentine said of Gilkey. ``He's capable of playing
better.'' ... Hundley's father, RANDY, a longtime catcher for the
Cubs, led the crowd in ``Take me out to the ball game'' during the
seventh-inning stretch. ... Sunday's pitching matchup is the best
of the series: Chicago's rookie phenom, KERRY WOOD, vs. the Mets'
All-Star right-hander RICK REED. ... The Cubs placed the
right-hander JEREMI GONZALEZ on the 15-day disabled list after he
sprained his right elbow in the first game of Friday's
double-header.

RACING TO PREPARE FOR A POLITICAL RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sitting at a bare desk in his modest office in
Elmhurst, Queens, state Assemblyman Joseph Crowley was coming to
grips on Thursday, detail by complicated detail, with his sudden
transformation from a candidate in a sleepy race for re-election to
a candidate for U.S. representative.
</P>
<P>
   He had not selected a new campaign manager, nor had he begun to
determine how he would raise the far larger sums needed for a
congressional race. Still, he said he was eager for the opportunity
to succeed Rep. Thomas Manton, who announced last week that he
would retire at the end of the year to return to his private law
practice. Manton, the Democrat who has represented northwestern
Queens for 14 years, handpicked Crowley as his successor.
</P>
<P>
   The days since then, Crowley said, have been heady ones, filled
with nonstop calls from well-wishers and struggles to manage the
complexities of a congressional campaign _ all while preparing for
his wedding in October, a month before the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``These have been the most overwhelming days of my life,'' said
Crowley, 36, who could easily be mistaken for a professional
football linebacker. ``This has been a great, invigorating
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Manton's retirement announcement, at the end of
the season of petitioning for political office, coupled with his
maneuvering of Crowley's selection as the Democratic candidate, has
made it difficult for the Republicans to produce a strong
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Crowley, a member of a Queens political family and
a longtime protege of Manton, is heavily favored to win the
November election in the overwhelmingly Democratic district, which
stretches from the Queensboro Bridge to Shea Stadium and includes a
small part of the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Political colleagues, both Democratic and Republicans, described
Crowley as an affable assemblyman who works easily with other
legislators. He is said to have paid particularly close attention
to Irish affairs as well as to calls from constituents in his
middle-class district. He was also said to be ever cheerful, even
playing guitar and lending his tenor to a rock 'n' roll band, the
Budget Blues Boys, made up of members of the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is responsive and delivers as much to his community as most
legislators, if not more,'' said Assemblyman Jeffrion Aubry, a
Democrat who represents a district neighboring Crowley's. ``He
really does work well with others and will be particularly good at
building coalitions.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Crowley's quiet representation of the
Assembly district that covers the Queens neighborhoods of Elmhurst,
Middle Village and Maspeth has earned him a reputation as a steady,
but not particularly shining, legislator during 14 years in the
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, several Assembly colleagues, when asked to discuss
Crowley's legislative accomplishments, said they could not recall
any, except for his strong interest in Irish issues and his
chairmanship of the Committee on Racing and Wagering. ``He's a
really nice guy,'' said one Assembly member who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. ``But has he done much in the Assembly to
distinguish himself above the pack? Not really.''
</P>
<P>
   And the manner of his selection as the congressional candidate,
by a hastily gathered committee of Democrats close to Manton, has
already been a controversial chapter in Crowley's short-lived
congressional candidacy. Even politicians who are fond of Crowley
have complained about the back-room nature of the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does nothing to engender confidence in the political
system,'' said John Sabini, a city councilman who was once the
acting chairman of the Queens Democratic Party. ``But the rules of
the poker game are posted on the wall of the saloon. But then, on
the other hand, we can't complain when we go out to help him and
there is a lack of voter enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Crowley said he had no regrets about the manner of
his selection. ``People who know me well, know what I'm all about
and how I've always conducted myself in terms of being honest and
open,'' Crowley said in an interview. ``I am not embarrassed and I
am not sorry or upset about the fact that I am the Democratic
designee.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Crowley's political career began shortly after his graduation
from Queens College in 1985. His uncle, Walter Crowley, had been a
member of the City Council, having succeeded Manton there when
Manton was elected to Congress. Walter Crowley died in 1985, and
Joseph Crowley set his eye on running for that seat.
</P>
<P>
   He decided to support a former aide to Manton, Walter McCaffrey.
``I was too young at the time, and Walter was more seasoned,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley became a Democratic district leader. And when
Assemblyman Ralph Goldstein died in 1986, Crowley decided to run in
the Democratic primary to succeed him. It was a crowded race with
seven candidates. Crowley, then 24, won that race decisively.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Crowley has established a record that has been
moderate to conservative. He opposes abortion and a residency
requirement for New York City police officers, and he favors
affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley described himself as an active legislator, having been
involved in the rebound of the city's Offtrack Betting Corp., for
example. ``Like it or not, I'm considered a leader in Albany,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   With the congressional race looming, he has started developing
his positions on issues of concern beyond the borders of Queens.
``I'm the Democratic designee,'' he said. ``But I still have an
election to win.''

THE DRUG AT CENTER OF TOUR DE FRANCE SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Italy)  (mk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For patients suffering from anemia caused by kidney disease, use
of the synthetic hormone erythropoietin, or EPO, can be a lifesaver
because it stimulates the production of red blood cells. For
endurance athletes, the increased oxygen-carrying capacity provided
by EPO has made it an alluring, performance-enhancing drug, albeit
one that is banned and that can leave athletes at risk of strokes,
heart attacks and even death.
</P>
<P>
   EPO is at the epicenter of a widening drug scandal in the Tour
de France, the world's most prestigious bicycle race. It is thought
to be widely used in cycling, distance running and Nordic skiing by
world-class athletes. But the drug goes largely undetected because
scientists have yet to develop a reliable test to differentiate
naturally occurring EPO from the genetically engineered version of
the hormone.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we're probably not really very close,'' said Dr. Don
Catlin, who runs the Olympic drug testing laboratory at the
University of California at Los Angeles and who is a member of
International Olympic Committee's medical commission. He added:
``It's a terrible problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The synthetic version of EPO was approved by the Food and Drug
Administration in 1989, according to the U.S. Olympic Committee's
drug education handbook. But it has been available in Europe since
1987 and has concerned Olympic officials since the 1988 Winter
Games in Calgary, Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of use of EPO as a performance-enhancing drug has been
most visible and ominous in cycling, where approximately two dozen
deaths have been linked anecdotally to the drug since the late
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   EPO is a glycoprotein, or protein-carbohydrate compound, which
is produced by the kidneys and circulates through the bloodstream,
stimulating the bone marrow to produce red blood cells, which in
turn carry oxygen to the muscles. The drug is synthetically
produced for use by patients with kidney disease, AIDS and cancer,
according to the U.S. Olympic Committee handbook.
</P>
<P>
   Endurance athletes inject EPO to increase the number of red
blood cells, thus providing themselves with greater aerobic
capacity. The use of EPO is the evolution of another procedure,
called blood doping or blood packing. Blood doping involved an
athlete removing a portion of his blood, allowing his body to
replenish its red-blood cell supply, then intravenously restoring
the removed blood to increase his oxygen-carrying ability.
</P>
<P>
   Both procedures are banned because they give athletes unfair
competitive advantages, and both carry health risks.
</P>
<P>
   The danger with EPO is that an excessive number of red cells
thickens the blood, especially with the dehydration that results
from strenuous exercise, making it more difficult for the heart to
pump blood through the body. This leaves athletes at risk of
clotting, strokes and heart attacks, Catlin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give a kidney patient EPO, it remarkably improves the
quality of their life,'' Catlin said. ``But it's a two-edged sword,
and the edges are very sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past four years, federations for sports like cycling,
speed skating, biathlon and cross-country skiing have begun using
programs to measure athletes' red blood cells. In cycling, for
instance, those athletes who have a hematocrit, or percentage of
red blood cells in whole blood, above 50 percent, are suspended for
two weeks. Seven riders have been caught this year and about a
dozen last year.
</P>
<P>
   These programs are not referred to as doping tests but as
health-protection initiatives. Those caught are not branded as
cheaters or banned for long periods. Controversy has erupted on
several fronts. In speed skating, for instance, the tests have been
voluntary instead of mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   Also, not everyone can agree on what the allowable hematocrit
limit should be. If 42 percent is considered the normal level of
red blood cells for men and athletes are allowed to boost the count
to 50 percent, that can be perceived as encouraging cheating,
Catlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in Italy and Norway are working on tests that would
detect synthetic use of EPO. Last January, Dr. Francesco Conconi of
Ferrara, Italy, reported that encouraging steps had been made in
isolating synthetic EPO from naturally occurring EPO in urine
samples.
</P>
<P>
   However, research on a reliable test for EPO lags behind
research to detect synthetic human growth hormone, another banned
substance used by athletes for its steroidlike qualities. The IOC
hopes to have a reliable test for hGH, as it is known, for the 2000
Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, Catlin said. The IOC and the
European Union have each contributed $1 million toward hGH
research, he said.

ONE MAN'S 9-YEAR STRUGGLE AGAINST THE SYSTEM

   NEW YORK _ While some contested disability cases appear
relatively straightforward, others, like that of Michael Romanelli,
are complex and ambiguous. Romanelli had been a firefighter for
eight years when he was hurt fighting a blaze in a vacant synagogue
in Borough Park, Brooklyn, in 1989. He tripped in a hole on a wet
floor and fell hard on his back, landing on his 35-pound air pack.
</P>
<P>
   He felt pain in his neck and back, and medical tests found
damage to disks in his spine. In 1990, a panel of Fire Department
doctors found Romanelli unfit for full duty because of two
herniated disks in his neck and nerve pain caused by related disk
damage in his neck and lower back.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Romanelli retired and applied for a tax-free
disability pension at three-quarters of his annual salary. His case
went before the doctors of the 1B medical board five times. Each
time, they said his injuries had partly disabled Romanelli,
although they offered varying reasons why. The doctors also
maintained that the 1989 accident was not severe enough to have
caused his disability.
</P>
<P>
   The medical board concluded initially that his disc and nerve
problems were caused by a broken jaw and concussion he sustained in
1983 while off duty. The next time, they said his condition was
caused by a seizure he suffered in 1984, also while off duty.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth and fifth times, the doctors decided he was suffering
from a ``pain syndrome,'' which they believed was not caused by the
condition of his disks and nerves. The panel said the pain syndrome
was unrelated to his work, and so Romanelli did not get a
disability pension.
</P>
<P>
   Romanelli went to court, contending that pain syndrome was not a
legitimate medical diagnosis. He also argued that, since he had not
experienced pain in his neck or back before he fell in 1989,
whatever it was that ailed him resulted from his accident at the
fire.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Justice Frank Vaccaro of state Supreme Court in
Brooklyn agreed. He said there was not enough credible medical
evidence to support the doctors' decision, and he awarded Romanelli
a disability pension. But an appellate court reversed the ruling in
1994, saying that since there was conflicting medical evidence, the
courts should not intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years after he was injured, Romanelli remains passionate,
if not obsessed, about his case. The dining room of his house on
Staten Island is littered with boxes of documents, and he still
spends time every day trying somehow to find a way to reopen the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1989 and 1993, Romanelli was seen by more than two dozen
doctors and had many diagnostic tests; some supported his
contention that he was seriously injured and others did not.
Romanelli insists that the medical board ignored some of the tests
supporting his case, as well as the doctors who found his injuries
significant and service-connected, but instead gave weight to the
opinions of doctors who found his medical problems modest and his
symptoms questionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not faking,'' Romanelli said. ``I get pain in both arms.
I get constant pain in my neck and back. I get tingling in my hands
and sciatica down my left leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Romanelli, who is 37 and has two young children, has not worked
since leaving the Fire Department. ``I will fight for what I
deserve until the day I die,'' he said.

IRANIAN WRESTLING HERO LOSES AT GOODWILL GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., Ariz., Russia)  (mk) 
 By RON DICKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Rasul Khadem's knees ache, his nation aches with
them. Khadem is the Michael Jordan of Iran, an athlete so famous
that he cannot walk the streets of Tehran without being approached
by well-wishers.
</P>
<P>
   `'He's a hero for everybody,'' said Jalal Hosseini, an Iranian
exchange student who traveled from Boston to watch Saturday's
Goodwill Games wrestling team competition at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old Khadem is nearing the end of his career and
wonders how long his body can hold out. Iran's match against Russia
in the morning was an important test for Khadem. The team thought
he would rest for the world championships in Tehran in September,
but Khadem wanted to test his fitness at a heavier weight class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be good practice to prepare for Tehran,''
he said through a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   At 198 pounds, Khadem was nearly unbeatable. He won three world
championships and the gold medal in the 1996 Olympics. Competing
Saturday in the 286-pound class, he was vulnerable. Giving away
about 60 pounds to Andrei Shumilin, Khadem kept lunging for
Shumilin's legs for the quick takedown. He succeeded once but lost,
3-1 in overtime, as the Iranians fell to the Russians by 17-12.
</P>
<P>
   The surprisingly quick Russian used Khadem's momentum as the
Iranian was grabbing at Shumilin's ankle, and threw Khadem to the
mat on his stomach for the clinching point. A crowd of 4,540, which
included about 700 Iranians, cheered for Khadem.
</P>
<P>
   ``He moved up to see how he could do,'' Shumilin said of Khadem.
`'He didn't have an easier time.''
</P>
<P>
   An exhausted Khadem said after the match that his knees were
feeling better, but he hedged on whether he would try to hang on
for the 2000 Olympics. ``The decision for now is only until the
world championships,'' Khadem said.
</P>
<P>
   With one match remaining Saturday, the United States clinched a
victory over Turkey. Les Gutches of Corvallis, Ore., the world
champion at 187 pounds, overpowered Turkey's Ali Ozden by 11-0,
ending their bout on a mercy rule. At 213 pounds, the 1996 Olympian
Melvin Douglas of Mesa, Ariz., scored a takedown in overtime to
beat Kasif Sakiroglu.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Iran was scheduled to wrestle the United States
in the countries' first competition since the Iranians defeated the
Americans in World Cup soccer last month, and Russia was to face
Turkey. The round-robin tournament ends Monday with the United
States vs. Russia and Iran vs. Turkey.

LIEBERMAN-CLINE TAKES SEAT ON THE BENCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (lb)

<TEXT>
<P>
   For Nancy Lieberman-Cline, her basketball life was not ending at
40; it only seemed as though it was.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman-Cline, one of the more accomplished players in the
history of women's basketball, is now the head coach and general
manager of the Detroit Shock of the Women's National Basketball
Association. After playing last year at age 39 for the Phoenix
Mercury, Lieberman-Cline has made a surprisingly smooth transition
into coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been hard, because I didn't have the desire to play,
which I thought I'd be fighting,'' said Lieberman-Cline, whose
expansion team was 10-9 heading into a home game with the Los
Angeles Sparks on Saturday and on the road against the New York
Liberty on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the hardest thing has been the managing of people. I
feel like I spend 80 percent of my time managing people and 20
percent of my time getting work done.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Donovan, her former teammate at Old Dominion and now the
head coach of the Philadelphia Rage of the American Basketball
Association, has been impressed by Lieberman-Cline's coaching
debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge step for her,'' Donovan said. ``For someone who
has played at such a high level for such a long time, it's good to
see her make that transition and doing well for herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman-Cline, who was enshrined in the Naismith Memorial
Basketball Hall of Fame in 1996, led Old Dominion to two national
collegiate titles. As an 18-year-old from Far Rockaway High School
in New York, she became the youngest basketball player to win an
Olympic medal, a silver, in the 1976 Games at Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   If leaving her playing career behind was easy, picking up the
nuances of coaching was another story. From running practices to
dealing with player egos, there was plenty to learn. Fortunately,
she had the services of the former UCLA coach Billie Jean Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a tremendous asset to me as a person,'' said
Lieberman-Cline of Moore, who coached her as an 18-year-old on that
Olympic team. ``I just told her, `Teach me everything you know
about the game,' and she systematically walked me through
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   For Donovan, who had been a college coach at East Carolina for
three years before taking the Rage job this spring, it was a matter
of making what she termed a natural progression. But
Lieberman-Cline knew she needed to take a different route.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that long term, I could have a different contribution
to the game,'' Lieberman-Cline said of coaching professionally. ``I
viewed it as different from college coaching. As much as I respect
college coaches, I didn't feel it would meet my style. After being
in Phoenix last year and seeing the professional attitude, I felt
like this could work. I didn't have to baby-sit and I could focus
on teaching the game.''
</P>
<P>
   After an 0-4 start, the Shock has rebounded to put itself in
contention for the fourth and final playoff spot, vying with the
Cleveland Rockers and the Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've probably surprised a lot of people,'' Lieberman-Cline
said. ``Sport magazine had us flat last and I put it up in our
locker room so our players could see it every day. We never entered
the season with the mind-set that we were an expansion team.''

 &HT;    AMID SADNESS OVER CAPITOL SHOOTING, THE ``PEOPLE'S HOUSE''
REOPENS
 &HT;    By REBECCA CARR
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Wearing a T-shirt with the American flag emblazoned
across the front, Alan May and his young son Noah walked
hand-in-hand to the steps of the U.S. Capitol the day after a
gunman shot his way through a security checkpoint, killing two
officers and wounding a tourist in his wake.
</P>
<P>
   May, of Ellijay, Ga., came to the Capitol despite the shootings
because he wanted 8-year-old Noah to know that the massive
building, the People's House, ``stands for justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Noah, looking at a heap of flowers left on the Capitol steps in
memory of the slain officers, said he was ``scared to come here,
but we're Americans and we stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Beneath flags lowered to half-staff, the Capitol and adjacent
congressional office buildings reopened Saturday as tourists
somberly filed into the domed symbol of freedom and democracy. It
was less than a day after the accused killer, Russell Eugene
``Rusty'' Weston Jr., 41, is said by authorities to have burst
through a weapons detector at the East Front entrance of the
Capitol and opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials say the first in his line of fire was
Jacob J. Chestnut, 58, an 18-year veteran of the U.S. Capitol
Police force who was known to his friends as ``J.J.'' Angela
Dickerson, a tourist standing nearby, was also shot. A second
officer then fired a volley of shots at Weston, police say, but he
fled. As Chestnut lay dying, tourists and staffers fled the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Weston chased a woman down a corridor leading to the
offices of Texas Republican and Majority Whip Tom DeLay. Hearing
the gunfire, Special Agent John Gibson, 42, also an 18-year veteran
of the force, ordered staff to ``get down'' and then pushed the
woman out of the way as he pulled out his gun and started shooting
at Weston, said U.S. Capitol Police spokesman Sgt. Dan Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   Weston on Saturday was charged with murder of a federal police
officer, a crime that could bring the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the shootings, a surreal atmosphere had taken over
the usually bustling Capitol building. U.S. Capitol Police wore
strips of black tape across their badges out of respect and
mourning for their fallen fellow officers. Several dozen bouquets
of flowers were placed on the steps of the Capitol's main entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists and staffers alike talked in hushed tones. There was a
palpable sense of shock as tourists walked along the Capitol's
hallowed hallways.
</P>
<P>
   Many said they were shocked that such a tragedy could happen
here. They told stories about going home Friday night and simply
holding their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tragedy,'' said Capitol Police officer T.E. Dove,
standing in front of DeLay's office where the shooting took place,
his eyes still red from crying. ``Fellow officers being injured is
one thing, but to hear one confirmed dead and then a few minutes
later another . . . it takes your breath away. We're all brothers
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Dove said, he returned home from police
headquarters, looked at his 3-year-old daughter and choked with
emotion. ``I thought it could have been me, any of my fellow
officers. He could have come through any door,'' he said. ``I wear
my (bulletproof) vest every day because I have a 3-year-old
daughter who depends on me. Depends on me every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Capitol Saturday, television camera operators
prepared for briefings under umbrellas to protect themselves from
the sun as tourists snapped family photos. Despite seeming
normalcy, there was still a sense of overwhelming sadness in the
eyes of the people who knelt by the flowers, who waited to get
inside the building, who gripped their children's hands with an
unusual tightness.
</P>
<P>
   There were long lines of sightseers waiting to enter the
building at its normal 9 a.m. opening time. Some brought bouquets
of flowers. A few of the bouquets had American flags poking out and
handwritten notes that thanked Chestnut and Gibson for ``being our
heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been coming all day long, placing flowers on the
Rotunda steps,'' Sgt. Nichols told reporters. ``People have been
asking if that's okay. We certainly think that's okay.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officers from Michigan, in the Washington area for
training, paused to leave embroidered fabric badges, the
traditional sign of respect from one law enforcement agency to
another that has lost officers.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, tourists could walk close to where the shootings
occurred. But their view was obscured by large portable screens.
</P>
<P>
   Both the tourists and Capitol officials said they were
determined not to let Friday's tragedy keep the public from
entering the building.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, speaking at Andrews Air Force Base en route
to christen a Navy ship in Virginia, said that the Capitol must be
kept as a place where ``where people can freely and proudly walk
the halls of their government.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a special radio address aired by some television
networks, an emotional House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., with his
wife Marianne standing nearby, led the nation in prayer for the two
dead lawmen. Gingrich was grim-faced as he spoke from handwritten
notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please help this country learn to live with its freedom.
Please help those who are troubled learn to live peacefully with
their problems,'' said the speaker, a tear running down his right
cheek.
</P>
<P>
   He described the Capitol has the ``keystone of freedom'' and
vowed that ``no act of violence will block us from preserving our
freedom and from keeping this building open to people from all over
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, who usually is driven to the Capitol from his home,
walked on Saturday. As the speaker strode up the center steps, a
few feet from where the gunman entered, he stopped to take in the
flowers that had been left. He was particularly moved by a bunch of
wildflowers that had a card inscribed: ``Thank you, heroes, for our
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Strolling along a hallway of statues inside the Capitol, many of
them war heroes, 19-year-old Jason Gagnon of the Washington area
said he was deeply saddened by the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   But Gagnon also said that he hoped that the tragedy would not
cause gun control advocates to push for more laws governing the use
of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, such discussion consumed many morning radio shows as
the nation struggled to come to grips with the fact that someone
had shot his way into the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gun control would be totally the wrong reaction. We need to
look beyond the actions of these madmen and into the psychology of
why they do this stuff,'' Gagnon said.
</P>
<P>
   To get rid of guns, he said, ``would really loosen the base that
liberty stands on.''

MINOR-LEAGUER FROM N.Y. HAS MAJOR-LEAGUE MATERIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GRANT GLICKSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is 0-9 for his Class A minor league baseball team. His earned
run average of 4.87 is four times higher than it was when he led
the Tottenville Pirates of Staten Island to consecutive Public
School Athletic League titles in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But Jason Marquis, the 35th overall selection in the June 1996
free-agent draft, is still considered the hottest minor league
prospect in the Atlanta Braves' pitching-rich organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really doesn't matter what his numbers say, because this
kid has major league stuff right now,'' said Bruce DalCanton, a
former major league starter who is now Marquis' pitching coach in
Virginia with the Danville 97s of the Carolina League. ``If he was
a free agent in the open market, he'd be a million-dollar
pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Marquis, a 6-foot-1-inch, 196-pound right-hander, has a
95-mile-an-hour rising fastball and a curveball capable of sending
batters back to the dugout shaking their heads. He is as sure a bet
of making it to the major leagues as his parent club is of claiming
the National League's Cy Young award (Braves pitchers have won five
of the last seven).
</P>
<P>
   The 19-year-old Marquis is one of only four Atlanta pitchers who
are consistently timed in the mid-90s. The others are already in
the majors: John Smoltz, Kevin Millwood and Mark Wohlers.
</P>
<P>
   It is no small wonder, then, that the Braves signed Marquis for
more than $600,000 rather than let him slip away to the University
of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm right on pace to make it to the major leagues in the next
four years,'' Marquis said. ``Barring injury, health and God
willing, there should be no slowing me down.''
</P>
<P>
   While the mental burden of the 0-9 start has not impeded his
progress as a pitcher, Marquis admitted that his record and his
team's lack of success _ Danville is 40-56 _ has made his second
full season as a professional less than ideal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to let it get to me, but it's hard not to,'' said
Marquis, whose team has averaged fewer than two runs a game for him
in 16 starts this season; overall, the 97s are scoring fewer than
three runs a game.
</P>
<P>
   Marquis added: ``It's been tough on all our pitchers, but it's
something that you have to work through. I think that it will make
us better pitchers in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   To earn a job in the majors, Marquis must improve his changeup
and learn to pitch out of jams. He has spent much of the season
throwing shutout ball for six to seven innings before allowing a
handful of runs in one inning. Marquis has allowed 85 hits and 44
earned runs in 81 1/3 innings. His strikeouts-to-walks ratio of
97-30 is exceptional for a developing pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he gets into a little bit of trouble,'' DalCanton said,
``he has a tendency to overthrow his pitches and try to get real
fine with them. He needs to bear down and let his stuff take care
of everything. That will come with maturity.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing games on a regular basis is not something Marquis is
accustomed to. He has spent much of his young career dominating
opposing hitters while pitching for dominant teams. Tottenville has
won four of the last seven PSAL titles and six since 1986. Marquis
was on the mound at Shea and Yankee Stadiums when the Pirates
claimed league titles in 1995 and 1996. As a junior, Marquis, in
the role of closer, struck out the final batter in Tottenville's
3-2 victory over George Washington of Manhattan at Shea Stadium. In
his senior year, Marquis struck out 15 George Washington hitters in
a 5-1 triumph over the Trojans at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Marquis helped the Macon Braves, a Class A team in
the South Atlantic League, advance to the second round of the
playoffs. He posted a 14-10 record with a 4.38 ERA. Marquis struck
out 121 batters and walked only 55 in 141 2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was pretty special because it was just like winning
a championship with Tottenville,'' Marquis said. ``When you're part
of a winning team, it makes everything go a little bit smoother.
You could kick back, relax and have some fun.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the greatest thrills of his professional career came
during spring training this season, when Marquis and some of his
minor league counterparts had a chance to talk shop with Braves
stars from the parent club.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of buddies and I talked to Smoltz and Greg Maddux
about what it took for them to get to the majors,'' Marquis said.
``They gave their advice and we asked them questions about how they
would pitch to a batter in certain situations. Ultimately, the
decision comes down to us. But you try to take their ideas and put
them with yours. You soak up the information and keep it in the
memory bank.''

WHILE TIGERS PROWL, FOES WILL BE TAKING AIM AT MISSOURI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last season, Missouri became a cat of a different stripe.
</P>
<P>
   On their way to eight victories, including the football
program's first bowl game in 13 seasons, the Tigers transformed
from the hunter into the hunted. But that metamorphosis is not
without attending danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the hunter's point of view, you don't have the initial
respect, but you do have the opportunity to sneak up on some
people,'' said Corby Jones, Missouri's 1997 all-Big 12 quarterback.
``If you're hunted, you're always on the run. And you have to keep
your eyes open.''
</P>
<P>
   And so wide-eyed Missouri, along with Oklahoma State, has
assumed the role of legitimate player in the Big 12 scheme of
things after more than a decade as a conference also-ran. Sixteen
returning starters _ eight on offense, seven on defense and a
punter _ deem that a logical conclusion. But having gained one
edge, Missouri might have lost another.
</P>
<P>
   ``After you've established yourself, you've got people who are
gunning for you,'' said linebacker Barry Odom, a leader of what is
expected to be an improved defense. ``I don't think anyone's going
to be looking past us like they may have the last couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people know now we're not a joke. We're for real.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri, nevertheless, must show them again to move into the
``for real'' category, Jones said. And therein lies this season's
task.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to (win) at least two years before you can start
talking,'' Jones said. ``And that's what we need to do: continue to
keep things rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   Tigers coach Larry Smith could not have said it better. The only
active Division I-A coach who has taken four programs (Tulane,
Arizona, Southern California and Missouri) to bowl games, Smith has
been there before, unlike his players.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers' turnaround in his fourth season in Columbia spawned
what he said is a recruiting class unprecedented in his 21 years as
a college head coach, a class that includes four Texans. A new
attitude is as evident as the more than $12 million worth of
facility improvement at the school this decade, including recently
completed dressing rooms, medical-training facilities and an
academic center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The building process is never over, not in this day and age,''
Smith said. ``Right now, we have some tremendous momentum. But I've
been around the game long enough to know the process starts all
over at the beginning of every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take the first step, which is winning, and we've
done that. But where we want to be is at the top. We're just
beginning to make a move. And right now, we just want to continue
to make that move, establish some consistency and take that next
step.''
</P>
<P>
   Picked to finish third behind Nebraska and Kansas State in the
Big 12 North division, the Tigers pick up Texas A&AMP;M and Texas Tech
in the league's rotating schedule. Their nonconference schedule
includes potential national champion Ohio State as well as an
opener with Bowling Green and an Oct. 3 date with Northwestern
(La.) State. The stretch run _ in which Missouri has been strong
the past two seasons _ includes an anticipated Oct. 24 rematch with
Nebraska, followed by Tech, Colorado, A&AMP;M and Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at our schedule, and it's important we win early,''
Smith said. ``I said that last year, and we were 3-3 after six
games, and we won down the stretch (four of five). But you look at
our last five games this year, and I'll tell you: If we win three
or four out of that, we'll be one heck of a football team.''

REAL ESTATE: APARTMENT PRICES AS MOVING TARGETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DENNIS HEVESI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite paneless windows, bare cement floors and the
constant clatter of construction, it looked as if there just might
be a sweet home for Deirdre Manganaro when she donned a hard hat
last month and toured the 11-story building still on the rise at 99
Jane St. in the West Village.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet soon turned sour, however, when Ms. Manganaro found out
that the price for the two-bedroom apartment she and her husband
had set their sights on had been raised by $50,000 _ from $635,000
to $685,000 _ just three days after the tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling tricked,'' Ms. Manganaro said. ``I believed him''
about the initial price, she said of the sales agent, with whom she
had been talking since January when she first spotted an
advertisement heralding the coming of 99 Jane St. ``He said the
market had become a feeding frenzy, and they had raised their
prices on everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `What if I'm willing to pay the extra 50''' _ the
additional $50,000 _ ```does it guarantee me that apartment?' He
said no. Then he tried to steer me to another unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Finder, a real-estate lawyer in Manhattan, had a client
who orally agreed to the price of an apartment in a new building
shortly after the offering plan was accepted by the New York state
attorney general's office. The client asked the agent to send over
the sales contract. ``Weeks went by,'' Finder said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after several phone calls, the buyer was told that an
amendment had been filed, and the price had jumped nearly $100,000.
``My guy was so angry at how shabbily he was treated that he walked
away from the deal,'' Finder said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ms. Manganaro nor Finder's client had fallen victim to
any sort of illegal deed, but to the standard practice of
developers _ particularly in a superheated market _ of ratcheting
up prices early and often after the offering plan has been accepted
by the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   At Citylights, for example, the 42-story building that looms
over the Long Island City side of the East River, there have been
nine price increases since the plan was accepted on April 27, 1997.
So the cost of a two-bedroom with a den on the 18th floor, which
was $73,600 a year ago, is now $113,197, while the price of a
one-bedroom penthouse, $75,048 at the offering, has nearly tripled
to $210,423.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not buyer beware, but buyer be aware that upon acceptance
of the plan it is likely that prices will increase almost
immediately,'' said Kevin Singleton, vice president of Rockrose
Corp., developers of 99 Jane St., where Ms. Manganaro faced the
brutal truth of the current seller's market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just raised the price again,'' Singleton said two weeks
ago, ``and I'm preparing a third amendment for an additional price
increase. It is a helium-filled marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the offering plan for 99 Jane St. was accepted on June 19,
Singleton said, prices have increased, on average, by 5 percent _
``some apartments 2 percent, some apartments 7 percent'' _ with a
third price-change amendment in the offing. ``It's a question of
when I do it, tomorrow, Monday, but I am going to do it,''
Singleton said two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   And so, for example, apartment 3H, a three-bedroom originally
offered at $840,000, increased to $848,400 on June 22, three days
after the plan was accepted; to $855,000 a week later, on June 29,
and, ``If I had to project,'' Singleton said, will soon go to
$865,000.
</P>
<P>
   It did, on July 15.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Manganaro's experience (and, presumably, those of other
would-be buyers, though no data are available) vividly illustrates
the confusions that the uninitiated buyer can encounter, first
during what the industry refers to as the CPS1 period, and then
after the offering plan has been accepted.
</P>
<P>
   During the former, no firm price can be declared by the
developer; during the latter, the prices initially listed in the
offering plan can shift virtually daily _ up or down _ based, of
course, on what the market will bear.
</P>
<P>
   CPS1 is shorthand for Cooperative Policy Statement 1, and it
sets out the attorney general's rules governing how a developer may
test the market for a new building before filing the offering plan,
and, for that matter, even before construction is completed.
``Essentially, they are trying to see if there is enough interest
to go forward with the development,'' said Gary Connor, chief of
enforcement for the attorney general's real-estate financing
bureau.
</P>
<P>
   After the plan is accepted, ``and until something is signed,''
cautioned Stuart Saft, chairman of the Council of New York
Cooperatives, ``the developer can change the price 40 times'' _ a
figure of speech rather than a statutory limit.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Manganaro had seen an ad for 99 Jane St. _ an H-shaped,
83-unit building with skyline and harbor views, in January _ during
the CPS1 period. ``I went over with my husband and met the agent,''
she said. ``We wanted a three-bedroom. He told us it was about
$675,000 and that, of course, prices were subject to change, which
we understood because it was so far in advance and they hadn't even
filed the plan yet. We said keep in touch because we really liked
the space.''
</P>
<P>
   Connor of the attorney general's office explained that during
the CPS1 period, which lasts 120 days but can be extended for an
additional 60 days, ``developers can advertise and take names of
people who are interested, but they cannot take money. They can
talk about price ranges, but nothing specific. No reservations can
be accepted; no deposits can be accepted, and all advertisements
must be approved by our office.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was in May that the CPS1 period for 99 Jane St. ended and the
broker called, inviting Ms. Manganaro back to the sales office
downtown, with its table-top model of the still-aborning building,
its finely appointed model kitchen and its walls adorned with
full-color, floor-to-ceiling photographs of what the views will be
like when construction is completed early next year.
</P>
<P>
   During that phone conversation, Ms. Manganaro said, ``He told us
that the prices had all been raised, they were close to getting an
offering plan and the three-bedroom ones were now at $725,000'' _
up from the $675,000 range that had been discussed in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that became out of our reach, the three-bedroom,'' Ms.
Manganaro said, ``and we made an appointment to meet him again and
look at two-bedrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   The agent told the couple of a ground-floor two-bedroom with a
sizable patio selling for $635,000 _ ``very doable for us,'' Ms.
Manganaro said. Soon after, matters got confused and tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made an appointment to look at the site in two weeks, a
Wednesday,'' Ms. Manganaro said. ``We go over, put on the hard
hats, look at the apartment. We go home, go over the numbers. We
talk, we talk, we talk.''
</P>
<P>
   The following day, Ms. Manganaro and her husband left a message
for the broker saying they were willing to pay the full $635,000
for the two-bedroom and asking that he call as soon as the offering
plan and contract were available. ``He called later that day and
said, `Come in tomorrow, I have everything ready for you,''' Ms.
Manganaro said. ``So I go in on that Friday and he wasn't there.
The other broker says, `Which unit?' I said 1F, and she says: `Oh,
somebody else wants that apartment. There's nothing here for you to
pick up.'''
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, the original broker called, Ms. Manganaro said,
and asked her to come to the office the following Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go in Monday,'' she said. ``He comes out and says: `We have
a problem. So many people are interested in the apartment you like
that we've raised the price $50,000.' I'm like shocked. `I thought
we were first in line; we've been talking to you since January. I
thought this was a done deal.'''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it was no deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, in this marketplace,'' said Singleton of
Rockrose, ``there will be unhappy prospective purchasers _ and
`prospective' is the key word. The day it's approved, it goes up,
particularly these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Skolnick, vice president of Jack Parker Corp., developers
of eight residential buildings _ most recently the Knickerbocker at
308 East 72nd St. _ said, ``In our sales office, people come in one
day, fail to make a decision and come back the next day only to
find that the same home is available but for more money; and they
still go ahead and buy.''
</P>
<P>
   There were nine price increases at the Knickerbocker during a
seven-month sell-out, Skolnick said, ranging from $5,000 to
$400,000, depending on the unit. ``An apartment could start at $1.5
million and ultimately go for $1.9 million,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers must realize, Skolnick said, ``that pricing has not
reached its peak in any way, shape or form.''
</P>
<P>
   Saft of the Council of New York Cooperatives said that given the
current system, a jolt of sticker shock and disappointment is
inevitable, for some. Saft explained how _ unlike the case with
price increases for an existing building that a sponsor is
converting to a co-op or condominium _ it is possible for the
developer of a new building to raise rates virtually at will.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are converting an existing building,'' he said, ``the
tenants have a 90-day exclusive right to buy their apartment, and
the sponsor is not permitted, by law, to negotiate separate prices
_ meaning that if he is going to offer a tenant a 5 percent
discount, he has to offer it to every tenant. And he has to amend
the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   To change prices _ or, for that matter, to make any sort of
material change in the offering plan _ the sponsor of the
conversion must send the proposed amendment to the attorney
general's office, which reviews it to make sure it fully discloses
whatever the sponsor is trying to do, and then accepts the
amendment for filing. ``Only then can the sponsor actually offer
the discount,'' Saft said.
</P>
<P>
   But in a new building _ as well as after the 90-day tenant's
exclusive period in a converted building _ the sponsor can
separately negotiate the price of a particular apartment,
regardless of what is being charged for any other apartment. ``He
can sell apartment 24C for $100,000 and the next day sell 23C, the
identical apartment, for $75,000,'' Saft said. And no amendment
need be submitted.
</P>
<P>
   The developer has to submit an amendment only if price changes
for all the apartments in the building or for a certain class of
apartments _ perhaps one line of units, from first to top floor _
are being sought. And if all that the developer is seeking are
price changes, with no other material fact regarding the building
needing to be disclosed, the amendment is automatically accepted by
the attorney general's office without further review.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Changing prices in a new building does not require a review
because there's nothing to disclose,'' Saft said. ``It's the
typical amendment form, but instead of having to go through the
review process, the developer can simply fax it in with the
amendment fee, $150, and it's considered approved.''
</P>
<P>
   The underlying legal premise, said Connor, is that ``the
attorney general does not regulate price, just the proper
disclosure of the prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Saft, asked if Ms. Manganaro could file suit, said: ``I don't
see how she has a claim. We have in New York the Statute of Frauds
_ it goes back to English common law _ and it requires that any
agreement to purchase real estate must be in writing and signed to
be valid. A verbal agreement doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Manganaro believes that she and her husband ``were just
totally used as a measuring stick to see what the market could
take. If he had said to us from the beginning that a lot of people
are interested and we don't know the price, I would have never put
on the hard hat and gone over to see this building.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't do anything illegal,'' she conceded, ``it's just
the way they treated us that made me the maddest, and the waste of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there is any way buyers can protect themselves, Saft
said, ``No, not really.''
</P>
<P>
   It can help, however, to have an idea of the principles and
strategies of the developers and their sales agents. ``The typical
developer strategy,'' said Clark Halstead, founder of the brokerage
that bears his name, ``is to underprice the offering slightly at
the beginning in order to generate some sales. And then, in the
minds of the public, the building is successful, allowing the
developer to file an amendment for price increases _ or several of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea for the consumer is to get there at the first
offering and enter into a contract right away, then feel very smart
as prices for similar units go up and up.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, works just fine for the seller, too _
particularly in a hot market. ``The usual puffery,'' said Saft,
``is that you better buy now because next week the prices are going
up.''
</P>
<P>
   In a less than torrid market, however, developers sometimes file
amendments, raising prices across the board, then offer individual
buyers discounts. ``Buyers tend to believe that the offering price
is the market price,'' Saft said. ``So, if the sponsor raises the
price and then offers a discount, the buyer thinks they are buying
at below market.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Rose, executive vice president of Rose Associates, a
long-time residential owner and developer in the city, points to
the paramount factor governing pricing for new apartments: ``Unlike
a rental, where you can make a correction when the apartment is
next vacant, when you're selling a condominium you only have one
bite of the apple.''
</P>
<P>
   In setting initial prices, a developer makes assumptions of what
the marketplace will value, Rose said, and the bank validates those
assumptions by putting up considerable funds for the construction
loan _ which the developer, of course, must repay.
</P>
<P>
   ``But neither the developer's team nor the brilliant bankers are
as smart as the marketplace,'' Rose said. ``It's easy, for example,
to assume that high-floor apartments with views are more valuable
than low-floor apartments. But in some cases, for instance when
contiguous to a park, low-floor apartments could be more
desirable.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his company's goals, Rose said, is to sell evenly. ``Some
people consider a quick sellout of one side of the building a great
success,'' he said. ``We prefer to adjust prices so that different
exposures and different floors sell in roughly the same
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if your initial offering is much too low for a particular
apartment line, it has to be adjusted very soon in your sales
process. Conversely, one line may be sitting untouched for too
long, and that price will have to be lowered.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrie Mandel, senior vice president of Corcoran Group, said
that in serving as a sales agent she has, on occasion, asked
developers to accept a sale at the previous price when a buyer has
viewed the apartment several times before a price change. ``They
agreed to this, no problem,'' she said, ``and felt it was the right
thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And Adrienne Albert, president of the Marketing Directors, which
specializes in acting as a sales agent, said that when a particular
buyer was close to making a decision she had sometimes asked the
developer ``for a certain time period, 24 to 48 hours, before a
price increase is effective in order to allow that buyer to make
their decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually it's granted,'' she said. ``Not always, but usually.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Albert said she wants prospective buyers to understand that
she has ``a fiduciary responsibility to the developer, our client,
to get them every dollar that we can.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all understand when there's a bidding war on a resale
apartment,'' she said. ``Why is it any different in new
construction? No one wants to irk the buyer, but the bottom-line
responsibility is to the client, the owner. It's not done to make
an enemy.''

 &HT;    Murphy Hall call may wait
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown has been very good to
former players with Atlanta ties. Braves knuckleballer Phil Niekro
was inducted last year; Braves announcer Don Sutton gets the call
today.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the fact that one of Atlanta's favorite players is
about to become eligible for the Hall, don't expect the string to
go on.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Murphy's name goes on the ballot for the 1999 inductees
later this year, but it doesn't appear he'll come close to getting
the 75 percent of the votes needed for induction. Murphy deserves
to get in. He was the best offensive player in the game at one
time, winning two league MVPs and finishing with 398 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   But the competition will be brutal.
</P>
<P>
   George Brett, Nolan Ryan, Carlton Fisk and Robin Yount are
eligible. Each player can make a stronger argument for induction
than Murphy, and history suggests that only four will make it.
There has been only one five-player induction in history. In 1936,
the Hall's first class included Ty Cobb, Walter Johnson, Christy
Mathewson, Babe Ruth and Honus Wager. In 1947, the writers voted in
their only four-player class.
</P>
<P>
   At the All-Star Game, a group of writers with Hall of Fame
votes, in an unofficial discussion, outlined their thoughts about
the process this time. Ryan and Brett, two of the game's best, are
locks. Yount, who finished with 3,142 hits and had a great
relationship with the media, could make it. Fisk likely will have
to wait at least a year, because he will be compared with Johnny
Bench, the last catcher inducted.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion on Murphy focused on the last years of his
career, when his numbers dropped dramatically because of injuries.
But the feeling is Murphy eventually will make it. He will be
helped by the fact that while some writers don't vote for certain
players because they don't like them; some will vote for Murphy
because they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dale may be the only guy I know who could call 24 guys in one
locker room a good friend,'' Sutton once said.
</P>
<P>
   And Murphy will have a lot of fans pulling for him. The ``Dale
Murphy Induction Society'' page already is on the Internet. The
mission: ``To educate those misguided souls as to why Dale Murphy
is deserving of induction.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy will have a better chance in 2000, when the best
first-timer is Goose Gossage. Then it gets tougher during the next
two seasons, with Kirby Puckett, Dave Winfield, Andre Dawson and
Ozzie Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Murphy is in Boston serving a three-year term on a
Mormon mission. And knowing him, he probably hasn't thought at all
about the upcoming vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never known anyone like him,'' said former Braves manager
Chuck Tanner. ``God only makes one like Dale every 50 years.''

 &HT;    A long way from Clio to Cooperstown
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. -- In his term as top Dodger, Buzzie Bavasi
ran spring training at Vero Beach like it was Boys Town with
laughs. He filled the air with his good nature and wanted to be
sure everybody was having a good time. He would make a point each
spring of picking his choice for prospect of the camp. Most likely
to be a hit in Tinsel Town. Most of the time he had a winner. Wes
Parker, Bill Russell and Jim Lefebvre come to mind.
</P>
<P>
   It was a stretch in 1966 when he said, ``I really got one for
you now. Just a kid, one season in the minor leagues. He's my guy
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The kid was still 20, began life in rural Alabama but became a
city boy when his daddy moved the family to Pensacola. It's my
guess that the late Leon Hamilton discovered him. That was his
territory. Besides, the two had one trait in common _ there was
some brashness and a strong self-confidence in both.
</P>
<P>
   So Donald Howard Sutton reported to the farm club in Santa
Barbara and nobody could beat him in the California League, so he
made the lunar leap to Albuquerque. Between the two teams, he won
23 games and Bavasi couldn't wait to get him in a Dodger suit.
That's the last Sutton ever saw of the minor leagues. Twenty-three
years later, he had won 324 major league games, struck out 3,574
batters (fifth all-time), pitched 58 shutouts and a mile-high
number of innings, 5,282.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't confine his art to Los Angeles. When free agency came
in style, he moved around like a traveling salesman. The Astros,
the Brewers, the Angels, the A's were stops he made, until
returning to the Dodgers for an encore in 1988. So when he is
embraced by the Hall of Fame in that big pasture at Cooperstown
this afternoon, five clubs will be taking bows, but his heart will
be pumping Dodgers blue. From Clio, Ala., to Cooperstown, one giant
step for a man with a program.
</P>
<P>
   One reason he went back to the Dodgers one more time was to make
connections for his next career. He was not one of these big
leaguers whose first reaction after it's over is, ``Where'd
everybody go? Where's the cheering?'' Sutton transferred his
interest from arm to larynx. He knew what he wanted to be and went
to work at it. He didn't leap from locker room to broadcast booth
cold turkey. He got prepared. He even went back to college for a
spell. He'd had a brush with the intellectual foundry before at
Mississippi College. He sold himself to the Braves and here he has
grown roots.
</P>
<P>
   His style is his own. It's not polished brass. He doesn't try to
play baritone. His is a plain old Southern dialect with a lot of
what the game is all about. He can rankle and he can be gentle. And
to remind him of where he came from, I sometimes mention that he
once set a record for losing most times in a row to one team. The
Cubs beat him 13 straight. And that he once gave up three straight
home runs in an inning. To balance out, though, there's the other
record of most seasons in a row striking out 100 or more batters,
19, later broken by Nolan Ryan (who else?).
</P>
<P>
   In passing, I should like to do homage to Lee MacPhail, who
played several roles in the game, a gentleman of integrity. And to
Larry Doby, the first black American Leaguer. I'm left to wonder if
the man who brought him to the league will ever be so honored by
the Oldtimers Committee. Crusty Bill Veeck, and it may be that the
applied adjective is the answer, as it was for so many years with
Leo Durocher. And a bow here to an old friend, Sam Lacey, 94, the
Baltimore columnist who hasn't yet found a quitting place and goes
in representing those of us who still hack away.

 &HT;    Sutton on induction:`I earned the right'
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ When Don Sutton takes the podium this
afternoon to deliver his Hall of Fame induction speech, he will
first pause and look down at the front row.
</P>
<P>
   And he will smile.
</P>
<P>
   There, little daughter Jacqueline, who two years ago fought so
hard to live after a premature birth, will be seated on the lap of
Sutton's wife, Mary.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a special moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mary is trying to get her to say, `There's my daddy,'
'' Sutton said. ``That part of it will be very emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   In career that lasted through 23 years and 324 victories, Sutton
proved he was one of the greatest big-game pitchers of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton will be inducted with Larry Doby, the first black player
in the American League; Bullet Joe Rogan, a Negro Leagues
pitcher/outfielder; George Davis, a turn-of-the-century shortstop;
and former American League president Lee MacPhail. The Hall will
also welcome Spanish-language broadcaster Jaime Jarrin, who has
been doing Dodgers games since 1959, and writer Sam Lacy, one of
the first black members of the Baseball Writers Association of
America. He worked in both Washington and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton said the Hall of Fame induction is something he has
wanted since he was a little boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why I had to win 300 games, so I could have this
day,'' Sutton said. ``I thought if I could win 300, it would be
very hard to justify me not being in the Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, who played for five teams, will wear a Dodgers hat going
into the Hall. He played his first 15 seasons and his final one
with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't find any reason not to; it's what my mother would have
wanted; it's what (Dodgers manager) Walter Alston would have
wanted; it's what the (former Dodgers owners) O'Malleys would want;
it's what my dad wants.''
</P>
<P>
   He plans to mention a lot of people in his speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be a chance to line everybody up that has been a
part of it in a receiving line and shake their hand and introduce
them to you and thank them,'' he said. ``I earned the right to be
there. I have already seen all the games. More than anything else,
it should be a chance to make people aware of how many people
believed it would be possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Some players ask other Hall of Famers for advice on the speech.
Not Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be influenced by what other players said and
did,'' he said. ``This is my day. I've gone through it over and
over, and every time I get very emotional about it. It's going to
require a lot of effort, and I am going to have a hard time going
through it.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes the bronze plaque will feature his famous curls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (had) better,'' he said, ``otherwise I will send it to the
beauty parlor.''

 &HT;    Cooperstown ceremonies crown a hard-won honor
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. -- During a game in Pittsburgh in the late
1970s, Don Sutton was kneeling in the on-deck circle in the sixth
inning when he heard a whisper from the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   It was Tommy Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psst,'' the Dodgers manager said. ``Hey, Don, come on back.
I'm hitting for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton couldn't believe it. It was early in the game, his team
was behind by one run, and he had pitched too well to be pulled for
a pinch hitter with nobody on base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psst,'' said Lasorda, more insistent this time. ``Come on.''
</P>
<P>
   As an angry Sutton returned to the dugout, his teammates,
fearing the worst, scattered. But Sutton didn't throw anything. He
calmly put on his warmup jacket and walked into the tunnel. Because
Lasorda had a rule that no one could leave the park before the game
was over, Sutton knew he couldn't dress and exit. So he walked up
to the stadium club with his uniform on, sat at a table near a
window, ordered a bottle of wine and asked for a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   His call was to Lasorda in the dugout. When Lasorda looked up to
the stadium club, Sutton raised his glass in a toast and gave his
manager a big smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have seen the look on Tommy's face,'' Sutton said.
``But I didn't break any rules, I didn't leave the park.''
</P>
<P>
   Such was the 23-year career of Don Sutton. He pushed things to
the edge, did things his own way, said things he probably shouldn't
have, but most of the time he got the last laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Although not as talented as Nolan Ryan or Tom Seaver, he was
determined to win 300 games. Many felt it would be impossible, but
he again had the last laugh _ not only winning No. 300, but 24 more
before he took the cap off those familiar curls.
</P>
<P>
   No one knew him better than three catchers _ Joe Ferguson, Steve
Yeager and Bob Boone _ who caught him during a career that spanned
three decades.
</P>
<P>
   They understand why Sutton will become the 62nd pitcher to be
inducted in baseball's Hall of Fame today. And they're amazed that
it took five tries for him to make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because people don't judge (longevity as talent),''
said Boone, a special scouting assistant for the Cincinnati Reds.
``They don't consider that talent. ... He's the winningest pitcher
in Dodgers history, and look at how many great pitchers have been
there. He deserves it and should have been there a few years ago.
His stats haven't changed since that first year on the ballot; he
hasn't won any more games. But he has handled everything like he
did when he played, as a consummate professional.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also a tireless worker, a characteristic learned while
growing up in Clio, Ala., a small coal town. Sutton once said he
was born in ``a tar-paper shack,'' but his life took an abrupt
change in 1966 when he arrived in Los Angeles to join Sandy Koufax
and Don Drysdale on the Dodgers' staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comparing me to Sandy Koufax is like comparing Earl Scheib to
Michelangelo,'' Sutton once said. But he adjusted quickly and fit
in with the Dodgers because he studied the techniques of others. He
never stopped watching Koufax and Drysdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don had a good sense of not only the game he wanted to pitch,
but he also knew the hitters and how to expose them,'' said
Ferguson, manager for Baltimore's Class AA team in Bowie, Md. ``In
tough situations, he would never give in to hitters. He was going
to throw his pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Success came quickly. He only led the staff in victories during
two of his first 15 years with the Dodgers, but he was a model of
consistency. Even when he left the Dodgers in 1980, he kept winning
with the Brewers, Angels and Astros. He won more than 10 games in
21 of 23 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton never admitted or denied that he used every trick in the
book to get some of those victories. There were times when he would
stuff his pocket with dirty notes for umpires, because he knew they
were going to check him.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton recalls the day he met Gaylord Perry, another pitcher
known for his ``expertise'' on the mound. ``He handed me a tube of
Vaseline. I thanked him and gave him a sheet of sandpaper,'' Sutton
said. And when Sutton was asked time and time again if he doctored
the baseball with foreign substances, he said: ``Not true at all.
Vaseline is manufactured right here in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton maintains a similar vein of honesty today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I fool with the ball? Daily,'' he said. ``I never got
caught doing anything illegal to the ball. I won 324 games, too. I
pitched 5,000 innings, too. I had 3,500 strikeouts, too.''
</P>
<P>
   His catchers take a philosophical approach when explaining
Sutton's mastery.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was enforced then and what rules are enforced now are two
different things,'' Ferguson said. ``Pitchers back then did things
they could get away with. They would do anything to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Boone: ``There is an art to that, to knowing your craft,
just knowing everything about what you do for a living. Back then a
pitcher would pick a ball with a scuff on it and figure out how he
could make it sail. I have played with a lot of golfers, and they
can hit the ball right at the tree and cut it to the left or right
before it hits it. I think any polished major league pitcher could
do that to a ball with a scuff on it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times I would get a ball with a scuff on it and get
it past the umpire and throw it back to the mound,'' said Yeager,
who is in private business. ``Today, a pitcher throws it out of the
game when it's a little dirty. What a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton also was a controversial figure off the field, a
well-spoken wisecracker. He fought with teammate Steve Garvey, and
both ended up with black eyes. He once told people this about
Lasorda: ``I'm leery of Tommy. I believe in God, not the Big Dodger
in the Sky.'' And there was the time he called the police on Angels
teammate John Candelaria for drinking. Some said Sutton wanted
Candelaria's spot in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, did he have guts, both on the field and off of it,''
Yeager said.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton pitched in five league championships and four World
Series. In 1982, at age 37, Sutton led the Brewers to a final-game
victory over Jim Palmer and the Orioles for the division title.
Palmer had won 13 of his last 14 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when we were playing the Pirates in the 1974
playoffs,'' Ferguson said. ``We knew the Pirates were a
free-swinging team with Willie Stargell and all those big bats. Don
knew as soon as a pitcher would cock his arm against the Pirates,
they would start swinging. So he told me he probably would not
throw more than a dozen balls in the strike zone that night. He
didn't and we won.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ferguson said Sutton was honest about his limitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day we went out to the mound and (manager) Walter Alston
wanted to know if Don was through,'' Ferguson said. ``Don said to
ask me, so I said to get him out of there. I got a note after the
game from Don, and it said, `I'm glad you were honest, I didn't
have anything left.' You see, he knew how to pace himself.''
</P>
<P>
   And for 23 years he paced himself, finishing with 3,574
strikeouts, fifth all-time. He got his 300th win at age 41. He
returned to the Dodgers for one last hurrah in 1988. He was 3-6.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton said he hasn't stayed close to Yeager and Ferguson, but
he is close to Boone, who cannot join him at the ceremony today
because of scheduling conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a good friend of mine,'' Boone said. ``He sure was fun
to have as a teammate. Don was the tour director. He always would
set up dinner, and we would go out and try different wines, things
that are fun, the reasons for living.''
</P>
<P>
   And today, they all raise a glass to Sutton.

 &HT;    The short, sweet life of McCall Akin
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Ala. -- A top a wooded mountain ridge covered in
morning mist, 300 mourners gathered Saturday to say goodbye to
McCall Cameron Akin, the 2 1/2-year-old Kennesaw girl who died
Wednesday from an E. coli infection.
</P>
<P>
   At the same gazebo where her parents exchanged wedding vows five
years ago, friends and family dwelled not on the mystery of the
fatal illness that felled the child, but on the ``miracle'' of her
final month.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those of us who have been faithfully praying for this
child, this could be a time of anger,'' said the Rev. Doris
McCafferty of Huntsville Unity On The Mountain church. ``We
sincerely believed in miracles. We truly expected life.''
</P>
<P>
   McCafferty conceded that she felt helpless when she was summoned
Tuesday to Scottish Rite Children's Medical Center in Atlanta. Her
prayer group made the four-hour trip to Atlanta in silence, ``each
of us lost in confusing, soul-searching thoughts.'' They
collectively wondered how they could ease the anguish of McCall's
parents, Marisa and Andy Akin, or face the prospect of seeing the
little girl who would never again spontaneously break into choruses
of ``America the Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As we walked toward the ICU, I thought my heart would break,''
McCafferty said. ``But when I laid my eyes on McCall, she looked
untouched. McCall looked perfect, beautiful. She was manifesting in
the truth of who and what she really was, after all the assaults on
her physical body.''
</P>
<P>
   McCafferty, echoing sentiments of the family, expressed
amazement of the support that had cascaded from churches, prayer
groups, hospitals, even the Internet _ over the plight of a little
girl many of them did not personally know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left that hospital feeling we had been part of a very sacred
experience,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As the service ended, Marisa Akin gently released two balloons
into the sky _ one pink, one purple, her daughter's favorite
colors.
</P>
<P>
   During Friday evening's visitation at the Weeden House Museum,
people stood in a receiving line for 75 minutes to deliver their
condolences. Photos of McCall were placed around the antiques and
artwork in the antebellum home. One showed her posing last Easter
with a basket of goodies and a white bunny, her baby bare feet
peeking out from a long white dress.
</P>
<P>
   So many flower arrangements had been delivered to Weeden House,
its sprawling downstairs rooms could not contain them. Several
bouquets arrived from strangers who were grieving a child known
only to them in cyberspace as McCall, the sickest child of an
Atlanta-area E. coli outbreak, the child whose smiling face
appeared on an Internet site asking for prayers.
</P>
<P>
   As McCall tried to fend off the ruthless bacterial infection for
more than a month, thousands of people checked the site for daily
reports on her condition. ``This thing just shotgunned over the
Internet in ways I never expected,'' said Mark Long of Huntsville,
who is the boyfriend of McCall's maternal grandmother, Marvene
Nichols. Long issued the daily bulletins beginning June 17, through
an Internet site for music fans that he already had launched.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a tremendous response from people of all
denominations,'' he said. ``It was very positive, and no one was
intrusive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet there were 100,000 people praying for this girl all over
the world,'' said Charles Henderson, McCall's great-uncle from
Starkville, Miss. ``It was remarkable how far and wide that Web
site and e-mail list spread.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site remained unknown to the media until July 1, when
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution learned about it. The site then
quickly vanished after the family was asked about using material
from it.
</P>
<P>
   Both Long and Nichols said McCall's parents knew about the Web
site and appreciated the prayers and electronic messages of
support. However, they also wanted their ordeal to remain private
as long as possible as they dealt with their only child's
deteriorating condition, even though they understood the Internet
information to be in the public domain, Long said. Following
McCall's death, Long said the family did not object to publishing
the Web site material.
</P>
<P>
   People sent prayers and e-mails of concern from as far away as
Romania, Japan and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   McCall may have succumbed sooner had it not been for
``something'' that suddenly seemed to revive her _ twice _ on the
brink of death, Long and Nichols believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been some real miracles, if you will, that have defied
medical logic as a result of people praying all over the world;
both Marvene and I really believe that,'' Long said last week, when
it appeared McCall had slightly improved. ``We had a couple of real
close calls, so close the family said their goodbyes, and at the
11th hour, she pulled through.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall's plight first appeared with the header ``Urgent!
Urgent!'' under a Web site created for classical guitar fans called
``Classical Guitar Aficionados Page.''
</P>
<P>
   It read: ``I am requesting prayers for a 2-year-old girl named
McCall who is currently in an intensive care unit in Atlanta
fighting a serious case of food poisoning from E-coli. It does not
matter what your religion or denomination is. This child needs all
the help she can get. I apologize for such a personal message on
the page. But this child is dangerously ill and is the only child
of some very dear friends of mine. Thank you for your help.'' It
was signed, ``Mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Day by day, updates of between two to 10 paragraphs appeared on
the site, providing details on the child's medical condition and
the family's request for prayers.
</P>
<P>
   The idea to ask for prayers on the information superhighway
suddenly struck the 34-year-old Long one night when he was praying.
``It was really strange. I was praying for healing, for taking care
of her, and the thought just popped into my head to request prayers
off my (Web) page. It seemed I couldn't finish my prayer until I
sat down and wrote out that message.''
</P>
<P>
   Long said he felt like a reporter at times, remaining detached
so he could document the ordeal. After visiting McCall in the ICU
ward for the first time June 20, he wrote: ``To say I was a little
taken back emotionally is a bit of an understatement. Before me was
a child that had a startling number of wires and tubes attached to
her. She was sedated as she had been placed on a respirator from
the night before. Her father was sitting there beside her bed when
I was there. I was amazed at his strength and composure. ... As a
physical therapist, I have worked with all manner of sickness and
have been around things that would make the ordinary person
squeamish. ... But to see this beautiful little girl lying there,
who just a few weeks before rode on my back as I played like a
horse, made me feel like I had never stepped into a hospital room
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Many entries revealed the tricks of the E. coli toxin that
seemed to move in a series of ebbs and flows, leaving doctors
puzzled and her parents panicked. Day by day, the results of a
disease called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), caused by E. coli
poisoning, were laid out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was informed that HUS creates a toxin that literally shreds
the platelets in the blood. The shredded platelets in turn
coagulate in the kidneys and effectively shut them down. This is
exactly what happened to McCall,'' Long wrote June 19.
</P>
<P>
   The site vanished from the Internet after a Journal-Constitution
reporter spoke with the family about it. It disappeared with this
explanation: ``McCall made it through surgery. There has been a
leak to the Atlanta media about this page. My worse fears of the
misuse of these updates have been realized as a reporter questioned
the father about today's operation. ... I know that a lot of good
has been accomplished here, and it is with regret that I must cease
these updates. Please continue the prayers!''

 &HT;    Sutton on induction:`I earned the right'
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ When Don Sutton takes the podium this
afternoon to deliver his Hall of Fame induction speech, he will
first pause and look down at the front row.
</P>
<P>
   And he will smile.
</P>
<P>
   There, little daughter Jacqueline, who two years ago fought so
hard to live after a premature birth, will be seated on the lap of
Sutton's wife, Mary.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a special moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mary is trying to get her to say, `There's my daddy,'
'' Sutton said. ``That part of it will be very emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   In career that lasted through 23 years and 324 victories, Sutton
proved he was one of the greatest big-game pitchers of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton will be inducted with Larry Doby, the first black player
in the American League; Bullet Joe Rogan, a Negro Leagues
pitcher/outfielder; George Davis, a turn-of-the-century shortstop;
and former American League president Lee MacPhail. The Hall will
also welcome Spanish-language broadcaster Jaime Jarrin, who has
been doing Dodgers games since 1959, and writer Sam Lacy, one of
the first black members of the Baseball Writers Association of
America. He worked in both Washington and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton said the Hall of Fame induction is something he has
wanted since he was a little boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why I had to win 300 games, so I could have this
day,'' Sutton said. ``I thought if I could win 300, it would be
very hard to justify me not being in the Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, who played for five teams, will wear a Dodgers hat going
into the Hall. He played his first 15 seasons and his final one
with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't find any reason not to; it's what my mother would have
wanted; it's what (Dodgers manager) Walter Alston would have
wanted; it's what the (former Dodgers owners) O'Malleys would want;
it's what my dad wants.''
</P>
<P>
   He plans to mention a lot of people in his speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be a chance to line everybody up that has been a
part of it in a receiving line and shake their hand and introduce
them to you and thank them,'' he said. ``I earned the right to be
there. I have already seen all the games. More than anything else,
it should be a chance to make people aware of how many people
believed it would be possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Some players ask other Hall of Famers for advice on the speech.
Not Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be influenced by what other players said and
did,'' he said. ``This is my day. I've gone through it over and
over, and every time I get very emotional about it. It's going to
require a lot of effort, and I am going to have a hard time going
through it.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes the bronze plaque will feature his famous curls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (had) better,'' he said, ``otherwise I will send it to the
beauty parlor.''

CAPITOL POLICE MOURN, SEEK RESPECT FROM THOSE THEY PROTECT
<TEXT>
<P>
   By GREG McDONALD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1998 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Anger and frustration mingled with sorrow Saturday
as the death of two Capitol policemen prompted complaints from
other officers about disrespect.
</P>
<P>
   The business-as-usual atmosphere as the Capitol reopened to
members, staff and tourists was what congressional leaders and
Capitol police brass had sought to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   But for some police officers, maintaining the appearance that
everything was normal was not an easy task while mourning the loss
of their partners and trying to deal with hard feelings about what
they view as discourteous behavior toward them on occasion by staff
and members.
</P>
<P>
   Officer T.E. Dove complained that he feels a level of
``disrespect'' from staff sometimes because they tend to look on
him as an inexperienced hired guard who does little more than
direct traffic and stand around instead of a ``well-trained police
officer whose job it is to protect them at all costs''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, it took two officers' lives to make the
point,'' he said. ``Maybe this will make them show us a little more
respect and appreciate us a little more as police officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Dove said he sometimes receives better treatment from tourists
because they recognize how ``tough'' the job of being a Capitol
police officer is.
</P>
<P>
   That contention was reinforced by a number of floral tributes
left on the steps of the Capitol on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thoughts and prayers are with you. May God give you
comfort,'' read one card pinned to a small bouquet.
</P>
<P>
   Dove's comments, and those of two other Capitol policemen who
asked not to be identified, were apparently aimed at critics who
have suggested in the past that officers are not trained properly
and that too many of the positions are nothing more than patronage
slots filled with friends and even relatives of members and top
congressional staff.
</P>
<P>
   Detective John Gibson, an 18-year police veteran who was killed
in the Capitol shootout along with Officer Jacob J. Chestnut, was
married to the niece of Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson was assigned to guard House Majority Whip Tom DeLay,
R-Sugar Land, and his actions in bringing down suspect Russell
Weston while taking fire himself were described Saturday as a
``heroic response'' in the most difficult of situations.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the complaints about disrespect, DeLay told
reporters Saturday that he thought it would be ``tragic'' if any
Capitol police officer feels that way. But, he said, ``I think,
certainly, they'll be treated even better and with more respect
after this incident.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay met privately Saturday afternoon with the families of both
dead officers to offer condolences and to reassure them that their
financial needs would be taken care of through a memorial fund to
be set up by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He called the incident ``so senseless. But (the officers) did
their duty, they stood their ground, and they protected the Capitol
and people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the shootings, the building was opened to tourists
Saturday at the normal time of 9 a.m. Other than a few more police
being visible, there was no sign of any heightened security
precautions, and most officers seemed to think that the system in
place worked pretty well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our security is top-notch already. Unless you put everybody in
a steel box and X-ray their entire body as they come in, you can't
upgrade our system,'' said one officer.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the tourists on Capitol Hill Saturday seemed to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any amount of security is going to stop some
wacko who wants to get in,'' said Ron Petro from Three Oaks, Mich.
``Even the ultimate in security can't stop someone intent on doing
something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Petro, his wife and three sons tried to get into the Capitol on
Friday afternoon shortly after the shooting. But they were turned
back by police. He said they decided to try again Saturday because
they did not want to leave Washington without touring the Senate
and House chambers where the nation's laws are made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tragedy, but I don't fear for my own safety or my
family's,'' Petro said. ``I don't know what's it's usually like up
here, but it seems pretty normal to me. Like you can't even tell
that anything happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Things did seem close to normal on Saturday. The lines for
tickets into the Capitol building were long, like they usually are
during summer vacation time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Routine business in the face of great tragedy,'' is how one
police captain described it.
</P>
<P>
   But the flags flying at half-staff, and grim-faced police
officers with strips of black material across their badges were
reminders of the previous day's deadly violence. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Some parts of the building also remained off limits to
tourists. DeLay's office, for example, was closed because it had
become a crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Pausing near the whip's office, John Rogero, a tourist from
Orlando, Fla., said he was not surprised that things appeared
normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really hasn't made a whole lot of difference to us or
anybody else, if you look around at people here,'' he said. ``I
think we've gotten kind of numb to crime and shootings (in the
United States), and we're just here for our vacation, and even
though it's a sad incident, it hasn't impacted on us.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay said that Congress would try to resume its business next
week on schedule. But Monday and Tuesday are expected to be taken
up by tributes and a memorial service for the fallen police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to design the schedule of the House to honor these
two men and their families,'' he said.

PAK WANTS TO BE THE WORLD'S BEST GOLFER, OF ANY GENDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By GENE MENEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only 20 years old and six years after starting the game, Se Ri
Pak has reached unimaginable frontiers and golfed where few have
golfed before.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean rookie is the first player under 21 to win two
majors in one season with her victories at this year's McDonald's
LPGA Championship and U.S. Women's Open. She ranks as the youngest
player to win a U.S. Women's Open championship. She holds the
all-time, lowest 18-hole score in an LPGA event shooting 61 at the
Jamie Farr Kroger Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Her list of accomplishments rolls on like one of her 250-yard
drives on a hard, downhill fairway. Any golfing frontier _ Hall of
Famer, Grand Slam winner, best woman player ever _ seems possible.
</P>
<P>
   At least in this lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her goal is to come back (reincarnated) as a man,'' said Kelly
Leadbetter, Pak's self-described ``sparring partner'' and wife of
Pak's swing guru, David Leadbetter. ``Her goal is not to be the
best woman golfer in the world. She wants to be the best golfer in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Pak says she does not believe in reincarnation as much as
other Buddhist followers, she has given the idea some thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I just want to play men,'' said Pak, who speaks
fractured English. ``Maybe I die and born again and maybe I am boy.
I just want to play the men tours. I just want to play a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak, already a three-time winner, and her buttery swing have
burst onto the golf scene in a way that only a Tiger can rival, and
even he did not have so much success so quickly. The speed of her
success might be more impressive than the success itself or the
fact that she has attained success despite living away from her
family and friends or the impact she already has made on her life,
the tour and the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am really surprised myself,'' Pak said. ``At that time (of
the LPGA victory), I can win tournament in this country, but not
that fast, that quick. Maybe win tournament two years, three years
later. That time I know many things about the many golf course,
this country, many things.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is first year, I don't know that much many golf
course. Everything is new, but I win two majors already.''
</P>
<P>
   So who is Se Ri Pak? First of all, she may be Se Ri Park.
</P>
<P>
   The golfer admitted her father, Joon Chul, may have made a
mistake when he filled out her passport application.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made that P-A-K because I am special,'' she said. ``Just
special so maybe better and more easy for people.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in South Korea, Pak participated in track and field,
competing in the 100 meters, 100-meter hurdles, shot put and sprint
relays. Her father trained her by making her run up the stairs of a
local building, which contributed to her fire-hydrant thighs on her
5-foot-6 frame.
</P>
<P>
   Her father also introduced Pak to golf six years ago, and, after
playing in a junior tournament, she immediately knew the sport was
for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I just want to change,'' Pak said. ``I told my dad I
just want to play golf now. Practice hard. I just want to be No. 1
in golf, the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak has all the backing she needs to attain that goal. Her
coach, Leadbetter, has worked with Nick Faldo, Nick Price and Ernie
Els, among others. He is being paid by Pak's sponsor, Samsung, the
Korean electronics firm, with whom Pak signed a 10-year contract in
1996. The contract, agreed to before Pak had even earned her LPGA
Tour card, provided Pak with a manager, fitness coach and sports
psychologist, among other personal services, paid for her travel
expenses and covered the rent on her apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The guaranteed deal paid Pak a reported $3.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   With her three LPGA victories, that price is going up. Pak's
bilingual manager, Steve Sung Yong Kil, said the sides are in the
process of renegotiating a new contract, ``much more than the
previous contract,'' and Samsung officials already have told Pak
they are sending her a new luxury car.
</P>
<P>
   When she is not working on becoming the world's top player, Pak
either plays the video game Tetris (''help more using brain,'' she
said), sleeps (''Just like `Boom.' Automatic,'' she said), studies
her English lessons or plays with her dog Happy, who helps her
battle loneliness in Orlando and on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to be Se Ri, like me,'' she said. ``Normal people
like they have many fun, go outside, many thing to do everything. I
just want to be like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am 20 years old, almost like kid.''
</P>
<P>
   When players and teachers talk about Pak they use the words
instincts and talent, not the kind of traits any hacker can pick up
by reading all of the golf instruction books at Barnes and Noble.
</P>
<P>
   Leadbetter first saw and, more importantly, heard the instincts
and talent first-hand in November 1996 when Pak first came to his
golf academy in Orlando. Pak was there to try to convince the swing
guru to work with her; Leadbetter almost exclusively works with
male players in order to avoid involvement with multiple tours.
</P>
<P>
   Pak did not have to do any talking. Her ball striking spoke
volumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could always tell somebody has great ability in golf to
strike the ball well because it is just a different sound about the
strike,'' Leadbetter said. ``The sound that she had on the shot was
very similar to the male tour players. This was very impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought if this girl has a brain, we can get her golf swing
right. If she thinks right, she's a can't-miss-type thing. You only
so often get young players who come along who just have so much
talent.''
</P>
<P>
   After Pak moved to Orlando two months later, they worked on
improving her posture and balance and shortening her backswing. It
worked. She tied for first at the LPGA's qualifying school, earning
her tour card for this season.
</P>
<P>
   Pak has an all-around game. Entering the Giant Eagle LPGA
Classic, which concludes today, Pak ranked 19th on the tour in
driving distance (249.23 yards), 18th in greens in regulation (68.5
percent) and eighth in birdies (208). Is there anything more than
driving it far, hitting greens and making birdies?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the mental game, and after outlasting amateur Jenny
Chuasiriporn in a grueling 20-hole playoff to win the U.S. Open,
Pak has that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have nervous,'' she said. ``I can control my mind. I
can control myself whether leader or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Said LPGA player and former teaching pro Pat Hurst at the U.S.
Open: ``Obviously, she can play. She is their big star athlete, not
just golfer, but athlete, in Korea. I think in order to do that she
has got to have the mental capacities to withstand all the
pressures that are coming just from her country alone, not only
herself, but from everybody else around her at home.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as Leadbetter can break down a golf swing into a million
pieces, he does not have a theory as to why Pak became so good
after just starting the game six years ago. However, his wife, who
has played on the tour since 1981, believes Pak simply has the
instincts.
</P>
<P>
   During a practice session last year, Kelly Leadbetter challenged
Pak with a long bunker shot, considered the toughest in golf. She
gave Pak thin lies, buried lies, side-hill lies and downhill lies.
Without any instruction, Pak stuck each 25-yard shot to within two
feet of the hole. Kelly Leadbetter thought to herself, ``Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can throw three balls in the heavy rough on a side-hill lie,
and it wouldn't take her but a few shots to really master how to
hit it out of there,'' Kelly Leadbetter said. ``I played with a lot
of really super golfers through my years on the tour, and seen a
lot of different swings, and this girl has got more talent than
anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's incredible. She's so gifted. She's the most instinctive
when it comes to playing a shot of any woman that I've seen play.''
</P>
<P>
   Every player has her kryptonite, and Pak's is her putting, which
can be erratic. Yet, she still ranked 47th on tour (29.92 putts per
round) entering the Giant Eagle.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, as good as Pak has been in her three victories
(including the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic in which she set the
LPGA's all-time, lowest 72-hole total at 261), she has been
mediocre in her other performances. In her other 14 events, Pak has
two top-20 finishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, say barring injury and loss of desire, I really do
think she is going to become very dominant in the world of golf,''
David Leadbetter said. ``There obviously are a lot of great players
there, but I think the other great players, the Annika Sorenstams
and Laura Davieses, really drive her to greater heights.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak already has had an impact on her own life, a life that might
never be the same for the phenom who just wants to live like any
other 20-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   She visited the White House as a guest of South Korean President
Kim Dae-Joong. A horde of Korean photographers and journalists
follow her from tournament to tournament.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Korean tourists to Orlando have added another stop
on their Walt Disney World-Epcot Center vacation: Shin Jung
Restaurant. At the restaurant, which Pak frequents three or four
times a week for the Doen Jang Jigae (soybean paste stew) or Kim
Chee Jigae (pickled spice cabbage stew), Korean tourists stop to
ask if Pak will be coming, said Po Lee, the restaurant owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 3,000 Korean population in Orlando, and everybody crazy
about it,'' Lee said. ``They are just proud of her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before (Pak) we just World Cup soccer. After she won two major
tournaments, everybody is looking for news on new superstar. She's
No. 1 in Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak has become so big in South Korea that LPGA commissioner Jim
Ritts said that previous negotiations with South Korean television
officials to televise more LPGA events have ``certainly
accelerated,'' with her victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have already seen is that the heat around and interest
around Se Ri Pak over the past three or four weeks has dramatically
expanded the number of general sports fans who previously might
have been only quietly interested or casually interested in the
game of golf,'' Ritts said. ``She has brought those fans squarely
into the interest circle of the LPGA, and that's important.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, her impact on the game and the tour will depend on
how well she continues her major-tournament-winning and
record-setting ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just 20 years old, two majors already, but I don't want
to stop here,'' Pak said. ``Keep doing it. Keep working hard. I
just want to be really, really top player. I just want to play
more, longer, long time, best player.''

CUTTING'S LIKE TO OTHER SPORTS, AS HORSES USE PRESSURE DEFENSE ON
COWS
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ It's a duel between frantic cow and
unyielding horse, like an isolation play in basketball or a
football carrier and tackler squaring off in the open field.
</P>
<P>
   For world-class competitor Leon Harrel and his cutting horse,
preventing a cow from returning to the herd is like a seasoned NBA
player fending off Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were a veteran and assigned to guard Michael Jordan, he
wouldn't run over you to get past you. He would try to maneuver his
way past you,'' said Harrel, who is competing in this week's
National Cutting Horse Association Summer Spectacular at Will
Rogers Memorial Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cows can't run over our horses, but they will try to
outmaneuver them to get back to the herd. Like basketball, your
horse keeps the cow out of shot range.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutting, a sport that emerged from cattle handling on the
Western frontier, begins with a rider entering a herd and
separating a lone cow. After the animal has been driven out of the
herd, it instinctively attempts to return.
</P>
<P>
   In competition, horses are judged on how aggressively and
gracefully they maneuver to keep the cow at bay. A run lasts 2 1/2
minutes; a competitor usually will separate and work two or three
cows in that time.
</P>
<P>
   The rewards are rich. The winner of the 1998 Futurity, the
sport's premier event staged in Fort Worth each December, is
expected to offer its open division winner at least $200,000. Next
Sunday night, after the 13-day show's final performance, the Summer
Spectacular open division winner is expected to pocket almost
$30,000.
</P>
<P>
   With the high stakes, competitors studiously understand and
explain their sport. Weatherford's Lindy Burch, who is one of two
women to win the Futurity and serves as an ambassador for the
association, also compares cutting to basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's like a basketball player bringing the ball down
the court,'' Burch said. ``The cow (that has been separated from
the herd) is the player bringing the ball down, and the herd is the
goal. The cow has an advantage because it knows how it is going to
attempt to drive to the goal. But my horse has to counteract the
cow's movements and keep it from driving its way to the herd.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran California trainer Scott Weis compares cutting to three
strenuous sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell my students that cutting is like playing tennis,'' Weis
said. ``The ball that's being hit toward you is the cow, and your
horse is the return shot, stopping the ball from getting past you
and the baseline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also like a goal-line stand in football. The cow is like
O.J. Simpson, and your horse is like Dick Butkus, who stops the
running back from a touchdown. It also can be compared to hockey.
The player driving the puck is the cow, and the horse is the goalie
who stops the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a hockey coach preparing his team for a Stanley Cup playoff
game, cutting competitors prepare with warmups on game day.
</P>
<P>
   Before two-time Futurity champion Harrel and a horse named Flips
Lil Angel competed late Friday morning at the Summer Spectacular,
the duo began preparing six hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The day began at 5:30 a.m. in dimly lit stalls at a Burleson
ranch with Harrel feeding the horse. At 6:15 a.m., Harrel saddled
the horse then trotted and galloped the animal for about 20
minutes, loosening its muscles and relaxing the animal.
</P>
<P>
   Harrel gathered about 25 head of cattle and drove them into a
practice arena. By 7, Harrel had separated and worked four cows,
making sure the horse was in tune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually don't have to work this horse very much before I
make a run,'' Harrel said. ``But an amateur rider had competed on
it the day before, so I wanted to make sure that the horse was
stopping right and everything was right.''
</P>
<P>
   At 8:30, there was the popping noise of hooves striking the
concrete floor and the splattering sound of water hoses as Harrel
washed the horse, making sure it would shine in the show ring. At
9, Harrel loaded the horse and left for the Will Rogers Equestrian
Center, arriving about 45 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   At 11, Harrel rode his horse into the coliseum arena during a
``timeout'' period, dubbed as a cattle change. After a group of 15
riders compete, a fresh herd of cattle is brought in for the next
group; cattle changes last about half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Harrel, the first rider in the third group, watched intently as
hired riders sifted through the herd, attempting to settle the
cattle. Harrel sat hunched in the saddle at the back of the pen,
attempting to spot at least two or three blue-chip cows that might
help him earn a good score.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bright lights at 11:30, Harrel and Flips Lil Angel
made their 2 1/2-minute run, separating three cows. Though the last
cow was unruly, Harrel's horse held the animal herd like a scrappy
basketball defender and turned in a commendable score of 214 in the
Classic/Challenge open division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comparing cutting to basketball is the best way to illustrate
how it works,'' said Harrel, who authored a book on the sport a
decade ago. ``Since most people have played basketball, they
understand. So I try to get them to visualize themselves and their
horse as a defender who is guarding a player that's a little better
than they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's fast, you'll stay back and counteract his moves, and
you won't crowd him. Over and over, you keep him at a distance
where you always can counteract his moves. It's the same way with a
cow. Your horse controls it without pushing into it too close and
too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a football team watching scouting film of its next
opponent, riders carefully study cattle at a cutting horse show.
</P>
<P>
   During a cattle change Friday, former Futurity and Summer
Spectacular champion Winston Hansma peered over the railing in the
south end zone, looking over the fresh herd of cattle while
clutching a pen and paper.
</P>
<P>
   As the veteran rider observed each animal's movements, he and
several other trainers compared notes. The men made educated
guesses on which cows to single out. As the animals trotted across
the pen, Hansma jotted down descriptions of several that might be
blue-chippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Choosing the right cows is about 75 percent of making an
effective run,'' Hansma said. ``There are a lot of variables in
cutting. Many things have to work in your favor when you, the horse
and cows are involved in decision making. But if you give your best
effort to pick the best cattle before you start, you feel like
that's one variable you've controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   After working three cows, Hansma and Smart Kit Dually turned in
a high score of 221.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carefully picking your cattle is better than rolling the dice
by riding in the herd and working just any cow that becomes easily
accessible,'' Hansma said.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it's a sport that celebrates the Old West ranch chore
of separating a specific cow, driving and keeping it out of the
herd.
</P>
<P>
   If Hansma's run had been compared to basketball, his cutting
horse would have given Michael Jordan's equivalent a tough fight.

WHERE WILL JOHNSON WIND UP?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ Although the baseball world shifts its
attention to this tiny piece of Americana for today's Hall of Fame
induction ceremonies, the infatuation will quickly keep moving.
</P>
<P>
   The real buzz in baseball deals with trades. Friday is the
major-league trading deadline and the biggest question is whether
Seattle left-hander Randy Johnson finally will be traded.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is yes, but there are so many teams interested, where
he is headed remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The division-leading New York Yankees and Cleveland Indians have
told the Mariners not to make a deal until they get a chance to
counter.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres, runaway leaders in the NL West, are
attempting to overtake Atlanta for the league's best record and
pass the 1975 Cincinnati Reds for the best home record in National
League history. They also have funding for a new stadium on the
November ballot and are willing to make one big push.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres have offered pitcher Joey Hamilton and one-time top
Yankees prospect Ruben Rivera, who hasn't had much of an impact
since coming over in last season's Hideki Irabu deal.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson already would be gone, but one of the Mariners' 16
owners has been holding out. Everyone else _ including manager Lou
Piniella and center fielder Ken Griffey _ has been begging the club
to make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Dodgers, who appeared to be a front-runner a month
ago, there is little chance now. Seattle wanted Darren Dreifort,
the Dodgers were offering Ismael Valdes.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have no chance of catching San Diego in the West but
have enough pitching _ even without Johnson _ to make the playoffs
as the wild card. For a team with so much upheaval this year, that
might be enough to convince Fox this season was a success. But
probably not. &QL; 
WHERE'S TOMMY?
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Tom Lasorda is here this weekend, one
year after being inducted by the Veterans Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda, however, went to New York City on Saturday for an
Old-Timers game at Yankee Stadium. The Yankees were celebrating the
20th anniversary of their World Series victory over the Dodgers and
Lasorda managed his former team in the Old-Timers game.
</P>
<P>
   But this weekend is not just a social call. Lasorda will be
trying to make a few deals before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   One reported trade possibility, the moving of injured third
baseman Bobby Bonilla, isn't going to happen. But if Lasorda could
move a 35-year-old who is guaranteed $6 million in each of the next
two seasons after undergoing two major operations and a cancer
scare, he should not only win executive of the year, he could
retire the award. &QL; 
GOOD AND BAD
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Orioles' fast start in the second half probably
will keep them from conducting a much-needed fire sale on their $73
million payroll. They unloaded Joe Carter this past week, but there
won't be much more.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, they came from way back to win the American League wild
card. This year, they were 15{ games behind Boston at the break.
Today, the Orioles are eight games back of the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   No team ever has come from that far back, but some were close.
The 1914 Braves won after trailing by 15 games. The 1978 Yankees
were 14 behind Boston before winning. The 1951 New York Giants and
1995 Seattle Mariners came from 13 down.
</P>
<P>
   Can the Orioles do it? Probably not. But they have a few things
in their favor, including two more series with the Red Sox. They
also have a soft schedule for the next three weeks, not facing
anyone with a winning record until they open a four-game series
Aug. 13 against Cleveland. &QL; 
POPULAR PORTUGAL
</P>
<P>
   It seemed certain Philadelphia's Mark Portugal would be traded,
but that's changed since the Phillies became a wild-card contender.
</P>
<P>
   On the team's just-completed 8-4 road trip, Portugal went 3-0
with an 0.82 ERA in three starts. It was hard to believe for
Phillies fans, who have booed Portugal since he signed a two-year,
$5 million contract in January 1997. Before the trip, Portugal had
just one more victory for the club than visits to the disabled list
(3-2).
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, who pitches today against Florida at home, still has
not won a game at Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see why we would deal Portugal,'' said Phillies ace
Curt Schilling. ``I mean, is Albert Belle coming here, something
like that? There wouldn't be another reason why you would do it.'' &QL; 
BELL TO SECOND?
</P>
<P>
   Although shortstop Jay Bell was signed to be a cornerstone by
expansion Arizona, he is close to moving to second base less than
one season into his monster five-year, $34 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, 32, has 12 errors after committing 10 in each of the last
two seasons. He is fourth in the National League with 90
strikeouts. He has tendinitis in his left knee that has limited his
mobility.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks called up Triple-A shortstop Danny Klassen on
July 4 to play second, but it might only be a matter of time before
the switch is made. Bell, one of baseball's more consistent
shortstops during his years at Pittsburgh, balked last season when
Kansas City attempted to move him to third.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he seems more accepting of a change. Last week, Bell
had a meeting with manager Buck Showalter that touched on a variety
of subjects, including a move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked a little about second base,'' Bell said. ``I'm going
to do what is best for this club. I'm relied upon to do some things
not only on the field but off the field. I want to reflect what it
is like to play the game hard. The one thing I can't allow for me
personally is to become complacent.'' &QL; 
REGGIE LEAVES
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, Reggie Jackson and Yankees owner George Steinbrenner
not getting along.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson resigned this past week as a special assistant to
Steinbrenner. Insiders say Jackson wanted more responsibility in
his attempt to someday become a general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the rift isn't over money, which of course, is part
of it. He originally angered Steinbrenner last month when he ran up
$14,000 on the company credit card. Steinbrenner refused to
reimburse him and withheld Jackson's $100,000 salary.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues were resolved. Others were not. Since he took the
job several years ago, Reggie has done little more than be Reggie.
He represents the team at functions, but also works with youngsters
during spring training and serves as a mentor for some of the
minority players in the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson begged to be part of the decision-making process. Like
Lasorda, Reggie wanted to help build a team and be part of
player-personnel moves. The Yankees weren't ready for that. &QL; 
PROSPECT PROSPECTUS
</P>
<P>
   Although Todd Van Poppel and Esteban Loaiza were the players
fans recognize, the big name in last week's trade between the
Rangers and Pirates was second-base prospect Warren Morris.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates want to move their second baseman, Tony Womack, who
leads the league in stolen bases. Womack, the league leader in
steals (60) during his first full season in 1997, could be eligible
for salary arbitration at the end of the year. The top 17 percent
of players with two-plus years service time are eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, 24, was the Rangers' fifth pick in 1996 from LSU. He is
best known for hitting a ninth-inning, game-winning homer against
Miami in the NCAA championship, and he has continued to excel.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he was batting .331 with 14 homers, 73 RBI and 12
steals in 95 games at Double-A Tulsa at the time of the deal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TOP OF THE ORDER
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Padres' runaway season that could end with the NL's
best record, there is a good chance now that San Diego voters will
reject a proposed $411 million, 42,000-seat downtown stadium in
November. That was considered essential to keep the team from
leaving. The Padres packed their lineup this year hoping to entice
voters, but last week negotiations with the city were described as
``intolerable.'' &QL; 
ROTISSERIE WATCH
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have fallen out of the NL Central race and would
like to trade one of the league's top hitters, Brian Jordan. The
problem: The free agent to be is Mark McGwire's protection in the
lineup. Although McGwire has walked more than 100 times during his
pursuit of Roger Maris' record, there is a good chance he won't
make it without a quality hitter behind him. &QL; 
STAT OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   The baseball adage, offense wins games, defense wins pennants,
might not be more true in Texas. In their first 56 games, the
Rangers committed 28 errors and went 34-22. In the next 44 they
made 46 and were 21-23. Pitching and hitting were basically the
same during both stretches. &QL; 
THE BUZZ
</P>
<P>
   Despite his perfect game and starting assignment in the All-Star
Game, the Yankees' David Wells, 35, says he's done when his
contract expires at the end of next season. Wells, who missed a
start last week because of gout in his foot, is 11-3 with a 3.69
ERA. The Yankees hold an option for 2000 at $4.5 million. Expect
the team to offer an extension. &QL; 
QUOTABLE
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I walked four guys in an inning. He told me,
`That's OK, dad, I walked six in one inning this year.' I pitched
like they do in Little League. Walk five or six, strike out the
side.'' &QL; 
_Philadelphia's Mark Leiter, to his 7-year-old son Mark Jr. last
Sunday, when he picked up a victory after walking four and striking
out three, including Mike Piazza to end the game.

GIANTS WIDE RECEIVER IKE HILLIARD GETS AN ENTHUSIASTIC RECEPTION  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Halfway through the first practice of their 1998
training camp Saturday morning, the Giants gathered for a passing
drill _ the first-team offense against the first-team defense.
</P>
<P>
   On the first play, wide receiver Ike Hilliard made a quick move
near the sideline, luring cornerback Phillippi Sparks forward.
Then, with a burst of speed, Hilliard streaked upfield, leaving
Sparks several strides behind. Quarterback Danny Kanell heaved the
ball 40 yards on a line, over Sparks and into the hands of
Hilliard, who ran untouched into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   As Hilliard turned to run back to the huddle, even from across
the field one could see his smile through his helmet facemask.
Sparks turned and was smiling, too. Kanell was shouting excitedly
in Hilliard's direction. Coach Jim Fassel, far behind the play,
clapped his hands and jogged up to greet Hilliard, offering a slap
on the back of the shoulder pads.
</P>
<P>
   In that instant, a little more than an hour into their season,
the Giants' offense looked whole again. In one play, Hilliard,
participating in a full practice for the first time since he had
neck fusion surgery 10 months ago, showed how his charisma and
considerable pass-catching talents could transform the plodding
offense. With Hilliard, the attack is not only more potent, it is
charged with a certain panache.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great move, bro,'' Sparks said to Hilliard as the two made
their way back to their respective huddles.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Percy Ellsworth flashed back to practices nearly a year
ago. ``I was thinking, `I remember this guy,''' Ellsworth said.
``His presence alone changes the look of everything. I felt good
for him and I felt good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilliard, the Giants' top pick in 1997, is back, 312 days after
he had posterior spine stabilization surgery to fuse his sixth and
seventh vertebrae. Hilliard had injured his neck on Sept. 7, making
the second catch of his Giant career, when he was hit from behind
by Jacksonville safety Chris Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, with the Giants in full pads, Hilliard bounced off
teammates in drills and made a couple of diving catches. He has not
had any serious, or even routine, football collisions since the
team has yet to have a live, full contact scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   How he will react to that first hit is in the back of his mind,
and it is also a constant source of reporters' questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of me wants to get it over with,'' Hilliard said. ``I'm
not worried about it at all, but I guess everybody wants to see me
take that lick and get up and run back to the huddle.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting Hilliard through that initiation has the Giants
defenders in a bit of a quandary. No one wants to deliver a blow
that could cause injury, and yet Hilliard needs to get used to
contact again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just have to treat him like any other receiver,'' safety
Sam Garnes said. ``He's not taking it easy on us or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellsworth said: ``He got Phillippi for one today. I say he's
just another offensive player you have to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilliard said Saturday that he had never watched the tape of the
reception and hit by Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember it and I don't care to watch it,'' he said.
``That play is behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not far from the minds of many Giants. With Hilliard, the
offense figured to be more daring.
</P>
<P>
   Hilliard was the stylish counterpart to the other starting wide
receiver, the steady Chris Calloway. But with Hilliard gone, the
Giants offense was more plain, more predictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the things that happened to us last year,'' the All-Pro
defensive end Michael Strahan said Saturday, ``Ike going down hurt
us the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilliard said his doctors told him to expect a loss of some
mobility as he tried to move his head down or side to side, but he
has yet to experience any change.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just as quick,'' Garnes said. ``Just as elusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellsworth added, ``And as shifty.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are compliments from defensive backs.
</P>
<P>
   Hilliard assessed his status in different terms. ``I am back
together,'' he said. ``In one piece.''

 HOUSE gop WHIP HAS HIGH PRAISE FOR GUARD FROM MASSACHUSETTS 
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Representative J. Joseph Moakley recommended John Gibson for a
job on the Capitol Police force 18 years ago and never regretted
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just such a natural,'' said Moakley (D-Mass.) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Special Agent Gibson, a native of Waltham, Mass., died a hero
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the security detail of House Republican Whip Tom
DeLay of Texas, Gibson went down protecting DeLay and his staff
after an exchange of gunfire with an assailant who stormed the
Capitol armed with a Smith &AMP; Wesson .38 caliber revolver.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Gibson hadn't stopped him, we all might have died,'' said
John Feehery, a spokesman for DeLay, still shaken by the shooting
nearly 24 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   As he had on Friday, DeLay broke down in tears Saturday when he
spoke to the media about Gibson, whom he described as ``simply the
finest man I have ever known. He died so that my staff, I and the
public could live.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Globe, DeLay, No. 3 in the House GOP
leadership, recalled Gibson as a man who went beyond the call of
duty to care for both DeLay and his family.
</P>
<P>
   When DeLay's daughter went across the border into Mexico to
party with friends during the Republican National Convention in San
Diego two years ago, Gibson went after her and brought her back.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when DeLay and his wife invited him to their daughter's
recent wedding in Texas at their expense, Gibson declined out of
concern it would appear unprofessional.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a special guy,'' said DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson left his home in Massachusetts for the capital as a young
man to realize his dream of becoming a police officer said Moakley,
who is an uncle of Gibson's wife, Evelyn.
</P>
<P>
   He applied to the US Capitol Police and Moakley gave him a
reference. He got the job and never lost either his Massachusetts
accent or his enthusiasm for being a policeman.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, a native of Houston, teased Gibson relentlessly about his
accent and his loyalty to the Red Sox. ``He was a typical
Bostonian: He talks funny, he's in your face and he's a Democrat,''
said DeLay, who spoke with affectionate emotion about a man ``who
would stick to me like glue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved the Red Sox and he loved them like most Bostonians.
He loved to hate them,'' said DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay said Gibson had tried to explain the intricacies of hockey
to him at a recent game in Washington but DeLay admitted he could
never quite figure out the appeal of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Last week DeLay said he hit the button on the CD player in his
car and ``Macho Man,'' Gibson's favorite song, blared forth. ``He
was the ultimate macho man,'' said DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a nice kid. He worked himself up to a special agent on
the force. He loved it,'' said Moakley, whose brother, Robert, was
Gibson's father-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   The Gibsons settled in the suburbs of northern Virginia and had
three children; Kristen, 17, John, 14, and Daniel, 12.
</P>
<P>
   A National Park Service helicopter picked up Gibson's wife and
two sons at Woodbridge High after the shooting and carried them to
his side at the Washington hospital where he was pronounced dead
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen was in Boston with relatives about to begin a vacation.
Her grandfather took her to Moakley's house in South Boston Friday
night. Saturday morning she returned to her mother and brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Moakley said President Clinton telephoned Friday night to offer
condolences and spoke to Kristen telling her how much the country
owed her father. The teenager wept as she listened to the
president's words.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and friends remembered him as a good humored and
friendly man. Until a few months ago, Kevin Murphy lived next to
Gibson in Woodbridge, Va., on a dead-end street of modest suburban
townhouses where children play baseball in the street and neighbors
gather on the front steps even though they all have decks in the
back. ``John was a great family man,'' Murphy said. ``He didn't go
out anywhere without his family, not even to the store.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal Robinson, who lives across the street, helped Gibson with
his lawn, which, despite his best efforts, Gibson failed miserably
to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Moakley received a message that Gibson wanted to
see him. He was delighted to find that Gibson only wanted to
discuss tickets to a Boston College football game scheduled for
November.
</P>
<P>
   Moakley's hideaway office at the Capitol is just yards away from
DeLay's suite. Moakley had walked by DeLay's door on his way to the
airport just minutes before the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know John,'' said DeLay, ``And I know he is in heaven.''

SLAIN OFFICER WAS PREPARING TO RETIRE
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jacob Chestnut, known as J.J., was closing in on the end of his
second career as a Capitol Police officer when killed by a shot to
the head at the Capitol Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Once nominated to be Capitol Police officer of the year,
Chestnut, a tall 58-year-old former airman, cut a distinctive
figure at his sentry post by the East Front entrance of the Capitol
building, which is heavily used by tourists and student groups. He
was just months away from retirement.
</P>
<P>
   He served in Vietnam as a military police officer, retired from
the Air Force in 1980, and began his second career as a police
officer at the Capitol. He is survived by his second wife Wen and
their two children, three children from a previous marriage, and
five grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Tom DeLay of Texas, the House Republican whip, Saturdaydescribed
Chestnut in these terms Saturday: ``He's a patriot. He loved this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   After retiring from the Air Force, Chestnut couldn't wait to
become a police officer, DeLay said. ``He came here and requested
and fought for that spot,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really enjoyed his job protecting the Capitol, and he
exhibited the best qualities of professionalism,'' DeLay said. ``He
was one of the nicest, friendliest police officers on the force,
because every night when I left, he would give me a hearty
goodnight and wish me well.''
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut also was known as a good and friendly neighbor who
tooted his car horn on returning to his street in suburban
Maryland, an avid gardener with prize-quality tomatoes, and a
steady presence on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves his police work. Police and the garden, that's his
life,'' said Betty Wenying Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut was a native of Myrtle Beach, S.C., but lived for years
in a brick-and-siding split-level home at the end of a tree-lined
street in suburban Fort Washington, Md., 10 miles south of the
Capitol along the Potomac River.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said that he and his wife Wen often biked around their
neighborhood and each year went door to door collecting money for
the Tantallion Square Civic Association, a group that provides
scholarships to local students and sends flowers to neighbors when
there is a family death. ``We are shocked,'' said Johnson who lives
just blocks away from Chestnut. ``He was such a wonderful man.''
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut and his wife, known as Wendy, met in 1974, while he was
stationed in Taiwan with the Air Force. They were married there.
</P>
<P>
   A poignant scene played out on the family's front lawn Friday
evening. His wife, summoned from her job as a computer department
supervisor at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington, was taken to
George Washington University Hospital, where her husband died. She
then returned home, escorted by two of her husband's fellow
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Her son emerged from the house. They hugged, and then retreated
into the home. ``She's not doing very good. She's so shocked. We
all are,'' said Johnson. ``He was such a wonderful man. We are all
very shocked.''

MOURNERS EXPRESS GRIEF AT THE CAPITOL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One note wrapped around a handful of carnations and
daisies placed on the Capitol steps simply read, ``Thank you,
heroes, for our freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In memory of Officer Chestnut, Officer Gibson, American
heroes,'' said another card tied to three red roses wilting in the
midday heat.
</P>
<P>
   The flowers arrived in vases, glass jars, baskets, bouquets
filled with American flags, and notes. A large arrangement of white
roses, gladiolus, and lillies were delivered by an elderly man.
``It's just sad, that's all,'' he said as he walked quickly away.
</P>
<P>
   The US Capitol is still open, the tour buses outside Union
Station are packed with visitors, and the lines to get into the
Capitol snaked along as slowly as usual the day after a lone gunman
burst into the building, killing two police officers and wounding a
tourist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty normal for a Saturday, and that's what Congress
wanted,'' said one Capitol Police officer. ``They didn't want to
shut down.''
</P>
<P>
   Normal, except for the American flag flying at half-staff, the
influx of US Capitol Police on patrol, and of course, the line of
lavender, ruby red, yellow blaze of flowers on the lower steps
leading up to the Capitol that, by midday Saturday, had become a
makeshift memorial.
</P>
<P>
   The shots that rang out at about 3:40 p.m. Friday from the
building that symbolizes freedom and open government to people
around the world seemed to weigh on the minds of visitors Saturday,
as they offered officers their condolence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is tragic for the whole nation,'' said Sue Bowden,
visiting the Capitol with her family from Tyngsborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The event certainly puts an exclamation point on our visit,
like a marker in time,'' said her husband, Russ.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, people all seemed to remember what they were doing when
they heard the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the airport,'' recalled Debbie Thompson of Orlando,
Fla. ``We were kind of leery about it. But now I don't feel worried
or scared at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so for Cynthia Della Coletta of Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to skip it,'' said Della Coletta as she
boarded a tourist trolley at Union Station a few blocks from the
Capitol. ``We thought it might be best to stay away. It makes you
wonder where you can be safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Capitol Police wore a black cloth strip across their badges in
honor of their slain colleagues, Officers Jacob Chestnut, 58, and
John Gibson, 42, both 18-year veterans of the force.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeant Dan Nichols, a spokesman for the Capitol Police, said
the force had received hundreds of calls from across the nation
from individuals wanting to express their concern and support for
the officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been buoyed by the outpouring of sympathy from the
American public, and if anything is going to get us through, it is
that,'' Nichols said at a news briefing Saturday. A security review
of the Capitol building and grounds is planned.
</P>
<P>
   The mood among visitors was mixed. Many of the tourists took the
opportunity to reflect on the state of the nation, and noted, with
more than a touch of cynicism, that the shooting was a natural
consequence of a cycle of gun violence and moral decay plaguing the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make you feel very secure, but that's part of our
nation today,'' said E.W. Campbell of Pittsburgh. ``It's indicative
of our leadership, all the scandal and gossiping. It is such a poor
example to those inside and outside the country. We shouldn't
tolerate this.''
</P>
<P>
   Others faulted the justice system. ``We have crazies everywhere,
and we allow them to do what they want to do instead of
incarcerating them and giving them treatment as mentally ill,''
said Joe Aviles, of Manhasset, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists, who typically roam freely through the halls of the
Capitol, Saturday were forced to walk in line up a long flight of
marble steps to the House and Senate chambers on the second floor
of the Capitol, avoiding the closed-off first-floor entrances
normally used to enter the building, including the one used by the
gunman.
</P>
<P>
   People passed the area not far from the shootings, near the
office of House majority leader Tom DeLay of Texas, but most of the
area was sealed off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everytime anyone passes DeLay's office, whether they see a
chink in the marble or a flower laid on the floor, they will think
about what happened,'' said Matt Thornblad, a summer Senate intern
from Des Moines.

SUSPECT'S FATHER THREW HIM OFF PROPERTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VALMEYER, Ill. _ Russell E. Weston Jr., wracked by years of
paranoid delusions, began his twisted journey from this farm town
to the US Capitol after the last person he trusted, his father,
turned against him, family friends said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The day before Weston was critically wounded during his attack
that killed two police officers, the unemployed drifter angrily
drove away from the corn fields that surround his family's
farmhouse after shouting at his father, ``I'll show you,'' said a
friend of the Weston family.
</P>
<P>
   The friend said Russell E. Weston Sr. recounted the incident
Saturday, as the Weston family and their neighbors in this village
that hugs a bend in the Mississippi River endured the anguished
aftermath of the tragedy. The friend refused to identify himself,
saying he did not want to become involved in the investigation of
the double homicide.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators scoured Weston's summer shack in Montana for
evidence and waited to see if he would regain consciousness in a
Washington hospital, several residents of Valmeyer, where Weston
was born and raised, said the episode only showed everyone the
depth of his mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   Weston, 41, who was rarely seen in Valmeyer in the last 15
years, left here on Thursday after his father ordered him off the
property for shooting about a dozen cats with the family shotgun.
He apparently drove through the night to Washington, nearly 850
miles away, where he allegedly launched his assault in the Capitol
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess craziness knows no boundaries,'' said Rich Siedel, an
off-duty freight driver watching television news accounts of the
fatal shooting as he sipped a beer at the Fountain Inn tavern in
Valmeyer, about 25 miles south of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Weston, who was listed in critical condition at Washington's
D.C. General Hospital, had a long history of psychological torment,
including an apparent obsession with President Clinton that
prompted a judge to commit him to a mental health facility in
Montana in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But many residents of Valmeyer (population: 900) said they knew
little about Weston's recent woes. Indeed, many felt so besieged by
journalists seeking clues to Weston's past that Dennis M.
Knoblauch, the village administrator, tacked a statement to a
bulletin board in the Fountain Inn.
</P>
<P>
   ``One individual, through mindless, deranged actions, can make
their mark on the pages of history and change the lives of many
individuals forever,'' Knoblauch said. ``Residents of the village
of Valmeyer shared a zip code with Russell E. Weston Jr., but not
much else.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch described Weston as ``very quiet and reserved'' when
he attended Valmeyer's elementary and secondary schools. ``But
after his graduation,'' he said, ``most who knew him lost contact
with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch added: ``We join all the people of the world in
expressing our sympathy to the families of those involved in this
incident.''
</P>
<P>
   The Weston family's phone line was dead Saturday, and police
blocked off the only roads leading to their home to keep
journalists away.
</P>
<P>
   In Rimini, Mont., where Weston spent his summers in a remote
shack in the Red Mountains southwest of Helena, cobwebs filled his
mailbox and two padlocks hung on the door of the cabin, which sits
only about 40 miles from the the tiny shack Unabomber Theodore
Kaczynski lived in.
</P>
<P>
   Weston, who hated and feared the federal government, but lived
on its disability payments, had made threats over the years,
although no one in the area recalled that he ever did anything
violent. ``He always stopped just short of being arrested for
intimidation,'' said Jefferson County Undersheriff Tim Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Weston made veiled threats against several county officials
after they declined to press charges against his 86-year-old
landlady, Campbell told the Helena Independent Record. Weston said
she hit him with her cane while trying to evict him from a cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Weston filed a lawsuit against the woman; the lawsuit was
dismissed. He fought the dismissal to the Montana Supreme Court and
wrote letters to newspapers complaining about the county officials.
</P>
<P>
   Weston's only criminal history in Lewis and Clark County was an
arrest on Aug. 7, 1991, charging him with sale of dangerous drugs,
Sheriff Chuck O'Reilly said in Helena. County Attorney Mike McGrath
said no formal charge was filed.
</P>
<P>
   A judge committed Weston to the state mental hospital at Warm
Springs in late 1996 for an undisclosed incident, the governor's
office said. He was discharged after the hospital consulted with
his family.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital employee, Jerry Swihart of Anaconda, said he worked
in the hospital warehouse with Weston, who volunteered that he had
been hospitalized for ``writing threatening letters to President
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He would rant and rave about how he was a personal friend of
Clinton and his family and then Clinton turned on him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd say things like, `I've got the dirt on him, but if I tell
you, Clinton will get me,''' Swihart said.

WESTON REMAINS IN COMA IN WASHINGTON HOSPITAL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Suspected Capitol gunman Russell E. Weston Jr.
remained comatose in an area hospital Saturday with what his doctor
said was a 50-50 chance of survival, as investigators tried to
determine a motive, and the families of the slain police officers
searched for solace in the heroism of two dead men.
</P>
<P>
   Anger and sorrow seemed to wash across official Washington in
waves Saturday, tempered by a sense of resilience. A day after
Friday's attack inside the Capitol building, House Speaker Newt
Gingrich shed tears on national television. President Clinton
described the shooting as ``a moment of savagery at the front door
of American civilization.'' And all the while, the Capitol, bathed
in sunshine, reopened to a long line of summer tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities charged Weston, 41, Saturday with the murder of a
federal officer, a crime that can carry the death penalty. He was
listed in critical condition after undergoing a second round of
surgery for gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they have yet to determine why Weston, a
drifter with a history of mental illness who split his time between
a family home in rural Illinois and a cabin in Montana, came to
Washington and shot his way into the halls of Congress, killing
plainclothes Capitol Police agent John Gibson, 42, a Waltham
native, and Officer Jacob Chestnut, 58, in the minutes-long
rampage. Detectives were searching Weston's different homes in an
attempt to find clues.
</P>
<P>
   Weston's name was entered into a Secret Service database more
than two years ago because of threatening remarks he made about the
president, according to a federal law enforcement official. He was
committed to a state mental health facility in Montana for 53 days
in the autumn of 1996, according to a spokesman for Montana
Governor Marc Racicot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a difficult time,'' said Sergeant Dan Nichols, the
spokesman for the Capitol Police. ``The officers are going to rely
on each other to a great extent. But they're buoyed by the output
of sympathy from the American public. If anything can get us over
it, it will be that.''
</P>
<P>
   Just outside the public glare, Evelyn Gibson and her three
childen secluded themselves in their neat, pale green townhouse in
the Lake Ridge section of Woodbridge, Va., a suburb about 25 miles
south of Washington, to mourn the death of their husband and
father. As police stood guard outside, relatives and friends came
to pay respects.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just wonderful,'' said Hal Robinson, who lived across
street. ``He was honest. It's hard to find nowadays. There was just
nothing phony about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, the personal bodyguard to House majority whip Tom DeLay
of Texas, has been hailed on Capitol Hill as an American hero _ the
officer who shot and incapacitated Weston when the gunman burst
into DeLay's suite of offices near the Capitol entrance Friday
afternoon and began firing at anyone around him.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Saturday that the gunman had chased a woman into
DeLay's office when he encountered Gibson. Gibson, according to the
police account, shoved the woman to safety and became involved in
the fierce, seconds-long gunfight with Weston in DeLay's outer
office. When police arrived, the two men lay bleeding just a few
feet apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Special Agent Gibson sacrificed his life in the
protection of a woman who was being chased by a gunman at that time
prevented her death and quite possibly the deaths of other people
in the building,'' Nichols said.
</P>
<P>
   In Lake Ridge, Kevin Murphy, Gibson's friend and former
next-door neighbor, said Gibson was a jovial companion who rarely
ventured to the store without the company of his wife, 17-year-old
daughter, and two sons, aged 14 and 12.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his kitchen, Murphy asked his young son, Ryan, what
Gibson used to say to him each evening when he arrived home from
work. Ryan, speaking in a deep voice meant to imitate Gibson,
replied, ```Hey you!' That's what he'd say.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Murphy: ``He used to say to me all the time, `What do you
say, Murph.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the D.C. General Hospital, Weston remained unconscious in the
surgical intensive-care unit, under heavy police guard, officials
said. Doctors said he had breathing tubes in his throat, was under
sedation, and would probably not have the ability to speak for at
least several days. Police have yet to interview Weston, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Weston was struck by gunfire in his chest, right arm, left
thigh, and right buttock, according to Dr. Paul Oriaifo. When he
arrived at the hospital Friday, he was combative and bleeding
profusely, Oriaifo said, and was whisked into the operating room
within 20 minutes. When his blood pressure dropped overnight, he
was rushed again to the operating room and revived.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Weston's prospects for survival, Oriaifo replied,
``He is critically ill. I would say about a 50-50 chance.''
</P>
<P>
   As Friday's chaos gave way to Saturday's sorrow and anger, a
clearer account of the rampage emerged. According to Nichols, other
witness accounts and an affidavit filed by authorities Saturday in
US District Court here, Weston arrived at the metal detector at one
of the Capitol entrances on the east side of the building.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than walk through the detector, Weston tried to walk
around it and was stopped by Chestnut, an 18-year veteran of the
Capitol Police. Weston allegedly pulled out a handgun and shot at
Chestnut without warning, killing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weston took out a handgun he had in his possession, pointed it
at Officer Chestnut's head, and then fired it,'' the affidavit
said.
</P>
<P>
   A tourist, Angela Dickerson, 24, was also shot near the metal
detector, authorities said. She was released Saturday from George
Washington Hospital, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Weston exchanged gunfire with another Capitol Police officer,
then began chasing an unidentified female down the hallway and into
DeLay's office suite, according to accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In that suite, Gibson, hearing the sound of gunshots echo down
the hallway, told workers to take cover. The door burst open, the
woman came in, and Weston followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reacting to the sound of gunfire, Special Agent Gibson ordered
the staff in the area to get down, pushed the female out of harm's
way and exchanged gunfire with Weston,'' Nichols said. ``Both
Special Agent Gibson and Weston were wounded in this exchange, both
falling to the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Nichols refused to say whether the slain officers were wearing
bulletproof vests. Weston was found with additional ammunition in
his pocket, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Saturday, DeLay said he planned to
request a special dispensation to bury Gibson and Chestnut at
Arlington National Cemetery, if the families wish.
</P>
<P>
   A vehement opponent of gun restrictions, DeLay said the rampage
did not change his stand. ``Washington is the most gun-controlled
city in America,'' he said. ``If somebody wants something you can
buy, they can get it. It is the person who pulls the trigger, not
the gun.''
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, police officers wore black bands across their
badges in memory of their slain colleagues. The flags near the
gleaming dome were lowered to half-staff, where they fluttered in a
gentle summer's breeze. Officials closed off the entrance that was
the site of the shooting. Still, the building was alive with
tourists, some of whom left bouquets of flowers on the Capitol
steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``All around the world, that majestic marble building is the
symbol of our democracy and the embodiment of our nation,'' Clinton
said. ``We must keep it a place where people can freely and proudly
walk the halls of their government.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Gingrich, in a radio and television address, as a tear ran
down his cheek: ``Please help this country learn to live with its
freedom. Please help those who are troubled learn to live
peacefully with their problems.''

REPUBLICAN WHIP DETAILS SHOOTOUT IN OFFICES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the Republican whip, was
talking business on Friday with two staff members in his Capitol
Hill office when he heard the shots.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay hurried out but did not get far before an employee shoved
him back inside. In a rush of adrenaline, DeLay, his three staff
members and a French tourist dashed for the only safe place they
saw: the bathroom, whose door they locked and where they waited it
out.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 yards away, two men lay critically wounded. One was the
man assigned to keep DeLay safe, Det. John Gibson of the Capitol
Hill Police. The other was Russell Eugene Weston Jr., who on
Saturday was charged with the murder of Gibson and Jacob Chestnut,
another member of the Capitol Hill Police force.
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional news conference on Saturday, DeLay recounted for
the first time the harrowing events surrounding that gun duel in
his mazelike suite of offices on the first floor of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``He died so my staff and the public and I could live,'' DeLay,
his voice hoarse and strained, said of Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman, DeLay said, wound up in his office by accident.
Panicked after unloading his first volley of gunfire, the man
appeared to have walked through the first door he saw, one marked
private, just behind the French tourist. It is the same door DeLay
uses on his walks back from the House floor countless times a day,
and, until now, it was never locked.
</P>
<P>
   Just past the doorway, Scott D. Hatch, DeLay's floor assistant,
sat staring into his computer when he was jolted by the sound of
gunshots. He looked square into Gibson's eyes, and without pausing,
scrambled out of his seat.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch rushed to the back office, ordering staff members to
follow him along the way, shouting at them to lie flat on the
floor. He was just in time; the gunman was already inside. ``Scott
Hatch is a real hero,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson shouted at Joe Connolly, a 22-year-old systems' analyst,
ordering him to duck for cover under his desk. Then he fired his
weapon. Shots rang out, followed by a loud clunk on the desk. The
gunman's weapon had hurtled from his hand and landed on top of
Connolly's desk. The gunman lay wounded and bloody just inches
away.
</P>
<P>
   After it was over, DeLay gathered his staff and said a prayer
for Gibson, but the police ordered him out. Some of his staff were
convinced that they heard more gunfire and that the officers could
not be sure the gunman had acted alone. They advised DeLay to
leave.

   East
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, in the middle of a wild-card race, likely would
play Cleveland in the playoffs, and that's not a bad thing for
manager Jimy Williams. Boston pitcher Pedro Martinez is 2-0 with a
1.44 ERA against the Indians. ``It does give me some confidence,
but so much can happen in a short series,'' Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Toronto's Dave Steib, back in the league after a
five-year absence, turned 41 Tuesday, making him the seventh-oldest
player in the game. The oldest is Dennis Eckersley, 43 _ four
months older than Atlanta pitcher Dennis Martinez. ... Boston's Mo
Vaughn was booed Friday night at Fenway Park. It was the fans
response to a story that quoted the first baseman as saying his
first choice next season was to play for Toronto. ... The Yankees
could finish with 100 victories by going 28-36 the rest of the
season. ... Look for the Blue Jays to trade right-hander Juan
Guzman, whose early-season struggles may be behind him. ... Yankees
pitchers certainly controlled Detroit's Brian Hunter in a recent
four-game series; the speedy outfielder was 0-for-22.Central
</P>
<P>
   If the White Sox trade Robin Ventura, they likely would replace
him at third with Greg Norton, who has been the club's first
baseman this season. Norton is a natural third baseman and was
switched to first in the spring when they decided to move Frank
Thomas to designated hitter. However, Norton had 38 errors playing
third last year at Class AAA Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Royals closer Jeff Montgomery said he wants to finish his
career with Kansas City, and he has veto power over any deal. The
only way he will move to another club is if it is a contender and
that team is willing to extend his contract. ... After Indians
reliever Mike Jackson struck out Mo Vaughn with two out and the
bases loaded in the ninth inning Wednesday night to preserve a 4-3
victory over the Red Sox, Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove was asked
about the pitch. ``I didn't watch it,'' he said. ``So you'll have
to write about it on your own.'' ... Now that the Reds' Pete
Harnisch has signed an extension, the hottest pitcher on the market
may be Kansas City's Tim Belcher. Teams lining up to make offers
include the Giants, Astros, Red Sox, Rangers and Angels. ... Twins
closer Rick Aguilera has a no-trade clause in his contract, but has
said he would be willing to go to the Padres. He lives in San Diego
in the offseason.

<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. is a big golf fan, and two of his closest
friends and Florida neighbors (he lives in Isleworth, Fla.) are
Tiger Woods and Mark O'Meara. O'Meara has won the Masters and
British Open this year, and Lee Janzen, another Isleworth resident,
won the U.S. Open. ``You can't stop us,'' Griffey said. ``Another
Isleworth guy wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: With 1,846 walks, Oakland's Rickey Henderson has passed
Carl Yastrzemski for fourth on the all-time list. ... A great
strikeout race is going between Seattle's Randy Johnson and
Philadelphia's Curt Schilling. Going into the weekend, Johnson had
201, Schilling 198. ... The Angels are beginning to bat Jim Edmonds
leadoff; in his season debut there Wednesday he went 2-for-5. ...
The Rangers' Juan Gonzalez has 25 RBIs vs. the Royals this year and
has three more games against them. . . . Disney lost $27 million in
its first two years of owning the Angels, but apparently will be
able to cover the losses this year because of an increase in
attendance. ... Despite getting Esteban Loaiza from the Pirates,
the Rangers are hunting for more pitching, looking at Arizona's
Willie Blair, Montreal's Carlos Perez and Belcher.

 &HT;    ON THE BUBBLE
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WLB Cornelius Bennett
</P>
<P>
   Bennett has shown good speed running down plays all over the
field. Still, he will be 33 when the season starts, and he and
middle linebacker Jessie Tuggle will have the highest salary cap
figures ($3.45 million) on the team. Third-year man Craig Sauer and
first-round draft pick Keith Brooking are working behind Bennett,
but so far have a ways to go to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   C Robbie Tobeck
</P>
<P>
   There have been just a couple missed exchanges from Tobeck, who
moved from left guard before camp began. There hasn't been enough
contact to determine much in the interior line yet, but the Falcons
are working second-round draft pick Bob Hallen at No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   S Devin Bush
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who started last year at free safety, has been working
mostly as the backup strong safety behind returning starter William
White. Bush has made the transition fairly smoothly, but
occasionally upsets coaches with a mental mistake.
</P>
<P>
   WR/PR Todd Kinchen
</P>
<P>
   Kinchen hasn't had a great week, dropping some passes that
should have been caught, and fumbling a few punts. He and rookie
Tim Dwight are expected to compete for the punt returner's job, and
if Dwight wins that battle, Kinchen could be in trouble unless he
proves he can be the third or perhaps fourth receiver. Right now,
he ranks no higher than fifth.
</P>
<P>
   DT Nathan Davis
</P>
<P>
   Davis threw in the towel Friday, quitting pro football one day
after reporting at 313 pounds _ 18 more than coaches wanted. In his
only practice, last year's second-round choice played horribly, and
was reported to have a ``stomach illness.'' He later confessed to
taking a bunch of diuretics the night before in an attempt to lose
weight.

 &HT;    Workout concludes with full contact
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- It was a fitting close to matters Saturday afternoon
when the Atlanta Falcons went ``live'' for the first time in
training camp, finishing the fifth practice in three days with
goal-line work where everything was full go, tackling included.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the first off-day of camp was right around the corner,
players' and coaches' enthusiasm picked up, and in 11 plays there
was a wide variety of results.
</P>
<P>
   When the first-string offense went against the first-string
defense, there were three scores in four tries from inside the
5-yard line. Running back Jamal Anderson scoring twice up the
middle and fullback Bob Christian also scored. All the while, there
was considerable whooping and hollering everywhere as about 200
fans watched in Suwanee.
</P>
<P>
   The backup defenses stopped the offense the next seven times,
though.
</P>
<P>
   It was a nice change after a morning practice that was short _
about an hour and 50 minutes, and very sloppy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys really responded,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``It's
kind of what coach (Tom) Landry used to do (when Reeves played and
coached under him in Dallas from 1965-'80. After three days, you
kind of get ready to where that's the first time you want to really
hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the guys I don't know if we took a step forward this
morning; guys are starting to get tired. We had a lot of missed
assignments, missed snaps, things that frustrate you.''
</P>
<P>
   What's next?
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons will be off today, other than evening meetings, and
will practice twice Monday and Tuesday, and once Wednesday. Morning
practices will be at 9 and afternoon practices probably at 3 or
3:30.
</P>
<P>
   Turning up the heat
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons moved Saturday afternoon's practice from 3 to 3:30
in an attempt to dodge some of the worst heat and humidity of the
day after 17 players had to take intravenous fluids after Friday
afternoon's practice. It was 90 degrees with 55 percent humidity.
</P>
<P>
   QB watch
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at what's going on with the quarterbacks:
</P>
<P>
   Chris Chandler: Worked with the first team in all unit drills,
and took his share of turns working in drills that focused on the
running game while other QBs threw passing drills.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Graziani: Same as Chandler, but with the No. 2 unit. He
fumbled two snaps in morning sessions, as he struggled with the
exchanges from rookie center Bob Hallen.
</P>
<P>
   Steve DeBerg: Worked with No. 3 unit all day.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Brennan: Mostly used in off drills, but did take a few
snaps with the No. 1 unit on running plays. Switched from No. 14 on
his jersey to 11, which was to have been Mark Rypien's number.
</P>
<P>
   The good, bad, and ugly
</P>
<P>
   Good: Tight end Ed Smith made a nice over-the-shoulder catch
down the middle on a pass from Graziani to score a 20-yard TD in
9-on-9 drills.
</P>
<P>
   Bad: As the team worked on its punt protection, backup snapper
Dave Widell skipped one to backup punter David Akers.
</P>
<P>
   Ugly: The sound of defensive line coach Bill Kollar's voice.
Kollar, the most vocal of all coaches, has gone hoarse after
two-plus days of his patented screaming.
</P>
<P>
   What he said
</P>
<P>
   ``Gimme a chance, just one well-thrown deep ball.'' _ Receiver
Todd Kinchen, who ran a streak route down the right sideline in
passing drills only to have a 50-yard pass from Chandler sail out
of bounds and out of reach as cornerback Ray Buchanan was on his
left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know?
</P>
<P>
   Curfew for players is 11 p.m. every night, as coaches take turns
going room to room to make sure they're in their rooms at the
Falcon Inn motel. Incoming calls to the hotel switchboard are not
switched to players' rooms after that hour, either. Players can,
however, call out.
</P>
<P>
   Vehicle of the week
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's got anything on the big, black Hummer owned by safety
Devin Bush, who decided to buy the vehicle, ``after I saw them in
the movies, 'The Fan,' and 'Escape from Alcatraz.' '' The tank-like
monstrosity is nice and shiny, has a big-time stereo, gray interior
and ...purple seat covers. What's up with that? ``The dealer gave
'em to me,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Weighty matters
</P>
<P>
   Four players were fined for missing their prescribed weight and
weigh-ins Thursday morning. Right guard Gene Williams, who did not
have the benefit of attending workouts in June or mini-camp earlier
this month as he tended to important family matters, missed by the
most. He weighed 337 pounds. Team officials wanted him at 315.
Under terms of the collective bargaining agreement, teams can fine
players $95 per pound. In Williams' case, that's $2,090.... Worth
noting: Rams running back and former Falcon Craig Heyward, who did
not show up for weigh-ins in St. Louis Friday, was not re-signed in
Atlanta last year in part because he wanted a contract with no
weight stipulations and the Falcons refused.
</P>
<P>
   You decide
</P>
<P>
   Falcons team photographer Perry McIntyre says the Falcons
original home from 1966-'91 was ``Atlanta Stadium.'' Team
play-by-play man Jeff Hullinger strongly disagrees, saying it was
``Fulton County Stadium'' before the name was eventually changed to
Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. Readers, argue among yourself.
Answer coming Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunity
</P>
<P>
   Through the NFL's minority coaching program, University of
Cincinnati assistant Joker Phillips worked Friday with defensive
backs coach Ron Meeks, and Cornell assistant Ron Prince worked with
offensive line coach Art Shell.

 &HT;    Santiago looking for strong return
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- O.J. Santiago learned the hard way he's not
invincible, and the Atlanta Falcons tight end now looks at things a
little differently than last year. And not just for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Despite breaking the fibula in his left leg in the 11th game of
the season, the 6-foot-7, 267-pound tight end is convinced he will
be a better player this year than last, when he was the team's only
rookie starter. He also believes the team will be better that last
year's 7-9 edition.
</P>
<P>
   Much better, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to a team last year that was coming off a 3-13 season
and our goals were much different,'' Santiago said. ``We just
wanted to break even. We're looking so far past that this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's expected to make the playoffs. Anybody can tell on both
offense and defense, we look so much better than last year,'' he
added. ``It's like night and day. We finished 6-2 (in the second
half of the season) and we want to build on that. Nobody on this
team will be satisfied with less than 10 wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Santiago had 17 catches for 217 yards and two touchdowns last
season, but it ended at St. Louis on Nov. 20 when the small bone in
his leg was cleanly broken, four inches above the ankle.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first serious injury in the athletic career of the
former Kent University standout whose first experience in football
was as a high school junior in Whitby, Ontario. He wore a cast four
weeks, and returned to Suwanee Jan. 5 to begin rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first month, I had a lot of time to think. There was a
lot of just sitting around in my apartment,'' said the former
third-round pick. ``The thing that bothered me most was I really
had the goal of coming in here as a rookie and starting all 16
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Santiago has no special limitations right now. He tapes the
ankle just like before. But on some days when he walks onto the
practice field and it feels sensitive, he'll also tape over his
shoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leg feels 100 percent,'' he said. ``It still gets sore, I
have to ice it, and I'm not sure the calf muscle is back all the
way, but everything is OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Santiago also wears high top cleats, adding to his appearance of
a basketball player in pads _ in keeping with a trend of young,
tall tight ends like the Cowboys' David LaFleur, the Chiefs' Tony
Gonzalez and the Bears' John Allred.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, Eric Turner of the Raiders said of Santiago,
``If you let him get an easy release (from the line of scrimmage),
it's going to be a problem because he's just a huge target running
unchecked through the secondary. Sort of like a runaway giraffe.''
</P>
<P>
   As quarterback Chris Chandler grows more comfortable with his
tight end, and Santiago is more comfortable in the offense, the
Falcons might get a runaway year from their giraffe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked hard to try and not have any mental hangups,'' he
said. ``I don't want any excuses, or crutches. I just want to
perform and win.''

 &HT;    Falcons sign Gaines, but questions continue at DT
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The Atlanta Falcons Saturday signed four-year NFL
veteran defensive tackle William Gaines to a one-year, $300,000
contract one day after former second-round draft choice Nathan
Davis quit. The move does not, however, answer the biggest question
in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   How are the Falcons going to get by with such thin ranks in the
middle of the defensive line?
</P>
<P>
   Starting left tackle Travis Hall (6-5, 298) is coming off a
stellar season. After him, issues abound.
</P>
<P>
   Seventh-year veteran Shane Dronett (6-6, 295) last year backed
up Hall and departed right tackle Dan Owens.
</P>
<P>
   Dronett moves into the starting role, a job he's had just three
games the past three seasons in Atlanta and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're satisified with the starters,'' coach Dan Reeves said.
``I wouldn't say it's dire after that, but it's an area of concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need help. Somebody has to step up.''
</P>
<P>
   The current backup right tackle is Esera Tuaolo (6-2, 281), who
is with his fourth team in eight years after playing six games for
Jacksonville last year.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Campbell (6-1, 293), who did not dress out as a rookie in
Denver in '96 and played four games last year for Arizona, is the
backup left tackle.
</P>
<P>
   The other tackles are rookie seventh-rounder Henry Slay (6-1,
290), and Gaines (6-5, 330), who last year dressed for 13 games for
Washington, starting seven and registering 26 tackles. In one year
with Miami and three with the Redskins, he has 126 tackles and
three sacks.
</P>
<P>
   The team will probably keep four defensive tackles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say much because we've only been in pads three
days,'' said defensive line coach Bill Kollar. ``We've got to get
another guy we're confident can play in the regular season.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Davis said Saturday, ``I may be back in camp Tuesday.
I've done some thinking, and maybe I made too quick a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to see what (the Falcons) thinking is.''
</P>
<P>
   Under NFL rules, once a player is on the ``reserve/left squad''
list like Davis, he has five days to return. If he does not, he
cannot play for any NFL team that season. The Falcons can refuse
his return and waive him.

 &HT;    Niners try to shrug off upheaval
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- For nearly two decades, the San Francisco 49ers
served as the model of consistency, a franchise every other NFL
team wanted to emulate. Despite some internal bickering, the public
persona was that of a team making the transitions from Bill Walsh
to George Seifert and Joe Montana to Steve Young with little strain
or strife.
</P>
<P>
   But while San Francisco still dominates the NFC West on the
field, the last few years have not been kind to the 49ers off it.
</P>
<P>
   Seifert was summarily ousted after the 1996 season and replaced
by Steve Mariucci. Last December, owner Eddie DeBartolo, the
subject of a federal probe over attempts to secure a Louisiana
casino license, surrendered control of the team to his sister,
Denise DeBartolo York. And last Wednesday president Carmen Policy,
for 30 years DeBartolo's closest friend and one of the most
respected administrators in the league for 20 years, suddenly
resigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure from the outside,'' said wide receiver Jerry Rice,
``people feel the foundation is starting to crack. But as players,
we don't see much difference.'' Noted strong safety Tim McDonald:
``It's pretty much been business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. Just from surveying officials from a dozen teams,
however, there exists now an underlying perception San Francisco is
more vulnerable than at any time since Walsh replaced Fred O'Connor
in 1979, two years after DeBartolo purchased the Niners with the
help of Oakland owner Al Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of Policy may signal the return of DeBartolo,
but there's no assurance commissioner Paul Tagliabue will clear him
until the Louisiana situation is resolved. Even in the league
offices last week, there were concerns over the still-murky future
of the club, and it's been a long time since that was the case.
</P>
<P>
   New frontrunners
</P>
<P>
   During a press conference last week, Policy joined the efforts
of credit card magnate Al Lerner and former Browns quarterback
Bernie Kosar to land the new Cleveland expansion team. You could
almost hear the knife twisting in the gut of Art Modell. The
onetime Browns owner, who moved his team to Baltimore, had an
acrimonious split with former partner Lerner. And, of course,
Modell drew the scorn of fans in 1993, when he permitted coach Bill
Belichick to release local favorite Kosar at midseason. Modell has
endorsed Charles Dolan's bid for the new Browns. The additions of
Policy and Kosar, though, now make Lerner a strong favorite to land
the team.
</P>
<P>
   Draft blunder
</P>
<P>
   He arrived with the nickname ``Big Nate,'' but when Nathan Davis
abruptly walked away from the game Friday, even Atlanta Falcons
officials shouldn't have been surprised. The defensive tackle
became one of the biggest busts in recent draft history. In the
weeks leading to the 1997 draft, many NFL teams _ citing injury
problems and Davis' own candid remarks about a possible lack of
desire _ red-flagged him. Others dropped him completely off their
draft boards. The Falcons' draft team, however, ignored problems
that Indiana coach Bill Mallory might have told them about, and
Davis stands as the first draft strike against the new regime. A
few of the players Atlanta passed over to take Davis in the second
round: QB Jake Plummer (Arizona), LB Jamie Sharper (Baltimore), SS
Mike Minter (Carolina), FS Darren Sharper (Green Bay), RB Corey
Dillon (Cincinnati) and OT Adam Meadows.
</P>
<P>
   Invisible man
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City defensive coordinator Gunther Cunningham may have to
reshuffle plans for his third-down pass rush personnel. Lineman Dan
Williams, who had 10 1/2 sacks in '97, continues to balk at signing
for the one-year ``franchise'' tender of $2.88 million. He has
moved to Atlanta and did not provide coach Marty Schottenheimer or
president Carl Peterson a new phone number. Cunningham hoped to
package Williams with Derrick Thomas and new acquisitions Chester
McGlockton and Leslie O'Neal to further pump up an already potent
Chiefs pass rush. Agent Roosevelt Barnes phoned Falcons general
manager Harold Richardson a few weeks ago about Williams, but now
that the July 15 free agent deadline has passed, the Chiefs hold
most of the cards, and it would be tougher to acquire him.
</P>
<P>
   Homeboys
</P>
<P>
   Brett Conway, the former Parkview High kicker taken by Green Bay
in the third round in '97, still hasn't fully recovered from the
thigh injury that wiped out his rookie season. Conway, battling
Ryan Longwell for a job, so far is limited to kicking once a day.
... A season-ending knee injury to Dallas linebacker Broderick
Thomas has scuttled plans that Dallas defensive boss Jim Bates had
for former Georgia standout Randall Godfrey. The Cowboys had hoped
Thomas could line up at strongside linebacker, which would permit
Godfrey to replace incumbent Fred Strickland in the middle. ... One
of the early camp experiments for Pittsburgh offnsive coordinator
Ray Sherman is using former Bulldogs star Hines Ward as a
third-down tailback.
</P>
<P>
   Niners' new twist
</P>
<P>
   The past four years, the San Francisco defensive front always
aligned with Bryant Young at left tackle and Dana Stubblefield at
the right tackle spot he clearly preferred. The free agent
departure of Stubblefield to Washington has created obvious
problems for coordinator John Marshall, but could mean more chances
for Young to create havoc. The plan is to get Young the best
available matchup by allowing him to flip sides with Junior Bryant
when he feels he has an obvious advantage over a certain opponent.
``His quickness is going to be put to the best use possible,'' said
line coach Dwaine Board.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   League officials have moved to the next level in their
investigation of two NFC West assistant coaches who purchased Super
Bowl XXXII tickets from players last year and then sold them to
brokers for huge profits. ... It didn't take long for Philadelphia
coach Ray Rhodes to discover how first-round offensive tackle Tra
Thomas spent part of his $3.4 million signing bonus. The former
Florida State star pulled into camp in a 1996 black Hummer,
outfitted with three television sets, a VCR and a satellite hookup.
... New York Giants special teams coach Larry MacDuff will use Pro
Bowl corner Jason Sehorn to return kickoffs this year. The Giants
finished last in returns a year ago with a paltry 18.9-yard
average. ... At least two groups, both convinced that John Kent
Cooke can't afford to keep the Redskins, are quietly preparing bids
for the franchise. ... The Jets and Cardinals are among the
safety-thin teams that will closely scout Atlanta's Devin Bush
throughout the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   The last word(s)
</P>
<P>
   Miami Dolphins first-round tailback John Avery of Mississippi on
how his size (5-9 3/8, 185) will affect him against the NFL's
bigger defenders: ``When fear sets in, it doesn't matter who is
chasing you. You just run. The lion wakes up every day knowing that
he must outrun the fastest gazelle to eat. The gazelle knows he
must outrun the fastest lion to survive. You've just got to wake up
running.''

   It will be crazy at Turner Field on Aug. 19, when the Braves
have a Beanie Baby giveaway during the Giants series. The first
12,000 kids 14 and under will get Chip The Cat, honoring Andres
``Big Cat'' Galarraga. It will be interesting to see how the Braves
will control the crowd. The Beanie Baby giveaway at the All-Star
Game got out of hand when fans began fighting to get them.

   Notes: Lenny Harris is the 113th player to play third base for
the Mets since they joined the league in 1961. Seven players have
played the position this year. ... When Braves third baseman
Chipper Jones recently hit his first home run from the right side
of the plate this year, he was able to escape a dubious
switch-hitting distinction. Pete Rose in 1969 and Roy Cullenbine in
1944 hit all their homers from one side of the plate. ... Recently,
Marlins reliever Matt Mantei had 10 straight strikeouts during a
three-game period. ... Montreal shortstop Mark Grudzielanek
continues to lose trade value because of sore knees and a bad heel.

   The Cubs are in the postseason hunt, and fans are complaining.
Chicago can't seem to get on television. Approximately 60 games
were pulled off superstation WGN and put on a local Chicago cable
channel. But an executive at the Tribune Company, which owns the
Cubs, said if the winning continues WGN may televise more games.

   Notes: Reds shortstop Barry Larkin ripped the C (standing for

recently went on the disabled list after getting hit in the head:
``I was surrounded by Angels.'' . . . The Giants are making a run
at Cardinals outfielder Brian Jordan, and the Angels would like to
get pitcher Todd Stottlemyre from St. Louis. ... Teams continue to
call the Pirates about relievers Jason Christiansen and Ricardo

White Sox aren't too interested in helping the Cubs get a

last writer to become a GM, Claire said: ``Looking out at my

   Notes: The Dodgers have had the biggest turnover this season,
with 12 different players from their opening day roster. ... Since
joining the Dodgers, closer Jeff Shaw has retired 25 of 28 hitters
he has faced and pitched 8 1/3 scoreless innings. ... Since going
to Arizona, former Braves reliever Alan Embree is 3-0. His account
of the day he was traded: ``John (Schuerholz) called, and I think
he expected me to be real upset,'' Embree said. ``And I just told
him thanks, and I'm looking forward to going to the Diamondbacks. I
think that kind of stunned him a bit.'' ... The Padres continue to
pursue Seattle's Randy Johnson, trying to find out if he would be
interested in signing a long-term deal with the club. Word is he
would. ... The Rockies are willing to deal outfielders Ellis Burks
and Dante Bichette and pitchers Pedro Astacio, Chuck McElroy and
Mike DeJean.

 &HT;    The Games' first glitc
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They swam with the fishes in the strong, smelly
currents of New York Harbor, failing to find Jimmy Hoffa _ though
some jellyfish found them.
</P>
<P>
   Then they raced up Fifth Avenue like a pack of underclothed
bicycle messengers who, on the blocked-off streets, were spared the
horror of car doors opening.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they ran through Central Park while Saturday morning
joggers, preoccupied with their own fitness, ignored them.
</P>
<P>
   The Goodwill Games triathlon, involving athletes likely to
compete in the first-ever Olympic competition in 2000, would have
been a rousing success as a tour of the city except three athletes
suffered the fate of most visitors to New York: They took a wrong
turn.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Lessing of Great Britain, a three-time world champion, won
the men's race and $15,000 with a cumulative time of 1 hour, 46
minutes, 33 seconds. He defeated Craig Walton of Australia and
Laurent Jeanselme of France while also managing not to hit ``a
little dog with a little soccer ball in his mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Loretta Harrop of Australia, whose strength is swimming, took
the women's event in 1:59:43, holding off her more famous teammate
Michellie Jones and Hungary's Erika Molnar, both accomplished
runners. Barb Lindquist was fourth, the highest-finishing American.
</P>
<P>
   All 25 women and 18 of 25 men who attempted the 1,500-meter
swim, 40-kilometer (25-mile) bike race and 10-kilometer (6.2-mile)
run finished alongside the posh Tavern on the Green restaurant as a
reggae band played and homeless people slept.
</P>
<P>
   Reigning world champion Chris McCormack was one of three men who
were told more than an hour after the race that they still had not
officially finished. They were directed the wrong way on the
running course, which became the first major glitch of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, well, that's life,'' McCormack said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the debate over whether it's the athletes'
responsibility or the organizers to ensure they follow the course _
which was not open to pre-competition testing _ Goodwill officials
did not disqualify McCormack, Dmitry Gaag of Kazakhstan and
Gilberto Gonzales of Venezuela. And from a Games contingency fund,
they were awarded $3,750 apiece, the average prize money for fourth
through sixth place.
</P>
<P>
   The runners were supposed to do a short out-and-back loop, then
three longer laps. Competition manager Dave McGillvray said an
unidentified person thought the cones along the road ``were in the
way of the runners'' and moved them, eliminating the turn-around.
</P>
<P>
   Lessing, Walton and Jeanselme consequently did one of the big
laps first, forcing officials to change the course. But when
Gonzales came around from the opposite direction _ signalling with
his arms, ``Where do I go?'' _ officials knew there was trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The triathletes are looking forward to Sydney, and not just
because it has an established course.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still a young sport,'' said Australia's Greg Bennett.
``I think we're fortunate to be going in as early as we are.''

 &HT;    Furious stretch run
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG POND, Pa. -- Seventeen down, 16 to go. And there is not an
open date to be found between today's Pennsylvania 500 at Pocono
and the season finale on Nov. 8 at Atlanta's NAPA 500.
</P>
<P>
   It's a modern-day NASCAR Winston Cup record, one no race team
covets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be handled without much fanfare if you're prepared,''
said team owner Richard Childress, who prepares the cars of Dale
Earnhardt and Mike Skinner. ``You need to develop a plan and stick
with it. An you can't afford any bad luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Preparation is the key, fatigue the enemy. A Winston Cup
championship is riding on the long and brutal stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about energy and enthusiasm and keeping enough cars all
in one piece,'' said Robin Pemberton, crew chief for Rusty Wallace.
``And, it's absolutely imperative that we don't let anything bad
happen to the two or three favorite cars we have.''
</P>
<P>
   The game plan for most teams is to have two crews _ one to take
care of things at the track, another to have everything ready when
the first team returns.
</P>
<P>
   It's now a case who has the best team, not the best car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about anything but luck through this stretch,''
said Mark Martin. ``I know that 24 team (Jeff Gordon) is fierce. I
know the 88 (Dale Jarrett) is fierce. I know the 12 team (Jeremy
Mayfield) has been impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things that can happen, but from what I've
seen so far out of this team that I'm working with, it will not be
outworked down this all-important stretch. The majority of the
group is young, and they want it bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Yates is taking a different approach. He's not going to
burn out his team in the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could race every day,'' he said. ``But, we're not going to
wear out any of our guys. We'll get 'em a break when they need it.
We've done 14 straight before, and 15 should be no big problem. One
thing in our favor is we have four Saturday night races.''
</P>
<P>
   Yates has another reason to be optimistic. He has enough cars
prepared for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're in really good shape to make this stretch run,''
said Dale Jarrett of his Yates team. ``If other teams are in as
good a shape as we're in, then we've got a real battle. But I think
we're as prepared as any out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it's gonna allow us to do, with the number of good race
cars we can take to these different tracks, is take a little bit of
the workload off these guys. Hopefully, they're not gonna have to
come in at (7 Monday morning) after the race on Sunday, and they
can a little time off to relax and enjoy what we've accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain. Sixteen in a row can shake up a points
race in a hurry.

 &HT;    Schuerholz ready to make a deal
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- John Schuerholz popped up in the Braves dugout late
Saturday afternoon, with the active light glowing on the cell phone
hanging at his hip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's turned on,'' the Braves general manager said, ``and ready
to burn up the wires.''
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, Schuerholz tempered his eagerness when asked
about getting something accomplished between now and Friday's
trading deadline. The club has spent weeks canvassing the market
for a veteran closer and a left-handed set-up man but Schuerholz
said he would not be disappointed if the club stood pat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go into the postseason with this team, I wouldn't feel
bad at all. You can't be,'' he said. ``Just because you need or
want someone doesn't mean you can expect to get them. So you can't
be disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   The club's options are gradually being reduced. Bill Lajoie and
Brian Murphy, special assistants to Schuerholz, have been scouting
the American League for the past week. While Lajoie has seen
Detroit's Todd Jones and Jose Mesa, since dealt by Cleveland to San
Francisco, Murphy has been in Kansas City, where veteran Jeff
Montgomery has 24 saves and is on track for his best season in five
years. Tampa Bay's Roberto Hernandez also remains an option.
</P>
<P>
   The National League market is not as open. The Braves'
discussions with Philadelphia over Mark Leiter cooled when the
Phillies asked for outfielder George Lombard, hitting .317 with
Class AA Greenville. Before Cincinnati dealt Jeff Shaw to Los
Angeles, the Reds had shown interest in outfielder Michael Tucker,
a possible deal Schuerholz discounts.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' biggest obstacle, as it has been the past several
years, is forging a fair exchange when both leagues are by now
quite familar with the Braves' needs and try to leverage a way into
Atlanta's farm system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always that way,'' Schuerholz said. ``The more they know
what you're doing, they want to try _ and rightly so _ to delve
into that mother lode.''
</P>
<P>
   Dial J-O-H-N
</P>
<P>
   While Schuerholz reclined in the Atlanta dugout, Pittsburgh's
Jason Christiansen glanced over during batting practice said, ``If
it was up to me, I'd call him tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Christiansen has become one of the hot trade tickets these two
weeks _ a left-handed set-up man with a 1.75 ERA _ and has drawn
inquiries from 17 different clubs. The Braves and Chicago Cubs have
shown high interest, though the New York Yankees have become a
front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Christiansen, 28, becomes arbitration-eligible next year, which
makes him the Pirates' most perishable commodity as the team tries
to keep down payroll. Good friends with Atlanta's Denny Neagle, he
has monitored his place on the market via nightly forays on the
internet. Asked if would welcome a trade to the Braves, he said,
``I'd love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie's back
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Perez rejoined the club after two days at home tending to
his family while his wife, Marisol, underwent surgery for gall
stones and kindey stones. Dr. Patrick Luke waited for Perez to
arrive at Northside Hospital Thursday morning before going ahead
with the procedures, while Perez was left to care for the couple's
two children, including six-week-old son, Andres.
</P>
<P>
   ``Javy (Lopez's wife, Analy) took care of the baby,'' Perez
said. ``I don't think I'd be alive right now if I had to take care
of the baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves will not get a look at Pirates rookie third baseman
Aramis Ramirez this series. He is serving a five-game suspension
for charging the mound against Montreal's Javier Vazquez last
Friday, which triggered a brawl.

 &HT;    ON DECK: PITTSBURGH PIRATES
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: Today, 1:35 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Three Rivers Stadium, Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   TV/radio: Fox Sports South; WSB 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: RHP Greg Maddux (13-4, 1.66; 14-13,
2.77 vs. Pirates) vs. RHP Jason Schmidt (8-7, 4.15; 1-2, 7.54
lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: On June 1st, Schmidt beat the New York Mets to improve
his record to 8-1 and left an impression around the league that he
had finally shed a reputation for inconsistency and come into his
own. Since that day, Schmidt has gone 0-6 in nine starts, his ERA
has risen a half-run to 4.15 and the inconsistency rap is back. He
has not pitched poorly throughout the losing streak, holding
opponents to three earned runs or less four times. Twice the
Pirates have been shut out during the streak and two other times
held to one run. The Braves beat him 11-3 in Pittsburgh on April 7
(five runs in four innings, two Chipper Jones home runs). Somehow,
this has become Maddux's rockiest stint of the season, having given
up six earned runs in his last 21 2/3 innings and he has gone 1-2
in those three games. He continues to lead the majors with a 1.66
ERA, leads the NL with four shutouts and is second in the league
with seven complete games. His first shutout of the season came
against the Pirates on a six-hitter April 15. Al Martin remains his
biggest threat in Pittsburgh with a .361 career average.

   VALMEYER, Ill. _ Not many people in this in tiny village,
rebuilt atop a bluff along the Mississippi River after the great
flood of 1993, remember Russell E. Weston Jr.
</P>
<P>
   But the man accused of killing two police officers Friday night
in a gunfight at the U.S. Capitol is a native son.
</P>
<P>
   Those who do recognize the name don't recall Weston getting into
any noteworthy trouble or showing any indication he was capable of
such an aberrant act.
</P>
<P>
   It was only when he went to Montana after graduating from high
school that reports of troubling behavior began to surface.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors in the town of small town of Rimini, about 17 miles
from the capital of Helena, described Weston as a loner who often
ranted about everything from the government to a nearby satellite
TV dish he though was spying on him. But none of them thought he
was dangerous or ever saw him with a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   He reportedly was hospitalized for more than a month in 1996
after writing threatening letters to government officials,
including some missives that caught the attention of the Secret
Service.
</P>
<P>
   People who saw him in Valmeyer have a hard time reconciling such
erratic and hostile actions with the Weston they knew.
</P>
<P>
   Weston's grandfather was a section foreman for the railroad
company, said Harold Baum, who was the superintendent of Valmeyer's
schools and knows the Weston family well.
</P>
<P>
   Weston attended Valmeyer schools from the first grade until his
graduation in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ````I like to say he was a typical child of the '70s in that he
rejected all society's values, everything that is except the money,
and had no work ethic,'' Baum says. ``Never worked to capacity. But
he never got into any trouble or anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Baum said Weston, who as a student was overweight, wore his
blond hair long and usually dressed in nondescript, baggy clothes.
He was quiet, didn't seem to date anyone and had an ``average''
number of friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely wasn't what you would call a loner,'' Baum said.
</P>
<P>
   Baum said the Westons were a typically ``stable'' family that
did not appear to have any serious problems. Baum and Weston's
father, Russell Sr., attended school together.
</P>
<P>
   When he left high school, Weston and several other Valmeyer
graduates moved to Montana, and for many years, whenever he came
back home, Weston would visit Baum. Baum said he never heard
anything from the young man to indicate that he was mentally
disturbed or angry at anyone.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Weston had drifted back and forth between
Montana and his old hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Those who came into contact with him in Montana describe him as
having a paranoid personality.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Moore owned a 9-foot television satellite dish and
recalled that Weston used to accuse him of aiming it at his cabin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would say, `That's pointing at my house, they're watching
me,''' Moore told the New York Times, adding that he preferred to
avoid Weston whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was a little leery,'' he said. ``He was never
violent, but you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore's wife, Mary, said Weston was fine as long as he was on
medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was off the medication, he was paranoid, you just
didn't know,'' Mary Moore said. ``His grandmother and his parents
used to check in on him with the lady next door.''
</P>
<P>
   Weston's relatives in Valmeyer were not commenting on their
son's behavior or mental state on Saturday. Local police officers
had the roads to the Weston's property sealed off and no one at the
house was answering the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, the Miami Herald reached Weston's father by
telephone and told the paper he had last seen his son on Thursday
when they argued because the younger man had used a shotgun to kill
a number of cats.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shot a bunch of cats and I made him get out. I got mad,
told him, 'You gonna have to leave,''' Weston Sr., told the
newspaper. The father also reportedly said that his son's ``mind
doesn't work real good.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the Weston's neighbors, who did not want her name used,
said she had never seen or heard anything about the family that
concerned her. They ``kept to themselves pretty much,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Valmeyer's residents expressed dismay at the attention
being focused on their community. The new town, laid out neatly on
top of the bluff above the old one, is struggling to put down roots
and forget about the devastating flood of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis M. Knobloch, the village administrator who led the effort
to move the entire town to higher ground, left piles of fliers at
several locations around town with a statement intended to play
down the connection between Valmeyer and Weston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Residents of the Village of Valmeyer share a zip code with
Russell E. Weston,'' he wrote, ``but not much else. ... He was a
very quiet and reserved individual through his school days at
Community Unit School District No. 3 and Valmeyer High School.
After his graduation, most who knew him lost contact with him.'' &QL;

Restrictors performing as hoped

   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BROOKLYN, Mich. _ In its simplest form, auto racing is a game to
see who can go the fastest. But the irony of the sport these days
is the fact that the powers-that-be are constantly trying to find
ways to slow the cars down.
</P>
<P>
   Then the crews, the engine builders, the chassis designers and
the tire manufacturers invent new ways to make the cars overcome
the restrictions in a never-ending game of cat-and-mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The newest restriction on the CART circuit involves the Handford
Device, a bulky wing attachment that was supposed to slow the cars
by at least 15 mph at the Michigan Speedway this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But Adrian Fernandez guided the Tecate Reynard Ford to the top
qualifying speed of 229.519 mph for today's U.S. 500, only four mph
slower than Scott Pruett's 233.857 last year. The drivers say they
likely would have qualified at more than 238 mph without the new
wing because of the technical advances made this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the year at California, we will be back up to
240 (mph), and they will have to come up with something else to
slow us down,'' said Michael Andretti, who qualified eighth at
227.129 in the Texaco Swift Ford. ``It's just the nature of the
sport. It's a continuing battle, but I think it makes things
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, open-wheel racing and NASCAR Winston Cup cars
still were testing the limits of technology to see how fast the
drivers could go. But it soon became apparent that only limit was
the ability of the drivers to control the ever-increasing speeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is we couldn't just run at tracks like Michigan if
we were uncontrolled,'' said Paul Tracy, who qualified 15th in the
Kool Green Reynard Honda at 225.113 mph. ``If they didn't do
anything, we would be out here running 300 mph by the year 2400.''
</P>
<P>
   The nature of race-car drivers is to go as fast as possible, but
they understand the speeds have reached the point where safety is
he main concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speed is all relative,'' Andretti said. ``I really don't
care how fast we go as long as I'm faster than the other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Andretti said everyone is going to go faster in today's race
than they did in qualifying because the tow from drafting enables
the cars to gain speed. That proved true in the open practice
session Saturday morning when Jimmy Vasser, the No. 2 qualifier at
228.855 mph, posted a 233.622-mph lap in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see a lot quicker laps in the race than you
saw in qualifying,'' Andretti said. ``But a 500-mile race is all
about finishing. I think the last time I finished this race was
1989. I've only finished the race here three times (including two
victories) in my career. What you hope to do is breathe the engine
for the first 300 miles, stay in contention and then make your
move.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, a 33-year-old native of Mexico City who now lives in
Paradise Valley, Ariz., believes the Handford Device has increased
the importance of drafting in today's race, making the event
similar to a Winston Cup race at a restrictor-plate track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drafting is going to be the key,'' Fernandez said. ``The cars
have no downforce in the corners when you have a line of cars in
front of you because they take up all the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``This race is very hard on the engines because you are running
flat out so much of the time. You can't go out there and try to get
too fancy early in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   With speeds in excess of 230 mph in a 250-lap race on a two-mile
oval, the No. 1 priority is survival of your equipment so you still
will be running at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a track where the old saying makes sense,'' said
Richie Hearn, who qualified third at 228.238 mph in the Budweiser
Swift Ford. ``First you have to finish if you hope to finish
first.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Rahal, who qualified 12th at 225.882 mph for what will be
his last start at Michigan, admits that the Michigan Speedway is a
scary place.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those places where I always thank God when I
walk out of here,'' Rahal said. ``You really don't look forward to
it because the speeds are so fast and the risk is so high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get out there and get going, you still get caught up
in wanting to be the fastest, but this race doesn't always go to
the swiftest.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Zanardi, the defending champion at Michigan, has been
swifter to the finish line than the rest of the CART drivers in the
last four races. If he wins today, the 31-year-old Italian will
become the first CART driver in history to win five consecutive
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in America tend to judge you by how you do on the
ovals,'' said Zanardi, who will start on the inside of row 4 after
qualifying at 227.237 mph. ``And you make a name for yourself in
the 500-mile races. At the end of the race last year I said to
myself, `Now I know I can do it.' I hope I can do it again.''

WHERE WILL JOHNSON WIND UP?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ Although the baseball world shifts its
attention to this tiny piece of Americana for today's Hall of Fame
induction ceremonies, the infatuation will quickly keep moving.
</P>
<P>
   The real buzz in baseball deals with trades. Friday is the
major-league trading deadline and the biggest question is whether
Seattle left-hander Randy Johnson finally will be traded.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is yes, but there are so many teams interested, where
he is headed remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The division-leading New York Yankees and Cleveland Indians have
told the Mariners not to make a deal until they get a chance to
counter.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres, runaway leaders in the NL West, are
attempting to overtake Atlanta for the league's best record and
pass the 1975 Cincinnati Reds for the best home record in National
League history. They also have funding for a new stadium on the
November ballot and are willing to make one big push.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres have offered pitcher Joey Hamilton and one-time top
Yankees prospect Ruben Rivera, who hasn't had much of an impact
since coming over in last season's Hideki Irabu deal.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson already would be gone, but one of the Mariners' 16
owners has been holding out. Everyone else _ including manager Lou
Piniella and center fielder Ken Griffey _ has been begging the club
to make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Dodgers, who appeared to be a front-runner a month
ago, there is little chance now. Seattle wanted Darren Dreifort,
the Dodgers were offering Ismael Valdes.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have no chance of catching San Diego in the West but
have enough pitching _ even without Johnson _ to make the playoffs
as the wild card. For a team with so much upheaval this year, that
might be enough to convince Fox this season was a success. But
probably not. &QL; 
WHERE'S TOMMY?
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Tom Lasorda is here this weekend, one
year after being inducted by the Veterans Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda, however, went to New York City on Saturday for an
Old-Timers game at Yankee Stadium. The Yankees were celebrating the
20th anniversary of their World Series victory over the Dodgers and
Lasorda managed his former team in the Old-Timers game.
</P>
<P>
   But this weekend is not just a social call. Lasorda will be
trying to make a few deals before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   One reported trade possibility, the moving of injured third
baseman Bobby Bonilla, isn't going to happen. But if Lasorda could
move a 35-year-old who is guaranteed $6 million in each of the next
two seasons after undergoing two major operations and a cancer
scare, he should not only win executive of the year, he could
retire the award. &QL; 
GOOD AND BAD
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Orioles' fast start in the second half probably
will keep them from conducting a much-needed fire sale on their $73
million payroll. They unloaded Joe Carter this past week, but there
won't be much more.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, they came from way back to win the American League wild
card. This year, they were 15{ games behind Boston at the break.
Today, the Orioles are eight games back of the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   No team ever has come from that far back, but some were close.
The 1914 Braves won after trailing by 15 games. The 1978 Yankees
were 14 behind Boston before winning. The 1951 New York Giants and
1995 Seattle Mariners came from 13 down.
</P>
<P>
   Can the Orioles do it? Probably not. But they have a few things
in their favor, including two more series with the Red Sox. They
also have a soft schedule for the next three weeks, not facing
anyone with a winning record until they open a four-game series
Aug. 13 against Cleveland. &QL; 
POPULAR PORTUGAL
</P>
<P>
   It seemed certain Philadelphia's Mark Portugal would be traded,
but that's changed since the Phillies became a wild-card contender.
</P>
<P>
   On the team's just-completed 8-4 road trip, Portugal went 3-0
with an 0.82 ERA in three starts. It was hard to believe for
Phillies fans, who have booed Portugal since he signed a two-year,
$5 million contract in January 1997. Before the trip, Portugal had
just one more victory for the club than visits to the disabled list
(3-2).
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, who pitches today against Florida at home, still has
not won a game at Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see why we would deal Portugal,'' said Phillies ace
Curt Schilling. ``I mean, is Albert Belle coming here, something
like that? There wouldn't be another reason why you would do it.'' &QL; 
BELL TO SECOND?
</P>
<P>
   Although shortstop Jay Bell was signed to be a cornerstone by
expansion Arizona, he is close to moving to second base less than
one season into his monster five-year, $34 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, 32, has 12 errors after committing 10 in each of the last
two seasons. He is fourth in the National League with 90
strikeouts. He has tendinitis in his left knee that has limited his
mobility.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks called up Triple-A shortstop Danny Klassen on
July 4 to play second, but it might only be a matter of time before
the switch is made. Bell, one of baseball's more consistent
shortstops during his years at Pittsburgh, balked last season when
Kansas City attempted to move him to third.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he seems more accepting of a change. Last week, Bell
had a meeting with manager Buck Showalter that touched on a variety
of subjects, including a move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked a little about second base,'' Bell said. ``I'm going
to do what is best for this club. I'm relied upon to do some things
not only on the field but off the field. I want to reflect what it
is like to play the game hard. The one thing I can't allow for me
personally is to become complacent.'' &QL; 
REGGIE LEAVES
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, Reggie Jackson and Yankees owner George Steinbrenner
not getting along.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson resigned this past week as a special assistant to
Steinbrenner. Insiders say Jackson wanted more responsibility in
his attempt to someday become a general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the rift isn't over money, which of course, is part
of it. He originally angered Steinbrenner last month when he ran up
$14,000 on the company credit card. Steinbrenner refused to
reimburse him and withheld Jackson's $100,000 salary.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues were resolved. Others were not. Since he took the
job several years ago, Reggie has done little more than be Reggie.
He represents the team at functions, but also works with youngsters
during spring training and serves as a mentor for some of the
minority players in the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson begged to be part of the decision-making process. Like
Lasorda, Reggie wanted to help build a team and be part of
player-personnel moves. The Yankees weren't ready for that. &QL; 
PROSPECT PROSPECTUS
</P>
<P>
   Although Todd Van Poppel and Esteban Loaiza were the players
fans recognize, the big name in last week's trade between the
Rangers and Pirates was second-base prospect Warren Morris.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates want to move their second baseman, Tony Womack, who
leads the league in stolen bases. Womack, the league leader in
steals (60) during his first full season in 1997, could be eligible
for salary arbitration at the end of the year. The top 17 percent
of players with two-plus years service time are eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, 24, was the Rangers' fifth pick in 1996 from LSU. He is
best known for hitting a ninth-inning, game-winning homer against
Miami in the NCAA championship, and he has continued to excel.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he was batting .331 with 14 homers, 73 RBI and 12
steals in 95 games at Double-A Tulsa at the time of the deal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TOP OF THE ORDER
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Padres' runaway season that could end with the NL's
best record, there is a good chance now that San Diego voters will
reject a proposed $411 million, 42,000-seat downtown stadium in
November. That was considered essential to keep the team from
leaving. The Padres packed their lineup this year hoping to entice
voters, but last week negotiations with the city were described as
``intolerable.'' &QL; 
ROTISSERIE WATCH
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have fallen out of the NL Central race and would
like to trade one of the league's top hitters, Brian Jordan. The
problem: The free agent to be is Mark McGwire's protection in the
lineup. Although McGwire has walked more than 100 times during his
pursuit of Roger Maris' record, there is a good chance he won't
make it without a quality hitter behind him. &QL; 
STAT OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   The baseball adage, offense wins games, defense wins pennants,
might not be more true in Texas. In their first 56 games, the
Rangers committed 28 errors and went 34-22. In the next 44 they
made 46 and were 21-23. Pitching and hitting were basically the
same during both stretches. &QL; 
THE BUZZ
</P>
<P>
   Despite his perfect game and starting assignment in the All-Star
Game, the Yankees' David Wells, 35, says he's done when his
contract expires at the end of next season. Wells, who missed a
start last week because of gout in his foot, is 11-3 with a 3.69
ERA. The Yankees hold an option for 2000 at $4.5 million. Expect
the team to offer an extension. &QL; 
QUOTABLE
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I walked four guys in an inning. He told me,
`That's OK, dad, I walked six in one inning this year.' I pitched
like they do in Little League. Walk five or six, strike out the
side.'' &QL; 
_Philadelphia's Mark Leiter, to his 7-year-old son Mark Jr. last
Sunday, when he picked up a victory after walking four and striking
out three, including Mike Piazza to end the game.

SUSPECT WAS HOSPITALIZED IN 1996 FOR OMINOUS LETTERS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for new 3rd graf, fixes, rewrite throughout)   This article was reported by James Brooke, Pam Belluck and John
Kifner and was written by Brooke.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIMINI, Mont. _ Russell Eugene Weston Jr. was a quiet loner who
drifted back and forth between a cabin in the Montana mountains and
a modest house in rural Illinois, all the while becoming an
increasingly troubled figure who eventually was hospitalized two
years ago after writing threatening letters to government
officials, according to officials and people who knew him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had something against'' President Clinton personally and
the government, said Jerry Swihart, an employee of the Warm Springs
State Mental Hospital in Montana. ``He was possessed by it. He went
on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Daniel Kelley of Monroe County, Ill., after speaking to
the suspect's family there, said they had told him that their son
had been diagnosed by a medical professional as a paranoid
schizophrenic.
</P>
<P>
   Weston, the suspect in the Capitol building shootout that killed
two police officers on Friday, was involuntarily committed to Warm
Springs by court order on Oct. 11, 1996, according to Andrew H.
Malcolm, a spokesman for Gov. Marc Racicot of Montana. He was
released on Dec. 2, 1996, because the hospital ``deemed him no
longer a threat to himself or others,'' Malcolm said. After Weston
was released, a hospital employee drove him to his cabin here with
the understanding that he would close it for the winter and return
to his parents' home outside Valmeyer, Ill., where he had a series
of appointments at a mental health center in nearby Waterloo. But
it remained unclear on Saturday whether he kept those appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that year, Weston's anti-government statements,
including an accusation that officials had planted land mines on
his property in Montana, were virulent enough to attract the
attention of the Secret Service, federal officials said. Weston was
questioned by agents in April 1996, and the service's Presidential
Protective Detail has maintained a slim file on him ever since.
</P>
<P>
   That May, the Secret Service classified him as a minor threat _
a probably harmless but potentially dangerous man, law-enforcement
officials said. The Secret Service made the assessment after
reviewing interviews with Weston conducted by local mental health
authorities, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The portrait of the 41-year-old Weston emerging from interviews
with the few people who noticed him in the two tiny towns where he
lived _ Rimini, a former gold mining hamlet 17 miles southwest of
Helena, Montana's capital, and Valmeyer, a Mississippi River town
south of St. Louis _ was of a withdrawn, introverted loner who grew
increasingly angry and alienated over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when invitation letters went out for a 20-year reunion
of the 63 members of his 1974 graduating class at Valmeyer High
School, his came back scrawled with obscenities and a warning never
to contact him again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a few expletives,'' said Gary Baum, whose wife,
Sandy, was the class president. ``Basically, he said you could put
the letter where the sun doesn't shine.''
</P>
<P>
   The anger apparently finally exploded when he drove his battered
red pickup truck to Washington, officials said, and stormed past a
metal detector into the Capitol, firing a .38-caliber revolver and
killing the two officers.
</P>
<P>
   In Rimini, an old prospector's haunt in a thickly forested
valley on the eastern shoulder of the Continental Divide _ not far
from where the convicted Unabomber, Theodore Kaczynski, lived
unremarked upon by his neighbors _ residents said they generally
steered clear of Weston but thought he was harmless.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was on his medication, he was fine, he would wave and
talk,'' said May Moore, a longtime resident, as she stood Saturday
morning on the village's main street, a dirt road leading to the
Helena National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was off the medication, he was paranoid, you just
didn't know,'' Mrs. Moore said as FBI agents began to search the
cabin where Weston spent most of his summers. ``His grandmother and
his parents used to check in on him with the lady next door.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth D. Moore, her husband, pointed to his nine-foot
television satellite dish and recalled that Weston used to accuse
him of aiming it at his cabin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would say, `That's pointing at my house, they're watching
me,''' said Moore, the settlement's unofficial mayor, who added
that while he was not afraid of Weston, he generally preferred to
avoid him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was a little leery,'' he said. ``He was never
violent, but you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Around Valmeyer, whose population of about 900 was cut in half
by the great Mississippi river flood of 1993, Weston, known as
Rusty, was remembered only vaguely; his family lived out in a
rural, unincorporated area a half dozen miles north of town.
Townspeople said he moved to Montana soon after getting out of high
school in 1974 and only returned once in a while to visit his
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand, it was the early '70s when we were in
high school and graduated,'' said Baum, his old classmate. ``It was
the end of the Vietnam War. We were way out in the sticks and a
little bit behind the rest of the country with the whole drug
scene.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   He remembered Weston from the seventh grade on, mostly as ``one
of the forgotten middle kids, kind of on the fat side, not a sports
guy, never went out with any girls. Only had a couple of friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Then around the 11th grade, Baum recalled, ``he started getting
into the drug scene, smoking marijuana. He and a group of other
kids, they all went out to this place in Montana. They wanted to
get away, to be free. It was to be some kind of self-sufficient
commune. I heard he had a gold claim out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Knobloch, who was a senior at the 200-student high school
in 1974, said: ``He was not a person who participated in sports or
music or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just a quiet, shy kid,'' she remembered after leafing
through her high school yearbook, The Pirate. ``Not a troublemaker.
He didn't stand out as anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Knobloch said her husband, Dennis, a high school classmate
who as mayor and later village administrator was a major force in
rebuilding the destroyed town above the flood plain, could not
remember having seen Weston since they graduated. But she, too,
remembered the talk about Weston falling in with the clique of
marijuana smokers that developed in the mid-'70s.
</P>
<P>
   Alberta Reichman, whose son, Perry, went to school with Weston,
remembered him as ``a chunky kid in school, with curly hair''
looking different from the gaunt visage on the Montana license she
saw on television.
</P>
<P>
   In the Montana mountains Saturday, a bomb disposal squad from
the Air Force was searching through the lot where Weston lived.
April Callahan, Weston's sister, bought the property, a former
gold-mining claim known as the Minnie Lea Lode, in the early 1990s.
The lot, on the site of an old railroad turntable, has three
weather-beaten shacks and is littered with three trucks and a car.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Siewert, 54, a self-employed construction worker and
prospector, whose land abuts the lot, said he last saw Weston in
mid-June. He said he had talked to Weston several times over the
last four years. Conversations always started out normally, he
said, but quickly turned to talk that the CIA and FBI were out to
kill him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was paranoid but not violent,'' Siewert said. ``Everyone
and everything was out to get him. Satellite dishes were messing up
his mind. He said he had been an inside member of the Kennedy clan,
and for some reason the FBI and CIA were out to assassinate him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was paranoid about people breaking into his house. I had
some surveyors up here setting some pins on the land, and he
claimed they broke into his house and were going through his stuff.
I checked with the surveyor, and he said no way.''
</P>
<P>
   Rimini grew up as a mining town in the 1880s with a population
that once numbered 3,000, but that has dwindled to about 30 in the
winter. But with its 5,300-foot altitude, offering cool air,
meadows of clover and daisies and hillsides of spruce and lodgepole
pine, the village is undergoing a minor boom in the construction of
log cabins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community is changing, where people like him are
leaving,'' said Ted Topolski, a real estate investor here,
referring to Weston.
</P>
<P>
   Weston was arrested in Helena on suspicion of selling drugs on
Aug. 7, 1991, but no formal charges were filed.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20 miles south of here, near Clancey, Weston had another
run in with the authorities, recalled Tim Campbell, undersheriff of
Jefferson County.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, Weston threatened the undersheriff and several
other county officials. ``He confronted me and said something along
the lines of `you better watch your back,''' Campbell said Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he never made it intimidation. He knew where to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The threats stemmed from an incident in 1983 when an 86-year-old
woman, Dorothy Cole, hit Weston on the head with her cane while
trying to evict him from a cabin he was renting from her. Similar
to the cabin here, it had no sewer hookup.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Weston sued Mrs. Cole, but the suit was thrown out on
the grounds that he had waited too long _ three years _ to file. He
appealed to the Montana Supreme Court, but the lower court ruling
was upheld in 1988. At the time, Weston protested by calling a
radio talk show and by sending letters to local newspapers and to
Racicot, then Montana's attorney general. He was angry at Jefferson
County officials because they refused to file charges in the
assault.
</P>
<P>
   In Valmeyer, people who knew Weston said that when he returned
home in recent years, he mainly kept to himself. He spent much of
his time in the family home on B Road, an isolated rural route
where the frame houses are stitched together by vast fields of
soybeans and corn.
</P>
<P>
   He spent a lot of time gardening and chopping up some of the
hundreds of dead trees that are the detritus of the flood of 1993,
when virtually all of Valmeyer was washed away and the town, to
save itself, moved to higher ground. Unlike many of their
neighbors, the Westons, who have lived for at least 50 years on the
land here, about six miles north of Valmeyer, stayed behind after
the flood.
</P>
<P>
   Weston was close with his sister, Ms. Callahan, whose nickname
was Becky. They frequently talked on the phone, said Joe
Schellhardt, who knew Weston when he was younger. Ms. Callahan and
her husband, Ron, live in a pale yellow frame house with an
American flag out front, next door to a grain elevator, in Fults, a
two-street town about 15 miles from the family home. They were not
home on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Schellhardt and neighbors of Ms. Callahan in Fults also said
that Weston and a group of other young men, including Schellhardt's
brother Michael, headed to Montana soon after high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got menial jobs and lived in a cabin,'' Schellhardt said.
``They went to have fun like young men do. No women went.''

MOTIVE OF SUSPECT IN CAPITOL SHOOTINGS REMAINS ELUSIVE

Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The motive for a gunman's deadly invasion of the
U.S. Capitol remained elusive Saturday as the troubled, heavily
guarded shooter was charged with murder while he lay unconscious in
a hospital with a ``50-50'' chance to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Emotional memorials to the two congressional police officers
slain Friday in the exchange of pistol fire poured from the
Capitol, the White House and ordinary Americans.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton called the shootings ``a moment of savagery at
the front door of American civilization,'' and a tearful House
Speaker Newt Gingrich prayed in a nationally broadcast statement
that the country could ``learn to live with its freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The Capitol reopened to tourists, some of whom brought floral
tributes to officer Jacob ``J.J.'' Chestnut and special agent John
Gibson and laid the bouquets on the central steps of the massive,
domed building.
</P>
<P>
   Police cordoned off part the first floor where the shooting
occurred, including the office of House Majority Whip Tom DeLay,
R-Sugar Land, Texas, as a crime scene still being combed for clues
and evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Dickerson, a tourist bystander wounded by the gunfire,
was released from George Washington University Hospital, and
returned to her home in the Virginia suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Russell Eugene Weston Jr., 41, of Rimini, Mont.,
was formally charged Saturday as he was held comatose in an
intensive care unit at D.C. General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Weston, who was known to the Secret Service and considered by
acquaintances to be mentally disturbed, was charged with killing a
federal officer performing official duties, a crime that can lead
to the death penalty. Additional charges are being considered by
the U.S. attorney's office, law enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Capitol Police spokesman Dan Nichols referred to Weston as a
``lone gunman'' but refused to discuss details of the investigation
</P>
<P>
   Police sources said Weston's truck was found parked near the
Capitol and searched, but they refused comment on broadcast reports
that it contained science fiction materials and writings that
described Weston in a military context.
</P>
<P>
   In the Illinois town of Valmeyer, the suspect's family released
a statement expressing sorrow for the families of the slain
officers and ``our apologies to the nation as a whole, for the
trauma our son has caused. If I had but one wish, it would be that
this had never happened,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Oraiafo, D.C. General's trauma director, said Weston
was in critical condition and that his chances of survival were
``about 50-50.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Norma Smalls, who treated Weston on his arrival at the
hospital Friday afternoon, said the team of doctors attending the
suspect were ``still concerned that he will have problems with his
heart and lungs in the coming days and weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Oraiafo said Weston was ``communicative only for a very short
period of time'' as he arrived at the hospital, about a mile from
the Capitol, but soon lapsed into coma and had not regained
consciousness during extensive medical procedures, in part because
he was sedated.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday afternoon, Oraiafo said Weston, although in critical
condition, was ``much better'' than during the night.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders stressed that they hoped to keep the
Capitol, which has seen sporadic violence over its two centuries,
relatively open to visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, speaking during the time allotted for the Republicans'
weekly response to Clinton's radio address, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to emphasize that this building is the keystone of
freedom, that it is open to the people because it is the people's
building. And that no terrorist, no deranged person, no act of
violence will block us from preserving our freedom and from keeping
this building open to people from all over the world, and to every
American who wants to come and visit the center of their self
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Majority Whip DeLay, noting he had opposed several proposed
security measures in the past, including fencing the Capitol
grounds, said: ``We should not give in to terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texan said he assumed he was not the target of the attack
but that his office was just the first one at hand after the gunman
stormed past a Capitol entrance with a metal detector.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Kay Granger, R-Fort Worth, Texas, a member of the House
Oversight Committee, said Congress and its officers should move
slowly on increasing barriers to public access to the Capitol and
nearby legislative office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we don't rush to judgment to say immediately something
else has to occur,'' Granger said on C-SPAN.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and Clinton, in their formal statements, stressed the
personal loss to the Chestnut and Gibson families.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would ask all Americans to reflect for a moment on the human
elements of yesterday's tragedy,'' Clinton said in a statement
delivered at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington as he departed
for trip to Virginia, Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scripture says, `Greater love hath no man than this: that
he lay down his life for his friends,' '' Clinton said. Chestnut
and Gibson ``laid down their lives for their friends, their
co-workers, and their fellow citizens _ those whom they were sworn
to protect. In so doing, they saved many others from exposure to
lethal violence.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay told a news conference on the Capitol lawn that House
leaders are determined to provide fully for the Chestnut and Gibson
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will need nothing,'' DeLay vowed.

MILLS AND DAVIS FOR NO. 2
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

And KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ One week before the Cowboys' first
preseason games, the fight for the No. 2 receiver has been reduced
to two.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Ernie Mills and Billy Davis have emerged as the leading
candidates to start opposite Michael Irvin, distancing themselves
from precamp contenders Macey Brooks, Stepfret Williams and Jimmy
Oliver with solid camps.
</P>
<P>
   Mills, an eight-year veteran, signed with the Cowboys during the
off-season. He has the advantage of playing with Cowboys coach Chan
Gailey when both were with the Steelers and knows the new offense.
</P>
<P>
   Though Mills is coming off an 11-catch performance in Carolina
last season, he has looked as good as any receiver in camp and has
hands that rival Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a special teams star the past four seasons, is having
another strong training camp. Only Irvin, has caught more passes in
practice.
</P>
<P>
   However, Davis has only three career receptions _ though the
poor stats can be blamed more on a lack of opportunities than lack
of skills. &QL; 
SAFETY BATTLE BREAKDOWN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The competition at free safety has been altered as well.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Williams is no longer one of the combatants to join
cornerbacks Deion Sanders and Kevin Smith and strong safety Darren
Woodson in the starting lineup. He has been moved to cornerback
after the loss of Wendell Davis to a knee injury last week.
</P>
<P>
   That left six-year veteran George Teague and second-year guys
Omar Stoutmire and Kenny Wheaton as the main safety candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In assessing the skills of the free safeties, Gailey said Teague
offers veteran savvy, Stoutmire is best at run support and Wheaton
tops at pass defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all bring something to the table that's good,'' Gailey
said. ``But you got to find which one fits best for your scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   The early read on the battle has Stoutmire and Wheaton working
primarily with the first and second team, respectively _ leaving
the veteran Teague as the odd man out.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys secondary coach Mike Zimmer said much has yet to be
decided and that Teague will work with the first team this week in
practice.
</P>
<P>
   However, Teague has not even worked with the first-team nickel
defense, which employs Stoutmire, Wheaton, Williams, Smith, Sanders
and Woodson. &QL; 
LET'S GET PHYSICAL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys ended practice with live goal-line drills. Yes, that
means there was some real hitting.
</P>
<P>
   Even running back Emmitt Smith took a shot as he went into the
end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, there was some hitting going on,'' said Smith, who
scored twice during the drills.
</P>
<P>
   Said defensive coordinator Dave Campo: ``It's good we culminated
it with a little hitting. The guys got after it pretty good. And
the guys said let's do it every day.'' &QL; 
ON THE DEFENSIVE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before camp began, the Cowboys had a lot of questions on the
defensive line. So far, the unit has made the most progress, Gailey
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we've got some young players that are good, we've
got some veterans that are pretty good and I really like the way
they're being active on the football field,'' he said. ``But we've
got a long way to go with that group yet as well. I don't want to
say we've arrived.'' &QL; 
`NOTHING' WITH HARPER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys vice president Stephen Jones said he is not planning to
do anything with wide receiver Alvin Harper. ``Nothing is going
on,'' Jones said.

 &HT;    CONGRESSIONAL LEADER OWES HIS LIFE TO ``FINEST MAN THAT I HAVE
EVER KNOWN''
 &HT;    EDS: Memorial fund information is at bottom.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A new plaque on the desk of House Majority Leader
Tom DeLay caught the eye of a security officer a couple of days
ago: ``This could be the day,'' the plaque says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's there to remind me every day that this could be the day
that I meet my maker, or this could be the day that Jesus comes
back, and I better have my act together,'' DeLay explained. ``John
and I talked about that a little bit. I hope he took it to heart.''
</P>
<P>
   John Gibson was the Capitol Police officer on duty in DeLay's
offices Friday when a gunman burst into the U.S. Capitol and
fatally wounded Officer Jacob J. ``J.J.'' Chestnut a few feet from
the private door to DeLay's suite. Inside, Gibson yelled for
DeLay's staff to take cover as the gunman reportedly plunged
through the door and exchanged fire with Gibson. The wounded gunman
fell to the office floor, only a few feet from where the officer
collapsed behind his desk, dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was simply the finest man that I have ever known,'' DeLay
said Saturday of the officer who had spent three years as one of
his personal security guards. ``He deeply loved his job. And he
died so that my staff and the public and I could live.''
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by his family and staff Saturday, DeLay spoke in a
hoarse, breaking voice about losses that were, at the same time,
intensely personal and immensely public; about how two familiar
faces will not be seen again because they belonged to people who
died to save countless unfamiliar faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we wonder why these things happen to such good
people, because John Gibson and J.J. Chestnut are heroes for what
they did in defense of our nation's Capitol,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   For DeLay, a Texas Republican who became the No. 3 leader of the
House 3 1/2 years ago, Chestnut was the friendly and conscientious
officer who guarded the exterior door closest to the majority
whip's offices on the ground floor of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved this country. He loved this Capitol,'' DeLay said of
Chestnut, a Vietnam veteran who took the Capitol Police job after
retiring from the Air Force. ``He came here and requested and
fought for that spot in which he died. He really enjoyed his job.
He was one of the nicest, friendliest police officers on the force.
Every night when I left he would give me a hearty good night and
wish me well. The entire Capitol Hill community is going to miss
J.J.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, on the other hand, was a personal-security officer who
had become both a friend and a part of DeLay's family, sharing a
closeness that developed during long hours in the Capitol and
outside, travelling to speeches and campaign events, where one
familiar face can mean more than crowds of smiling admirers.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay spoke fondly of Gibson's Boston accent and the officer's
unsuccessful efforts to teach a Texas congressman about hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never understood hockey,'' said DeLay, who has represented a
district south of Houston for almost 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson ``desperately loved the Boston Red Sox....but most
importantly, he was a dedicated family man,'' said DeLay, who flew
to Houston Friday after the shooting to gather his own family _ his
wife, his daughter and new son-in-law and the DeLays' foster
daughter _ and bring them back to Washington that night.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson ``loved his two boys and his girl _ and he deeply, deeply
loved them _ and he talked about them alot,'' DeLay said. ``John
and I were alone alot, and he would always talk about his family.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay and his family visited the families of the slain officers
Saturday. Chestnut left a wife, five children and five
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told both families that I feel responsible for them,'' DeLay
said. ``We're going to take care of both families.''
</P>
<P>
   House leaders are working on a plan for providing for the
families, but DeLay was reluctant to discuss details Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're to make sure that these two families will not want for
anything, and not necessarily with the taxpayers' money'' he said.
``I feel personally responsible for these families, and I'm going
to make sure that their children who are still dependent upon them
are taken care of, and I'm going to make sure that their widows are
taken care of for the rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Gibson and J.J. Chestnut were real heroes, American
heroes, but that's little solace that either family could take from
this senseless tragedy,'' DeLay said. ``They did their duty, they
stood their ground to protect the Capitol and save people's lives,
and their sacrifice will not be forgotten.''

   SUSPECT'S HOMETOWN CAN BARELY RECALL HIM &QL;

<P>
   VALMEYER, Ill. _ Not many people in this tiny village, rebuilt
atop a bluff along the Mississippi River after the great flood of
1993, remember Russell Eugene Weston Jr.
</P>
<P>
   But the man accused of murdering two police officers Friday in a
gunfight at the U.S. Capitol is a native son.
</P>
<P>
   Those who do recognize the name don't recall Weston getting into
any noteworthy trouble or showing any indication he was capable of
such an aberrant act.
</P>
<P>
   It was only when he went to Montana after graduating from high
school that reports of troubling behavior began to surface.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors in the small town of Rimini, about 17 miles from the
capital of Helena, described Weston as a loner who often ranted
about everything from the government to a nearby satellite TV dish
he thought was spying on him. But none of them thought he was
dangerous or ever saw him with a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   He reportedly was hospitalized for more than a month in 1996
after writing threatening letters to government officials,
including some that caught the attention of the Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   People who saw him in Valmeyer have a hard time reconciling such
erratic and hostile actions with the Weston they knew.
</P>
<P>
   Weston's grandfather was the first of his family to move out
onto the bottom, where he was a section foreman for the railroad
company, said Harold Baum, who was the superintendent of Valmeyer's
schools and knows the Weston family well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rusty,'' as Baum called the accused gunman, attended Valmeyer
schools from the first grade until his graduation from high school
in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to say he was a typical child of the '70s in that he
rejected all society's values, everything that is except the money,
and had no work ethic,'' Baum says. ``Never worked to capacity. But
he never got into any trouble or anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Baum said Weston, who was overweight for his size, wore his hair
long and usually dressed in nondescript, baggy clothes. He was
quiet, didn't seem to date anyone and had an ``average'' amount of
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely wasn't what you would call a loner,'' Baum said.
</P>
<P>
   As for his family life, Baum said the Westons were a typically
``stable'' clan that did not appear to have any serious problems.
Baum and Weston's father, Russell Sr., attended school together.
</P>
<P>
   When he left high school, Weston and several other Valmeyer
grads moved to Montana, and for many years, whenever he came back
home, Weston would call on Baum for a visit. Baum said he never
heard anything from the young man to indicate he was mentally
disturbed or angry at anyone.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Weston had drifted back and forth between his
new home and his old hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Those who came into contact with him in Montana describe a
paranoid personality.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Moore owned a 9-foot television satellite dish and
recalled that Weston used to accuse him of aiming it at his cabin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would say, `That's pointing at my house, they're watching
me,''' Moore told The New York Times, adding that he preferred to
avoid Weston whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was a little leery,'' he said. ``He was never
violent, but you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore's wife, Mary, said Weston was fine as long as he was on
medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was off the medication, he was paranoid, you just
didn't know,'' Mary Moore said. ``His grandmother and his parents
used to check in on him with the lady next door.''
</P>
<P>
   Weston's relatives in Valmeyer were not commenting on their
son's behavior or mental state on Saturday. Local police officers
had the roads to the Westons' property sealed off and no one at the
house was answering the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, the Miami Herald reached Weston's father by
telephone. He told the paper he had last seen his son on Thursday
when they argued because the younger man had used a shotgun to kill
a number of cats.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shot a bunch of cats and I made him get out. I got mad,
told him, `You gonna have to leave,''' Weston Sr. told the
newspaper. The father also reportedly said that his son's ``mind
doesn't work real good.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the Westons' neighbors, who did not want her name used,
said she had never seen or heard anything about the family that
concerned her. They ``kept to themselves pretty much,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Valmeyer's residents expressed dismay at the attention
being focused on their community. The new town, laid out neatly on
top of the bluff above the old site, is struggling to put down
roots and forget about the devastating flood of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis M. Knobloch, the village administrator who led the effort
to move the entire town to higher ground, left piles of fliers at
several locations around town with a statement intended to play
down the connection between Valmeyer and Weston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Residents of the Village of Valmeyer share a Zip code with
Russell E. Weston,'' he wrote, ``but not much else. ... He was a
very quiet and reserved individual through his school days at
Community Unit School District No. 3 and Valmeyer High School.
After his graduation, most who knew him lost contact with him.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Neagle OK but Braves still lose
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Denny Neagle's good news: he pitched much better.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news: he lost anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle gave up just two runs and even had a third disallowed by
the umpiring crew Saturday night and still lost 4-1, if only
because he was outperformed by Pittsburgh's Francisco Cordova and a
grounder up the middle that became a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   It was still a one-run game with Dennis Martinez working in the
seventh when Turner Ward pinch-hit with two outs and Tony Womack on
second. Ward sent a two-strike grounder up the middle that second
baseman Tony Graffanino dove for and deflected. Andruw Jones
miscalculated his angle on the ball and as he appeared to jog in
pursuit, it rolled all the way to the wall, giving Ward an
inside-the-park home run and the Pirates a three-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   The shot was the Pirates' first pinch-hit inside-the-parker
since 1931.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle gave up seven hits and two runs but still lost for the
eighth time in 12 starts to drop his record to 10-9.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle got a huge break on his first pitch of the sixth inning,
which Kevin Young sent deep into right-center, above the
outstretched glove of Michael Tucker and, according to a television
replay, a foot over the fence for a homer. But second-base umpire
Gerry Davis claimed the ball hit the top of the fence, ruled the
ball in play and Young was forced to stop at second.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle got out of it, striking out Jose Guillen, retiring Marty
Martinez on a fly to center and, after hitting Keith Osik with a
1-2 pitch, striking out Lou Collier to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh took a 2-1 lead in the third, assisted by a timely
passed ball. With Womack on first with one out, Neagle's first
pitch to Jason Kendall was a fastball low and inside that catcher
Javy Lopez made a futile attempt to block.
</P>
<P>
   The ball wound up rolling into the Braves bullpen for Lopez's
sixth passed ball, sending Womack to second. Kendall than ran the
count to 3-1 before driving Womack in with a double to left-center.
The double was Kendall's sixth hit in 11 career at-bats (.545)
against Neagle.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates tied it 1-1 in the bottom of the second and a
floating Neagle change-up was the culprit. Neagle had center
fielder Martinez down 1-2 in the count but his next change-up
stayed in the strike zone and Martinez drove it over the left field
wall for his fourth homer of the season.

 &HT;    King inaugerated as SCLC chief
 &HT;    By Kimberly H. Byrd
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- With comparisons to courageous biblical prophets,
orders to seek God's guidance and a charge to reawaken the
conscience of America, Martin Luther King III walked away from his
inaugural celebration Saturday as president of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference prepared to keep his father's dream
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Andrew Young told him he didn't have to fill his
father's shoes, nor follow in the footsteps of the Rev. Joseph
Lowery or the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be like Joshua,'' Young said during the 4 1/2 hour celebration
that was reminiscent of an early-morning worship service. ``Stand
strong. And stand tall.''
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by his mother, siblings and warriors of the civil
rights struggle, King accepted the challenge and called on
churches, communities and leaders to help erase injustices, bring
equality to the classrooms and remove poverty from this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there are poor folks, we can't celebrate,'' King
said. ``We can observe. As long as women are still paid less than
men we can't celebrate. And as long as God's people aren't working
together, we can't celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowery, who served as president, of SCLC for 20 years passed the
mantle and the office to King.
</P>
<P>
   The inauguration was held at Jericho City of Praise in Landover,
MD. It was attended by politicians and civil rights leaders from
across the nation.

HALL OF FAME ALWAYS ONE OF SUTTON'S GOALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ As he stepped into the blazing sunlight,
Bill Russell felt a chill.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were honoring Don Sutton for his induction into
baseball's Hall of Fame at a ceremony last March at their training
camp in Vero Beach. Russell, then the Dodgers manager, was asked to
say a few words about his longtime teammate, but couldn't help
feeling like he had just booted a late-inning ground ball with
Sutton standing on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``May lightning not strike me for all the nice things I'm about
to say,'' Russell quipped under his breath before taking the
podium.
</P>
<P>
   But as Russell continued to speak, the graying heads of Sutton's
Dodger past began to relax. The laughter and the tears became
sincere.
</P>
<P>
   As Russell told the one about... the wind shifted and so did the
mood.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Sutton wasn't such a bad guy after all.
</P>
<P>
   In the 33 years since Sutton first arrived in Vero Beach by bus
from the Florida panhandle, few could say they liked or understood
the single-minded personality that helped him win 324 major-league
games.
</P>
<P>
   He was tough on teammates and found expressing emotion a sign of
weakness. But in that single afternoon, the past reconciled with
the present. He won't promise that he won't cry today during the
Hall of Fame acceptance speech he has been working on the past six
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was just something that day, I don't know, a real
appreciation for what he had done that never was there before,''
Russell said. ``It wasn't just the Hall of Fame. I guess you got a
chance to take a step back and look at someone who had done
something pretty special.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, 53, will be one of five inductees today in the
Cooperstown Class of '98. Larry Doby, Lee McPhail Jr., Joe Rogan
and George Davis are the others.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Dodgers Spanish language broadcaster Jaime Jarrin and
sportswriter Sam Lacy also will be inducted.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, now a broadcaster with the Atlanta Braves, joins former
manager and adversary Tom Lasorda, who was inducted last year.
Their clash of personalities during the late 1970s often
overshadowed their success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hall of Fame finally gave us something in common, but it
was more than that,'' Sutton said. ``Probably neither of us had the
right to be here in the first place. But we both worked hard to get
here. That is what should be remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton is the first to acknowledge that his greatest attributes
were perseverance and determination. He pitched 23 seasons in the
majors, including 14 with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   And though he is the club's career leader in victories (230),
games (534), starts (517), strikeouts (2,652) and shutouts (52),
Sutton rarely is cast in the same light as Dodgers greats Sandy
Koufax and Don Drysdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I wanted most was my team knowing that they could always
count on me,'' Sutton said. ``The results were rarely spectacular
or glorious, but I always gave my best.''
</P>
<P>
   His legacy was further blurred by playing with four other clubs,
including the Angels, with whom he won his 300th game on June 18,
1986, against the Texas Rangers.;jWKRHhVKkW-UYM

Status as underdog inspires U.S. squad
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATHENS, Greece _ They are here, this team of dreamers, to take on
the basketball world. To some, it's like sending the Boy Scouts to
do the Marines' job.
</P>
<P>
   The FIBA World Championship of Basketball begins here Wednesday
without NBA players on the U.S. team, without the hoopla those
international stars generate and, for many, without a lot of the
passion the sport's biggest tournament usually has.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the participants view this tournament as a can't-win
situation. Even if Yugoslavia or Greece or Puerto Rico or Australia
wins, their gold medals will no doubt have asterisks on them, they
believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest disappointment about them (NBA players) not coming
is that the more opportunity you get to play against the NBA's best
and experience that, the quicker you are to catch up (to that
level),'' Australia's Andrew Gaze said. ``It's a real shame on the
international scene that they're not here because I think that the
rest of the world really wants an opportunity to compete against
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, this U.S. team is in a no-lose situation. It is
not considered a favorite. Far from it. It will be hard pressed to
reach the medal round, although it received a favorable placement
in the groupings for early-round competition.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Tomjanovich faces perhaps his toughest coaching assignment
in trying to get the U.S. replacement players to believe they can
be as successful as the NBA players who were supposed to be here
before the labor dispute changed everything.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich likens this challenge to the one that faced his 1995
Rockets team, which went into the playoffs quietly and which
surprised the NBA by winning the title after finishing sixth in the
Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We read something in the paper over here where we're not
expected to win,'' Tomjanovich said. ``So that just gives you that
mentality of `us against the world.' We're the underdog and nobody
thinks we're going to do real good. I've been there many times. I'm
really looking forward to proving some of the doubters wrong along
the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's a big possibility, if we continue to grow and keep
our poise.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude is filtering through his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that everyone's against us just because we believe
we're the best basketball country in the world,'' point guard
Michael Hawkins said. ``So everyone's out to get us. I guess we're
the bad guys. So I think we just have to go in and keep on proving
that we're the best basketball country in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been getting e-mails from a reporter in Greece and he's
already said in the paper that the Greek team and the Yugoslavian
team really feel that they are going to win it because our NBA
players aren't playing for America. That's how they feel.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are two reasons the Americans cannot be dismissed in
this event, even though they will play against national teams that,
in some cases, have been together for years as opposed to the three
weeks of preparation the U.S. squad will have when the games begin.
</P>
<P>
   First, they have outstanding depth. Their best two or three
players might not match up with those of Yugoslavia or Australia.
But the further into the roster, the more the talent level slips
for most foreign teams. In America's case, the 10th, 11th and 12th
men might end up getting large amounts of quality playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wearing down opponents is something we'd like to do,''
Tomjanovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Second, players such as Hawkins, Jason Sasser, David Wood and
others seem committed to playing the sort of defense Tomjanovich
knows must make up for spotty shooting and offensive execution.
</P>
<P>
   Offense will go through dead spells, particularly when a team
has not been together long. But its defense is capable of carrying
the U.S. club.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really been great is the way they've taken to the
defense,'' Tomjanovich said. ``It's a part of their belief that
that's the only way we're going to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all our guys have been very good. There's a process we
go through in our minds because you go through the weapons that you
have and we're getting to know the guys more and trying to figure
out plans of attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Another asset is this team has taken on the personality of its
coach. Not so much on the court, although the defense will have to
be emphasized. But Wood said this is a team of solid citizens in
addition to good players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed at the quality of players on this team as far as
character,'' Wood said. ``I'm just surprised we have such a good
group of guys. Everyone on this team, you'd be happy to have them
sit down and eat a meal with your family, and you can't say that
about every team.''
</P>
<P>
   The questions remain: How good can this team be? Can it win the
gold medal?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to know because you don't see these other teams play
a lot,'' said Russ Granik, president of USA Basketball. ``I know
one of the teams we're concerned about is Yugoslavia, first and
foremost. Then Russia and Australia. And then I guess you have to
worry about the Greeks some, especially playing in Greece. But it's
not like we see anybody, other than maybe a couple of countries,
who are going to be easy wins for our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Warren Brown, executive director of USA Basketball:
``Australia is pretty good because most of those guys have played
together for a long time, plus it's pretty well-organized
professionally over there. Just playing together, I think they'd be
somebody to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   There are four groups with four countries each. The United
States is in Group C, along with Lithuania, Brazil and South Korea.
Compared to the other three groupings, it is not a strong foursome.
</P>
<P>
   On the first three days of the tournament, the United States
will play the other three teams in its group. After that
preliminary round, the top three finishers go on to the second
preliminary round and will play the three teams in Group D who
advanced.
</P>
<P>
   Group D includes Nigeria, Australia, Argentina and Spain. Only
Australia is considered medal-worthy from that group.
</P>
<P>
   That should give the U.S. team a good chance to reach the
quarterfinals, with the top four teams from the C-D and A-B
groupings reaching that round.
</P>
<P>
   After that, one loss means the gold medal is gone. The final
eight teams play the equivalent of an NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich is optimistic his team will be a force in the
tournament, although he understands it is not the NBA players
everybody with USA Basketball had hoped would represent the
country.
</P>
<P>
   How would these players stack up if they were an NBA team?
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys, on an NBA team, probably would be from the 10th to
the 12th guys,'' Tomjanovich said. ``And maybe a little higher.
Most of these guys _ in the right situation _ have a chance to be
in the NBA. But it depends on the situation. With this team, we
don't have guys where we can just call the play and get the ball in
their hands and something's going to happen. They have to do it on
teamwork. And they've done a real good job of that so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, eventually, the talent level would overtake things
(against NBA teams). But I'll say this: every game would be a game
because these guys will battle their butts off. We'd wind up
winning a couple of games. Just after a couple of weeks together,
we're starting to get some chemistry, feeding off of each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I've learned that there's no limit to what can happen when
a team pulls together and really believes in one another and plays
really hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Wells is a video scout for the Rockets and has been put in
charge of gathering information on the other countries in the
tournament. He says the style of play will be the biggest
adjustment for the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``European players, if they get any kind of look at the basket,
they will shoot the ball extremely well from any spot on the floor,
and that includes 7-footers,'' Wells said. ``They're not a real
driving-all-the-way-to-the-hoop style. It's not a real post-up
game. It's more finesse, although it's very physical on the weak
side.''
</P>
<P>
   And, after seeing many of the teams involved, Wells sees the
U.S. team fitting in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say definitely the U.S. is in the mix,'' he said. ``We
have a lot of guys who have played over here and know the European
style. I think we'll be all right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yugoslavia, probably is No. 1. Italy, Australia and definitely
Greece, with it being in Greece. That could be a 20-point
home-court advantage. And maybe Puerto Rico or Russia will be in
the hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans also think they have to factor in a few lost
points per game just because of the rules changes in international
basketball. Veterans of European play such as Wendell Alexis and
Wood remind the younger players of some of the twists. But it's not
easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of European things we need to work on, like in
one scrimmage, the ball hit the rim and went over the backboard,''
Wood said. ``I took the ball and stepped out of bounds to give it
to the ref, not realizing that that's not out of bounds in
international play. If it doesn't hit anything, it's not out of
bounds. Little things like that could hurt us if we're not
careful.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not so much the game the U.S. team must overcome. It's
the fear the players won't measure up to the standards Dream Teams
have established. But that doesn't mean the U.S. team is going to
be pacified with mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a lot more satisfying when the teams over here are
mad because the NBA players didn't come and we're not going to be
what they expect,'' Alexis said. ``After we beat them, they're
going to say, `What happened?' Then their fans are going to turn on
their own team. So we'll get a lot more satisfaction after we play
them.''

JARRIN HAS CARVED MONUMENTAL NICHE IN L.A.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The most influential baseball announcer in Los
Angeles doesn't wish a very pleasant good day to you wherever you
may be. Doesn't send outfielders a-waaaay back. Doesn't play with
deuces wild.
</P>
<P>
   The most influential baseball announcer in Los Angeles is never
introduced as a master of the English language.
</P>
<P>
   And the most influential baseball announcer in Los Angeles is
not in the National Baseball Hall of Fame. At least he isn't until
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   People call Jaime Jarrin the Vin Scully of Spanish broadcasting.
But, really, that understates Jarrin's contribution to the town and
to the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Scully brought a language to baseball. Jarrin brought a people.
</P>
<P>
   If your image of a Dodger Stadium crowd includes a lot of brown
faces _ it's estimated that Hispanics account for 35 percent of the
team's attendance, 10 times the figure in the 1960s _ Jarrin is one
big reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a comedian,'' said Mike Brito, the Dodgers scout famous
for his radar gun and Panama hat, naming just one appeal of
Jarrin's play-by-play. ``He makes you listen to the game like
you're in the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``He introduces you to the game. You feel like you're on the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   In nearly 40 years calling more than 6,000 Dodgers games on
KWKW-AM (1330), Jarrin has introduced millions to the game. And
that, he says, is what makes him especially proud of the honor
coming his way today, when he will be inducted into the Hall of
Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.. He's the 23rd broadcaster but only the
second Spanish-language announcer to receive the Ford C. Frick
Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to go in there because I'm Hispanic and because
it's time to fill a quota,'' Jarrin said in the press-box dining
room before a recent game. ``I want to go in because I made a
contribution to baseball. And I think I have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hispanics, in my book, the last five years, they've been the
one segment of the population supporting baseball more than any
other. They don't buy luxury suites. But they come twice or three
times a week, they always drink lots of beer, they always eat a
lot, they spend money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the problems the Angels have had is that they
didn't give much of their efforts to the Hispanic community. Now,
finally, they've opened their eyes and they're cultivating the
Hispanic market in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter O'Malley,'' Jarrin said, ``had a great vision. He was
the first to see the resources of the players in Latin America and
also to see the potential of the Hispanic market here.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is where Jarrin came in.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dodgers came to Los Angeles in 1958, they became the
first major-league team to regularly broadcast games in Spanish.
Jarrin joined in '59.
</P>
<P>
   He was with KWKW in '58 as news and music director, and had
broadcast boxing matches. When the boss asked Jarrin to share the
Dodgers microphone with Rene Cardenas, he politely declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never seen a baseball or a bat,'' explains Jarrin, who
is from Ecuador, no baseball hotbed.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrin agreed to spend a year observing, then stepped into the
booth full-time, first with Cardenas, then with Jose Garcia and
Rudy Hoyos, then with Cardenas again when the Nicaraguan rejoined
the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   In the '60s, Jarrin covered news as well, reporting from the
White House and Arlington National Ceremony after President
Kennedy's assassination, from New York during a papal visit, and
from London during Winston Churchill's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, he was named one of the 100 most influential Hispanics
in the United States by Hispanic Business magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In between, in the '80s, he became a familiar face to
English-speaking baseball fans as well when he served as Fernando
Valenzuela's interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in a nod to the dominant language, Jarrin plans to make
his Hall of Fame speech two-thirds in English, one-third in
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   He's got a long list of thank-yous to deliver as he joins the
late Buck Canel as the only Hispanics in the Hall. Jarrin overflows
with gratitude, in part because he almost wasn't walking around
today, having recovered from a 1990 auto accident in Vero Beach,
Fla., which he was given an 8 percent chance of surviving.
</P>
<P>
   He'll thank his wife, Blanca, and sons Jorge and Mauricio, for
putting up with a traveling man. (A third son, Jimmy, died of a
cerebral hemorrhage in 1988.)
</P>
<P>
   He'll thank dozens of players, especially Fernando, for their
contributions to the broadcaster's career.
</P>
<P>
   He'll thank the bosses who pushed him toward a sport he'd seen
only in photographs.
</P>
<P>
   And he'll thank Vin Scully, who was ``my trainer,'' who was kind
enough to telephone him with pregame notes in the days when Jarrin
broadcast recreations of Dodgers road games.
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Jarrin, the Vin Scully of Spanish broadcasting? Really,
they both should be flattered by the comparison. &QL;

Cowboys put new life in stale offense
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JODY GOLDSTEIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
It took a while _ longer than some expected _ but it appears that
defenses finally caught on.
</P>
<P>
   After all, there were few changes in the Cowboys' offense over
the years, few changes to the plays, even fewer to the personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Certain things were synonymous with the Cowboys: the I
formation, Emmitt Smith's power ground game and Troy Aikman's
precision passing.
</P>
<P>
   It was time defenses finally caught on.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you do the same things over and over and over, sometimes
it gets stale,'' Smith said. ``Sometimes you need to make a change.
We ran it a long time, obviously. It was about time for the league
to start catching on. They had a lot of tape to watch, a lot of
wins and a lot of losses as well to really see what we did
offensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the teams that played well against us, those
were the teams that the others teams were going to look at the
tapes of. They wanted to see what they did to slow us down, and
over the years they had a lot of tape to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Any secrets had long been uncovered. Opponents in recent years
weren't faced with the mental challenge of figuring out the
Cowboys, only the physical challenge of actually getting the job
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past couple of years, it was like ego _ we're going
to do this, you just have to stop it,'' Smith said. ``And they just
stopped it. They slowed it down. They stopped it. It caught up to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Chan Gailey into the picture.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' new coach learned the ropes from Ron Erhardt, who
twice led the New York Giants' offense to Super Bowl titles. He
also took Gailey to a Super Bowl while Erhardt was coordinating the
Pittsburgh Steelers' offense. Gailey coached the receivers in a
losing effort to the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey's offseason project has been to revamp this predictable
offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys will work in some shotgun, some five-receiver sets,
possibly even a trick play or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our best personnel is three wide receivers, one back and a
tight end, then you'll see us in that,'' Gailey said. ``If
(fullback) Daryl Johnston is playing great, then you'll see us in
the I-formation more. We have enough diversity to do whatever is
going best.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, that isn't the old system, which appeared on its final
legs. Only two years removed from a Super Bowl title, the 1997
Cowboys stars looked ready for retirement. The offense, which
ranked fifth in the league when the Cowboys earned their rings in
1995, plummeted to 20th last season.
</P>
<P>
   Smith scored just four touchdowns and had only two 100-yard
rushing games. In '95, he rushed for an NFL-record 25 touchdowns
and a league-leading 1,773 yards, 11 times rushing for 100 or more
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Irvin's nine touchdown receptions were only one shy of
his 10 in the regular season in 1995, but he had only four 100-yard
receiving games last year as compared with 11 in that last Super
Bowl season.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman was sacked 33 times, more than twice the number (14) in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to spread the ball around too much last year, and we
got away from doing what had been successful for us,'' Irvin said.
``You pay some people in the NFL a lot more than you pay other
people because they make plays and win games. I think I'm one of
those players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys could point fingers all day, but the point remains
that changes were needed.
</P>
<P>
   The passing game will look the most different with formations
and pass patterns that will spread the wealth. In the shotgun,
Aikman will stand farther behind his line, giving him more time to
make reads. There will be more moving pockets and more receivers
involved in the patterns.
</P>
<P>
   But Aikman has been a bit hesitant about change, arguing it
wasn't the system that was the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think those in the football-know know it wasn't the
system,'' Aikman said. ``But having said that, I am excited to
learn something new. What we did in the past was very successful
and it helped us win three Super Bowls. I don't think the old
system caused us problems; I think it was execution. If we don't
execute this system, then we're not going to be any better.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some misconceptions about the four-and five-receiver
sets, according to Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sometimes people hear four and five receivers and they
think sometimes that gives you more places to throw the ball,''
Aikman said. ``You still have the same number of people out running
the routes. For every receiver you put in, you have to take someone
out and you're not taking out an offensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't have that many more options than we've had in
other seasons, it's just a combination of routes. There's not a
route here that I haven't thrown at some point in time. It's just
how they put it all together. The combinations of the routes when
you start putting three or four receivers together with variations,
that's what changes the complexity of the patterns for a
quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are still determining who the primary targets will
be, though Irvin's role will remain largely unchanged. The
perennial Pro Bowler, however, may have a trick or two up his
sleeve. In at least one practice so far, Irvin got a chance to
catch a screen pass coming out of the backfield, an attempt to get
loose from double coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' Irvin said. ``I was really loving it until I saw
big Leon Lett out there. If it had been a real game, I might have
been in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith will be asked to make some changes in the running style
that has earned him four NFL rushing titles. In the new system,
Smith should get more time to pick his holes rather than the quick,
power-through-the-line style to which he has become accustomed. He
also should have more choices because of more zone blocking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to make some major adjustments,'' Smith said. ``I've
been accustomed to hitting things hard, straight down, running
behind my shoulder pads. But here, in this offense, you've got to
let things develop a little bit, then make your move.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Cowboys debut their new offense Friday in Dallas
against the Seattle Seahawks, they expect to find plenty of kinks.
They have five preseason games and a couple of scrimmages to get
the problems solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to go through some sloppy days,'' Aikman said.
``You don't want it to happen, but it's going to. You just have to
fight through. Anytime you're putting in something new like we are,
you have those types of days.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can all stay together offensively, battle together and
fight through the difficult times, but remain confident with one
another, we're going to be OK. Everyone believes in what we're
doing. We're excited about the offense. Now we just have to get
comfortable with it. That's what the next four weeks are for.''

Incaviglia, Candaele are hits with Astros' Class AAA team
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEIL HOHLFELD &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW ORLEANS _ In a corner of the New Orleans Zephyrs' clubhouse,
tucked away amid the lockers of young Astros farmhands dreaming of
playing in the majors one day, Pete Incaviglia has gone back to the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Incaviglia, 34, is on a minor-league team this summer for the
first time in his career. He went straight from Oklahoma State
University to the Texas Rangers in 1986, and for the next 12
seasons played for six teams in the majors and one in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But until this season, he had never been in the minors with the
exception of a three-game injury rehabilitation assignment last
season. What would possess someone who has played in a World Series
and has hit 206 homers in the big leagues to voluntarily spend the
hottest summer in recent memory playing in the minors?
</P>
<P>
   ``The obvious goal is to get back to the big leagues,'' said
Incaviglia, 34. ``But this has been a lot of fun. I'm enjoying
myself. I still love going out to compete and trying to win games.
I still feel like I can do a lot of things that could help a team.
When I quit having fun, that's when I'll get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the room, Casey Candaele, who was a teammate of
Incaviglia's in Houston in 1992 and has spent most of the past five
seasons in the minors, also refuses to give in. Candaele, 37, still
believes he can help a major-league team with his versatility,
competitiveness and guile.
</P>
<P>
   Candaele has been with five organizations in the past five
years. Players with less resiliency would have given up long ago,
but Candaele's zest for the game hasn't wavered. He was signed by
the Astros' organization in June after being released from the
Pittsburgh system and is hitting .265 in Class AAA this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other things I could do, but what's better?'' said
Candaele. ``I always play with the idea of going back (to the
majors.) If I didn't to that, this would be useless. And it doesn't
even matter what anybody else thinks. I've surprised them all
before.''
</P>
<P>
   For 2{ seasons from 1994-96, Candaele played at the Class AAA
level for three organizations and said he was told repeatedly by
those teams he didn't have a chance to get back to the majors.
Wrong. Candaele played for Cleveland parts of the past two seasons
and got into an American League playoff game with the Indians in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I signed with Buffalo (in the Indians system) they told
me it was only to play in Triple-A, that you've got no chance of
going to the big leagues,'' said Candaele. ``Those are always good
things to hear for a guy like me because it keeps you driving. Then
later that year, I'm in the playoffs. That was very satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've played in the big leagues and then you're down
here for a couple years, everybody's thinking, `Oh, he's done.'
Then you're sitting there in the dugout with the team that has the
best record in baseball, and that's a very satisfying feeling. Then
you go to the playoffs, and it's a terrific feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the two players, it would seem that Incaviglia has the better
chance of being called up to the Astros when rosters expand on
Sept. 1. There also is the chance that another team interested in a
veteran with power to come off the bench might ask about
Incaviglia.
</P>
<P>
   Incaviglia was released by Detroit in late April after he hit
.071 (1-for-14) in seven games. He signed with the Astros'
organization in mid-May and is hitting .319 with 21 home runs and
52 RBIs in 63 games. New Orleans manager John Tamargo loves having
Incaviglia around as his team battles for the Pacific Coast League
Eastern Division title, but he believes the veteran outfielder is
playing in the wrong league.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we all see here is that he could help a major-league club
somewhere down the road as a righthanded hitter off the bench, DH
or sometime left fielder,'' said Tamargo. ``What does he have to
prove in Triple-A? We know he can hit. The thing you look for in
this situation is bat speed. He continues to have bat speed, so you
know he's going to be able to hit. The quickest way to find out if
a guy is done or not is by his bat speed. And Inky is still
swinging with that bat speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker said that Incaviglia's
power threat likely would lead to his return to the majors,
probably with the Astros in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inky can fill a need most clubs have,'' said Hunsicker.
``Every time he walks to the plate, he has a change to hit the ball
out of the park. We don't have many guys who can come off the bench
and do that. Not many clubs do. But his track record has always
been as a power hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Incaviglia, however, is a changed man from the last time he was
in Houston. After bulking up to nearly 260 pounds last season when
he played in 53 games with Baltimore and the New York Yankees,
Incaviglia went on a strenuous winter program in which he lost
nearly 40 pounds yet retained his strength.
</P>
<P>
   The hard work over the winter was one reason that Incaviglia
decided to keep pursuing a job after he was released by Detroit. He
said the first time he contacted the Astros, they told him they had
no openings at the Class AAA level. Five days later, Incaviglia
said Hunsicker called back and asked if he would be interested in
playing for New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker only had to ask once.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost 40 pounds this winter, and it was probably the hardest
thing I've ever done in my life,'' said Incaviglia. ``I didn't want
that to go to waste. I'm sure a lot of people think that because I
came to the majors when I was 22, that I'm really old. I'm not old
by any means. I'm 34, and I feel like I'm still in the prime of my
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I keep myself in the shape I'm in, I still have another
four, five years in me. I think I've learned something. Last year,
I was really big. It was really the first time I felt tired and
slow, kind of bound up. When I got released by the Yankees last
year, I knew what I had to do if I wanted to keep playing. I went
on a rigorous cardio program with very little weightlifting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how great I feel. I feel strong. I'm always
in a better frame of mind. You know, when you're overweight, you
just don't feel good. I can't imagine playing this schedule in this
weather if I was as big as I used to be. I couldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another change in Incaviglia is his style of play. At New
Orleans, he already has drawn 25 walks in 230 at-bats. With the
Rangers in 1989, the free-swinging Incaviglia walked 32 times in
453 at-bats. In a game against Vancouver last week, Incaviglia
walked twice, including in the ninth inning after falling behind
0-2 in the count when his team trailed by two runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really has focused on going after good pitches,'' said
Tamargo. ``The part that hurts at times is that the umpires here
will call bad pitches strikes on him, and it frustrates him because
he's worked so hard to learn the strike zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Another change in Incaviglia's game is that he is running better
because of his weight loss. Incaviglia has nine steals in 11 tries
for New Orleans after stealing only 11 bases in the majors in eight
previous seasons and 30 overall in his career. He laughs when
someone raises the possibility of having a 20 homer-20 steal
season, but it's not as outlandish as it would first seem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think because I'm running better, I can do a lot more than
just go out and be an offensive player,'' said Incaviglia. ``I can
go out and run balls down in the gap. I'm stealing bases, scoring
easily on extra-base hits from first. It's funny, now I've got guys
holding me on at first base. That's a first. I'm not used to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly this season, though, Incaviglia has been getting used to
life in the minor leagues. At the time he came out of college, he
was the all-time home-run champion and went straight to the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm getting to see now all the things that everybody
else had to go through to get to the big leagues,'' said
Incaviglia. ``You have a new-found respect for those players and
the things they went through. But when you're playing the game,
it's baseball. It doesn't matter where you're playing at. The thing
you miss is all the first-class ballparks, treatment, flights,
hotels.''
</P>
<P>
   The possible end result _ a return trip to Houston _ makes the
rigorous schedule bearable for Incaviglia. When he was with the
Astros in 1992, he helped young players like Jeff Bagwell, Craig
Biggio, Shane Reynolds, Darryl Kile and Luis Gonzalez adjust to the
majors. Watching them in the playoffs last season was a kick for
Incaviglia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a pretty tight club when I was there,'' said
Incaviglia. ``We were up-and-coming, you could tell that they had
the makings of a good team with all the talent they had. It would
be great to suit up with those guys again, especially when they're
in a pennant race this time.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Incaviglia's immediate goal is to help New Orleans in
the pennant race. In addition to leading the team in homers and
ranking second in RBIs, Incaviglia continues to help young players
with their approach to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, the guy's got 13 years in the majors, so you listen
when he talks,'' said catcher Mitch Meluskey, one of the top
prospects at New Orleans. ``He's been on me about little stuff _
you know, getting there early, being on time, playing hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot different when you've got a guy telling you that
you've got what it takes to get there, but you've got to be
professional about it. You take it a little more seriously. He'll
get on you, too, if you're not doing it. He'll let you know if
you're not doing what you should.''
</P>
<P>
   Tamargo says the presence of Incaviglia and Candaele serves as a
constant reminder to younger players on how to reach the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's invaluable to bring guys in here to show the young
players how you have to go about your business to become a
big-league player,'' said Tamargo. ``It can work both ways in these
situations. You know, they could have come in here with a big ego
and messed things up for us. They didn't do that. They help all the
young guys and do whatever you ask of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, Casey's always got that smile on his face and has a good
time out on the field. He goes about his job just as hard as
anybody. He's really enthusiastic. You can't help but want to play
the game when you see a guy with his experience still having so
much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   In 13 of his 15 seasons in professional baseball, Candaele has
spent at least part of the year in the minors. Adjusting to life
one level below the majors is no big deal for him. For Incaviglia,
however, this has been a huge change, one that he has enjoyed
immensely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no picnic getting up at 5 a.m. and having to connect at a
couple different airports to get where you're going and then have
to play that night,'' said Incaviglia. ``That's what's rough.
That's what I missed when I was younger. But it's been a lot of fun
for me to experience this. I think in the long run, it'll make me a
better person to have done this.''

FLOYD ON STEADY COURSE, LEADS BY 3
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After the first day of the U.S. Senior Open, 23
players were within three strokes of one another at the top of the
leaderboard, and only one golfer was on the friendly side of par.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, it seemed unlikely that anyone would be
able to open a significant lead entering the last day of play. But
Raymond Floyd _ yes, he was the lone par-buster on Thursday _
stubbornly refused to be dragged down from behind. Despite a
sluggish Saturday afternoon in which he shot a 2-over-par round of
73, he will hold a three-stroke advantage over Hale Irwin, Isao
Aoki and Dave Stockton entering today's final round at Riviera
Country Club in Pacific Palisades.
</P>
<P>
   Merciless Riviera separated the chaff on Saturday _ and threw it
in every conceivable direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't expect to have a three-shot lead after shooting a
73,'' Floyd said a few minutes after three-putting No.18 to sit at
even par for the tournament (70-70-73_213).
</P>
<P>
   But over the last three days, there have been a lot of strange
occurrences on this course, which has exacted a heavy cost from
anyone who has tried to make up strokes quickly with risky shots.
</P>
<P>
   That should work in Floyd's favor today as he attempts to be
only the third wire-to-wire winner in the 19-year history of the
U.S. Senior Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raymond is playing very, very consistent. I played with him
the first two days, and he doesn't have too many things he's doing
wrong,'' said Stockton, a Southern California native and former USC
player who estimates he's played Riviera 300 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The gap) is not too much to overcome.... But, obviously,
there haven't been too many rounds in the 60s. We're going to have
to rely on him not playing quite as sharp and at least getting him
back to par.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd insists he did not play conservatively Saturday in an
effort to protect the two-stroke lead he held after two rounds, and
he vowed that nothing would change in the patient, persistent
approach he has employed since the first day of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if I get passed on the third hole (today),''
said Floyd, who won four majors on the PGA Tour (the last, the U.S.
Open, in '86) and has won three majors on the senior tour. ``If
somebody starts eagle, birdie, birdie, or whatever, I have to
continue playing the way I have played. I can't do anything any
differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``This golf course will not allow it.''
</P>
<P>
   His challengers _ including Tom Jenkins, Hugh Baiocchi and Roy
Vucinich, who are four strokes back _ might be wise to mull over
the point. And to heed its manifestation Saturday in a player named
Jack Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament's sentimental favorite was six strokes back when
the day began, but after he faltered early, he admitted that he
tried to make up strokes quickly. The result was disaster.
</P>
<P>
   It began when Nicklaus missed the fairway on No.3. ``I've never
had that bad a lie in the rough before,'' he said. After he took a
full swing with a pitching wedge and knocked the ball only 10 feet,
the trouble began to compound.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus went on to bogey the next three holes and wound up with
a 79 for the day _ 8 over for the tournament and well back in the
pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started trying to do some things I probably shouldn't have
done to try to make it up, and I made more mistakes,'' he said,
adding, ``Obviously, I shot myself out of the tournament the first
six holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, the senior tour's most prolific winner over the last two
years, appeared destined to do the same when he staggered to three
bogeys over his first five holes of the day. But he recovered
nicely on the back nine, collecting three birdies for an even-par
round of 71.
</P>
<P>
   And there he sits, a menacing specter in Floyd's immediate wake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to keep my nose above water. Fortunately, I'm
still floating,'' said Irwin, who says he feels his game has gotten
badly out of sync in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would spend the remainder of Saturday afternoon
``playing tourist,'' perhaps taking his wife for a walk on a beach
in hopes of getting his mind off this game. And, presumably, this
course.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd, with Irwin as a playing partner, will resume his
determined trudge toward a title today, just a few minutes after
noon. He'll bring up the rear of the field, of course. Three
purposeful strides in front.

STOCK RISING IN STOCKTON FAMILY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Forgive Dave Stockton if he drives around Riviera
Country Club today with all the concentration of the workers who
have been shuttling fans to and from the course all week. After
some 300 loops around the pristine grounds or countless trips to
and from the spectator parking lots, the mind tends to go on cruise
control.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing Stockton knows the kikuyu grass of Riviera
Country Club like the shuttle operators now do Brentwood's back
roads, having played the course as a Southern California junior
golfer, a Southern Cal student and a PGA Tour pro (indeed, he won
the Los Angeles Open here in 1974).
</P>
<P>
   Stockton will rely on muscle memory to carry him through those
moments during today's final round of the U.S. Senior Open when his
mind invariably starts wandering off all the way to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens when you're trying to win your 26th title on
the PGA or Senior PGA circuits at the same time your firstborn and
namesake will be vying for his first PGA victory.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine-year-old Dave Jr. set the wheels of distraction in
motion Saturday by shooting a 5-under-par 66 at the CVS Charity
Classic at Pleasant Valley Country Club to grab a share of the
third-round lead with Willie Wood. Dave Sr., when not otherwise
engaged in obtaining updates on his son's round, cobbled together a
round of 2-over-par 73 at Riviera to remain three shots behind
leader Raymond Floyd heading into the last round of the Senior PGA
Tour's final major of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be interesting to see how he copes (today),
thinking about Junior and thinking about what he has to do,'' said
Cathy Stockton, the wife/mother of the Daves.
</P>
<P>
   A Stockton sweep would be the stuff of history. A father and son
never have won professional golf events in the U.S. on the same
week or, for that matter, captured the same tournament in different
decades. Dave Sr., the 1971 titlist at Pleasant Valley Country Club
when the PGA Tour stop was known as the Massachusetts Classic,
would love it if he and Junior were the first but he's not going to
get greedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If only one of us (can) win, I hope it's Junior because he
needs it,'' said Dave Sr., sounding at once paternal and pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
   The son is grinding a lot harder than his father these days,
having lost his exempt status on the PGA Tour this year after
finishing 146th on the money list in 1997. A win would give Dave
Jr. a two-year Tour dispensation and $270,000 to put aside for the
care and spoiling of his firstborn _ and his mother and father's
first grandchild. The baby girl is due in November.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Stockton's golfing rebirth, meantime, continues apace.
</P>
<P>
   The 56-year-old has two second-place finishes this season and is
fifth on the money list with $703,453. Since joining the Senior PGA
Tour in 1991, Stockton has won $7.34 million, or $6 million more
than he did in 27 years on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton's most successful season on the regular circuit came in
Junior's sixth year, in 1974, when he won three tournaments, the
L.A. Open among them. While rummaging around his ranch in Mentone
last week, Stockton came across the putter he had used that year to
tame Riviera's greens.
</P>
<P>
   Embracing it like a long-lost friend, Stockton spent hours
re-acquainting himself with it on the practice green. He has
carried it in his bag all week and hasn't had a three-putt yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week I put two or three really good days into working
with my putting because basically that is what has been driving me
nuts,'' Stockton said. ``And this week so far it has been pretty
darn good.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a considerable gap in Stockton's resume, suggesting he
went through some lean times in the 1980s. He may have barely
registered on the PGA Tour's radar (read: the money list) but what
he gained in that time was priceless. That was the decade he
devoted to being a dad (and mentor) to Dave Jr. and his other son
Ronnie, 27, who is playing golf on the Nike Tour. The youngest
Stockton missed the cut at this week's event; otherwise, the family
would be staring at one heckuva trifecta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a lot of corporate outings in those years so I could
spend more time with my kids,'' Dave Sr. said. ``When I look back
on it, I think I could have won a helluva lot more tournaments if I
had worked on my game. But having that time with my kids was
important.''
</P>
<P>
   All these years later, Dave Sr.'s family values have created
quite the family conflict for the clan's matriarch. Cathy Stockton
is thrilled for her husband and her son, don't get her wrong. But
she'll rest a lot easier when this day is done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be walking the course with Dave,'' she said Saturday,
``but my heart and a lot of my thoughts are going to be with Junior
because... he hasn't done it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathy remembers what it was like, wondering when or if that
first win would ever come. She and Dave Sr. found out midway
through his fourth season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the Colonial National Invitation in 1967,'' Cathy said.
``We drove out of town with our $23,000 winner's check thinking we
were millionaires.''
</P>
<P>
   They could feel better than that at the end of today. &QL;

ROYALS' SALE IS BACK ON FRONT BURNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY CHARLES R.T. CRUMPLEY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   The sale process for the Kansas City
Royals is heating up again, and a couple of insiders are suggesting
that Royals directors could make a decision within a couple weeks.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's still a toss-up as to what the Royals directors will
decide. The three most likely possibilities, according to various
insiders: selling the team to a group led by Miles Prentice;
selling to a group led by Lamar Hunt and Western Resources Inc.; or
spiking the sale and starting anew next year.
</P>
<P>
   It appears now that the most remote possibilities include
selling the team to a mystery buyer or to a group led by Bobby and
George Brett. The Bretts are conceding as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're a real long shot,'' said Bobby Brett. ``There
has been virtually no talk with J.P. Morgan (the investment banker
running the sale) or the Royals in the past several weeks, and no
talks are planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``And as the process has developed and we've gathered more
information about the Royals, it's very difficult to meet the price
and terms,'' said Brett.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals announced a month ago they were postponing the sale
of the team, and the drawn-out process plunged into what one bidder
called a cooling-off period.
</P>
<P>
   But now the talks are expected to heat up because would-be
buyers and sellers have returned from vacation, or will be soon.
</P>
<P>
   Prentice's bid appears to have good prospects, according to
several sources, who asked not to be identified because they have
signed confidentiality agreements that muzzle them from talking
about most aspects of the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Prentice, a New York lawyer and minor-league team owner,
submitted what has been reported as the highest bid. And he has
impressed the Royals and the investment bankers with what some
described as professionalism and persistence.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Royals have made it clear that his bid
needs to be shored up, and he particularly lacks big-name Kansas
Citians in his group. A bigger local presence would make the Royals
more comfortable about selling the team to him.
</P>
<P>
   Prentice is scheduled to visit Kansas City next week with an aim
of getting big-name Kansas Citians signed up, said David Westbrook,
Prentice's public relations counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among those involved in his local investment portfolio you
will find familiar names who have significant economic and
political resourcefulness,'' said Westbrook.
</P>
<P>
   Also considered a front runner is the Hunt-Western Resources
bid. Hunt, as the longtime owner of the Kansas City Chiefs, and
Western Resources, the owner of utility companies in this region,
were considered to form a power team that could buy and rescue the
Royals when they announced their partnership last spring.
</P>
<P>
   However, their bid reportedly is lower than Prentice's. One
person close to the Hunt-Western Resources group said the bid was
for less than $50 million, although that was neither confirmed nor
denied by others in the group. And the Hunt group has balked about
significantly raising its bid.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Connolly, the president of Hunt Sports Group, has said his
group may ask wealthy individuals, including Kansas Citians, if
they would be interested in investing money as partners. That
signaled that the Hunt group may raise its bid.
</P>
<P>
   However, Connolly said this week the plan has not gotten far.
</P>
<P>
   There's always the possibility that the Royals could postpone
the sale, presumably for a year, if the directors continue to be
disappointed with the bids.
</P>
<P>
   But Dean Davison, the public relations spokesman for the Royals
directors, said: ``There's optimism that the board will be
successful in finding a new owner this year who'll keep the team in
Kansas City and that we will deliver an incredible benefit to
charity.''
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from the sale of the baseball team will go to
charities.
</P>
<P>
   Even though there's been a cooling off period in the last month,
there has been a bit of behind-the-scenes maneuvering and spin
doctoring.
</P>
<P>
   For example, top executives with Western Resources _ allied with
Hunt _ flew to New York on June 29 and met with Prentice, sources
from both groups confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   There was a suggestion that the meeting was designed partly to
see if Prentice would be interested in joining forces with the
Hunt-Western Resources group, but that didn't go far. One described
it as a cautious meeting; another said that nothing came of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Bretts have talked in the past with the Hunt
group and more recently with Prentice with the idea of joining
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the Hunt group said they're cool to the idea of
taking on the Bretts. Prentice said two weeks ago that he'd like to
have George Brett in some capacity, but not necessarily Bobby
Brett.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Brett said that was all right with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was talk,'' said Bobby Brett. ``There's no talks going
on right now. Does that mean the door's closed? No, the door's
never closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we optimistic anything's going to come of it? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Most would-be buyers of the Royals, or representatives for them,
have privately complained about the $75 million asking price for
the baseball team. Because the Royals reportedly will lose about
$10 million this year _ one source said the Royals have lost $166
million over the team's life _ the asking price is far too high,
they claim.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, they complain about the terms of the deal. In an
unusual twist, the sale calls for the buyer to pay taxes. Some
estimate the tax bill will total $20 million. That would
effectively boost the price to $95 million.
</P>
<P>
   And because the buyer must sign an agreement to keep the team in
Kansas City through 2015, the buyer would have no leverage. For
example, he could not threaten to move the team unless taxpayers
paid for a new stadium or for major improvements to the existing
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals rationale is that the $75 million price is far below
the $155 million imputed sale price of the two recent expansion
teams, the Devil Rays and the Diamondbacks. J.P. Morgan suggested
that $75 million was a fair price.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the Royals were disappointed with the bids they
received last spring. Further negotiations between the Royals and
some bidders grew tense and argumentative at times, according to
some sources.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Herman, the Royals president, announced on June 25 that the
Royals were postponing the sale. They had hoped to announce a
winning bidder by July 6, but reset that self-imposed deadline to
September.
</P>
<P>
   After the announcement, several participants _ such as Herman,
Bobby Brett and Prentice _ went on vacation, and the cooling
off-period began.
</P>
<P>
   Herman, who returned earlier this week from Norway and France,
is expected to intensify the negotiations.

MASKED MAGICIAN EXPOSES TRICKS OF TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
 MAGICIAN-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY JAMES A. FUSSELL  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   The world of illusion is mired in a
magical snit, a controversy so rancorous it has magicians
nationwide pulling lawsuits out of their hats.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The issue? The future of magic.
</P>
<P>
   The subject? A silent performer in a creepy black mask who some
say is ruining it.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, two area men are smack in the middle of the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other magicians, Roger Miller of Kansas and David
Sandy of Missouri are miffed at that turncoat performer, the Masked
Magician, who has shown how classic illusions are performed on
three highly rated ``Magic's Secrets Revealed'' specials on Fox TV.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Masked Magician nor his attorney could be reached
for comment. A Fox spokesman said the network does not comment on
pending litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences love the Masked Magician. His colleagues, who take an
oath not to reveal magic's secrets, would just as soon saw him in
half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got $10,000 worth of props that I can no longer use
because (they've) been exposed on national TV,'' Sandy said this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Added Miller: ``Not only don't I think it's the right thing for
him to do, I don't think he has the right to do it. Especially when
it financially damages his colleagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a part-time magician, is treasurer of the St.
Louis-based International Brotherhood of Magicians. Professional
illusionist Sandy is publicity director. It's the largest magic
group, with more than 15,000 members worldwide, including David
Copperfield, Siegfried &AMP; Roy and Lance Burton.
</P>
<P>
   As treasurer, Miller oversees its ``action fund,'' which
promotes magic and combats the negative effects of those who expose
its secrets, including a few authors and Web-site hosts. A
contributor from Vermont enclosed a check for $50 with this note:
``If that guy is so proud of himself why is he hiding behind a
mask? Not only is it reprehensible to expose the secrets of
magic...he deprives his audience of the joys of being mystified and
entertained. He should be ashamed of himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to be kind to somebody who has betrayed his craft,''
he said. ``It would be like selling secrets of some business
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, such as magician Robert Croskery of Cincinnati, go even
further. Last week Croskery filed a lawsuit against the Masked
Magician and Fox. Other illusionists are doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Levy, professor at the University of Kansas School of
Law, said the lawsuits have a chance of succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a possibility that there would be a claim
there if the circumstances are right for some sort of protected
property interest or trade secret,'' on the part of the magician,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy is spending more than $13,000 on new illusions to replace
those exposed on the Fox specials. He said he knows of at least
three lawsuits including Croskery's that have been filed, with many
more likely.
</P>
<P>
   He flew to Las Vegas recently to consult with the attorney of
world-renowned illusionist Andre Kole, who also is suing.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the illusions that Andre Kole does in his show was
exposed in the first special in November. And Andre, just as a
test, kept the illusion in his show to see what kind of response it
got. As he was doing the illusion he could see people leaning
toward one another, whispering...`Oh, I saw this on
television.'...After less than two weeks of touring with it, he had
to pull it back out because people were coming up after the show
and saying `Hey, we saw that was done on TV!' It was useless to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   That particular illusion, called the Zig Zag Lady _ in which a
woman is sawed into three pieces _ ``is one that I've lost, too,''
Sandy added.
</P>
<P>
   So just who is this Masked Magician?
</P>
<P>
   While no one has admitted to being the controversial performer,
he has purportedly been named on the TV show ``Extra,'' on
magic-organization Web sites and in at least one lawsuit as Las
Vegas performer Leonard Montano, aka ``Valentino.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy and others said they also recognized Montano's voice when
the Masked Magician appeared on ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show.'' His
speech was supposed to be scrambled, but, due to a technical
glitch, it was not for at least 25 seconds. When correspondents
from ``Extra'' asked Montano whether he was the Masked Magician, he
gave them a ``no comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy has /{plenty/} of comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy sold out,'' he said. ``He was working an afternoon
show in Vegas and, in my opinion, a big, tempting offer came along
and he took it....And now he's capitalizing on all this....I just
can't /{imagine/} what he was thinking when he made the decision to
sell out his peers.''
</P>
<P>
   In a /{TV Guide/} interview, Mike Darnell, Fox senior vice
president, explained where he got the idea for the specials:
``Everyone who goes to a magic show walks out thinking, `How'd they
do that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   So, Darnell figured, why not show them? After a search, he
persuaded one magician to take the job.
</P>
<P>
   Fox reportedly is planning a fourth special for the fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, magicians can only wonder whose illusion will
be a target next.

DOCTOR IS ORDERED ACQUITTED OF MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   In a case that had raised concerns among
physicians nationwide, the Kansas Court of Appeals on Friday
ordered the acquittal of a doctor convicted in 1996 of murdering
one patient and attempting to murder another.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The three-judge panel ruled there was insufficient evidence to
convict L. Stan Naramore, a 53-year-old osteopathic physician who
treated the two seriously ill patients while working in the small
northwest Kansas town of St. Francis in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm free this morning. I'm a free man,'' Naramore said in a
telephone interview from his home in Parsons, Kan. ``I'm grateful
for the wisdom and courage of the appellate court.''
</P>
<P>
   After a trial in St. Francis, Naramore was sentenced to five to
20 years in prison. He was paroled on his first try in January 1997
after serving about a year in the maximum-security El Dorado
Correctional Facility.
</P>
<P>
   Naramore's appeal was championed by physicians across the
country who saw it as a test of whether doctors could be held
criminally liable for care provided to terminally ill patients,
even when they considered that care medically appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That big cloud of uncertainty (about criminal liability) has
been removed,'' said Harold Riehm, executive director of the Kansas
Association of Osteopathic Medicine. ``I feel my faith has been
restored in the judicial system in Kansas.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said it is unusual for the Kansas Appeals Court to
overturn a murder conviction without ordering a new trial. The
court's decision amounts to a finding of not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Horsch, a spokeswoman for Kansas Attorney General Carla
Stovall, called the judges' ruling disappointing. The attorney
general's office is reviewing whether to appeal the decision to the
state Supreme Court, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Naramore's lawyer, Kurt Kerns of Wichita, said an appeal by the
attorney general ``would be kind of silly to try.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it's legally possible, but I think the chances that
a higher court would review the same facts and come to a different
conclusion are unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   Naramore was accused of attempting a mercy killing of Ruth
Leach, a 78-year-old terminal cancer patient, by giving her an
overdose of pain medications.
</P>
<P>
   And he was charged with murdering Chris Willt, an 81-year-old
man suffering from diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity by
prematurely stopping resuscitation in the emergency room after he
suffered an apparent stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Naramore has insisted he did not intend to kill either patient;
he simply gave Leach sufficient medication to relieve her pain, and
he stopped efforts to revive Willt only after they became futile.
</P>
<P>
   At Naramore's trial, the prosecution presented physician experts
who supported the allegations against him.
</P>
<P>
   But the defense also had experts who said the drug doses
Naramore gave Leach were far lower than what a doctor would use to
deliberately kill someone. They described Naramore's treatment of
Willt as a heroic effort to save a man who probably had suffered a
massive stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found no case from another jurisdiction where a
physician has been charged with and convicted of homicide with a
specific intent to kill for the exercise of professional
judgment,'' the Appeals Court wrote in its decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing close to a medical consensus that Dr.
Naramore's actions were homicidal. In fact, there was extremely
strong testimony to the contrary,'' the judges said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find that no rational jury could find criminal intent and
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt based on the record here.''
</P>
<P>
   Naramore's arrest, trial and conviction led to the virtual
disintegration of his personal and professional life. He lost his
medical license. He became impoverished. And he and his wife
divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Since his parole, he has become engaged. He remains unemployed
and lives in Parsons with his fiancee.
</P>
<P>
   Naramore said he spends his time singing in a local church
choir, attending a Bible study group and ``reading a lot and
praying a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors had feared that a verdict against Naramore would
have a chilling effect on the use of drugs to relieve the suffering
of dying patients in extreme pain.
</P>
<P>
   Medical ethics permit doctors to give patients doses of pain
drugs that might shorten their lives if the intent is to relieve
pain and not to hasten death.
</P>
<P>
   Riehm said a number of worried physicians have told him they
have been in situations similar to the one Naramore faced with Ruth
Leach.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said: `I did what I needed to do, but in the back of my
mind I thought this is what Stan Naramore did and see what happened
to him,' '' Riehm said.
</P>
<P>
   Naramore has asked the Kansas State Board of Healing Arts to
reinstate his medical license.
</P>
<P>
   Healing Arts Board Executive Director Larry Buening said the
board likely will review his application in the next 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Naramore's conviction has been overturned, the board
still has concerns that he may have failed to notify other states
of his legal problems when he applied or renewed medical licenses
there, Buening said.
</P>
<P>
   Naramore said he wants to remain in Kansas and practice medicine
again in a small town in need of a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping the phone will start ringing, and they will call
me,'' he said. ``I love this state and I love the practice of
medicine.''

 JAMES A. FUSSELL  
 c. 1998 The Kansas City Star   Question of the week, baby boomers:
Does Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones make you feel old or young?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today, July 26, the legendary rocker and spandex-sporting leader
of perennial super group the Rolling Stones turns 55.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing wrong with turning 55, mind you. It's a respectable age.
It's just that, well, it's a bit long in the tooth for a rock 'n'
roll star.
</P>
<P>
   You've heard the jokes. A rolling stone may gather no moss, but
nobody said anything about cobwebs. Not to say that Jagger's old,
but he could have gone to school with the Hansons' grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense Jagger can make you feel ancient. The 1960s have
turned to the '90s, and the late, late '90s at that. No more
Beatles. No more Beach Boys. Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim
Morrison have all been dead for more than 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, look at Jagger go! So what if you haven't
heard of one of the artists on Billboard's Top 10 and you think
Counting Crows is something you do when you're bored. None of it
matters! Mick Jagger is still a huge, worldwide rock star, the
Rolling Stones are still releasing albums, going on tour and
selling out amphitheaters from L.A. to London!
</P>
<P>
   And as long as they are _ as long as Jagger can manage to dance
and prance and mug and preen, as long as young fans still scream at
his concerts and reach out for his hand _ then maybe, just maybe,
millions of boomers can close their eyes and, at least for a
moment, hold fast to a piece of their youth.
</P>
<P>
   Just listen to Paul Masterson, an 51-year-old investment banker
from Kansas City, Mo., who was 18 when Mick and the boys scored
their first No. 1 hit in 1965 with, ``I Can't Get No
Satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Mick Jagger,'' Masterson said. ``He makes me feel
young. Let's face it, most important parts of my youth are long
gone. But I was flipping around on the TV the other day and there
was Mick, jumping around like he was 25. I loved it. I hope he goes
till he's 80!''
</P>
<P>
   Other active performers who could qualify for their discount
cards from the American Association of Retired Persons: Willie
Nelson, 65; Kris Kristofferson, 61; Tina Turner, 59; Grace Slick,
58; Ringo Starr, 58; Bob Dylan, 57; Paul McCartney, 56; George
Harrison, 55; Richie Havens, 57; Mike Love, 57; Brian Wilson, 56;
Paul Simon, 55; Art Garfunkle, 55; Joni Mitchell, 54; Jimmy Page,
54; and even (gasp) Alice Cooper, 52.

FOREIGN LEGION STAYING CLOSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Senior PGA Tour's strong international
contingent will send three top-10 entries into today's closing
round at Riviera Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's Isao Aoki, who shot a senior tour-record round of 60
last year, shares second place at 3-over-par 216. South Africa's
Hugh Baiocchi shares fifth at 217 and Vicente Fernandez shares
eighth at 218.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Maria Canizares of Spain and English-born, Scottish-raised
Brian Barnes both missed the top 10 by a stroke at 219 _ Barnes
misfiring with a double-bogey on No.18.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody is trying to catch Raymond Floyd (even-par 213), who
is attempting to become the third player in the tournament's
19-year history to win by leading after every round.
</P>
<P>
   Aoki, the closest of the top five foreign challengers, who have
won a combined $2.6 million and two events this year, prescribes
the tactic Floyd has used successfully for three rounds:
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be really patient,'' Aoki said after shooting
2-over 73 on Saturday. ``I have to be calm, stick to my golf game
and keep it in the fairway. It's up in the air for (today). It's
going to be interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Faces in the crowd: Verdugo Hills Golf Course teaching pro
Donnie Saatzer, working the merchandise tent alongside the first
fairway, won't soon forget one of his Friday customers. It was an
out-of-state competitor who had just missed the cut and came in
carrying a big chunk of kikuyu grass, saying ``I'm taking this home
_ the guys back there will never believe this.''
</P>
<P>
   Yikes and yikes again: Qualifier Doyle Corbett took an
octuple-bogey 12 on the par-4 second hole en route to an 87 that
left him 11 strokes over the cut score on Friday. Senior tour
regular Larry Ziegler fared even worse for his 12 on Saturday.
Ziegler signed for the 12 on No.18, but he actually shot only nine
on the hole. The incorrect signing disqualified him and cost him a
minimum of $3,613, which is what today's last-place professional
finisher will earn.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly speaking: Frank Connor, who equaled Hale Irwin's
tournament low with a 3-under-par round of 68 Saturday, hit 13 of
14 fairways while tripling his combined two birdies of the first
two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, that helps,'' Connor said of his accuracy off the
tee.
</P>
<P>
   The Austrian-born Texan, seeking his first senior tour victory,
enters the closing round seven strokes off the lead and with the
appreciation of one of sports' all-time greats.
</P>
<P>
   As Conner was leaving the scoring room, baseball Hall of Famer
and big-time golf fan Ernie Banks came up and said, ``I followed
you around all day and just wanted to tell you what a pleasure it
is to watch you.''
</P>
<P>
   Words to live by: After dropping out of contention with a round
of 8-over-par 79 _ the worst score hehW.HY;I.H.Z$JhK-YH9% &QC; I

VUCINICH ENJOYING HIS COMING-OUT TOURNEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Fifty-four holes completed, Roy Vucinich remains
as big a mystery to his fellow golfers as the fans attending this
week's U.S. Senior Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't pronounce his name,'' said Hale Irwin, perhaps the
biggest name on the senior tour.
</P>
<P>
   It's pronounced View-sin-itch, Hale, and he doesn't expect you
to know that.
</P>
<P>
   Or anyone else. When he got paired with tourney leader Raymond
Floyd for Saturday's third round at Riviera Country Club, Vucinich
hustled down to the practice tee to introduce himself to Floyd. He
wanted to avoid the awkwardness of a formal introduction on the
first tee in front of a full gallery.
</P>
<P>
   These types of moments are becoming a daily routine for
Vucinich, the club pro at Allegheny Country Club in Sewickley, Pa.,
for 26 years. He doesn't expect the Irwins, Floyds or Stocktons of
the tour to recognize him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a nobody in the golfing world,'' Vucinich said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but the ``nobody'' shot 71s the first two days and was
paired with Floyd on Saturday in the day's final group, just two
strokes behind the leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was definitely more nervous today playing with Raymond
Floyd,'' Vucinich said. ``My concerns were there not to make a fool
of myself. It was tough last night, I had a hard time getting back
to sleep. At one time, I thought `What am I doing here?'''
</P>
<P>
   Vucinich stumbled a bit, shooting a four-over-par 75. But it was
hardly a meltdown. Floyd did only marginally better, shooting a 73,
and Vucinich is only four shots back entering today's final round.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of lamenting his six bogeys Saturday, Vucinich
demonstrated that he is not a tour regular, by remaining positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fabulous. I really enjoyed playing with Raymond
Floyd,'' he said. ``If that's my bad score, I'll be happy with
that. I'm here to enjoy the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Vucinich is not even a regular member of the senior tour,
failing at qualifying school last year and planning to make another
attempt next year. To get into this tournament, Vucinich had to win
a qualifying tournament three weeks ago in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   But this is what makes Vucinich such an endearing figure around
Riviera. He's the Open's version of Walter Mitty. Everything from
signing autographs to being interviewed is a new experience for
him.
</P>
<P>
   This week should take care of his anonymity, however, at least
among his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first round, you say `Who's that?''' Irwin said.
``After the second round, you say you better find something out
about him. After the third round, you say `Let's figure out how to
spell his name.'''
</P>
<P>
   Vucinich did accomplish part of his mission Saturday, by
managing not to embarrass himself around Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often, as you all know, you get someone in that position and
they don't handle it well,'' Floyd said. ``He hung in there. On the
backside, he didn't drive the ball very well at all. And he kept
putting the scores up. That is impressive when a player is capable
of doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   As well as Vucinich played, his life has not changed much. While
the other players relax or go to the movies each night, he calls
his golf course, just to make sure things are running smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go back to work, I will start Tuesday morning. We have
a ladies event and my lessons begin at 9 a.m. 'till noon,''
Vucinich said. ``Then again from 1 'till about 7. Just like things
haven't changed. I think right now I probably have the best of both
worlds.''

CAPITOL REOPENS, SUSPECT CHARGED IN SHOOTING TWO OFFICERS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for complete writethru; suspect formally charged, victim
released)   By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Capitol reopened for the people's business
as doctors labored to save the life of the man who was charged on
Saturday with shooting two police officers to death in a terrifying
bout of violence in the tourist season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shooting at the United States Capitol yesterday was a
moment of savagery at the front door of American civilization,''
President Clinton said of the Friday gunfight just beyond a
security checkpoint at a public entrance to the nation's lawmaking
forum.
</P>
<P>
   A summer ritual became a demonstration of national resolve this
morning as visitors in shorts and sneakers gingerly approached the
gleaming, white domed building once more. They were politely met by
Capitol guards, their badges tinged in black, who bolstered public
checkpoints that try to balance the needs of openness and wariness
in a democracy liberally tolerant of the individual's right to bear
arms.
</P>
<P>
   The suspected gunman, Russell Eugene Weston Jr., was reported in
critical condition after surgery for gunshot wounds in the chest,
back, left thigh and right arm. Capitol Police shot him down after
he made his short, deadly foray amid the crowds of people visiting
the nation's centerpiece of law and order. Doctors at D.C. General
Hospital rated Weston's chances of survival at 50-50 after four
hours of surgery and heavy bleeding that left him heavily sedated
and thus far beyond questioning by investigators.
</P>
<P>
   When Weston was briefly queried by emergency room doctors
Friday, he was ``combative'' in responding, doctors said. A man who
closely matched the widely published likeness of Weston taken from
his driver's license had approached a reporter for The New York
Times, John M. Broder, on Friday morning in Lafayette Park across
the street from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The encounter, less than six hours before the shooting at the
Capitol, included the man's gesturing at the White House and saying
in an even but intense voice, ``Millions of people are going to die
because of the people you put in that house.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack led some lawmakers to begin talking about an extra
margin of security at the Capitol. The Senate majority leader,
Trent Lott of Mississippi, said he would push for a 10-year-old
proposal to construct a new visitors center to bolster weapons
checks of the building's thousands of annual tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Lott praised the effectiveness of the current system, in which
the two police officers were slain in resisting the gunman after he
darted beyond a weapons detector at the Capitol's East Front
entrance. But the senator said he would press hard to begin
building the previously proposed Capitol visitors center, which
would employ initial weapons checks more remote from the Capitol
and would be connected to the building by a tunnel under the
building's East Front plaza.

WASHINGTON: Front plaza. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``This is America,'' Lott said during a political trip to Little
Rock, Ark., citing just one of a number of ideas expected to
surface in a fresh look at the Capitol's physical security. ``We're
not going to let one crazy person drive us into a lockbox.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed by tourists at the Capitol Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that we continue the tours and not let
terrorists take away our freedom,'' said one visitor, DaLesia Boyd
of Richmond Va., leaving the Capitol beyond a dozen bouquets left
near the Document Door entrance where the gunman shot his way
inside.
</P>
<P>
   One family, Janet and Dick Puglisi of Tampa, Fla., and their
children, Dominic, 9, and Janet, 12, had to duck behind a pillar on
Friday when they heard the nearby gun battle as they waited to
tour. They resolved to return, and today they toured a more
peaceful Capitol, one bathed in sunshine but tinged with mourning.
``Yesterday was filled with fear,'' Mrs. Puglisi said, ``but that
was erased today as we were able to see the history and the beauty
of the building. We wanted to have that memory instead of the one
from yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott's proposal for a separate visitors center has been on the
drawing board for more than a decade. Whether it gathers momentum
or remains a talking point in the wake of the shootout remains to
be seen. But he said the center had $25 million set aside for
possible construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Capitol, the people's house, is safe and secure,'' Lott
said. ``The security system worked,'' he said, describing the
proposal as offering an additional margin of caution against
gun-wielding Americans.
</P>
<P>
   A team of federal and city detectives led by the Metropolitan
Police Department's homicide squad maintained a cordon around the
crime scene at a legislative leadership office suite east of the
Capitol's central Crypt and Great Rotunda.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on his legal defense, Weston, who has a history of
unstable behavior, could face execution under federal law if
convicted of the murder of the two officers, Jacob Chestnut, 58,
and John Gibson, 42, both 18-year veterans of the Capitol Police.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth person hit by gunfire, Angela Dickerson, 24, a tourist,
was treated for wounds to the face and shoulder. She quietly
checked out of George Washington University Hospital Saturday as
news reporters waited in vain to question her. Ms. Dickerson
returned to her home in Chantilly, Va., near Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor, Liz Lapham, said that Ms. Dickerson was escorting
relatives from out of town when she was shot.
</P>
<P>
   Weston, 41, has a record of paranoid ramblings and of having
made threatening remarks about the president and other officials.
But he was rated a minor threat two years ago in an initial Secret
Service vetting of his case.
</P>
<P>
   Under heavy guard, Weston was formally arrested and charged
Saturday with homicide in the killing of an on-duty federal
officer. The authorities said he would be arraigned in absentia in
Washington, with additional charges likely. The police said today
that extra ammunition was found in his pockets.
</P>
<P>
   The bloody intrusion left the capital city in a withered mood.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich fought back tears as he told of visiting
the families of the dead officers and announced the creation of a
charitable trust for their survivors, the Capitol Police Memorial
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``No terrorist, no deranged person, no act of violence will
block us from preserving our freedom and from keeping this building
open to people from all over the world,'' he said, speaking
sorrowfully in the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitol Police officers were a study in pride and sorrow as
they resumed their posts for the unthreatening majority that
respectfully streamed down halls of power limned Saturday with
mortal implications. More than the lawmakers who use the building
as a kind of national sound stage, it is the Capitol force of 1,200
police officers that gives the Capitol complex of buildings a sense
of small-town community. They maintain their posts each day and
come to know the hordes of workers who come and go through the
weapons detectors of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Usually amiable but invariably vigilant, the police intercept
about 10 ordinary Americans a year packing guns. Most have gun
licenses in their home states and strap on their weapons for
vacation visits here, where handguns are generally outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   The gunplay at the lawmakers' doorway knocked the capital city's
political agenda askew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look like an idiot,'' said Rep. Jose E. Serrano, D-N.Y.,
reflecting on the ironies of his making a speech on the House floor
about Puerto Rican nationalism and its violent excesses in history
just as the shootout erupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I start skipping pages,'' he said Friday night on CNN's
``Larry King Live,'' describing how he received word of the gunplay
just as he was about to mention the Puerto Rican radicals' shooting
attack on the House in 1954, when five lawmakers were injured.
</P>

   Of the dead Capitol guards, Clinton said to their survivors:
``Nothing we say can bring them back. But all Americans pray that
the power of a loving God and the comfort of family and friends
will with time ease your sorrow and swell your pride for loved ones
and the sacrifice they made for their fellow citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   As tourists arrived beneath Capitol flags set at half-staff,
Clinton addressed his appeal for a rededication to lawfulness ``to
every American who has been shaken by this violent act, to the
millions of parents who have taken their children through these
very same doors.''

   John Walker and his family, of Pekin, Ill., took the president
at his word. ``I had no objections in bringing my family today,''
Walker said amid the Capitol's renewed flow of visitors. ``There is
perhaps a somber mood, especially with the police force. I still
think it's safe.''

SHOOTING VICTIM: HOSPITAL SENDS WOMAN BACK HOME TO RECOVER  
 (HLW)

   WASHINGTON _ Angela Dickerson, the young woman injured in the
shooting in the Capitol building, was released from George
Washington University Medical Center on Saturday and returned to
her home in nearby Chantilly, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dickerson had been taking relatives on a visit to
Washington's tourist sites when she was caught in Friday's gunfire,
which killed two Capitol Police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke to her father, and she is quite exhausted,'' said Liz
Lapham, who lives in Ms. Dickerson's suburban neighborhood outside
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dickerson's wounds, Ms. Lapham said, ``are not as bad as the
first reports suggested. She said that she based that assessment on
a conversation with Ms. Dickerson's father, Frank Dobscha.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something went into her sinuses, but we don't know how she was
wounded,'' Ms. Lapham said of her neighbor. ``I don't think she was
disfigured.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dickerson, who is 24, has been married for one year and
lives with her husband, Steve, in the same house where she grew up,
Ms. Lapham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was showing relatives around the area while her husband
was at work,'' Ms. Lapham said. ``Here she was, going out of her
way to make someone else's day more enjoyable. She was in the wrong
place at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lapham said that Ms. Dickerson was a designer for the Ethan
Allen furniture store chain, and a spokeswoman for the company
confirmed that Ms. Dickerson worked at its outlet in nearby
Springfield, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Farooq Kathwari, a spokeswoman for Ethan Allen, said that Ms.
Dickerson had worked there for two years, according to The
Associated Press. ``She has represented the store at the company
award program,'' Ms. Kathwari said. ``She is dedicated, talented
and is much respected by her peers and her customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kathwari's description of Ms. Dickerson was similar to Ms.
Lapham's, who said that the young woman had been her baby sitter as
a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always worked.'' Ms. Lapham said. ``She never just hung
out as a teen-ager.''
