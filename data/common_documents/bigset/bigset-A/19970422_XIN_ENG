HONG KONG, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Director of Operations of Hong
Kong Police Ng Ching-kwok and his party held fruitful discussions
with the border security agencies in Guangdong on further
cooperation to fight against illegal immigration today.
</P>
<P>
Returning from a one-day visit this evening, Ng said that both
sides reviewed the illegal immigration situation prevailing over
the past three to four months, particularly the recent influx of

<HEADLINE> China to Continue Its Efforts of Entry into WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China will continue its efforts
to enter into the World Trade Organization (WTO), Chinese Minister
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi said here today
during her talks with Renato Ruggiero, director-general of WTO.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that although China hopes to solve this problem as soon
as possible, it is prepared for new difficulties and obstacles it
will face in the entry process.
</P>
<P>
No matter what the outcome, she said, China will not stop but
rather speed up its reform and opening drive.
</P>
<P>
She noted that China's position on entering WTO is firm and
clear, and China's entry will be not only beneficial to China but
also to all members of WTO and the development of the world
economy.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that China asked to join the multi-national trade
system 11 years ago because the country realized at that time that
the objectives of the reform and opening are to gradually change
from the planned economy to a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
China's participation in the WTO shares the aims of reform and
opening, as well as those of the socialist market economy, which
was advocated by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Wu said she is satisfied with the progress made in the recent
third meeting of the Chinese working group, saying it indicates
that as long as the parties concerned have a sincere desire to
solve the problem, and bring that sincerity to the negotiation
table, the discussions will move forward.
</P>
<P>
The major negotiation parties should work harder to be flexible
and down to earth, in order to make the most of the current
opportunity, she said, adding that China's efforts alone are not
enough.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that major members of WTO should not take China's
development potential as reality and therefore make an unrealistic
evaluation of the situation.
</P>
<P>
China firmly opposes economic hegemonism and hopes that major
negotiating parties will raise their requirement on a legal basis
and within the mechanism and scope of WTO agreements, she noted.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, she continued, they should also take into
consideration China's economic status as a developing country and
its social and economic situation.
</P>
<P>
In future negotiations, China will also express its flexible
position so as to push forward the process, Wu said. She also said
she hopes that the problems related to the period of transfer will
be discussed seriously in the future negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Wu expressed her appreciation for Ruggiero's attention to the
negotiation concerning China's entry into WTO as well as his
efforts to advance it.
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero said that he and the secretariat of WTO will work
unceasingly to push forward the negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero is here at the invitation of Wu.

<HEADLINE> Former Irish PM Haughey Under Cash Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Former Irish Prime Minister
Charles Haughey has been formally named as a recipient of more
than a million pounds when an official investigation into cash
payments to politicians opened in Dublin early today.
</P>
<P>
Dennis McCullough, counsel for the tribunal, told the tribunal
today that Haughey, who had been Irish prime minister between 1979
and 1992, received 1.3 million pounds (about 2 million U.S.
dollars) from businessman Ben Dunne between 1987 and 1991, said
reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Michael Lowry, a promising figure in the ruling Fine
Gael party of Prime Minister John Bruton, resigned when a
newspaper report said that Dunne had paid for the renovation of
his house.
</P>
<P>
McCullough told the tribunal that Haughey had approached Dunne
to "help him out of financial difficulty" and that four separate
payments were made through intermediaries to the former prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
"The evidence which Mr Dunne will give is that between December
1987 and November 1991 he arranged for 1.3 million pounds (about 2
million dollars) to be paid to the benefit of Charles J. Haughey,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
McCullough said that there was no suggestion that money paid to
either Haughey or Lowry or any other figures to be named in the
investigation was intended to buy political favors.
</P>
<P>
However, the news that a millionaire Irish businessman had
given cash to some politicians has raised calls for a new code
governing funding of political parties and more transparency.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Launches Campaign to Invite Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is to launch seminars on
investment in the country in three European cities in May as the
latest push to invite foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
A team of Egyptian businessmen and investors will take part,
said today Executive Chairman of the General Investment Authority
Ibrahim Fawzi, who will be at the helm of the delegation to the
three cities.
</P>
<P>
Fawzi said the first two seminars, to open in the Spanish city
of Barcelona on May 19 and Madrid on May 20, will tackle the
prospects for investment and privatization in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The third seminar, to be held in the Norwegian capital Oslo on
May 23, is expected to attract some 125 Norwegian firms to deal
with Egypt, he added.
</P>
<P>
While the European businessmen will be briefed on the
investment atmosphere and facilities in Egypt. Egyptian investors
will hold intensive talks with their Spanish and Norwegian
counterparts to discuss setting up joint ventures, Fawzi said.
</P>
<P>
The move followed a series of measures to lure foreign
investment in a campaign to revitalize the country's economy and
create jobs.
</P>
<P>
The government has set up a task force of Egyptian businessmen
abroad to convince foreign investors to put their money into
Egypt, and announced new legislation on investment guarantees and
tax exemptions.
</P>
<P>
A new bill approved by the parliament last month bans all
threats to private enterprise, such as seizures, nationalization
and sequestration.
</P>
<P>
The government also plans to offer 20-year tax holidays for all
investment in the New Valley under a project launched by President
Hosni Mubarak to boost economic activity in the south-western
desert region.
</P>
<P>
The government of Prime Minister Kamal Al-Ganzouri has made
boosting investment its top priority since coming to power in
January 1996 and has vowed to remove all obstacles to that goal.
</P>
<P>
According to the International Monetary Fund, foreign
investment in Egypt is expected to reach 2.1 billion U.S. dollars
in 1997 from 650 million last year.

<HEADLINE> US Threatens to Respond to Iraqi Helicopter Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
threatened to respond if Iraq flies helicopters to pick up Muslim
pilgrims from Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has announced that it would send helicopters to pick up
"sick and exhausted" Muslim pilgrims from Mecca, Saudi Arabia, and
the move will start today.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to Iraq's announcement, White House spokesman Mike
McCurry said, "We will respond appropriatedly."
</P>
<P>
He demanded that Iraq take another measures to bring those sick
and exhausted" Muslim pilgrims back. "There are other means and
procedures available for the transportation of... pilgrims," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We would encourage the government of Iraq to meet its
obligations under U.N. Security Council resolutions. We will
monitor carefully any potential violations in the no-fly zone," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The United States and its allies have enforced two no-fly zones
over the northern and southern parts of Iraq since the 1991 Gulf
War, banning Iraqi aircraft flying over their own territory.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zone in southern Iraq was expanded unilaterally by
the United States last September as a punishment on Iraq for its
sending of troops to northern Iraq at the invitation of a Kurdish
faction.
</P>
<P>
McCurry did not say what kind of response the United States
would make but said, "We're not going to shoot down civilian
helicopters."

<HEADLINE> OPEC Oil Price Rebounds to 17.17 Dollars a Barrel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The average price of OPEC's basket
of seven crude oils rebounded to 17.17 U.S. dollars per barrel
last week, the Vienna-based OPEC Secretariat said today.
</P>
<P>
A week earlier, the average price for OPEC's basket of seven
crudes fell to 16.91 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the low price should be blamed on the advent of
warmer weather and the decline of crude oil demands from the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
members and former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the return of Iraq to the oil export market and the
increase of oil recovered in the global sphere also contributed to
the sustained plunge of price since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
The price will remain fluctuating, experts added.
</P>
<P>
The average price of OPEC crude oil was as high as 23.19
dollars per barrel last January, but fell sharply to 20.48 dollars
a month later.
</P>
<P>
In March, it fell to 18.64 dollars, far below OPEC's benchmark
price of 21 dollars per barrel.

<HEADLINE> China to Seek Common Prosperity with Latin America: Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said here
today that China is willing to expand its economic and trade
cooperation with Latin American countries in a bid to seek common
prosperity and development.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with visiting Uruguayan President Julio Maria
Sanguinetti this afternoon, Li said that since Sanguinetti's 1988
visit to China, great changes have taken place in both countries,
and they have made marked achievements in their bilateral
cooperation in various sectors.
</P>
<P>
The two nations have also maintained good coordination in world
affairs, Li said, expressing full confidence over the future of
their bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of diplomatic ties, Sanguinetti said,
bilateral relations have progressed smoothly, and cooperation in
politics, economy, and trade have also been fruitful.
</P>
<P>
At present, the world is marching toward multi-polarization,
and China's ever-rising world status is one of the symbols of this
new situation.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay emphasizes its relations with China, and there's great
potential for their economic and trade cooperation, the president
said, adding that many Uruguayan enterpreneurs are accompanying
him on his current tour, and they will play an active role in
expanding the economic and trade cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Sanguinetti briefed Li on the establishment of the "south
common market" by four Latin American countries, describing it as
an important action in compliance with the world's
multi-polarization.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the Cold War, the world is stepping toward
multi-polarization, which is warmly welcomed by people of all
countries, Li said.
</P>
<P>
China has always maintained that domestic issues of any country
should be handled by its own people, rather than by one or two big
countries, the Premier noted.
</P>
<P>
China supports the unity and self-reliance of the Latin American
countries, and their efforts in establishing the "south common
market," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his appreciation for Uruguay's "one China"
position over the issue of Taiwan, and its support to China over
the human rights issue.
</P>
<P>
Sanguinetti noted that to pursue the "one China" policy and
develop relations with China follows the general trend, and
Uruguay will unswervingly stick to this policy, which is also a
common understanding of the Latin American countries and people.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also briefed each other on the economic
development of their countries.

<HEADLINE> Czech Republic Asks for Security Deposit on Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Czech government today sought
the leverage of imposing a security deposit on foreign imports to
help reduce the country's foreign trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
Compliance with the measure, which took effect immediately
after today's announcement, is mandatory for importers to clear
the procedure at the Czech Republic's customs, the government said.
</P>
<P>
However, before making it official, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus
indicated that the measure could be lifted at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The security, or earnest money equivalent to 20 percent of the
value of import, is required to be deposited at designated
financial institutions, and bears no interest.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic has been running a huge foreign trade
deficit in recent years, and the imbalance mounted to 161 billion
Korun (about 5.3 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The deficit reached 29 billion Korun (1 billion dollars) in the
first two months of this year, and was projected to total 220
billion Korun (7.6 billion dollars) for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign trade deficit now stands at 8.5 percent
of its gross domestic product (GDP), which is generally considered
to be alarming for maintaining the health of economy.

SARAJEVO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A summit between the chairman of
the Bosnian Presidency Alija Izetbegovic and Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic could take place within a month.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for the summit is underway and the venue would be
somewhere in Croatia, Kasim Trnka, Bosnia's ambassador to Croatia,
was quoted as saying by a report in the Belgrade Daily Nasa Borba
available here today.
</P>
<P>
Trnka said the summit would be aimed at establishing diplomatic
relations between Bosnia and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had reportedly
evaluated a draft agreement on the bilateral relations presented
by the Yugoslav side and the document would be sent to the Bosnian
Presidency for its consideration.
</P>
<P>
The process of normalizing ties between the two countries has
been bogged down for Belgrade's requirement that Bosnia should
withdraw its lawsuit against Yugoslavia on the International Court
of Justice in the Hague, the Netherlands. The Bosnian side has
insisted on unconditional installation of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
There are no clear indications yet as to how the issue could be
settled.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has attracted 350.1
million U.S. dollars of foreign direct investment during the first
half of the current financial year which will end on June 30,
sources from the Board of Investment said here today.
</P>
<P>
And the portfolio investment in the country has amounted to
141.1 million dollars during the same period.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the largest investment has been made
by the United Kingdom, which is to the tune of 198.2 million
dollars including 166.4 million dollars of direct investment and
portfolio investment of 31.8 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
It is followed by the United States whose direct investment
totaled 107 million dollars while portfolio investment amounted to
48.3 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
During the year 1995-96 Pakistan attracted total foreign
investment of 1.296 billion dollars which included 1.091 billion
dollars of direct investment and portfolio investment of 205.2
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The United Kingdom was the biggest investor with total

<P>
The United States stood second with a total of 355.7 million

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Law Circle Demands Containment of Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian Society for
International Law today urged the world community to take more
serious steps to check Israel's settlement policy.
</P>
<P>
"Israel, by its settlement operations in East Jerusalem, is
breaking its pledges and the commitments made in Madrid conference
and the Oslo agreements," the organization said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"It obviously breaches the firm international rule which holds
it impermissible to annex territories by force or alter legal
situations and conditions on the ground in the occupied
territories," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Thus, it pointed out, the condemnation of Israel and the freeze
of ties should be "the least thing to be taken in this respect."
</P>
<P>
Blaming the Jewish state for the current Mideast stalemate, the
Egyptian society called on "Arab and Muslim states well as all
legitimacy-loving states to take more practicable measures to
deter the Jewish state and check its unlawful behavior and
designations."
</P>
<P>
The society, a firebrand critic of the Jewish state, also
directed criticism at the international community for lack of
counterattack against the Israeli violation of international law.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli conduct in the United Nations and especially in the
UN Security Council testifies to the inaction of world community
in confronting Israel and its double standard dealing," it
lamented.
</P>
<P>
The UN Security Council has failed to pass a draft resolution
condemning the Israeli construction of a new Jewish neighborhood
in East Jerusalem because of the two vetoes cast by the United
States, a key sponsor of the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it pointed out that the conduct of some big powers
are "worrying" as it violates the principles on which the new
world order is to rest, in an apparent reference to the position
taken by the U.S. in favor of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks were stalled over a month
since Israel decided on April 18 to press ahead with a Jewish
neighborhood in disputed East Jerusalem despite international
objection.

<P>
The main attraction of the agriculture package is the increase
in support prices of wheat, rice and other agricultural products.

The package is expected to encourage farmers to bring more area
under wheat cultivation and grow more wheat, the sources believed.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the government is confident to achieve the
target for wheat crop in the next fiscal year as the other
measures announced in the agriculture package envisages the

agricultural sector which will not only enhance the wheat
production, but also the production of other major crops.
</P>
<P>

17 million tons while the total requirement for the commodity in
Pakistan is around 19.4 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes Reciprocal Visits Between Greek, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government has
welcomed reciprocal visits between Greek and Turkish Cypriots and
described them as a desirable development and a good start.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday more than 400 Turkish Cypriots crossed over to
the government-controlled southern areas of the island to pray
in one of the Muslim holiest shrines near the southern coastal
town of Larnaca.
</P>
<P>
Greek Cypriots are due to visit the Turkish-controlled
Monastery of Apostlos Andreas, on the island's most eastern tip,
in the Karpass Peninsula, to celebrate Easter Mass this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing today, Government
Spokesman Manolis Christofides voiced welcome to such exchange of
visits, and noted that "humanitarian in nature as they may be,
they have obvious political benefits."
</P>
<P>
"We welcome such developments, this is a good start and an
example of respect of the religious beliefs of each citizen of
the Republic and for places of worship," Christofides said.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government, he said, is looking into various
other events which can boost efforts for rapprochement between
the citizens of the island country.
</P>
<P>
"One can assume that these reciprocal visits will have
beneficial results on the political effort to find a settlement
in Cyprus," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that "this is the first sign of breaking the
ice," expressing the hope that such visits will continue.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that the exchange of visits were the
result of the ongoing U.N.-led proximity talks between the Greek
and Turkish Cypriot sides, which began on March 10.
</P>
<P>
The talks were aimed at paving the way for the U.N. proposed
face-to-face negotiations between leaders of the two communities
and getting the two sides to adopt good-will gestures to create
a positive climate for direct negotiations.
</P>
<P>
This Eastern Mediterranean island has remained divided since
1974 when Turkish troops occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of an Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
The Greek and Turkish Cypriots have been separated and are
not allowed to cross the Green Line, which is controlled by the
1,200-strong U.N. Peace-Keeping Force in Cyprus.

both are faced with the task of safeguarding peace and seeking
development, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China and African countries, though far apart
geographically, are all developing countries, and their friendship
has stood the test of time in spite of the changing world
situation.

They have carried out broad and fruitful cooperation in
political, economic, cultural and other sectors, and closely
coordinated with each other on international issues based on the
five principles of peaceful co-existence, he noted.

Over the past decades, he said, exchanges of high-level visits
between China and African countries have been frequent, with

<P>
The premier pointed out that each African country has in recent
years worked hard to overcome the negative effects after the Cold
War, and during the current trend of seeking peace, stability and
development, the economic recovery in the countries has gained a
sound momentum and the sense of unity and strength continues to be
enhanced.
</P>
<P>
Africa, with a tremendous potential for economic development,
rich in natural resources and with so many countries, is an
important force in the international arena, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The peace and prosperity of the world requires the stability
and development of Africa, and any opinion or action to neglect
Africa is incorrect, Li added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is constantly attentive to Africa,
values the traditional friendship they share and maintains the
just rights and interests of the developing countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between China and Africa embodies the mutual
sympathy and support of the developing countries, and such a
common interest between them is deepened, not weakened, in the
cross-century times.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to further develop political friendship with
Africa, tap new channels of economic and trade cooperation and
pursue common development, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China wishes to strengthen consultation and
cooperation in international affairs, support the just demands and
reasonable proposals of African countries, stand together with
them and other developing countries, and work jointly with them to
promote just and reasonable international politics and a new
economic order.
</P>
<P>
Li said he appreciated the support of the African countries at
the just-ended United Nations Commission on Human Rights, foiling
the anti-China motion by a few western countries.
</P>
<P>
Ambassadors of the six countries to China warmly welcomed Li's
upcoming visit to Africa, saying that African people cherish deep,
sincere friendship and brotherliness toward China.
</P>
<P>
They are convinced that the visit will reap positive results in
all fields, and help to consolidate and develop the long-term
friendly cooperative ties between China and African countries.
</P>
<P>
They also congratulated China on once again maintaining its
sovereignty and dignity in the UN Human Rights Commission,
regarding this as a success for all the developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Pak Government to Lay Emphasis on Local Power Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government has
decided to pay special attention to the development of
hydro-electric and indigenous fuel-based thermal generation in its
forthcoming energy policy.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the Ministry of Water and Power the
new energy policy is expected to be announced at the end of next
month.
</P>
<P>
In its new energy policy, the government is expected to focus
on the private small and medium hydel plants, which have the
advantages of environment friendliness and tolerable pressure on
balance of payments as the required machinery can be produced
locally.
</P>
<P>
Under the policy, grids, transmission lines and other
infrastructure will be extended to improve accessibility of
hydro-potential sites, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the strategic shift in the policy would
be an emphasis on transport and communications. A significant
portion of the required transport infrastructure is linked with
the development of the thermal power plants.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the large increase in the import of fuel
will need port handling facilities, which will have to be
transported from port to power plants, necessitating investment in
roads or pipelines.
</P>
<P>
It is one of the main objectives of the policy to restore
railways' role as the main carrier of long distance bulk freight,
which is considered to be fuel-efficient, environment-friendly and
export-promoting.
</P>
<P>
In this context, foreign investment will be sought on the basis
of schemes, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
In pursuance of the power sector policy announced in March
1994, all public sector thermal power stations were to be
privatised and new ones set up only in the private sector.

<HEADLINE> Officials on US Court Order on Long Beach Port Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China Ocean Shipping (Group)
Company (COSCO) will reserve its right to ask for compensation for
losses caused by a US court order to cancel its lease agreement
with the Port of Long Beach in the US.
</P>
<P>
COSCO officials made the announcement here today in an
interview with a group of local journalists.
</P>
<P>
The COSCO American Incorp., an overseas branch of the leading
Chinese ocean shipping firm, signed an agreement with the US
harbor on November 15, 1995, to rent an abandoned US Navy port in
the city of Long Beach, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
They said the deal was signed in accordance with US law, and
and the court decision may result in heavy financial loss to the
company. COSCO has invested 36.1 million US dollars to buy six
cranes in the port, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The US court has demanded that the Port of Long Beach cancel
the agreement due to the project's negative influence on national
security and on environment and cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
Beverly O'Neill, Mayor of the City of Long Beach, and George
M. Murchison, President of the Board of the Harbor Commissioners
of the Port of Long Beach, who are visiting Beijing, also were
interviewed by the Chinese reporters today.
</P>
<P>
In her speech, the Mayor called COSCO a "very valued customer"
and "part of the Port of Long Beach."
</P>
<P>
Murchison said that the port would accept the court order to
cancel the agreement. As for the cause of the problem, he said,
"state process conflicts with federal process" over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Murchison insisted that both sides will suffer financially from
the decree. But he admitted that so far, the properties of the
former US Navy port have not been transferred to the Port of Long
Beach.

<HEADLINE> French Left Parties Set Up Alliance Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- France's leftwing parties reached
an agreement today to present their common candidates in the
constituencies where the extreme-right National Front (FN) party
is active, in the early legislative elections to be held in about
one month's time.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Socialist Party, the Communist Party and
other leftwing parties and the Green Party made the decision at a
meeting today at the headquarters of the Mouvement des Citoyens
party headed by former Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac will announce this evening his
decision to dissolve the National Assembly (lower house of
parliament) and to organize early legislative elections on May 25
and June 1.
</P>
<P>
National Secretary of the Communist Party Robert Hue said that
the leftwing parties will present their common candidates for
parliament in fewer than a dozen constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, First Secretary of the French Socialist Party Lionel
Jospin will have a meeting with Hue on April 28 to decide on a
common program for the two main leftwing parties in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Socialist and Communist party officials said that the two
parties have overcome their difference on European Monetary Union,
after Jospin said Sunday that he would reject the European single
currency if it resulted in more austerity socio-economic measures
in France.
</P>
<P>
Hue, who has vowed to fight for an overall rejection of the
monetary union, described Jospin's speech as "a positive
evolution."
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll conducted by the daily Le Figaro and the SOFRES
polling institute said today that the ruling right-center majority
will lose about 150 parliament seats in the elections, but will
keep an absolute majority.

<HEADLINE> Business Confidence Advances, Conference Board Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Confidence among the U.S.'s
business leaders rose during the first quarter of 1997, according
to a research group here today.
</P>
<P>
The New York based Conference Board reported that its Measure
of Business Confidence increased to 57 in the first quarter, up
from 54 during the final quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The index is based on quarterly surveys of more than 150 chief
executive officers and other business leaders representing a wide
variety of industries.
</P>
<P>
Forty-seven percent say the economy has improved over the last
six months, up from less than 45 percent in the last quarter of
1996. Business leaders also are marginally more positive about
business conditions in their own industries. More than 45 percent
say conditions are better than they were six months ago, up
slightly from the last quarter. Those saying conditions are worse
fell slightly to about 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
Among the various industries surveyed, chief executives in
wholesale and retail trade reported the largest improvement in
business conditions. Business leaders in banking and finance,
however, reported a deterioration in business conditions.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 percent of the chief executives plan to hire
additional workers during the coming year -- up substantially from
the 10 percent figure of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Business leaders say wage and salary costs, and other employee
benefits, are not major obstacles to hiring more workers this
year.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Calls for Technological Advancement for Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo
today called on the country's state-owned enterprises to speed up
technological advancement in order to raise production efficiency
and better adapt themselves to the market.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on industrial technological progress,
attended by ministerial and provincial officials, as well as heads
of some giant state-run enterprises, Wu affirmed the role of
technological progress in promoting the sustained, rapid and
healthy development of the national economy over the past several
years.
</P>
<P>
"It is key to the survival, development and competitiveness of
enterprises," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He urged the local and department officials and business heads
to take the lead in studying the market mechanism so as to avoid
repetitious construction projects.
</P>
<P>
They are also encouraged to find funds on their own for
investment in technological renovations, "instead of depending
solely on the central government," said the vice-premier.
</P>
<P>
Wu also urged state enterprises to work together for this
purpose.
</P>
<P>
Top leaders of governments at various levels must pay close
attention to this drive, and the legal person shall be fully
responsible for their technical renovation projects, Wu stressed.
</P>
<P>
He is a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee
of the Chinese Communist Party. The seminar was jointly sponsored
by the State Administration College and the State Economic and
Trade Commission.

<HEADLINE> Peaceful Reunification Irreversible: Scholars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A group of scholars and experts
said today in Beijing that the question of Taiwan will surely be
solved, and the ultimate reunification of the motherland is an
irreversible trend.
</P>
<P>
They made the pronouncement at a symposium held by the Hong
Kong-based newspaper "Wen Wei Po" to discuss the current situation
and future prospect of the cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
They noted that after the resolution of the questions of Hong
Kong and Macao, the question of Taiwan will be solved in
accordance with the basic principles of "peaceful reunification,
and one country, two systems" and the eight-point propositions put
forward by President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
They said the return of Hong Kong is a milestone in China's
reunification process, adding that the successful implementation
of the "one country, two systems" concept will set an example for
the resolution of the Taiwan question, as well as the ultimate
reunification.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the current situation on the Taiwan Island, the
participants said the Taiwan authorities are still blocking the
exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits by creating
"two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
They urged the Taiwan authorities to return to the principle of
"one China," open the direct postal, commercial and transport
links as soon as possible, and conduct political negotiations to
end the confrontation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Dianming, vice-president and secretary-general of the
Taiwan Studies Society, said the principle of "one China" is the
prerequisite for concluding the peaceful reunification, and any
thought of wavering or making compromises regarding Chinese
sovereignty will be futile.
</P>
<P>
Wang Sheng, an official of the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, said political negotiation is an effective way to
improve the cross-strait relations, and the Taiwan authorities
should respond quickly to the mainland's proposals.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jianmin, a research fellow of the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences, also commented on the importance of the direct
postal, commercial and transport links between the two sides,
saying that the two sides enjoy a vast potential in their economic
and trade relations, and the Taiwan authorities can never block
the development.

<HEADLINE> Joint Commission Still Responsible for Angolan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Although the Angolan government
of national unity and reconciliation has taken office, the Joint
Commission Overseeing the Angolan Peace Process will still be in
charge of the remaining tasks of the Lusaka peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed here today by the United Nations special
envoy in Angola Blondin Beye, who just returned here from
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He added that after the government of national unity and
reconciliation was sworn in on April 11 and the UNITA parliament
members took their posts in the National Assembly, both heads of
the Angolan government and UNITA delegations in the joint
commission were assigned to new posts.
</P>
<P>
However, the implementation of the peace agreement will still
be charged by the joint commission, which under the present
situation is to be reshaped, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Beye told reporters that before April 11, the implementation
of the Lusaka peace agreement was in the charge of the joint
commission under his leadership, which was made up of
representatives from the Angolan government, the UNITA, and
observers including the United States, Russia and Portugal.

<HEADLINE> Outlook of China's Tourism Good, PATA Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese mainland is predicted
to be the leading tourism destination by the year 2000, followed
by Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia, according to
the '96 Annual Report of the Pacific Asia Travel Association
(PATA).
</P>
<P>
In terms of tourism arrivals, China now ranks fourth and
Indonesia, fifth, in the region, says the annual report which was
delivered at PATA's 46th Annual Conference opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Among the biggest tourism players, China, Indonesia and
Australia have shown the strongest overall growth in the 1990s,
the report says.
</P>
<P>
As the center of the global economy moves towards the Pacific
Asia region, it is not surprising that tourism there is now
growing faster than in any other region, the report points out.
</P>
<P>
According to PATA statistics, compared with average world
tourism growth of 5.1 percent annually between 1991 and 1995, the
PATA region increased its arrivals by 9.3 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
From a 10.8 percent share of tourist arrivals from throughout
the world in 1991, PATA's figure increased by two percent to 12.7
percent in 1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials from the the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) began a three-day
seminar to map out a strategy to rid the region of some 20
million mines which have claimed over 250,000 victims since 1961.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC), the seminar will consider possible initiatives on the
landmines problem in southern Africa, where 10 of the 12 SADC
states have recorded casualties.
</P>
<P>
Dominique Dufour, head of the regional delegation of the ICRC,
said the solution to the landmines menace requires comprehensive
action encompassing outright ban on the use, production,
stockpiling and export of anti-personnel mines.
</P>
<P>
It should also be combined with greatly expanded programs for
enhanced mine clearance and massive increase in assistance to
victims, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the ICRC, only some 400,000 mines have been
removed since serious clearance operations began in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Inland, Hong Kong to Have Enhanced Tourism Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A top Hong Kong tourism official
predicts the tourism business will boom in both the Chinese inland
and Hong Kong after the latter's return to China on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Amy Chan, Executive Director of Hong Kong Tourist Association
(HKTA), made the remark at a press conference held here today at
the opening of the '97 Annual Conference of the Pacific Asia
Travel Association.
</P>
<P>
Chan said that tourist departments on both sides have been
working together, and will continue to do so to promote Hong Kong
and other Chinese cities as attractive tourist destinations on the
world tourist market.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong will be a complementary destination to China," she
noted, saying that inland tourism businesses can "take advantage
of Hong Kong's experience and expertise in international tourism
marketing."
</P>
<P>
Chan pointed out Hong Kong has been an important source market
for China, with nearly 29 million Hong Kong people visiting the
Chinese inland last year, while the number of inland tourists to
Hong Kong is growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
She emphasized her confidence in Hong Kong's future, saying the
city will continue to be a cosmopolitan city with unique scenery
to entice tourists around the world.
</P>
<P>
Chan revealed HKTA is organizing a large-scale promotion to
celebrate the first 100 days of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
Called "100 Days of Wonders," the campaign, running from July 1
to October 8, features a wide range of offers and events, such as
festivities for the handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China,
specially-created tours, and hotel and food-related deals.
</P>
<P>
Tourists will also have the chance to win prizes valued at some
one million Hong Kong dollars in the 100 Days of Wonder Lucky
Draw, which will take place on October 22.
</P>
<P>
Tourism has been a pillar of Hong Kong's economy for
decades. Last year, the city received a record 11 million
visitors, earning tourism revenue of over 10 billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Chirac to Dissolve Parliament to Secure Launching of Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac is
expected to announce this evening the dissolution of the National
Assembly, or the lower house of parliament, and the organization
of early legislative elections in a bid to ensure France's entry
into the European Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
The French presidential palace confirmed today that Chirac will
make a radio-television speech this evening to announce his
decision to the French people.
</P>
<P>
Chirac met Prime Minister Alain Juppe, Senate President Rene
Monory and National Assembly President Philippe Seguin this
morning in his office for consultations over the dissolution,
which is required by the French Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The dissolution will put an end to the 10th legislature of the
Fifth Republic of France, and will be the fifth dissolution of
parliament by the president of the republic since General Charles
de Gaulle did so in 1962.
</P>
<P>
Under the French Constitution, legislative elections should be
held 20 to 40 days after the president dissolves the parliament,
and the next legislative elections are widely expected to be held
on May 28 and June 1, both of which fall on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The main justification for Chirac to dissolve the parliament is
to avoid an overlap between the originally scheduled legislative
elections in April 1998 and the deadline to meet the criteria of
the Maastricht Treaty for joining the European single currency,
the Euro, on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Maastricht Treaty requires all candidates for the Euro to
cut their public deficits to below three percent of their gross
domestic product (GDP) by the end of 1997, and the European Union
will decide in the first half of 1998 which member countries are
qualified.
</P>
<P>
Despite the austere socio-economic policy adopted by the
government of Prime Minister Juppe over the past two years,
France's public deficit now stays at four percent of its GDP.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, social discontent remains unabated since last winter
and the country's unemployment rate stays at 12.8 percent, which
is greatly blamed on the policy of social and economic austerity
of the government.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Authorities' Diplomacy With Money Criticized (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A signed article released today
by the Xinhua News Agency calls for all Chinese people, including
the Taiwan compatriots, to show greater contempt for the Taiwan
authorities' plot to split the motherland by practicing "dollar
diplomacy."
</P>
<P>
The article says that in recent years, the Taiwan authorities
have sought international support for the position of so-called
"independent political entities," and they have expended large
amounts of manpower, material and funds in the name of "expanding
living space internationally."
</P>
<P>
They play a farce again and again as they continue to spend
money on buying diplomatic relations with African countries; to
employ public relations companies to canvass for support in the
U.S. Congress; to send high-ranking officials abroad to promise
economic "assistance"; and to claim that one billion U.S. dollars
will buy them their ticket into the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the article says, the Taiwan
authorities have spent about one million U.S. dollars to hire more
than 20 public relations firms and advisory groups to make contact
with the White House, the U.S. Congress, Wall Street and major
newspapers in the United States.
</P>
<P>
In order to help Taiwan "President" Lee Teng Hui visit the
United States, the Taiwan Research Institute, often referred to as
an "underground foreign ministry," paid Cassidy Associates 4.5
million U.S. dollars over a three-year period to go canvassing for
its operation.
</P>
<P>
Informed U.S. sources said that after staff members of the
Cassidy Associates received the money from Taiwan, they met with
U.S. Congressmen, government officials and journalists, and
pressured representatives of every state to vote for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Peter Rosenblatt, a White House lawyer, has been hired by
Taiwan as an advisor at a monthly salary of 8,500 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The article quoted one American employed by Taiwan in a similar
position as saying, "Some people in Taiwan will knock on your door
at any time to ask you to do things for them."

<P>
At the end of October 1996, just before the US presidential
election, some mass media, including "Asia Week" of Hong Kong and
"Newsweek" and "Wall Street Journal" of the United States,
revealed that the Taiwan authorities had offered money to the US
for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
The incident once again exposed the Taiwan authorities'
notorious penchant for "dollar diplomacy," which involves such
organs as the Taiwan Research Institute and the American Institute
in Taiwan, as well as a total of more than 10 million US dollars,
the article says.
</P>
<P>
The "Los Angeles Times" quoted a former US official as saying
that "Taiwan is indeed qualified for the title of master of
illegal donations and canvassing expert."

The various actions carried out by the Taiwan authorities were
strongly opposed by the people on the island long before this, and
the revelation that Taiwan had given political donations to the US
put its policy of "dollar diplomacy" in trouble.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's non-ruling parties and media also repeatedly
complained that the authorities believe that money is everything,
and requested them to conduct a thorough self-examination on the
existing "diplomatic" policy.
</P>
<P>
The article says the reserve of foreign exchange and the
economic strength of the Taiwan authorities have been built up by
the blood and sweat of the people of Taiwan, and that it is a sin
for the authorities to squander either the money or power wantonly.
</P>
<P>
"Dollar diplomacy" is simply an attempt to create "two Chinas,"
and an obscene way to gain "historical status" and an
"international name" for a handful of people rather than to
"expand international living space."

<HEADLINE> Chirac to Dissolve Parliament to Secure Launching of Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In order to prevent the next legislative elections from
becoming a national referendum on whether France should join the
Euro, Chirac has decided to secure a new majority in the
parliament through early elections.
</P>
<P>
This will give him a free reign -- at least for the next five
years during the term of the new legislature as well as his
presidency which ends in 2002 -- to carry through his austerity
plans aimed at meeting the budgetary criteria for joining the Euro.
</P>
<P>
It will also allow him to continue the economic and financial
structural reforms in France, "the other side of the coin" he
moulded since becaming president in May 1995.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said the decision to dissolve parliament is
also encouraged by a recent poll by the Interior Ministry, which
showed that the ruling majority could maintain 361 seats in the
557-seat National Assembly if the elections were held now.
</P>
<P>
A poll published today by the daily Le Figaro showed that the
ruling Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR) and the Union for
French Democracy (UDF) will lose some 150 seats in the next
elections, but they will keep 318 seats, 40 seats more than the
278-seat absolute majority required for adopting bills.
</P>
<P>
The poll also showed that the Socialist Party of Lionel Jospin
will be the biggest, if not the only, beneficiary of the early
elections. The Socialists and their ecologist allies will win 34.5
percent of the votes in the first round, it said.
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech Sunday evening, Jospin said that if the
Maastricht Treaty criteria for joining the Euro bring about a new
"tightening up" of the French economy, his party will reject the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
He also promised that if he became the next prime minister, he
would not adopt a policy of socio-economic austerity.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials of the ruling majority have pointed out
that the dissolution of parliament will not bring about any major
change of policy.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Economy and Finance Jean Arthuis said today that
France is determined to respect the Maastricht criteria for joining
the Euro and will meet the deadline.
</P>
<P>
But the dissolution of parliament is widely regarded as a bold
action by Chirac to push forward the European construction, which is
becoming more and more controversial not only in France, but also in
Germany and other European countries.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Authorities' Diplomacy With Money Criticized (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
However, given the situation that the world community commonly
acknowledges "one China," the Taiwan authorities' acts can gain no
favor internationally.
</P>
<P>
According to an old Chinese saying, "Anything obtained through
improper interests is sure to lose due to the interests." The
"establishment of diplomatic relations" bought by the Taiwan
authorities can easily end at any time, because some requests
cannot be met.
</P>
<P>
The desire for money has prompted some countries to "sever
diplomatic relations" and "resume diplomatic relations" over and
over with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996 when South Africa declared it would "sever
diplomatic relations" with Taiwan by the end of this year, some
countries that had been highly paid by the Taiwan authorities to
guarantee "diplomatic relations" have also begun to put a stop to
the practice. And Taiwan's "pragmatic diplomacy" has been in
question.
</P>
<P>
The article says it is commonly recognized that there is only
one China in the world, that the People's Republic of China is the
sole legal representative of China, and that Taiwan is part of
China.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, any action of the Taiwan authorities
to gain international status with money cannot succeed, the
article points out.
</P>
<P>
According to some insightful people on the island, the Taiwan
authorities should have a clear view of the current international
situation and the general strength of the motherland's mainland,
and realize that "the diplomatic breakthrough and the safety
guarantee of Taiwan rely on the relaxation of the cross-straits
relations."
</P>
<P>
Only after the reunification is achieved between the two sides
of the Taiwan Straits can the compatriots on both sides share the
dignity and reputation enjoyed by the Chinese people in the world,
the article says.

<HEADLINE> Greece Not Satisfied With Italian Cooperation: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Greece today voiced its
dissatisfaction with Greek-Italian cooperation in the framework of
the multinational security force policing the distribution of
humanitarian aid in the strife-ridden Albania.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said today that the
cooperation between the two countries was developing under
"difficult conditions."
</P>
<P>
"We want a more substantial cooperation in order to overcome
problems and speed up our pace so that we will be able to respond
to our role," he said, referring to the Greek force's slow march
towards its port of destination, Vlore, in southern Albania.
</P>
<P>
The second company of 520 Greek troops left for Albania today
while the first part of the Greek force remains at Fieri, awaiting
the green light from the Italian command to move to Vlore.
</P>
<P>
Greek Defense Undersecretary Dimitris Apostolakis today also
stressed that the Greek mission would remain "neutral and
impartial" and would not interfere in Albania's domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
A total of 760 Greek troops are expected to participate in the
U.N.-mandated operations in Albania which will last three months.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Greek troops will be stationed in the Albanian
capital of Tirana while another company will be deployed in Vlore.

<HEADLINE> Iran Allows Private Banks at Free Trade Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian banking authorities
announced here today that the private sector is allowed to
set up banks at the free trade and industrial zones with
partnership of the public sector.
</P>
<P>
Mohsen Nourbakhsh, Governor of the Central Bank of Iran
(CBI), said that the central government has decided to authorize
establishment of the banks at the free trade zones.
</P>
<P>
The governor made the statement at the opening ceremony of
a branch of the Export Promotion Bank of Iran at Qeshm Free
Trade and Industrial Zone, about 1,000 kilometers south of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
He said that the decision was made in line with a plan
passed by the Expediency Council which is headed by President
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign banks are also allowed to open branches at the free
trade zones and the domestic banks are entitled to perform
external operations there," he was quoted by the official news
agency IRNA as saying.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the free trade zones would
earn more value-added profits.
</P>
<P>
Iran has made little progress in absorbing foreign investment
though it pledged guarantee for the safety of foreign investment
in his country in a bid to lure capitals from other countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran has set forth a series of regulations and rules regarding
to investment, customs, import and export business, monetary and
banking operations and utilization of land and natural resources
in favor of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign investors still feel great political and
business risks in the country as they believe the regulations are
still not perfect enough for them. It has to take a long way to
reach the goal to make the zones centers of attracting advanced
technologies and of trade.
</P>
<P>
There are three free trade zones, namely Kish Island, Qeshm
Island and Chabahar. They are all situated at the south
coast of the country and connected to major international
waterways via the Persian Gulf and the Oman Sea and finally
the Indian Ocean.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Urges States to Ratify Chemical Weapon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- With the approach of entry
into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention on April 29, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan today urged members states to take
steps to allow the convention to fulfill its promise.
</P>
<P>
"This treaty is too important for the security of every state
and future international stability to be handicapped by the
failure of some to become parties," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, states that fail to ratify it will undermine their
credibility in subsequent arms regulation and disarmament
negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Spokesman Fred Eckhard said Kofi Annan made the statement
in Geneva, where he is having a working visit. Eckhard said that
Annan also elaborated three important ways, in which the
convention will contribute to international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
"First," Annan said, "it will create an international norm
prohibiting the development, production and acquisition of
chemical weapons. "
</P>
<P>
"Second, it will lead to the destruction of chemical-weapon
stockpiles, thereby eliminating the threat of chemical warfare,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Third, it will establish very stringent verification
measures," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the great potential of the convention to
contribute to international peace and security will depend on the
degree of universality it achieves.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Russia, which possess a large majority of
the chemical weapons, have not ratified the convention. The
Clinton administration is urging the Congress to ratify the
convention before April 29.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 21 (Xinhua) -- South Africa would like to
play a constructive role in the Middle East peace process, but
would not become directly involved in the process, Deputy Foreign
Affairs Minister Aziz Pahad said today.
</P>
<P>
Opening a workshop in Pretoria, Pahad said the South African
government hopes peace efforts in the Middle East will be revived
soon to replace centuries of conflict.
</P>
<P>
This should be done by offering encouragement for successes
and expressing disappointment at failures through what he called
carefully-crafted statements, said Pahad.
</P>
<P>
He also said South Africa's policy towards the countries in
the region will be underpinned by the principle of
evenhandedness, adding good relations with one country do not
preclude good relations with the other.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, organized by the Department of Foreign Affairs,
was aimed at explaining and refining foreign policy approaches to
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
It examined ways to improve South Africa's understanding of
the endemic factors threatening peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
A wide range of academics, politicians, business leaders,
non-government bodies and media representatives attended the
workshop.

<HEADLINE> African Social Security Seminar Opens in Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A five-day seminar on social
security started here today, gathering experts from 22 English
speaking African countries.
</P>
<P>
The experts are expected to formulate and implement
appropriate strategies for social protection reform.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare Minister
Florence Chitauro told the experts that limited resources in
Zimbabwe have hindered the National Social Security Authority
(NSSA) from including civil servants and domestic workers among
its contributors.
</P>
<P>
The NSSA was set up by the government as a compulsory pension
scheme in October 1994 and now draws about 6.36 million U.S.
Dollars from its members countrywide.
</P>
<P>
The scheme is designed to benefit members by giving them funds
during periods of income stoppage or reduction, such as when
invalid, at retirement and to survivors of a member at and after
his or her death.
</P>
<P>
When it became operational, civil servants, domestic workers
and self-employed people were "temporarily" exempted from
contributing to the scheme, which has included all workers in the
private sector.

MOSCOW, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia and China enjoy mutual
confidence and have set an example of sound tendencies in
international relations, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory
Karasin said today.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of a state visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin to

"tendencies are not the widening of blocs but, quite the contrary,
the stepping up of confidence measures."

Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan -- will sign
an agreement on mutual reduction of military forces in boder areas.
</P>
<P>
Calling the agreement a "very important document", Karasin said
"this is an significant measure of confidence between the five
countries. The tendency of cooperation and confidence becomes a
consistent line, which is extremely important for the Asia-Pacific
region and the whole world."
</P>
<P>
Karasin also said the document will be fully in keeping with
Russia's interests. The Russian Defense Ministry directly

The Russian official said the sound tendencies have a positive
effect on other countries, citing the agreement between China and
India on confidence-building measures in the military field in

Shanghai accord signed by China, Russia, Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan and

<HEADLINE> Cargo Handled by Tanzania Harbours to Be Declined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania Harbours Authority
(THA) is expected to handle 5.07 million tons of cargo this financial
year compared to 5.8 million tons handled last financial year.
</P>
<P>
The THA Director General, Sammson Luhigo told the authority's
Workers Council meeting held here today that the slight cargo
consignment drop experienced was due to change of import sourcing
point.
</P>
<P>
"Most of our potential customers such as Zambia and some Central
African countries are now importing from South Africa instead of the
European countries as it was the case before," explained Luhigo.
</P>
<P>
The THA chief also attributed the decline of cargo at the port to
poor performance of economy in countries which have been major
customers for years.
</P>
<P>
Luhigo said that the authority was taking proper measures to ensure
that the amount of cargo to be handled was increased and maintained at
a substantial level.
</P>
<P>
"We are dedicated to improve our operational capacity in cargo
handling," emphasized the director general, adding that the authority
was about to start expanding the port's mouth.
</P>
<P>
He said that better services would enable the authority to compete
effectively under the trade liberalization and privatisation process.
</P>
<P>
The director general also said Mtwara and Tanga ports are operating
below capacity.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, Tanga port has dropped from 250,000 tons down
to 100,000 tons a year, he said.  enditem

Over 100 participants from China, India, Canada, Indonesia,

They will discuss relations between environment and

Opening the session, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said
the primary aim of environmental management should be to ensure
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said excessive demands are already being made on the
environment's limited resources and on the carrying capacity of
the fragile resources, adding that any economic prosperity that
disregards environmental concerns could not be sustainable.
</P>
<P>
Leadership for Environment and Development, or the LEAD
program, is a non-profit organization that seeks to bring
together a generation of international leaders to carry forth a
vision of sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
The LEAD program was established in direct response to the
growing need for collaborative action in support of the world's
natural and human resources.
</P>
<P>
Following extensive research by prominent individuals in the
field, the Rockefeller Foundation officially launched the LEAD
program in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Dissolves Parliament, Announces Early Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
made his much expected radio-television speech this evening on the
dissolution of the French parliament and the organization of early
legislative elections on May 25 and June 1.
</P>
<P>
After weeks of silence over rumors about the dissolution until
today, Chirac appeared on television with a smile and began his
speech with the straight forward announcement of the parliamentary
dissolution.
</P>
<P>
"My dear compatriots, after consultation with the prime
minister, president of the senate and president of the National
Assembly, I have decided to dissolve the National Assembly," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Although Chirac has given the French people enough time to
prepare for his decision by letting the rumors spread for weeks
without seriously denying them, his decision still came as an
action of gamble.
</P>
<P>
The dissolution is widely believed to be aimed at avoiding an
overlap of the timing of the legislative elections, originally
scheduled for the spring of 1998, and the nearing of the deadline
for meeting the Maastricht Treaty criteria for joining the
European single currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
"My dear compatriots, the time has come for you to speak for
yourselves," said Chirac, adding that he wanted to "give the
speech back to the people, in order that they can express
themselves clearly on the fullness and the rhythm of changes to
come in the next five years."
</P>
<P>
"Today, I think, with conscience, that the interest of the
country commands the moving forward of the elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the French people to support the country's efforts
to join the European Monetary Union (EMU), and in the construction
of a strong European Union because, he said, "union makes power."
</P>
<P>
"For meeting the deadline (of joining EMU) in a position of
force, for constructing a Europe which is respectful of the genius
of the (European) nations which make it up, and which is capable
of rivaling great powers of the world, your adhesion and your
support are essential," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the French voters to "give France a majority
which will have the force and the necessary time for defying the
challenges of today."
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is easy, but we should choose the good road, the one
which puts together justice, solidarity and modernity," he said.

<HEADLINE> Landmines Meeting Turning Point for Southern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A meeting of member states
of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) will mark a
turning point in efforts to free the region of landmines, the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said today.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by ICRC President Cornelio Sommaruga in
Pretoria in a response to the opening of the three-day meeting in
Harare, capital of Zimbabwe, earlier today.
</P>
<P>
Sommaruga said there are more than 30 million landmines on
African continent, causing both human suffering and bringing
social and economic burdens to the governments.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, organized by the ICRC and the Organization of
African Unity, will discuss regional and international
cooperation in mine clearance on the continent.
</P>
<P>
It also offered an opportunity for the states of southern
Africa to take a leading role in the international efforts to
eliminate one of the great scourges of the 20th century, said a
statement by the ICRC Office in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was specifically requested at the October 1996
seminar on landmines in Ottawa, Canada, at which 50 states voted
in favor of a total ban on landmines, said the statement.

sidelines to await the outcome of next week's general election.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares moved off early lows to finish the

<HEADLINE> Democrats Warn Republicans on Chemical Weapons Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Democratic Party
today warned that Republicans will bear the responsibility if the
Senate does not approve the Chemical Weapons Convention this week.
</P>
<P>
The 100-member Senate is expected to start its debate on the
convention Wednesday and vote Thursday. The treaty needs 67 votes,
a two-thirds majority, for approval.
</P>
<P>
"Whether or not we pass the chemical weapons treaty comes down
to whether or not there are 22 Republicans who are willing to
provide the necessary votes," Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"This is as critical an issue as we will find this Congress, or
perhaps this decade," he said. "It is a remarkable important
document that requires U.S. participation and support."
</P>
<P>
The treaty, which bans development, production, stockpiling,
transferring and use of chemical weapons, has been signed by more
than 160 countries and ratified by more than 70 of them. It will
go into effect on April 29.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. will not participate in the treaty if the Senate fails
to approve it.
</P>
<P>
"The Republican Caucus is going to have to decide whether it
wants to be part of the international community or whether it
wants to avoid making the responsibilities and taking on the
initiatives necessary to ensure that we can continue to play the
role of superpower for the world," Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a battle for the heart and soul of the Republican
Party," he added.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone's Rebel Leader not Under House Arrest in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, April 21 (Xinhua) - Sierra Leone's Information
Minister Abdul Bangura said today that disputed rebel leader
Foday Sankoh "is not under house arrest" in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Bangura said, "he is a guest of
the Nigerian government".
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats here said they were "startled" by the
remarks as it added a further confusion on the status of Sankoh
in Nigeria where he has been for the past four weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian Embassy in Sierra Leone issued a statement
recently, saying Sankoh was being investigated on arms carrying
charges.
</P>
<P>
Since then, there has not been any further announcement and
Sankoh in interviews with the BBC had insisted he was not being
held against his will.
</P>
<P>
About three weeks ago, a group of Sankoh's loyalists kidnapped
up to eight officials including Sierra Leone Ambassador to
Guinea Mohamed Diaby, when they went to the rebel camp in far
eastern Sierra Leone to negotiate a replacement of Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said the group holding the hostages over
the weekend warned the Sierra Leone government that unless Sankoh
is released from Nigeria, they will attack the capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Bangura said that he is sceptical about
the threat. "How can they say so when dozens of their colleagues
are surrendering to tribal chiefs in the north?", he asked.

<HEADLINE> French Cease-Fire Monitor Demands Israeli Pullout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A French chief delegate in a
committee supervising breaches of cease-fire on the
Lebanese-Israeli border said here today that the five-nation
committee "can't prevent the tension in south Lebanon with an
Israeli presence there."
</P>
<P>
Jean-Michel Gaussot, head of the French delegation in the
cease-fire monitoring committee, said that only an implementation
of U.S. Security Council Resolution 425, rather than the
committee, is a solution for the south Lebanon problem.
</P>
<P>
Gaussot visited today the Beirut Presidential Palace and
briefed to Lebanese President Elias Hrawi on "works of the
monitoring group, especially during the French chairmanhood, which
started on November 1 and will end on April 30."
</P>
<P>
After a cease-fire understanding between Lebanon and Israel on
April 26, 1996, the committee was established comprising the United
states, France, Israel, Lebanon and Syria. The five-member
committee should be presided in rotation among its members.
</P>
<P>
"Of course this group is not a solution for the south Lebanon
problem, which will only be solved through an implementation of
Resolution 425 or a peace agreement between Lebanon and Syria on
the one side and Israel on the other," Gaussot said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Security Council Resolution 425 calls for an unconditional
Israeli withdrawal from one tenth of Lebanon's territory the
Jewish state occupied in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at the end of his meeting with the
Lebanese president, Gaussot expressed his hope that the tension in
south Lebanon, which is unavoidable as long as Israel refuses to
pull its forces out of the region, would not negatively affect the
civilians.
</P>
<P>
He said, "I think as long as this (Israeli) presence remains,
there is a certain tension, but this tension should not negatively
affect the civilians."
</P>
<P>
The French diplomat also expressed hope that members in the
cease-fire monitoring team will continue to play a "correct role"
after the U.S. taking the chairmanhood from the next
month.

<HEADLINE> Iran Vows Not to Change Policy Despite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei stated here today that the United States can never
force Iran to change its foreign policy by subjecting it to
conspiracies such as the Mykonos case.
</P>
<P>
Ali Khamenei, who is also Commander-in-Chief of the Iranian
Armed Forces, made the statement on the eve of the three-day
maneuvers code-named "Path of Jerusalem" in the southern port
city of Bandar Abbas, about 1,300 kilometers south of the
capital city Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the maneuvers
will be launched in Iran's four provinces this evening in the
presence of Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that the United States and Israel had tried hard
to subject the Iranian government and its people to "what they
call isolation" and separate Iran from Europe and Asia by using
Germany in the Mykonos case.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "They did not succeed in their conspiracy
and they will never succeed."
</P>
<P>
"The Berlin court announced on April 10 a verdict of the 1992
assassination of four Iranian-Kurdish dissidents in the Berlin
Mykonos restaurant, charging Iranian top leaders with ordering
the killing.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader also urged his people, particularly the
youths, to try to neutralize the negative impact of hostile
foreign propaganda.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, no "real or serious dangers" are
undermining the country's borders at the moment. Nevertheless, the
Iranian people should be aware of and watchful over them.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Iran and the United States have been
strained since the two countries broke off diplomatic ties on
April 7, 1980 in the wake of U.S. hostage crisis over which Iran
was accused of masterminding the abduction.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has pursued the dual-containment policy against Iran
and imposed sanctions and embargoes on Iran on the charges of
seeking weapons of mass destruction, sponsoring terrorism and
opposing the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier General Rahim Safavi, Deputy Commander of the Islamic
Revolution's Guards Corps (IRGC), said that 200,000 IRGC men and
volunteer forces will take part in the war games to be held in
Hormuzgan, Bushehr, Khuzestan and Kermanshah provinces in
southern, southwestern and western Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said that the maneuvers are part of the routine war games,
which feature various operations including missile, air, sea and
land operations.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the war games will be of the defensive
nature, during which surface-to-air, surface-to-sea and
surface-to-surface missiles will be tested in the games.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran has no intention of committing any act of
aggression on any other country but has the capability to counter
any of such moves.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Inflation Up Slightly in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Canadian consumers paid an average
of 0.2 percent more in March for the goods and services contained
in the Consumer Price Index basket, Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
The federal agency attributed the slight increase, relative to
February, to price hikes in clothing and footwear, air travel,
packaged travel tours, piped gas and cable television services.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, the rises were partly offset by declines in
gasoline and fuel oil prices, and in mortgage interest charges.
</P>
<P>
The inflation in March was equivalent to a 2.0 percent annual
rate, slightly lower than the previous three months' 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Between March 1996 and March 1997, annual increases in
provincial inflation rate ranged from a low of 0.9 percent in
British Columbia to a high of 3.5 percent in Newfoundland.
</P>
<P>
The extreme low inflation in British Columbia was due largely
to sharp drops in the owned accommodation and auto insurance
indexes, Statistics Canada said.
</P>
<P>
Newfoundland's high rate was the result of larger-than-expected
increases in six of its major component indexes, including food,
clothing and footwear.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Tractor Maker to List in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUOYANG, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The China First Tractor and
Construction Machinery Corporation, the largest farm-machinery
builder in the country, is busy preparing for its upcoming listing
on the Hong Kong stock market.
</P>
<P>
The group, which mainly produces farm tractors along with
automobiles and engineering machinery, is among the 38 firms
selected by the authorities to list overseas this year, and is
expected to issue H shares on the Hong Kong United Exchange later
this year.
</P>
<P>
Dong Yong'an, deputy general manager of the corporation, told
Xinhua in a recent interview that the company plans to combine the
would-be listed company with a dozen of its workshops and
departments that are directly engaged in the manufacturing of
tractors.
</P>
<P>
The board of directors of the proposed listed firm will be its
top decision-maker, though the corporation is to be its largest
stockholder, according to the deputy general manager.
</P>
<P>
China is a major grain producer in the world and grain
production is of great significance to the stability and
development of the country, Dong said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has focused much attention on the farm
machinery industry, as its growth has a direct bearing on the
country's agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, government investment has been increased in
both the agricultural sector and the farm machinery manufacturing
industry. Meanwhile, prosperous farmers have shown enthusiasm for
purchasing tractors and other farm machines, according to Dong.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming listing is likely to have a positive influence
on the country's farm machinery industry.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the corporation turned out some 150,000 tractors of
various types, some with horsepower ranging from 15 to 20.

upper Midwest, U.S. President Bill Clinton today promised a "very
creative" approach to help Dakotans rebuild homes.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was flying to Grand Forks, North Dakota, for a
helicopter tour of the flood-plagued town, where the Red River
swelled over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
He said he was confident that the Congress would approve an
extraordinary aid plan for the flooded region.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was to tour the Grand Forks area by helicopter and then
meet rescue workers and refugees at the Grand Forks Air Force
Base, some 26 kilometers west of the river. More than 2,000
evacuees are staying there.
</P>

Sewage-fouled river water covered 75 percent of Grand Forks and
virtually all of neighboring East Grand Forks, Minnesota, on
Monday. A large section of downtown Grand Forks was destroyed by
fire.
</P>
<P>
Erskine Bowles, White House chief of staff, discussed recovery
plans for the upper Midwest with Cabinet members on Monday and

<HEADLINE> UK House Prices Rise 5 Pct in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- House prices in some parts of
Britain have risen by more than 5 percent in the first three
months of this year, according to a survey published today.
</P>
<P>
More than 10 percent of the 259 estate agents surveyed by the
Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said that house
prices had risen at least 5 percent in the past quarter, the
biggest rise recorded since prices boomed in 1988.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the institution said that the housing market
seemed to be immune to the impending general election, and even
the predicted interest rate rise in early May was unlikely to have
any appreciable effect.
</P>
<P>
However, the RICS denied that the UK was in the grip of a new
housing boom, saying that there were great regional differences in
price performance and demand was not as great as in the late 1980s
and sales were lower.
</P>
<P>
It added that most of the recent upsurge in prices were due to
the buoyancy of markets in a few regions, such as London,
southeast England and the west Midlands, while in other parts of
the country, the recovery had been much more subdued.
</P>
<P>
Transactions, the measure of demand, are currently being made
at a rate of 1.3 million per year compared with the 2.2 million
achieved in 1988.

<HEADLINE> Liu Guoliang Finally Wins Waldner's Respect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, April 22 (Xinhua) -- To win the respect of
the world proudest table tennis player isn't easy.
</P>
<P>
After three consecutive losses with the first one dating back
to 1992, Sweden's Jan-Ove Waldner finally admits Chinese Liu
Guoliang is the best.
</P>
<P>
"I predict the world men's singles title will go to very
talented Liu," said 31-year-old Waldner on Tuesday, the only
player in the world to have won a Grand Slam of the Olympic, world
championship and World Cup titles.
</P>
<P>
It took Liu four years to get the credit from Waldner. The
20-year-old Chinese, who bagged two gold medals in the Atlanta
Olympics last summer and snatched the World Cup two months later,
is now one trophy away from the Swede's greatness.
</P>
<P>
"I have confidence," Liu told Xinhua, but he came short of
revealing how many gold medals he aimed to win in the world
championships which starts on Thursday or if he considered himself
as a favorite for the coveted single title.
</P>
<P>
Liu shot to fame as a 16-year-old at the expense of Waldner in
the China Open months before the 1992 Olympic Games, beating the
more fancied rival in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
Liu Guoliang, whose name means "pillar of the country" in
Chinese, was thus hailed as a reviver of the Chinese traditional
penhold style, which was predicted to end up in a Darwinian-style
extinction as more players were turning to handshake grip.
</P>
<P>
Playing a modified penhold style, Liu sticks rubbers onto both
sides of the racket and plays top spins with backhand.
</P>
<P>
Liu's upset victory over Waldner, who had been taking Chinese
as easy preys since two-time world champion Jiang Jialiang
retired, was a morale booster for the Chinese penholders. Most of
them have resorted to this modified style.
</P>
<P>
Waldner regarded his first loss to Liu as a mere lack of
concentration, promising to give the Chinese youngster a lesson in
their next meeting.
</P>
<P>
It was Liu who gave Waldner a lesson.
</P>
<P>
Leading by five points and with as many serves in his hands,
Waldner wilted under barrages of Liu's backhand top spins and
forehand flat shots, bowing out of the men's singles competition
at the 1995 world championships.
</P>
<P>
A complacent Waldner told reporters before this match that he
expected to take on Chinese lefthander Wang Tao in the
semi-finals. But he never made that far.
</P>
<P>
Liu's last fight with Waldner was a clash of two contrasting
styles and the world best servers. Liu took it seriously, so did
Waldner.
</P>
<P>
It turned out that Liu was a mount too high for Waldner to
scale as the Swede's rallying play was a mere interlude to Liu's
re-assertion of his authority in the game.
</P>
<P>
En route to the final against Waldner, Liu had beaten European
aces Vladimir Samsonov of Belarus, Zoran Primorac of Croatia,
Patrick Chila of France and Jean-Michael Saive of Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his 1-3 defeat in the World Cup, Waldner said his
loss could have been worse.
</P>
<P>
"I should have lost 3-0," he said. "It was a much easier game
for Liu than when I lost in the 1995 world championships where I
had led 10-5 in the final set."
</P>
<P>
Despite an impressive record against Europeans, Liu often falls
victim to his teammates and South Koreans.
</P>
<P>
He has never beaten world No. 1 Kong Linghui in major
competition and holds a poor record against Wang Tao.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Kim Taek Soo has handed two straight defeats to
Liu after the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
"Asian players are familiar with my style, but European players
aren't," Liu said.

<HEADLINE> New System to Administer Graphic Design Archive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Qinghua University, China's top
technical institution of higher learning, has newly developed a
system to administer graphic design archives, marking a change in
the traditional method of hand-drawn designs.
</P>
<P>
The high-tech system combines the most advanced techniques
available from Qinghua, Intergraph and Micron, according to the
developer, the Qinghua Unisplendour Group run by Qinghua
University.
</P>
<P>
With the new system, engineering designs will no longer have to
be drawn by hand, which liberates designers from the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
The system was announced here today in a meeting focusing on
the application of computer-aided design (CAD) technology.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the application of the graphic design computer
program will also give impetus to the popularity of CAD technology
in China.
</P>
<P>
CAD is a main element of electronic information technology, and
a fundamental technology needed for the build-up of the
information sector.
</P>
<P>
CAD is rapidly becoming widespread in China, but the main
software still needs to be imported from overseas.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Join Euro Despite Missing Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Doubts about Germany's ability to
make the grade for joining the single European currency gained new
ground today as the country's six leading economic institutes
joined the pessimists' club.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the six institutes, which jointly issued a spring
economic report Tuesday, still believed that Germany would still
managed to make the first wave to join the common currency -- the
Euro, which is due to be launched on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Most probably, Germany would not fail to join the European
Monetary Union," they said, raising the possibility that the tough
requirements set by the European Union for Euro membership might
be softened eventually.
</P>
<P>
According to projections of the six institutes, the country's
leading think tanks, Germany would overshoot the three percent
budget deficit limit required by the EU Maastricht Treaty for
participating in the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Germany would run a budget deficit equivalent to 3.2 percent of
gross domestic product (GDP) in 1997, instead of 2.9 percent
predicted by the government, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It is also expected to miss another key Euro target by posting
a public debt of 62 percent of GDP this year, above the 60 percent
limit required by the EU Maastricht Treaty, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Under the timetable for establishing the Euro, 1997 is a
crucial year because decision on which countries will be able to
make the first wave to join the Euro is expected to be made in May
1998, based on full economic data of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Given ongoing attempts by the government to slash state
spending, the report said, it might still be possible for Germany
to meet the three percent budgetary threshold.
</P>
<P>
But it would no longer be possible for Germany to bring overall
public debt below the 60 percent mark, mainly due to the massive
costs of the 1990 German reunification, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report was written by the German Institute for Economic
Research in Berlin, the Institute for Economic Research in
Hamburg, the Institute for Economic Research in Munich, the
Institute for World Economy in Kiel, the Institute for Economic
Research in Halle and the Rheinisch-Westfaelisches Institute for
Economic Research in Essen.
</P>
<P>
The six leading economic institutes issue a state of economy
report each spring and autumn.
</P>
<P>
Their joint reports, together with the annual economic report
by the government in January and the autumn report by the so-call
"five wise men," a politically independent economic advisory
panel, are recognized as the most important economic projections
for the country.

HARARE, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Export Processing Zone Authority
of Zimbabwe has in the past few weeks approved 26 projects worth 209
million US dollars capable of creating at least 3,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
The authority today said of the projects, 22 were
industrial ones, while the remaining were industrial park
development projects which, in addition to the direct jobs to be
created, would offer employment to thousands more in downstream
industries.

<P>
The authority was established by the act of parliament in 1994
with the specific aim of promoting export-oriented projects.
</P>
<P>
Last year, direct foreign investment into zimbabwe exceeded 863
million US dollars, which would create more than 12,000 jobs over a

<HEADLINE> Canada's Retail Up 1.1 Percent in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales in Canada recorded a
large increase of 1.1 percent in February, following a 1.0 percent
rise in January, Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
With the monthly increase, said the federal government agency
in a report, Canada's total retail sales for February rose to an
equivalent of 13.4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"While a pause was observed in December...retail sales have
been steaming ahead since October 1996. The positive results of
recent months give a strong start to 1997," it said.
</P>
<P>
Low interest rates are believed to be the driving force behind
the broadly based advances reported by Canadian retailers.
</P>
<P>
Consumers spent more in February compared with January in each
of the seven retail trade sectors in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Sales advanced the most in the general merchandise stores
sector (3.7 percent), followed by gains in the automotive sector
(1.0 percent) and furniture stores sector (2.0 percent).
</P>
<P>
Together, these three sectors accounted for over four-fifths of
the February increase, Statistics Canada said.

FUZHOU, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Fujian Province in southeast China
will stage a campaign to prevent the spread of drugs and drug
abuse, according to a provincial working conference on drugs held
here today.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the provincial government outlined its
anti-drug duties, which include closely controlling the number of
newly-reported drug addicts, eliminating the planting of opium
poppies, destroying drug-processing plants, cracking down on drug
crimes, and strengthening the anti-drug publicity drive.
</P>
<P>
The coastal province has achieved remarkable success in its
anti-drug efforts. In 1996, it cracked 863 drug cases, three times
the figure of 1995, and it arrested a total of 836 people on drug
charges.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1996, the province had solved 1,453 cases,
destroying 38 underground workshops which make the drug "ice,"
seizing about 2,700 kg of various kinds of drugs, and capturing
more than 2,000 criminals.
</P>
<P>
Efforts have also been made to help drug addicts kick the
habit, with drug rehabilitation centers being built in Fuzhou,
Xiamen, and Fuqing.

<HEADLINE> China's Determination to Enter WTO Consistent: Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said here
today that China's policy on entering the World Trade Organization
is consistent, and the issue of China's entry shouldn't be
politicalized.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with WTO director-general Renato Ruggiero, Li
reiterated that the requirements for China's entry should not
exceed its present economic development level.
</P>
<P>
Li thanked Ruggiero for his concern over China's accession to
the organization, saying China attaches great importance to the
multi-lateral trade mechanism represented by WTO, and supports its
role in world economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
At present, economic links between countries as well as
regional coordination are improving, and this is beneficial to
both bilateral and multi-lateral economic and trade cooperation,
the Premier said.
</P>
<P>
Any country and region that wants to seek economic development
should reinforce economic and trade coordination, Li said, adding
that China has strengthened its economic ties with the outside
world through reform and opening up.
</P>
<P>
The Premier said that China's development cannot be separated
from the world, and in return, the world development is
inseparable from China. China will continue its talks with
relevant countries proceeding from the balance between rights and
obligations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the latter half of last year, negotiations on China's
entry have witnessed certain progress. However, Li said, China is
still a developing country with imbalanced development.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the world economic and trade situation is
still characterized by inequality, exchange of unequal value, and
power politics such as imposing sanctions. This conforms neither
to the principle of equality and mutual benefit, nor to the
developing trend of the world situation and relations, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero said that over the past few days, he visited both
China's developing cities and relatively backward countryside, and
China's reform, opening up and economic progress left a deep
impression on him.
</P>
<P>
China's entry to the WTO benefits not only China but the world
as a whole, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Director-General, who has always been concerned about
China's entry to the WTO, said he will continue his efforts for
the promotion of negotiations in a bid to realize China's early
entry.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Desert Oilfield Goes into Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Tazhong No.4 Oilfield,
China's largest desert oilfield lying in the Tarim Basin of the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, recently went into operation,
with daily crude output topping 5,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
According to a China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) source, the
oilfield was discovered by the Tarim Oil Exploration Headquarters
in the heartland of the Taklimakan Desert in 1992, which covers a
total oil-bearing area of 35.7 sq km and has oil reserves of over
93 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The CNPC source noted that the oilfield was first explored on a
trial basis in 1994, with an expected annual crude production
capacity of two million tons. A total of 40 oil wells have been
sunk over the past three years, using advanced desert drilling
technology.
</P>
<P>
To date, the Tazhong No.4 Oilfield has developed an updated oil
storage installation and a computer monitoring system. The crude
turned out by the oilfield is piped to the city of Korla, some 500
km away.
</P>
<P>
The Tazhong No.4 Oilfield is the fifth that has been developed
in the Tarim Basin, which together with the other four has
produced an annual crude output of 4.4 million tons.

<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng met with
Chairman of the Kazakhstan Lower House Marat Ospanov here today,
saying that China is ready to work with the central Asia nation to
build a comprehensive cooperative partnership facing the 21st
century on the basis of the five principles of peaceful
co-existence.
</P>
<P>
Li said that in the five years since the two countries set up
diplomatic ties, exchange of visits by high-ranking officials
between the two sides has been frequent, mutual understanding and
trust have been deepened and cooperation in all fields expanded.
</P>
<P>
He said that the signing of a series of agreements among China,
Kazakhstan and their neighbors will not only benefit the good
neighborly friendship and mutual beneficial cooperation between
China and Kazakhstan, but also has great significance for the
maintenance of peace in the Asia-Pacific region and the world as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Kazakhstan in 1994, Li and President
Nursultan Abishevich Nazarbayev signed an agreement concerning the
borders between the two countries. China, Kazakhstan, Russia,
Kirghizstan and Tadzhikistan signed an agreement on confidence
building in military fields in border areas last April.
</P>
<P>
The five countries will sign yet another important multilateral
agreement soon.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that in recent years, China's National People's
Congress (NPC) and the parliament of Kazakhstan have forged sound
cooperative relations, which plays an important role in the
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said he wishes that the two countries will maintain the
positive momentum of bilateral relations and continue to
contribute to the development of the friendship and good
neighborly and two-way cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Ospanov said that he is deeply impressed with China's reform,
opening up and economic development, and wishes that the bilateral
relations should be further strengthened in order to promote trade
between the two countries that will benefit both sides.

<HEADLINE> HK Consumer Price Indices Rise Moderately in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Consumer Price Index (CPI)
(A), covering the largest percentage of households in Hong Kong,
recorded a 5.7 percent year-on-year growth in March, down from
that of 6.5 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
The CPI figures for March was released here today by the Census
and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
CPI (A) covers 50 percent households in Hong Kong whose monthly
expenditures are between 3,900 and 16,000 HK dollars (503 to 2,065
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, CPI (B), which is based on the expenditure
pattern of 30 percent households with expenditures between 16,000
and 28,500 HK dollars (2,064 to 3,677 US dollars), rose 5.8
percent over last year, also slower than that of 6.1 percent in
February.
</P>
<P>
However, the corresponding rate of increase in the Hang Seng

<HEADLINE> Table Tennis Worlds, A Show for Oldies? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Andrzej Grubba,
Jan-Ove Waldner and Johnny Huang have proved that table tennis
isn't a sport only for the young.
</P>
<P>
Even though table tennis requires reflexes, agility, power and
speed, those no longer as quick about court as before insist they
can catch up with the young through their experiences.
</P>
<P>
"Table tennis is an art more than a sport and its minute and
fine maneuvers can be easily done by those players with
experiences," said Grubba, the oldest player among the world top
20 who is to celebrate his 39th birthday nine days after the world
championships ends on May 5.
</P>
<P>
The Polish star, nicknamed a "table tennis comedian" for his
on-court gimmicks, amazed Chinese officials after winning the
Malaysian Open last year which had a strong field including
China's world top players Kong Linghui and Liu Guoliang, both at
20.
</P>
<P>
"It's incredible," said Li Furong, former world champion and
now a top sports official in China. "Chinese should learn from
Europeans on how to prolong the career."
</P>
<P>
Waldner, who won Sweden's only gold medal in the Barcelona
Olympic Games, never showed his years in the Qatar Open in
February, the last major tournament before the world championships.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Waldner nipped world champion Kong Linghui for
the fourth straight time in the semi-finals and beat the
20-year-old European top player Vladimir Samsonov from Belarus for
the 30,000 U.S. dollars winner's prize. He also combined with his
30-year-old teammate Jorgen Persson to take the team top honor.
</P>
<P>
Waldner is to lead an aging Swedish men's team, whose youngest
member is 28-year-old Peter Karlsson, for a crack at the world
team championship which they had been holding for six years before
being dethroned by China in the 1995 Worlds.
</P>
<P>
Chinese sports officials have put their players on high alert
against the Swedish team.
</P>
<P>
Xu Yinsheng, president of the the Chinese Table Tennis
Association who also heads International Table Tennis Federation,
warned last month that rising complacency might cost the Chinese
gold medals in the Manchester championships.
</P>
<P>
"Some players think the aging Swedish team is now easy to deal
with, it's completely wrong," said Xu, also vice minister of the
Chinese Physical Culture and Sports Commission.
</P>
<P>
"Age means experience. Don't belittle Waldner, Persson and
(Erik) Lindh," Xu warned.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Johnny Huang and Frenchman Jean-Philippe Gatien are
other old-timers tipped to shine in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
Huang, 34, regained his form in the Atlanta Games, foiling
Waldner's hope to defend the singles title, while 1993 world
champion Gatien, 29, has found his touch after lifting the elite
title in the European top 12 tournament in February.
</P>
<P>
There are many old players active in the women's table tennis
as well. Japanese Koyama Chire, 32, Cha Po Wa of Hong Kong, 31,
Geng Lijuan of Canada, 34, Chen Jing of Chinese Taipei, 28, are
expected to challenge the Chinese team led by world No. 1 Deng
Yaping.

<HEADLINE> Ansett Australia To Initiate Sydney-Shanghai Route </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Ansett Australia, one of the two
air carriers in Australia, is to initiate in early June a
twice-a-week flight between Sydney and Shanghai, the company's
first route to China, General Manager of Ansett International
Craig Wallace said here today.
</P>
<P>
The new service will allow Ansett to contribute to the
developing trade and tourism growth between Australia and China,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ongoing PATA (Pacific Asia Travel Association)
46th annual conference today, Wallace said, "Operating to Shanghai
gives us access to one of the region's fastest-growing inbound
markets."
</P>
<P>
"That growth provides our airline with considerable opportunity
to increase our strength in the highly-competitive Asian market,"
he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He added Ansett would also provide air service to the emerging
outbound tourism market, which is expected to deliver a total of
350,000 Chinese visitors per year to Australia by 2001.
</P>
<P>
The number of passengers traveling between Australia and China
has increased by close to 30 percent over the past three years,
according to the Australian Tourist Commission.
</P>
<P>
Wallace noted that Ansett has reached a commercial agreement
with the Shanghai-based China Eastern Airlines, which provides for
ground handling operations, potential code-shared flights between
the two countries, and domestic flights to cities within China
Eastern's extensive internal network.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that Ansett plans to increase the number of flights
between Sydney and Shanghai to four times a week by this November,
and to six times by November 1998, adding that it hopes to open
flights to other Chinese cities such as Beijing in the future.
</P>
<P>
Ansett, which has focused on the domestic market for decades,
started its first international service to Denpasar, Indonesia, in
1993. It now operates international flights to eight destinations,
all in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The carrier opened its first China office in Shanghai last
month, according to Wallace.
</P>
<P>
Air China and Quantas, the two countries' flag carriers, are
now each operating twice-a-week flights between Beijing and
Sydney, and China Eastern initiated a Beijing-Shanghai-Sydney
service last September, also twice a week.

major force among developing countries. China always cherishes its
traditional friendship with African countries and regards its
relations with the countries as special ones that endure
hardships, he said.
</P>
<P>
Boubacar said that the development of the friendly cooperative
relations between the two countries is not only in the interest of
the two peoples, but also beneficial to the promotion of
solidarity and cooperation among all developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Chocolate-flavored Carrots On Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Chocolate-flavored carrots and
pizza-flavored corn went on sale on Monday, as the Cancer Research
Campaign (CRC) joined forces with the frozen food chain, Iceland,
to encourage children to eat vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Baked-bean-flavored peas and cheese and onion-flavored
cauliflower are also among a new range of frozen vegetables aimed
at children, the Daily Telegraph reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Professor Gordon McVie, director general of the CRC, who
suggested the idea, said about 300,000 people a year got cancer
and one-third of the cases were thought to be related to poor diet.
</P>
<P>
"There is a clear link between a diet high in vegetables and
cancer prevention, yet recent research highlighted that mums are
losing the battle to get their kids to eat vegetables," said McVie.
</P>
<P>
He said he came up with the idea when shopping in a
supermarket. He saw a huge variety of flavored crisps (potato
chips) and it occurred to him that the same could be done with
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
"These products are designed for children. Adults in the main
are not thrilled with them," said Malcolm Walker, chairman of
Iceland. "We expect to sell these products in great quantities."
</P>
<P>
Frozen food stores will sell chocolate-flavored carrots for 99
pence for a one pound bag or 1.29 pounds for a two-pound
bag.

<HEADLINE> Qiao Shi Meets Finnish Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Qiao Shi
told visiting Finnish Defense Minister Anneli Taina that the two
countries should develop their relationship on the basis of the
Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence.
</P>
<P>
In today's meeting with Taina, who is the first Finnish defense
minister to visit China since diplomatic relations were forged,
Qiao said that Finland also is one of the first Western nations to
set up diplomatic ties with China, and that bilateral relations in
various areas have been good in recent years.
</P>
<P>
China respects the policies made by Finland, which are in
keeping with its own national characteristics, he noted.
</P>
<P>
At Tiana's request, Qiao briefed her on China's position on the
human rights issue.
</P>
<P>
He said that China proposes to increase dialogue, not
confrontation, in the human rights issue, noting that it is normal
to have different views on the subject.
</P>
<P>
"This issue should be settled through dialogue," he said. "And
it is better for each country to handle this matter on its own."
</P>
<P>
China opposes certain powers engaging in confrontation with
China and interfering in its internal affairs concerning this
issue, he stated.
</P>
<P>
"More and more countries have come to realize that
confrontation is not the way to solve the problems, and dialogue
is better than confrontation," he noted.
</P>
<P>
With unique characteristics, China opposes hegemonism and power
politics, holds that each nation should be equal, no matter how
big or small, rich or poor, powerful or weak, and should not

<HEADLINE> Waldner, Samsonov Top Chinese "Blacklist" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Sweden's 1992 Olympic
champion Jan-Ove Waldner and Belarus' rising star Vladimir
Samsonov have been "blacklisted" as the top threats to the Chinese
table tennis players bidding for a repeat of the seven-title sweep
at the World Table Tennis Championships.
</P>
<P>
Old enemies are still there and young foes are coming, Chinese
sports officials warn their players who have allegedly become
complacent after sweeping the table tennis titles in the Atlanta
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Waldner, 31, the only table tennis Grand Slam winner in the
world and one of the sport's all time greats, is just one of the
old enemies whereas 20-year-old Samsonov has become a foe worthy
of Chinese steel.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team, which wrapped up all seven events in the 1995
Worlds in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin, faces an uphill
battle to regain as much glory here because of an enlarging army
of rivals.
</P>
<P>
A "blacklist" of title contenders from outside China, drawn by
Chinese coaches Cai Zhenhua and Lu Yuansheng, rates Waldner and
Samsonov as China's No. 1 threats among the eight "very strong
rivals".
</P>
<P>
Waldner, the only player in the world who has won the Olympic,
world championship and World Cup titles, showed his killing
instinct in the Qatar Open in February, taking the men's singles
event after leading an aging Swedish squad atop the team podium.
</P>
<P>
The Swede, who suffered an early exit partly because of thumb
injury at the Atlanta Olympic Games last summer, is able to peak
at the right time, said Cai Zhenhua, Waldner's major rival in the
1980s who now heads the Chinese men's team.
</P>
<P>
"Waldner is a man of magic," Cai said. "He may play poorly in a
lesser tournament, but when a big event like world championships
comes, he can easily motivate himself."
</P>
<P>
Waldner, known for his deceptive serves and supreme ability to
change the tactics during the game, keeps a 4-0 record against
China's world No. 1 Kong Linghui and has beaten another Chinese
ace Ma Wenge twice in five months.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov, who has had the scalps of all European top players,
has given scare to Chinese after handing two recent losses to the
nation's top defensive player Ding Song, who jumped to fame after
ending the singles run of European stars Jean-Michael Saive of
Belgium and Jorgen Persson of Sweden in the last Worlds.
</P>
<P>
"Samsonov is an all-around player and he has everything a world
champion should have," Cai said.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Kim Taek Soo, German Jorg Rosskopf, Saive,
Croatian Zoran Primorac, Frenchman Jean-Philippe Gatien and Petr
Koppel from Czech Republic are other "very strong rivals" for the
Chinese men players.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese coaches also named 14 players as "serious
rivals". They include Persson, Frenchman Patrick Chila and Polish
veteran Andrzej Grubba, who is to celebrate his 39th birthday nine
days after the end of the championships.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yuansheng, head coach of the Chinese women's team, expected
his players to meet strong challenges from former Chinese playing
for their adopted countries or regions.
</P>
<P>
"The main rivals will be these players familiar with our styles
and tactics," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Topping Lu's list of possible rivals are Chen Jing of Chinese
Taipei and Chire Koyama of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jing, the 1988 Olympic champion, won the silver medal for
Chinese Taipei both in the 1993 Worlds and the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
Koyama, who caused an uproar in China with an upset victory
over China's world No. 1 Deng Yaping at the Hiroshima Asian Games
in 1994, regained her touch in the Asian championships last
December where she beat five Chinese youngsters en route to
picking up the singles title.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's Chai Po Wa, Germany's Jie Schopp and Ni Xia Lian of
Luxembourg, all former Chinese nationals, may also give some
troubles to the Chinese, Lu said.

<HEADLINE> Think Tanks Predict 2.25 Percent GDP Growth for Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Germany's leading economic
institutes predicted today that the country's gross domestic
product (GDP) will increase by 2.25 percent this year, lower than
the 2.5 percent expected by the government.
</P>
<P>
In a joint spring economic report, the six institutes, the
country's leading think tanks, said a slump in construction
industry should be blamed for the lower-than-expected GDP growth,
but exports are expected to grow by a robust 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Germany could expect a 2.75 percent GDP growth in 1998, the
country's next general election year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report also painted a gloomy picture of the job market,
predicting that unemployment will average 4.28 million people, or
11.2 percent of the workforce, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the report commented, German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's pledge to cut the country's jobless rate by half by the
year 2000 could be impossible to deliver.
</P>
<P>
The institutes predicted that inflation is set to remain low at
1.5 to 1.75 percent in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Boosted by a continued weaker dollar, the country's trade
surplus is expected to be 140 billion marks (about 82 billion
U.S. dollars) in 1998, the first time it will reach this level
since 1989, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report was written by the German Institute for Economic
Research in Berlin, the Institute for Economic Research in
Hamburg, the Institute for Economic Research in Munich, the
Institute for World Economy in Kiel, the Institute for Economic
Research in Halle and the Rheinisch-Westfaelisches Institute for
Economic Research in Essen.
</P>
<P>
The six leading economic institutes issue a state of economy
report each spring and autumn.
</P>
<P>
Their joint reports, together with the annual economic report
by the government in January and the autumn report by the so-call
"five wise men," a politically independent economic advisory
panel, are recognized as the most important economic projections
for the country.

<HEADLINE> HK Telecom to Offer High-speed Digital Data Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Hongkong Telecom today signed a
memorandum of understanding with AT&AMP;T to provide a high-speed
digital international private line service which will benefit
Internet Service Providers, financial institutions and other
multinational companies.
</P>
<P>
According to Hongkong Telecom, transmission speed of the new
service will reach 44.737 Mbps and marks the first such agreement
for high speed, high-bandwidth transmission between Hong Kong and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Hongkong Telecom International and AT&AMP;T
are responsible for the development of the network architecture so
that proper maintenance, testing provisioning, service performance
and other related issues will be addressed.
</P>
<P>
In addition, both parties will provide the necessary technical
modifications and share management of the international portion of
their respective services. Work on the service is expected for
completion by the third quarter of this year.

enhancing the territory's international connectivity which
reinforces Hong Kong's position as the hub of Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said that the new service will help meet the needs of
customers for high speed transmission and it enables multinational
business to send and receive large amounts of digital data at
speeds of up to 45 million bits per second, the equivalent of
transmitting the contents of a set of encyclopedia once every 15
seconds.
</P>
<P>
Typical service applications include Internet, multimedia,
video imaging and LAN-to-LAN interconnection, and CAD/CAM.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong To Open New Cross Harbor Tunnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 22 (Xinhua) -- A third cross harbor tunnel
which links the Kowloon Peninsula and the Hong Kong Island is to
be opened at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
With a designed capacity of handling 180,000 vehicles a day,
the Western Harbor Tunnel is expected to ease the traffic
congestion cross the Victoria Harbor.
</P>
<P>
The two existing crossings, the Cross Harbor Tunnel and the
Eastern Harbor Tunnel, each with two lanes, are now capable of
handling a total of 200,000 to 210,000 vehicles a day.
</P>
<P>
When putting into operation on April 30, the 2-km tunnel will
add six lanes and boost the cross-harbor traffic capacity by 75
percent, said Robert Adams, chairman of the Western Harbor Tunnel
Company Limited.
</P>
<P>
The tunnel is estimated to take in 50,000 to 70,000 vehicles a
day at the initial stage of operation and may reach its full
capacity in ten years.
</P>
<P>
The new tunnel, connecting Sai Ying Pun on the west of Hong
Kong Island and the southern end of the West Kowloon Reclamation,
is at the conjunction point of several trunk expressways,
including the one westwards to the New Airport being constructed
at Chek Lop Kok.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Western Harbor Crossing is the only privately
funded project out of the ten Airport Core Programs.
</P>
<P>
It took nearly three years to complete the Western Harbor
Tunnel, which cost 7.5 billion HK dollars (about 1 billion US
dollars).

<HEADLINE> Australian dollar Falls Due to Wage Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- A controversial wage claim by
the trade unions was rejected by the Australian Industrial
Relations Commission  (AIRC) today, that left the Australian
dollar 15 cents lower.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 77.59 US cents down from 77.74
at Monday's close.
</P>
<P>
The wage claim had been a source of concern to the Reserve Bank
of Australia, as having the potential to increase inflationary
pressures through boosting wages growth.
</P>
<P>
In its findings today, the AIRC cited the Reserve Bank's
concerns and granted a 10 Australian dollars (7.8 US dollars) a
week flat increase, compared to the unions' 20 Australian dollars
(15.6 US dollars) a week claim.
</P>
<P>
On today's cross-rates, the Australian dollar was at 97.61 yen
from 97.47 yen against the Japanese yen and was at 1.3211 marks
from 1.3248 marks against the German mark.

<P>
MACAO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The number of mobile phone users in
 Macao increased to 44,669 in 1996, up 22 percent from that in
1995, the Macao Telecommunications Company (CTM) said in an
annual report.
</P>
<P>
CTM established a total of 161,485 telephone lines by the end
of last year following the company's operation in 1981. That means
 one telephone for fewer than three residents in the territory.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Macao residents' long-distance calls added up to 1.8
million hours, up 3.7 percent from 1995, according to the report
issued on Monday.
</P>
<P>
As a result, CTM made a total profit of 273.9 million patacas
(about 34.67 million U.S. dollars), an increase of 3 percent from
1995.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the report said the value of the company's total
assets amounted to 1.738 billion patacas (about 220 million
dollars), with investment exceeding 2.5 billion patacas (about 316
 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Can Achieve 7 Percent Growth by 2000: ESCAP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will be able to achieve
a growth rate of up to seven percent by the year 2000 if the
current trends in the economy continue, said the Economic and
Social Cooperation of Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) under the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Increased level of foreign direct investment and improved labor
productivity could further increase the growth rate, said an ESCAP
survey report released here today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that during the 1980s Bangladesh achieved a
growth rate of 4.3 percent, but a population growth rate of over
two percent left little room for an increase in per capita income.
</P>
<P>
However, Bangladesh has been successful in reducing average
annual inflation rate from about 10 percent in 1981-1990 to just
above four percent in 1991-1995.
</P>
<P>
The most recent trends indicate a tendency for inflation to
stabilize at that low level or to come down further, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The ESCAP further said that recent policy initiatives have
emphasized continued price stability along with greater
mobilization of domestic resources. To that end, monetary and
fiscal reforms have been carried out, the report added.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the targeted economy growth, the report also
emphasized the need for improved education, reduced corruption,
trade liberalization and regional cooperation.

<HEADLINE> China Funds Rank Top in Performance for Third Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 22 (Xinhua) -- China equity funds came at the
top of the performance table in March with an annual return of 52
percent, a survey by the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association
(HKIFA) showed today.
</P>
<P>
This sector also came first in both January and February 1997.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing the performance of the sector, Peter Lord, vice
chairman of the HKIFA, said, "The strong returns posted were
mainly related to the strength of the China market, especially
after the interest rates reductions in May and August of 1996, and
there are further signs that inflation has slowed down."
</P>
<P>
The second leading sector was Latin American equity funds,
posting an annual return of 32 percent. In February, it also came
second on the performance table, the first time since mid-1995
when this category was added to the fund report.
</P>
<P>
Of the top 15 sectors, only four were Asian ones, namely China,
Malaysia, Hong Kong and Indonesia, while among the bottom 15
sectors, 10 were Asian-Pacific equities or warrants funds, the
survey found.
</P>
<P>
This was probably because of the concern over further
U.S. interest rates hikes after the 25 basis point increase and
the fact that several Asian countries were plagued by weak export
volumes or other domestic problems.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Miss Euro Targets, Leading Think Tanks Predict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Doubts about Germany's ability to
make the grade for joining the single European currency gained new
ground today as the country's six leading economic institutes
joined the pessimists' club.
</P>
<P>
In a joint spring economic report released today, the six
institutes predicted that Germany would overshoot the three
percent budget deficit limit set by the European Union (EU) for
member states to qualify for the common currency -- the Euro,
which is due to be launched on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Germany would run a budget deficit equivalent to 3.2 percent of
gross domestic product (GDP) in 1997, instead of 2.9 percent
predicted by the government, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It is also expected to miss another key Euro target by posting
a public debt of 62 percent of GDP this year, above the 60 percent
limit required by the EU Maastricht Treaty, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Under the timetable for establishing the Euro, 1997 is a
crucial year because decision on which countries will be able to
make the first wave to join the Euro is expected to be made in May
1998, based on full economic data of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Given ongoing attempts by the government to slash state
spending, the report said, it might still be possible for Germany
to meet the three percent budgetary threshold.
</P>
<P>
But it would no longer be possible for Germany to bring overall
public debt below the 60 percent mark, mainly due to the massive
costs of the 1990 German reunification, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Observers said a failure of Europe's largest economy to meet
the Euro targets would raise the specter that the 1999 launch of
the Euro may have to be delayed for one or two years, or the
qualification requirements may be softened.
</P>
<P>
Germany's six leading economic institutes issue a state of
economy report each spring and autumn.
</P>
<P>
They are the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin,
the Institute for Economic Research in Hamburg, the Institute for
Economic Research in Munich, the Institute for World Economy in

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Have Third University </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Singapore is to have its third
university to provide more opportunities for Singaporeans to
pursue studies at tertiary level, as the Singapore Institute of
Management (SIM) has decided to expand its courses with a view to
eventually attaining university status, Deputy Prime Minister Tony
Tan said today.
</P>
<P>
"The government will support SIM in its efforts to develop the
institute into a private university. Government support can
include both the provision of land and development grants as well
as per-capita recurrent grant," the deputy prime minister, who is
also in charge of the republic's current two universities, said at
an annual meeting of the SIM.
</P>
<P>
The SIM was set up in 1964 as a non-profit professional
organization to enhance managerial and organizational
effectiveness in Singapore. Over the years, the institute has
evolved and expanded to meet the needs of Singaporeans for
continuing education.
</P>
<P>
Tony Tan said, "SIM has grown from strength to strength, and
has now acquired a well-deserved reputation as a leading human
resource development organization in Singapore."
</P>
<P>
To achieve the objective of becoming a private university, the
SIM Council has decided to set up an Academic Board to be chaired
by Dr Cham Tao Soon, president of the Nanyang Technological
University.
</P>
<P>
The Academic Board will report to the SIM Council and will take
charge of academic matters and streamline courses which are
currently being conducted at SIM.
</P>
<P>
The council has also decided to appoint a task force which will
report to the Academic Board and will undertake a detailed review
of SIM's programs.
</P>
<P>
To develop SIM into a private university, Tony Tan also called
on the private sector to be "strongly involved in the running of
SIM and in determining what type of degrees or courses SIM should
conduct."
</P>
<P>
He said that the SIM should also make arrangements, possibly by
setting up a subsidiary, to continue to run the part-time programs
SIM presently offers in collaboration with foreign universities
and training institutions.
</P>
<P>
This subsidiary could also operate the Open University Degree
Program and help to cater to the needs of Singaporeans who wish to
upgrade themselves, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that it will be the task of the SIM Council to
work with the Academic Board, the Task Force and the SIM
administration to work out a strategic plan for SIM's development
into a private university complementing the present National
University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University and
specializing in financial and business courses.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Switches to Natural Gas Option </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Maximizing natural gas utilization
has become the core of Egypt's energy strategy to protect
environment, support local demand and keep its status as a net
oil exporter, Minister of Oil Hamdi el-Banbi said here today.
</P>
<P>
Banbi told a press conference that Egypt has encouraged the
use of compressed natural gas (CNG) in vehicles since 1992, as a
substitute for polluting fuels.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the penetration of natural gas in the local market
has been real fast, either replacing liquid fuels in power
generation, partially substituting gasoline and gas oil as a
transportation fuel or partially substituting liquefied gas in
domestic sector.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, natural gas consumption reached 10.1 million tonnes,
representing about 35 percent of the total hydrocarbons
consumption compared with 12 percent in 1982, according to the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Now about 80 percent of thermal power stations have been
converted to use natural gas while natural gas has gained more
ground in the local energy scene, he said.
</P>
<P>
From 1992 up till now, 439 vehicles and 645 taxis, trucks and
buses were converted to operate with compressed natural gas
besides gas or diesel, Banbi said.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that the use of 3.75 trillion cubic
feet of natural gas in different sectors from 1976-1995 has
successfully prohibited emissions of large amount of sulphur and
carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, infrastructure for the use of CNG as vehicular fuel
is steadily growing with eight refueling stations constructed and 13
others expected to operate this year.
</P>
<P>
Today, Egypt is producing an average of 900,000 barrels
of oil and 1.6 billion cubic feet of gas per day, which provides
about 92 percent of the total energy need and allows export of
surplus oil.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "natural gas option" has also contributed to
curbing the growing trend of annual oil consumption from 3
percent in 1982 to 0.3 percent in 1995, Banbi said.
</P>
<P>
The levels of oil exports was maintained at 11 million tonnes
in 1996, accounting for less than a quarter of total production,
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Besides natural gas, Egypt also resorts to other air control
approaches, such as sulphur limitations in fuel, lead reduction
in gas and production and marketing of unleaded gas in Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Report: Iraq Sends Helicopters to Border With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has sent helicopters to
its joint border with Saudi Arabia to carry back Iraqi pilgrims in
defying a no-fly zone enforced by U.S. warplanes, the official
Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
It said that a number of helicopters flew Monday and today to
the border to bring home Iraqis returning from the annual Muslim
pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
The helicopters flew to Arar along the Iraqi-Saudi border,
which is 350 kilometers southwest of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The United States urged Iraq to stay out of the no-fly zone or
face retaliation Monday following the announcement by Iraq to send
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
However, the INA Monday quoted an authoritative source as
warning the United States against molesting the Iraqi helicopters.
</P>
<P>
"Any U.S. action that threatens the security of the
helicopters and the pilgrims will be met with the suitable
response to deter aggression" because Iraq has an inalienable
right to use its civilian aircraft, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq did actually exercise that right when it ran a flight
carrying a number of Iraqi pilgrims to the Saudi port city of
Jeddah on April 9, the source added.
</P>
<P>
Western allies set up the no-fly zone after the 1991 Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Works for Infra-African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is now working for having
direct access to telecommunications with other western African
countries, Lieutenant-General Oladipo Diya, the Chief of General
Staff, said in Abuja on Monday.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar on Internet services in sub-Saharan Africa, the
second-placed Nigerian leader said the project will "remove the
delay and frustration that African countries face in establishing
telecommunications link directly between themselves".
</P>
<P>
A majority of telecommunications between African countries are
currently routed through London for Anglophone countries and
Paris for Francophone countries, which makes telecommuniations
both difficult and expensive.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that African countries now pay as much as 600
million U.S. Dollars annually to the British Telecoms and French
Telecoms for calls between them.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian project, called Direct Access Multiplex, will
reduce the cost considerably, said Diya.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of telecommunications infrastructure
to the development of economy and trade, he admitted that the
infrastructure in Africa is not sufficient to encourage regional
trade.
</P>
<P>
He, however, cited the coastal fibre optic project of Nigeria
and the Africa One project as examples of African nations'
efforts to improve telecommunications on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The Africa One project will link the whole coastal Africa by
fibre optic. It is now being handled by the AT&AMP;T company of the
U.S. at a cost of three billion Dollars.

FREETOWN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Education authorities in
Sierra Leone said today a seven-member committee has been set up
to probe into a riot in the northern city of Makeni.

</P>
<P>

death of one of their schoolmates, identified as Victor Kanu,
after a sporting event.
</P>
<P>
Kanu fainted after completingg a long distance race during his
school's interhouse competition. He then was rushed to the
governmental hospital where he briefly recovered but died later.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Japan's Lower House Calls for Okinawa Base Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Japan's House of Representatives
(lower house) adopted a resolution today calling on the government
to exert every effort toward a cut in U.S. military bases in
Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
The resolution urged the government to make utmost efforts to
consolidate, realign, reduce and relocate the U.S. bases in
Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
It also asked the government to proceed with consultations with
the United States on military postures, including the structure of
the U.S. military forces in the Asian-Pacific region, and take
comprehensive and effective measures such as "drastic reforms" to
help develop Okinawa's economy.
</P>
<P>
Majority lawmakers supported the resolution during a plenary
session, but the Japanese Communist Party, which has been calling
for a total removal of the U.S. military bases, voted against the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa, which represents less than one percent of Japan's
total area, is home to 75 percent of all U.S. military facilities
and more than half of the 47,000 U.S. troops in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a government-proposed bill to revise legislation to
allow the continued compulsory leases of land for use by the
U.S. military was passed by the Diet (parliament). The bill has
sparked protests in Okinawa.

LUSAKA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will benefit from the
establishment of the European Union Common Currency and the
proposed dollar, the single currency of the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), a Zambian bank official has
said.
</P>
<P>
Abraham Mwenda, director of financial markets of Bank of
Zambia, said that if the EU comes up with one single
Euro-currency this will make it easy for Zambia to deal with one
currency and help reduce costs, according to Financial Mail.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper today also quoted senior economist with
the bank Jacob Lushinga as saying that the idea of a single
currency is to help facilitate trade and enhance exchange of
goods that could be beneficial to Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Lushinga said the importance of the Euro-currency will depend
on Zambia's major trading partners.
</P>
<P>
The EU is Zambia's second main market for non-traditional
exports after COMESA.

<HEADLINE> PECC Calls For New Responses to Foster Human Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Asia Pacific economies should
introduce new forms of education and training as they now face a
major challenge of current imbalances between labor market needs
and the output of the education and training systems, the Pacific
Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) said here today.
</P>
<P>
Inadequate human resources support can put the brakes on rapid
growth in the Asia Pacific region. Thus, a fundamental policy
concern is how to keep both management's and workers' capabilities
advancing in parallel with the structural changes which underpin
the growth process, the PECC said in its latest Human Resource
Development Outlook 1996-97, which studies major labor market
issues facing the Asia Pacific economies.
</P>
<P>
The PECC Human Resource Development Outlook found that the Asia
Pacific economies are all actively pursuing policies to enhance
the output of their educational and training systems. But it said
that to cope with the changing educational and training need, "new
responses" will be required.
</P>
<P>
The proposed new responses include introducing new forms of
education and training, for example, through "twinning" between
domestic and foreign educational or training institutions, or
through distance learning arrangements, and reconsidering the
relative roles of the public and private educational and training
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The other proposals include coming up with new forms of
education and training which focus on lifelong learning and
retraining, as well as incentives for firms to upgrade their
workers' skills, and analyzing more closely the links between
foreign direct investment and the transfer of high-level skills,
and the mechanisms needed to meet the lower level manpower needs
of transnational companies.
</P>
<P>
The PECC is an independent, policy-oriented organization of
high level business, academic and government representatives from
22 Asia-Pacific economies. It aims to foster economic development
in the region by providing a forum for discussion and cooperation
in a wide range of economic areas.
</P>
<P>
The PECC Human Resource Development Outlook 1996-97 is the
fifth in an annual series published by the PECC Human Resource
Development Task Force. The PECC International Secretariat is
based in Singapore.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
arrived in Moscow today for a five-day state visit to Russia
which, as Jiang says, is expected to achieve the goals of
"deepening friendship, promoting cooperation and broadening common
understanding" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement released at the airport, Jiang said he
will hold talks with his Russian counterpart, Boris Yeltsin, to
fully exchange views on bilateral relations and major
international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
It will be the fourth official summit between the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Moscow, Jiang will sign a five-nation
agreement on the reduction of military forces in the border areas
with Yeltsin and the presidents of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and
Tajikistan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and acting Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov greeted Jiang at the airport, who is
accompanied by his wife Wang Yeping, Vice Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen and several other senior Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin held a ceremony at the airport to welcome Jiang's
team.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Russian relations have been soundly developed since the
beginning of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Jiang and Yeltsin announced the establishment of a
"21st century-oriented strategic partnership" between the two
countries during Yeltsin's visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said in his statement that the establishment of the
partnership is not only in line with the fundamental interests of
the two countries and two peoples, but also conducive to peace,
stability and development in the Asia-Pacific region and the world
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
A strategic partnership between the two countries is a positive
contribution to the establishment of a new international order,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed satisfaction with the positive achievements in
cooperation in various fields between the two sides in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed that two-way trade rose to nearly
seven billion U.S. dollars in 1996, and is expected by the two
governments to hit 20 billion dollars by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between the two sides in military technology,
science, education and culture has also been on the increase in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials said Jiang's visit will help forge closer
ties and give fresh impetus to cooperation between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Needs 1 Billion Dollars for Wheat Import: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan needs to mobilize
additional one billion U.S. dollars during the current calendar
year to import wheat to meet the national demand, local news paper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has to import about 4 million tons of wheat to bridge
the gap that is expected to emerge in the next 12 months, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The new crop, the harvesting of which has already been started,
is estimated at around 15-16 million tons against a total demand
for 20 million tons, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report suggested that one of the best way of getting out of
the wheat crisis is to increase the acreage of wheat cultivation
and use good-quality seed to improve per acre yield.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has been facing an acute wheat flour shortage for a
few months. Millions of people have been affected by the wheat
shortage brewing since the middle of January this year.
</P>
<P>
There have been incidents in the last few weeks of angry
citizens looting utility stores and even snatching flour bags from
the government trucks and private shops.

Yasukuni Shrine houses the memorial tablets of Japan's war
dead, including 14 Class-A war criminals executed at the end of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
On July 29 last year, Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto visited the shrine, breaking a decade-long taboo on
prime ministerial visit to it and triggering wide-spread
condemnation.
</P>
<P>
The two cabinet members among Tuesday's visitors were Transport
Minister Makoto Koga and Director-General of Okinawa and Hokkaido
Development Agency Jitsuo Inagaki. Another 73 lawmakers sent
proxies.
</P>
<P>
The visitors belong to a group set up by the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) in 1981 for the purpose of visiting the
Shrine.
</P>
<P>
The group was divided into two groups composed of LDP and
non-LDP members following the split of the LDP in 1993. The two
groups were reunited on April 2 this year.
</P>
<P>
The Yasukuni group comprises 228 Diet members -- 184 from the
LDP and 44 from the New Frontier Party (NFP) and other parties.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Strive for Trade Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam had been attaching special
attention to the process of accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO), said a senior official on Monday in Ho Chi
Minh City.
</P>
<P>
"The economic integration is the prevailing trend in the
world," said Trade Minister Le Van Triet, stressing that only by
enhancing the competitiveness of the national economy could
Vietnam economically catch up with other countries in the region
and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
While referring to the protection of the country's infant
agricultural and industrial sectors, Triet said that some
exceptional measures may be applied to safeguard domestic
enterprises and products.
</P>
<P>
"Gradually enhancing the competitiveness through international
economic integration is the strategic direction adopted by the
party and the government at this stage of development," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that Vietnam must achieve a high and
sustainable growth rate so as to catch up with other members of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in the coming
years.
</P>
<P>
"If the annual growth rate of ASEAN in the coming years is six
to seven percent, the growth rate of Vietnam should be nine to ten
percent so that the country will achieve the same level of
development as that of neighboring countries in the next 30
years," said the minister.

Malaysian companies to participate in the development of Hungary's
infrastructure, tourism and industrial park projects.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference here at the end of his two-day

<HEADLINE> HK Consumer Price Indices Rise Moderately in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Consumer Price Index (CPI)
(A), covering the largest percentage of households in Hong Kong,
recorded a 5.7 percent year-on-year growth in March, down from
that of 6.5 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
The CPI figures for March was released here today by the Census
and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
CPI (A) covers 50 percent households in Hong Kong whose monthly
expenditures are between 3,900 and 16,000 HK dollars (503 to 2,065
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, CPI (B), which is based on the expenditure
pattern of 30 percent households with expenditures between 16,000
and 28,500 HK dollars (2,064 to 3,677 US dollars), rose 5.8
percent over last year, also slower than that of 6.1 percent in
February.
</P>
<P>
However, the corresponding rate of increase in the Hang Seng
CPI, designed for 10 percent households with monthly expenditures
ranging from 28,500 to 61,000 HK dollars (2,064 to 7,870 US
dollars), was at 6.3 percent in March, slightly faster than that
of 6.2 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
The Composite CPI, covering the combined expenditure pattern of
all households, showed a year-on-year increase of 5.9 percent in
March, lower than that of 6.3 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
For the first quarter of 1997, the increase in the CPI (A)
averaged at 6.2 percent over a year earlier, while CPI (B), the
Hang Seng CPI and Composite CPI all grew by 6.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Maternal Mortality Rate Goes up in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The number of Uganda women dying
when giving birth has risen five times in the last 27 years,
reported the local daily New Vision today.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 506 among every 100,000 women died due to
pregnancy-related complications, compared with 100 per 100,000
women in 1970, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Pius Okong, a consultant obstetrician and gynecologist in
Nsambya hospital, attributed the high maternal mortality rate to
a number of reasons including poor nutrition, deterioration of
health services, poverty and lack of transport in time of need.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as advising health providers to show
responsibility towards their patients and utilize properly the
little resources available.
</P>
<P>
He also urged for basic services provided to deal with

<HEADLINE> NATO Military Committee Meets in Chiefs of Staff Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- NATO's Chiefs of Staff held a
one-day meeting on Tuesday at NATO headquarters with the aim of
making several recommendations to the alliance's internal and
external adaptations.
</P>
<P>
One of the meeting's major topics is the arrangement of NATO's
new command structure, especially selecting one alternative for
the commands in Europe.
</P>
<P>
According to NATO sources, the new structure is to reduce the
commands from the current 64, at four levels, to 25, at three
levels.
</P>
<P>
A senior NATO official said that the Chiefs of Staff would
probably recommend two regional commands in Europe, a Northern
Command and one for the South, instead of the current three
(North, Central and South).
</P>
<P>
They will also define the terms of responsibility of the Deputy
SACEUR (Supreme Allied Commander in Europe), who will command the
planned Combined Joint Task Forces (CJTF).
</P>
<P>
The CJTF concept, which was endorsed by foreign ministers of
NATO member states in Berlin last June, will enable NATO's
European nations to conduct their own operations using NATO assets.
</P>
<P>
But the same official said that there would be no discussions
at the meeting about who would run the Nepals-based southern
command in Europe, an important post traditionally held by an
American general and being demanded by France to be handed over to
an European, in order to make the European Security and Defense
Identity "more visible."
</P>
<P>
As for the external adaptation, the Chiefs of Staff are
expected to examine the issues such as strengthening NATO's
Partnership for Peace program, an update of the military elements
in negotiations with Russia and Ukraine, and the situation in
former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Chiefs of Staff will also meet with their
counterparts from partner countries.

<P>
LAGOS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Nine more persons have been killed
in the ethnic clashes in Warri, an oil city in southern Nigeria,
forcing Shell Petroleum Development Company to cut down its crude
oil production there by 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Times reported today that eight persons died on
Sunday night when Kantu, a village of the Itsekiri people, was
torched by unidentified persons.
</P>
<P>
Another young man was killed on Monday as the combatant youths
fired automatic weapons indiscriminately, causing fear and
stampede.
</P>
<P>
Sporadic shootings went on till late last night in parts of
the oil town, said the report.
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen people have been reported dead since the
ethnic crisis broke out between Ijaw and Itsekiri communities
over the relocation of the headquarters of the newly-elected
local government council in late March.
</P>
<P>
The Ijaws also alleged that 44 of their men were killed by the
Itsekiri people.
</P>
<P>
The crisis forced Shell, the biggest foreign oil company
operating in Nigeria, to cut down its production in the area by
15 percent, Shell's General Manager (West) Joshua Udofia
announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The company is reported to have lost an estimated 2,000
barrels of crude oil per day since last Saturday when renewed
clashes broke out.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Hostages in Zaire Pay 250,000 Dollars for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of Lebanese being held
as hostages in southeastern Zaire are only able to flee a 12-day
ordeal after paying their kidnaper 250,000 U.S. dollars,
local newspaper Daily Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
The only English daily in Lebanon quoted a member of the
Lebanese community in the Zairean capital of Kinshasa as saying
that the hostages Sunday paid the Zairean rebels a total of 250,000
dollars, down from an original demand of 700,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Only identifying himself as Morad, the man said the 46
Lebanese, who were taken as hostages in the city of Mbuji-Mayi on
April 10, had been living under great pressure.
</P>
<P>
"They were under great strain. They were not allowed to make
international phone calls and were confined to the town," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tayseer Fakih, one of the 44 men and two women abducted by
Zairean rebels, said a plane arranged by the British embassy in
Rwanda would arrive in Mbuji-Mayi Tuesday to airlift the hostages
to Johannesburg, a city in the northeastern part of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"It cost us 60,000 dollars to charter that plane," he said.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the Lebanese government for its handling of the
crisis. "The Lebanese government did nothing. They completely
kept its distance from the issue," Fakih told the newspaper via a
satellite telephone.
</P>
<P>
Haitham Jomaa, Director General of the Lebanese Ministry of
Emigrants, admitted that the government did little to help the
Lebanese captives.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way we could establish contact with the rebel
leader. The only thing we could do was to contact France and
Britain and ask them to help us, and that was what happened," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Fakih confirmed it was only after paying a ransom that the
Lebanese obtained permission from the rebels to leave Mbuji-Mayi.
</P>
<P>
"I do not want to provoke the rebels and jeopardize our
release by revealing the amount we paid," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added the rebels had given them the opportunity to travel
to Goma, the rebel's main headquarters in eastern Zaire, to
prepare papers for their eventual return to Lebanon once the
situation had calmed.
</P>
<P>
Most of some 2,000 Lebanese in Zaire work in the lucrative
diamond business and many have said they will definitely return
whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
Fakih called on the Lebanese government to send a plane to
Johannesburg to take them to Beirut "because we have no more
money left to pay our trip back home."
</P>
<P>
Jomaa said a plane was already waiting in South Africa but
refused to give additional informations.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Foreign Exchange Reserve Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's foreign exchange
reserve, not including gold reserve, has risen to 1.09 billion
U.S. dollars by April 21, an increase of 536 million dollars over
March 31, the Bulgarian National Bank, the country's central bank,
said today.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time since last January that the country's
foreign exchange had exceeded one billion dollars, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the growth mainly came from a 180 million
dollar loan by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a recent
purchase of foreign exchanges worth 200 million dollars and 150
million dollars earned from privatization.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Bulgarian currency, the Lev, has enjoyed a
stable rate against western currencies for a period of time. So
far, it has risen to 1,500 leva against the U.S. dollar since a
sharp devaluation in January.

<HEADLINE> Dalai Lama: "Tibetan People's Spokesman?" or Just Faithful Tool of Western Anti-China Forces? (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Xinhua News Agency today
issued a commentator's article entitled "Tibetan People's
Spokesman? or Just a faithful Tool of Western Anti-China
Forces? -- on the Dalai Lama's acts on the international scene".
</P>
<P>
Following is the full text of the article:
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Dalai Lama has widely engaged in
activities in many parts of the world to show up on various
occasions, proclaiming himself to be "a spokesman for the Tibetan
people" and claiming that his activities represent "the interest
of the Tibetan people".
</P>
<P>
In fact, what his activities represent is not the interest of
the broad masses of the Tibetan people, but the interest of former
serf owners and Western anti-China forces that collaborate with
them. He has in fact become a faithful tool of Western anti-China
forces.
</P>
<P>
As is known to all, since the 13th century, the Chinese central
government has effectively exercised sovereignty and jurisdiction
over the region of Tibet. This includes stationing troops,
appointing or removing local officials, approving the
reincarnation of major living Buddhas, and conducting the census.
</P>
<P>
There was no such thing as "Tibetan independence" until the
Opium War which represented the invasion of China by imperialist
forces in the modern age. This so-called "independence" was a
result of the invasion of China by colonialists and imperialists
in the late 19th century.
</P>
<P>
British colonialists staged two armed invasions of the Tibet
region, at the end of 1888 and again from late 1903 to August
1904, but met with courageous resistance by the Tibetan
people.

<HEADLINE> Dalai Lama: "Tibetan People's Spokesman?" or Just Faithful Tool of Western Anti-China Forces (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So, the British colonialists changed their strategy to one of
supporting pro-British separatist forces among the upper class in
Tibet, and encouraged them to work for "Tibetan
independence". This marked the beginning of the so-called "Tibetan
independence", a conspiracy that has never succeeded.
</P>
<P>
Now, the Dalai Lam has picked up the flag of "Tibetan
independence", proclaiming that "Tibet has been an independent
state since ancient times." In doing so, he has betrayed the
interest of the country and the nation. How can he say he is
representing the interest of the Tibetan people?
</P>
<P>
Old Tibet had a long history of feudal serfdom that combined
political and religious power. Under this ruthlessly oppressive
system, serfs and slaves, who accounted for over 95 percent of the
region's total population, had no basic human rights at all.
</P>
<P>
In order to maintain the system, a group of reactionary
upper-class Tibetans in 1959 staged an armed rebellion that
failed, after which the Dalai Lama fled. Can this be "in the
interest of the Tibetan people"?
</P>
<P>
Over the past several decades, Tibet has enjoyed economic
growth and social progress and the people's lives have improved
dramatically -- and the Dalai Lama has had nothing to do with this.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, he has made every effort to attack and malign
everything the central government has done for the benefit of the
Tibetan society and people, such as educational development, free
medical care, repair and protection of cultural relics, and
various construction projects.
</P>
<P>
From this it can be seen that what the Dalai Lama is really
concerned about and what he stands for is not "the interest of the
Tibetan people", but the interest of the former serf owners.
</P>
<P>
The people on whose behalf he speaks are not the masses of
former serfs and slaves who have escaped cruel oppression and
become Tibet's new owners and who are now building a new Tibet,
but those former serf owners who want to restore their lost rule.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Newspaper Calls for Halting Ties With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Syrian newspaper Al-Baath, the
mouthpiece of the ruling Baath Party, today called for halting
normalization of relations with Israel and freezing all forms of
economic cooperation with it.
</P>
<P>
The call came after Israeli Attorney-General Aelyakim
Rubinstein refrained from indicting Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu over the Bar-On political scandal Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It is the duty of all peace-loving nations, forces and blocs
that are really willing to build up a world free from violence,
wars and destruction to join forces and take one firm stand
against Israel which has become the most dangerous threat to the
entire world because of its hardline government, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's insistence on his racist and hardline policies
would cause the entire peace process to collapse, which would pose
a threat to security and stability of the Middle East and the
entire world, particularly Europe, the paper added.

<HEADLINE> Dalai Lama: "Tibetan People's Spkesman?" or Just Faithful Tool of Western Anti-China Forces? (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dalai Lama's activities to split the motherland are backed
by Western anti-China forces, with whom he has colluded and for
whom he has been a most willing tool, in order to fulfil his
political scheme.
</P>
<P>
Taking a look at what the Dalai Lama has done outside China to
split the motherland since he fled in 1959, one can see that the
shifts in his actions have always paralleled the changing
international situation and have always followed the needs of
Western forces in their anti-China strategy.
</P>
<P>
Without the support of the Western anti-China forces, the Dalai
Lama and his followers could have not continued their activities
in trying to split the motherland for even a single day.
</P>
<P>
After the armed rebellion was put down and the Dalai Lama fled,
there was a wave of anti-China outcry on the international scene
for awhile. But later, all through the '70s and to the middle of
the '80s, the Dalai Lama's attempts to split the motherland and
create "Tibetan independence" received almost no response and
remained dormant.
</P>
<P>
This was clearly related to the international climate at the
time, as well as to Western countries' strategy toward China.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama's "popularity" began to take off from the
late '80s to the early '90s, when Western countries started
another anti-China outcry, and his splittist activities were just
right for the strategic needs of the Western anti-China forces to
attack China and to try to Westernize and divide China.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama was resurrected and pushed to the fore, after
being garbed from head to toe by Western anti-China forces. The
various laurels heaped on him came from Western anti-China forces
who wanted to deceive the public and gain sympathy and support.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama, who is the chief representative of the serf
owners of old Tibet, was made up by Western anti-China forces to
be shown as a protector of "democracy" and "freedom". The man who
represents the brutal and savage rule of the past and who now
spreads propaganda in an attempt to disrupt ethnic relations and
incite hatred among ethnic groups, was dressed up as a "pacifist".
</P>
<P>
And the same Dalai Lama, who is a politician in exile in
religious clothing engaged in spliting the motherland, was dressed
up as a "merciful religious leader".
</P>
<P>
On top of this, foreign forces have been the main source of
funding for his attempts to split the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Dalai Lama: "Tibetan People's Spokesman?" or Just Faithful Tool of Western Anti-China Forces (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Western anti-China forces tried to hide the facts, distort
China's image and vilify China, the Dalai Lama ran around
spreading lies about how "China killed 1.2 million Tibetans in
Tibet." The fact is that the total population of Tibet was only
one million at the time of peaceful liberation, and the number of
Tibetans in Tibet is a bit more than 2.3 million at present.
</P>
<P>
As Western anti-China forces wish to contain China's
development and disrupt its stability, the Dalai Lama sent spies
to incite disturbances and carry out acts of terrorism, like
explosions in public places, in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
When Western countries advocate anti-China proposals at the
United Nations Commission on Human Rights, the Dalai Lama sent
representatives and even went himself to the meeting place, to add
up to the uproar. And similar cases are numerous. As a political
tool of Western anti-China forces, the Dalai Lama's role is
lamentable and fairly limited, and he will eventually be
abandoned. This is the inevitable law of history.
</P>
<P>
China's development, its increasing international influence,
and its contribution to world peace are independent of the desires
of Western anti-China forces. And Tibet's development, social
progress, ethnic unity, and the improving life of the Tibetans are
facts which cannot be concealed.
</P>
<P>
Attempts by Western anti-China forces to contain China's
development and their attempts to hide the truth and mislead the
public will ultimately fail. As their tool, the Dalai Lama,
inspite of his changing activities to split the motherland, will
also come to no good end.

<TEXT>
<P>
It is reported that one Western country, out of its anti-China
needs, provided a large amount of funding for the Dalai Lama
clique from 1993 to 1995. Some foreign forces provided equipment
or helped it set up radio stations that were used for propaganda
purposes, and provided the Dalai Lama with the platform and place
to "internationalize" the Tibet issue and to preach "Tibet
independence".
</P>
<P>
Without the assistance of foreign forces, it would have been
impossible for him to carry out his separatist activities and his
organs would have been impossible to operate and even to
exist. His repeated calls for "a peaceful march toward Tibet" and
"a referendum" were all planned with the help of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Operating under the aegis of Western anti-China forces, the
Dalai Lama did everything in his power to repay them by meeting
their political needs and closely bound himself on their war
chariot.
</P>
<P>
As they wish to split China and contain its development, the
Dalai Lama, going against historical facts, enhanced his
separatist activities by saying that "Tibet has always been an
independent state" and, by working with "Taiwan Independence"
forces and various other anti-China forces in exile.
</P>
<P>
As Western anti-China forces use human rights as a pretext to
interfere in China's internal affairs and push peaceful evolution,
the Dalai Lama dubbed himself as a protector of "human rights" and
"democrocy and freedom", and made up lies to accuse China of
"violating human rights in Tibet", in spite of his own past of
trampling on human rights when he ruled old Tibet.
</P>
<P>
When Western countries pushed the theory of China's "collapse"
in the late 1980s and the early 1990s, the Dalai Lama repeatedly
proclaimed his prophecy about how "the Chinese government would
collapse soon", saying that "his personal observations and his
divination indicated optimistic signs for development".

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli Finance Minister Dan Meridor has
expressed support for the granting of exemptions from custom
duties on products manufactured in Jordan by Israeli-Jordanian
joint venture facilities, reported bi-weekly Israel Business
Today.
</P>
<P>
Companies from both countries, including Delta from Israel and
Century from Jordan, have applied to the Israeli government to
consider joint venture products manufactured in Jordan as
Israeli-made goods for the purposes of Israeli custom duty
payments.
</P>
<P>
However, the Ministry of Industry and Trade has objected
to the granting of a full exemption, saying that Israeli
companies which operate in Jordan benefit from lower salary
costs compared with their counterparts which operate in Israel
and help boost employment levels in Israel.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The European Union Commission has decided to
establish a facility in Israel which will focus on economic
cooperation and the promotion of commercial interests of EU
member state business companies in Israel, reported bi-weekly
Israel Business Today.
</P>
<P>
The new unit will be staffed by economists and experts in
a wide range of related fields, in addition to a technical
team. The personnel will manage cooperation projects and locate
business opportunities for EU companies with local service
providers. The unit will also work toward reducing the trade
discrepancy between Israel and the EU.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Israel suffers from an annual trade deficit of
7 billion U.S. dollars and pressure has been applied in
recent years to reduce the gap.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- A group of Israeli companies and university
research institutes has established a research program designed to
enable the development of products based on metallic magnesium,
thereby increasing sales of raw metallic magnesium three-fold,
reported bi-weekly Israel Business Today.
</P>
<P>
At their first meeting, held in the middle of April, the
members of the consortium approved a development budget of 45
million shekels (about 1.4 million U.S. dollar) for the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
The declared aim of the consortium is to arrive at a
situation whereby Israel supplies 12 percent of future products
based on magnesium alloy and the Israeli company, Dead Sea
Works, becomes one of the world's largest suppliers of
magnesium.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- The six-member Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
states are most likely to fix their unified customs tariffs on
imports at 8 percent, local newspaper Arab Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview published today by the paper, Chief
of Kuwait General Administration of Customs Ibrahim Al-Ghanim
disclosed that GCC Secretary General Jamil al-Hojeilan had
proposed an 8 percent unified tariff, and the member states
considered it as "a suitable meting point."
</P>
<P>
He said that the views of the GCC member states about
unification of customs tariffs had recently become "very close"
after considering the new proposal.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic organization
founded in 1981, groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab
Emirates, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Customs tariffs in the GCC states at present vary from 4
percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
A wide gap existed among the GCC states toward the
unification due to differences in each country's economic
priorities. The disagreement has blocked a tariff agreement
almost since the alliance was formed.
</P>
<P>
GCC's Assistant Secretary General for Economic Affairs Abdulla
Al-Khulaifi said last month that "the major problem is
classification of goods," referring to the three categories of
classification -- goods exempted from tariffs, basic goods with
a tariff of 4 to 8 percent or 8 to 12 percent and other goods.
</P>
<P>
The GCC had finished until recently classifying the last 190
goods and the next step would be to present the list to the GCC
classification committee and the finance ministers in May and
then to the alliance's foreign ministers at their meeting in
June, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The final authority deciding the issue would be the GCC heads
of state who will hold their annual summit in Kuwait in
December.

<HEADLINE> Pak Minister Calls for Combating Desertification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Minister for Food
and Agriculture Syeda Abida Hussain called here today for
concerted efforts to combat desertification in the country.
</P>
<P>
She was speaking at the inaugural session of a three-day
seminar on the implementation of the U.N. Convention on Combating
Desertification.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was organized by the Ministry of Environment, Local
Government and Rural Development in collaboration with the Interim
Secretariat of the U.N. Convention for Combating Desertification.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of the U.N. Convention on Combating
Desertification by Pakistan is of significant importance, Abida
said.
</P>
<P>
"The convention comes as a ray of hope for more than 1 billion
people around the world whose lives are threatened by the adverse
impacts of droughts and desertification," she said.
</P>
<P>
Abida said desertification is an environmental, climatic and
human activity phenomenon leading to land degradation in arid,
semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas worldwide.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the area in Pakistan is arid and semi-arid,
she noted.
</P>
<P>
"The arid coastal strip and mangrove deltaic area are under
increasing environmental stress from reduced freshwater flows,
sewage and industrial pollution and over-exploitation of many
other natural resources. It leaves us with no option except for
making concerted efforts to save country's environment from
further degradation."
</P>
<P>
She observed that the gigantic objective of the implementation
of the convention might be achieved only by adopting a bottom-up
approach.
</P>
<P>
"For this we will have to strengthen local decision-making
mechanism and empower peoples' organizations as non-political
forces to bring a social change right from the grassroots."
</P>
<P>
She concluded with the hope that an action-oriented research
and development plan would be brought out by scientists and
research scholars to combat desertification in Pakistan.

SEOUL, April 22 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-Sam and visiting Belarussian President Alxander Lukashenko
agreed here today to promote bilateral cooperation in trade,

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Produce 40,000 Tons of Edibel Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Uganda will produce 40,000
metric tons of edible oil by the year 2000, reported the local
newspaper "the Crusader" today.
</P>
<P>
Otim Odoch, national coordinator of the edible oil producing
companies was quoted as saying that the edible oil industry in
Uganda was producing 40,000 metric tons and was in the process of
expanding production.
</P>
<P>
He said the industry was working with rural farmers to promote
the growth of edible oil producing crops like soya, groundnuts,
simsim and sunflower.
</P>
<P>
Once the targeted production is realised, he said, Uganda will
have enough edible oil for its domestic consumption and a surplus
for export.
</P>
<P>
About 25 years ago, Uganda had sufficient production of edibel
oil to meet domestic demand and some surplus for export to its
neighbouring countries.
</P>
<P>
However, this situation changed adversely after the mass
expulsion of the Asian community by the former president Idi Amin
in 1972. The supply of edible oil began to dwindle away as most
of the oil mills closed down because they were owned by the
departed Asians.
</P>
<P>
This sad situation was further aggravated by the drastic
decline in cotton production that subsequently reduced the supply
of cotton seeds which was a major source of the raw materials for
production of edible oil then. During the political turmoil and
civil war in the 1970s and early 1980s, farmers replaced cotton
farmland with coffee, thus the country's cotton production fell
from a peak of 445,003 bales (one bale equals 185 kilograms) in
1965/66 season to almost zero in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, the country can only produce about ten percent
and import nearly 90 percent of the edible oil on the local
market in late 1980s. According to statistics available, the
country was thus subjected to the edible oil scarcity, which
still persists today.
</P>
<P>
During the period from June 1992 to May 1993, Uganda produced
only 2,625 tons of edible oil.

<P>
LAGOS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- A total of 146 people, 108 of them
men, were killed in road accidents in Lagos, the biggest city and
economic center of Nigeria, during the first three months of
1997.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Champion reported today that during the period, no
less than 614 accidents involving buses, lorries, taxis, private
cars and motorcycles were recorded, compared with 847 cases a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman was quoted as saying on Monday that 412
persons, including 318 males and 94 females, were injured in the
road clashes between January and March with 1,081 vehicles
involved, compared with 1,130 one year earlier.
</P>
<P>
As the former national capital, Lagos has a well-built road
system which was used by about 288,000 petrol-fired vehicles
spending 7.2 million liters of petrol a day, making for 40
percent of the national daily consumption.
</P>
<P>
Driving without strictly abiding by traffic rules and the poor

<HEADLINE> GCC May Unify Customs Tariffs at 8 Percent: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The six-member Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) states are most likely to fix their
unified customs tariffs on imports at 8 percent, local newspaper
Arab Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview published today by the paper, Chief
of Kuwait General Administration of Customs Ibrahim Al-Ghanim
disclosed that GCC Secretary General Jamil al-Hojeilan had
proposed an 8 percent unified tariff, and the member states
considered it as "a suitable meting point."
</P>
<P>
He said that the views of the GCC member states about
unification of customs tariffs had recently become "very close"
after considering the new proposal.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic organization
founded in 1981, groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab
Emirates, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Customs tariffs in the GCC states at present vary from 4
percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
A wide gap existed among the GCC states toward the
unification due to differences in each country's economic
priorities. The disagreement has blocked a tariff agreement
almost since the alliance was formed.
</P>
<P>
GCC's Assistant Secretary General for Economic Affairs Abdulla
Al-Khulaifi said last month that "the major problem is
classification of goods," referring to the three categories of
classification -- goods exempted from tariffs, basic goods with
a tariff of 4 to 8 percent or 8 to 12 percent and other goods.
</P>
<P>
The GCC had finished until recently classifying the last 190
goods and the next step would be to present the list to the GCC
classification committee and the finance ministers in May and
then to the alliance's foreign ministers at their meeting in
June, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The final authority deciding the issue would be the GCC heads
of state who will hold their annual summit in Kuwait in
December.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ghanim described the progress in the GCC states' customs
unification efforts as "a great success toward achieving a
strong economic bloc in the face of other international
alliances."
</P>
<P>
He also said the integration of tariffs would have "a
balanced impact" on Kuwait because of its low customs duty which
is only 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said Kuwait pays great attention to the unification
issue, believing it would greatly contribute to achieving
economic integration among the GCC states.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also said Kuwait had decided to delay plans to
raise customs duty on imports to await the unification of
customs tariffs. Kuwait had prepared a study for raising customs.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Benefit From Single Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will benefit from the
establishment of the European Union Common Currency and the
proposed dollar, the single currency of the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), a Zambian bank official has
said.
</P>
<P>
Abraham Mwenda, director of financial markets of Bank of
Zambia, said that if the EU comes up with one single
Euro-currency this will make it easy for Zambia to deal with one
currency and help reduce costs, according to Financial Mail.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper today also quoted senior economist with
the bank Jacob Lushinga as saying that the idea of a single
currency is to help facilitate trade and enhance exchange of
goods that could be beneficial to Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Lushinga said the importance of the Euro-currency will depend
on Zambia's major trading partners.
</P>
<P>
The EU is Zambia's second main market for non-traditional
exports after COMESA.

<HEADLINE> China Preparing for Inner Mongolia's 50th Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region has been preparing a gala celebration to mark its 50th
anniversary on May 1.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia, which has the majority of China's Mongolian
people, became China's first provincial-level regional autonomous
region when it was established on May 1, 1947.
</P>
<P>
A regional headquarters official in charge of the celebration
activities told reporters that the theme would be "unity,
civilization, opening up, and development" and that it would show
Inner Mongolia's achievements and history, to demonstrate the
success of the regional autonomy system.
</P>
<P>
Because it is in an area of frigid temperatures where, in May,
the new prairie grass has still not had time to grow, the regional
government has decided to start the celebration on July 18, with
activities to last for a month.
</P>
<P>
During that time, a program of honoring role models, a meeting
for 10,000 people, a trade fair, a tourism festival, and many
cultural and entertainment programs will be staged in Hohhot, the
regional capital.
</P>
<P>
The regional party committee and the regional government have
spent 3.13 billion yuan in building 18 major projects for the 50th
anniversary. These include housing programs for teachers in urban
areas, grass-roots health care facilities, cultural facilities,
and power, telecommunications, and transport
facilities. Construction work has been done swiftly and most will
be finished before July, according to local sources.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Has 100,000 Personal Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 22 (Xinhua) -- There are around 100,000
personal computers in Kuwait at present and 20,000 computers are
introduced into the country per year, an official was quoted today
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The computer market in Kuwait is estimated at around 35 million
Kuwait dinars (115.5 million U.S. dollars) to 40 million dinars
(132 million dollars), judging by statistics of some global
computer firms, Director General of the Kuwaiti Information Center
and Computer Services and Consultations Mansour Al-Moussa told a
local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
He said computer business in Kuwait rests on three factors
comprising the computer machine, programs and the training and
maintenance services.
</P>
<P>
Although there were no comprehensive statistics to specify the
exact market value, he said, "if we assume that the average price
of a computer is 500 dinars (1,650 U.S. dollars), we can conclude
that annual computer sales come to 10 million dinars (33 million
dollars), together with 20 million dinars (66 million dollars) for
programs and related services and 5 to 10 million dinars for
training and maintenance, the local market would come to 35
million to 40 million dinars."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, member of the Kuwait Computer Society Board Abdul
Aziz Al-Duaij said that 60 percent of the computers sold here
were assembled locally.
</P>
<P>
Computer sold in Kuwaiti markets include a variety of famous
brands produced in the United States.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The head office of the China
International Travel Service (CITS), the country's largest travel
agency, will sharpen its competitive edge in the overseas tourist
market with more modern telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Li Lu'an, general manager of the travel service, explained
today at the 46th annual conference of the Pacific Asia Travel
Association (PATA) that it will take the lead in using e-mail as
of May 1 this year, to hook up to major overseas locations via the
network.
</P>
<P>
CITS has joined the Internet and a special cable allows it to
share tourism information with 14 key tourist cities in China, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
CITS is now an agent for many domestic and overseas airlines
and hotels, including Air China, China Eastern, the Wangfujing
Grand Hotel, American Express, and United Airlines.
</P>
<P>
In July of 1995, it joined the International Air Transport
Association (IATA), which consists of airlines from all over the
world, to become its first member on the Chinese mainland, making
ticketing much better.
</P>
<P>
CITS was set up in 1954 and now cooperates with more than 800
travel agents in over 100 countries and regions, and has nine
branch companies overseas. It dealt with 483,000 overseas tourists
in 1996, up 11 percent from the previous year, earning 142 million
US dollars in foreign currency, far exceeding the amount of its
domestic counterparts.
</P>
<P>
PATA, which started in 1952, is an influential non-governmental

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists recently
announced that the Changbai Mountains in Jilin province have a
total of 2,077 types of wild plants after a thorough survey of
materials from two field studies in 1993 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
Changbai Mountains, reputed as a kind of genetic bank for plant
species, are rich in animal and plant resources.
</P>
<P>
With the development of science and technology, more plant
resources will be developed and used to benefit mankind in our
daily lives, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that the mountains boast more than 1,600
kinds of plants, such as grass or trees, that could have
commercial value in medicines, perfumes, and creams.
</P>
<P>
"Natural resources here are well protected, especially 39
species of rare plants," noted Huang Xiangtong, an engineer who
participated in the study. He noted, however, that with an
increase in the illegal digging of rare plants, protection work is
becoming harder.
</P>
<P>
Provincial scientists suggest that a rare plant garden be set
up to provide special meticulous care for those on a brink of
extinction, and more funds are needed for scientific research,
which was recently forced to stop because of a fund shortage.

NINGBO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- ground breaking began Monday on a
highway-railway bridge that will connect the Chinese mainland with
Daxie Island near Ningbo City in Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the bridge will have a 1,538-m
four-lane highway and a 1,661.7-m railway on the same level. It
will handle 32,000 vehicles per day.
</P>
<P>
The whole project will take 27 months to finish at a cost of
430 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Daxie Island is one of the most suitable places on China's east
coast for an international bulk cargo center.
</P>
<P>
In November of 1992, Chinese Vice-President Rong Yiren, who was
Chairman of the China International Trust and Investment
Corporation (CITIC), made a decision about large-scale land
development on Daxie. The project got approval from the State
Council in March of 1993 and Daxie Island has been given
preferential treatment of an economic and technological
development zone.
</P>
<P>
The bridge is considered the most important infrastructure to
turn Daxie Island into a first-class port and trade zone.

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriots to Visit Northern Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Around 1,000 Greek Cypriots will
be allowed to visit the Monastery of Apostolos Andreas in the
Turkish-controlled northern part of the island on three
different occasions, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Commissioner for Humanitarian Issues Takis
Christopoulos was quoted as saying that after arrangements made
by the U.N. in consultation with the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
sides, about 700 Greek Cypriots will be able to visit the
monastery this Sunday to celebrate Greek Orthodox Easter.
</P>
<P>
Other visits are scheduled for August 15, and November
30, two of the most important dates in the Orthodox calendar.
</P>
<P>
These visits came following a visit of more than 400 Turkish
Cypriots to the government-controlled southern part of the
island, for a pilgrimage last Saturday to Hala Sultan Tekke, one
of the holiest Muslim places of worship in the world.
</P>
<P>
Christopoulos expressed the hope that these visits will be the
beginning of continuous communication between the two communities
in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"We are all ready to work together for a happy and prosperous
Cyprus, for all its inhabitants, regardless of nationality, race
or religion," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in cooperation with the U.N., he will try to
arrange visits of smaller groups from both communities to
different parts of Cyprus in the future.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government voiced welcome Monday to the
reciprocal visits between the two sides and described them as
desirable development and a good start, which will have
beneficial results on the political effort to find a settlement
in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of visits were believed here as a result of the
ongoing U.N.-led proximity talks between the Greek and Turkish
Cypriot sides, which began on March 10.
</P>
<P>
The talks were aimed at paving the way for the U.N. proposed
face-to-face negotiations between leaders of the two communities
and getting the two sides to adopt good-will gestures to create
a positive climate for the direct talks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a Greek
Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece.

The minimum wage reached 209,960 Meticais (18.2 Dollars) in

<HEADLINE> Muslim Reebs Kill Soldier in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) rebels Monday struck anew at government troops in Aleosan,
Cotabato, the southern Philippines, killing a soldier and wounding
another.
</P>
<P>
The attack followed separate MILF offensives in Buldon,
Maguindanao, and Carmen, Cotabato, over the weekend, where one
soldier and 25 rebels were killed, the Philippine News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Captain Noel Detoyato, spokesman of the
Army's Sixth Infantry Division, as saying the two soldiers were
among a group of government troops that escorted a local
engineering team to repair a road.
</P>
<P>
"They were preparing to leave the area at 4 p.m. when ambushed
by the rebels," Detoyato said.
</P>
<P>
However, Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice chief for political
affairs, claimed over a local radio that his men did not provoke
the incident.
</P>
<P>
He said the military entered the area without coordination with
the MILF forces present in the area.
</P>
<P>
"Our men only defended their position thinking that the
military were there to conduct operations against the MILF,"
Jaafar said.
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred two days before the scheduled third round
of preliminary talks between the two sides on April 23-24. Among
the issues to be discussed by peace negotiators is the cessation
of hostilities between the military and the rebels.

<HEADLINE> 200 Japanese Diet Members Visit Controversial Shrine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 Diet (Japanese
parliament) members, including two cabinet members, today visited
Yasukuni Shrine where Japanese war dead, including seven class-A
war criminals executed at the end of World War II, are enshrined.
</P>
<P>
Visits to the controversial shrine by senior Japanese officials
have always been criticized by Japan's Asian neighbors which
suffered bitterly under the Japanese militarist heels.
</P>
<P>
On July 29 last year, Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
visited the shrine, breaking a decade-long taboo on prime
ministerial visit to it and triggering wide-spread condemnation.
</P>
<P>
The 223 Diet members who visited the shrine today, including
Transport Minister Makoto Koga and Director General of Okinawa and
Hokkaido Development Agency Jitsuo Inagaki, belong to a group set
up by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in 1981 for the
purpose of visiting the Shrine.
</P>
<P>
The group was divided into two groups composed of LDP and
non-LDP members following the split of the LDP in 1993. The two
groups were reunited on April 2 this year.
</P>
<P>
The Yasukuni group comprises 228 Diet members -- 184 from the
LDP and 44 from the New Frontier Party (NFP) and other parties.
Former deputy president of the LDP Keizo Obuchi is the chairman of
the group.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 22 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
province has made an effort to optimize its industrial structure
to stimulate economic development.
</P>
<P>
One provincial government official says that three measures
have been taken. The first is to form a series of pillar
industries in petrochemicals, electric power, light industry, and
medicine. The second is to establish over 100 large enterprises
with annual sales revenue reaching three to ten billion yuan, and
the third is to develop brand names for local products to enter
international market.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government is making an effort to increase
technology renovation by spending as much as 30 percent of its
fixed assets on this, working out regulations to encourage
technology renovation, and enhancing technology reforms in 70
major large-scale enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Guangdong has intensifying its efforts in
optimizing regional economic structure. It is undertaking its plan
for coordinated development of the Pearl River Delta and its
northern mountains, and is mapping out plans for coordinated
development of its eastern and western.

<HEADLINE> Central Chinese City Says No To Polluters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Wuhan, the capital of central
China's Hubei Province, has turned down applications for 31
projects in an effort to protect the environment, and recently
vetoed a large chemical project with a proposed investment of 30
million US dollars because of possible pollution of vegetable
fields.
</P>
<P>
This is the latest example of the government's determination to
protect the urban environment of this old industrial base that has
long suffered from severe pollution.
</P>
<P>
The 31 projects were for paper mills, metallurgical and
chemical industries, tanneries, and building materials. Although
the refusal to approval them will cost the city hundreds of millions
of yuan in lost business, the city's environmental protection
bureau thought the move was worthwhile because it could protect
the city from millions of tons of harmful waste discharged by
those industries.
</P>
<P>
The city has also reduced pollution by moving a number of
polluters or by technological renovation. As a result of these
efforts, the quality of the environment in the Qingshan, Hanyang,
and Donghu districts has improved a great deal.

<HEADLINE> Siemens Determined to Regain Past Glory in China  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 22 (Xinhua) -- When it comes to business in
China, Siemens of Germany aims high: the electric giant says it is
determined to return to its past glory in China in the 1930s, when
its branch network here was next only to that in Europe.
</P>
<P>
As part of the restoration campaign, Siemens has re-opened a
representative office in Dalian, a coastal city in northeast
China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The re-opening of the office, which was first set up in 1987
but moved to the provincial capital of Shenyang in 1995, has made
Liaoning the second Chinese province in which Siemens has both a
branch and an office. The other is Guangdong Province in the south.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese market is so large that we can't afford to neglect
it," said Hermann J. Koelle, President of Siemens Limited China.
</P>
<P>
He flatly denied that Siemens' business in China, at 2.8
billion marks last year, has peaked. "Our business has just begun
and is at a rising stage," he said.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony marking the opening of the Dalian office, Koelle
said that Siemens is resolved to grab a big share of the China
market -- and he's confident it will happen.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng said at the 32nd World Congress of the
International Chamber of Commerce earlier this month that in the
next four years, the China market will be as much as 700 billion
US dollars, which Koelle likened to a "big cake."
</P>
<P>
"We are eyeing the cake and hoping to get a big piece," Koelle
told Xinhua in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Rainer Kordes, Siemens' regional general manager in northeast
China, explained that promising development prospects and business
opportunities in Dalian, one of the first 14 coastal Chinese
cities selected by the central government to open to other parts
of the world, have prompted Siemens to return.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Dalian has become the city with the highest
degree of openness in northeast China and its rapid economic
development and urban construction are other major factors drawing
Siemens back, according to Kordes.

"The re-opening of the Dalian office is just one step taken by
Siemens to compete for the northeastern China market," Kordes
said. "We hope it can boost our cooperation with Liaoning and the
entire northeast China."
</P>
<P>
Koelle said Siemens will increase its market share in China by
helping its Chinese partners find answers to funding difficulties,
pledging that the German company will also introduce into China
advanced technology and management.
</P>
<P>
With five branches and 10 offices already in China, Siemens
responded quickly to the Chinese government's strategy to
accelerate development in the central and western parts and to
revamp the old industries in the northeast, by setting up offices
in Chongqing, Chengdu and Dalian.
</P>
<P>
In Liaoning, an industrial base with 10 percent of China's
large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, China has launched
a multi-billion-dollar program to make over its old industries.
</P>
<P>
Siemens is keen on the business opportunities arising from the
restructuring and rejuvenating, Koelle said.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that more offices will be opened in China, such as
one in Urumqi and more in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
"China is large, and we want to be close to our clients and
stand firm in the market while the competition is still not
fierce," Koelle said.
</P>
<P>
The German company set up a representative office in the
Chinese capital of Beijing in 1982, and signed a memorandum of
understanding with the Chinese government on cooperation in
machinery, electrical equipment and electronics in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Siemens has so far set up 35 joint-funded and cooperative
enterprises and three solely-funded firms in China.

<HEADLINE> North Chinese Hot Springs Cure Ailments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, April 22 (Xinhua) -- People from China and abroad have
been coming to some hot springs at Arxan, a city in north China's
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, to get relief for various
ailments.
</P>
<P>
Halun Arxan, which is one of China's five famous springs and
whose name means "hot holy water" in Mongolian, has helped many
people regain their vitality and throw away their walking sticks.
</P>
<P>
One legend has it that during the Qing Dynasty (1616-1911) a
Mongolian Prince went out hunting. When he shot a deer, he sent a
hunter to follow the bloody trail of the wounded animal, but it
disappeared at a spring.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the deer had washed its wound in the spring
and had been cured instantly, and escaped. When he told the prince
about this, the prince became enraged and had the man's thigh
broken and ordered him to wash in the spring to test the
theory. The hunter surprisingly recovered immediately.
</P>
<P>
There are 48 fountains along a 100-ha stretch of grassland,
each one classified according to its ability to help the head, the
feet, the eyes, ears, or stomach, etc. They vary in temperature
from 1 to 50 degrees centigrade.
</P>
<P>
Two of them are the "Mother and Child Springs", only 30 cm
apart but with a temperature difference of 14 degrees. They are
rich in minerals and trace elements, including radioactive
elements, which have proven to have therapeutic effects in nearly
100 different diseases or ailments like arthritis and intestinal
or stomach troubles.
</P>
<P>
The regional government set up a sanatorium in the area in
1954, and electrotherapy, massage, and acupuncture have been added
to make the springs more attractive.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Banks Look For Local Professionals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Professionals are much sought
after in Shanghai, as more financial institutions move in, while
the number of existing ones has reached 2,700.
</P>
<P>
Local news media carry a large number of ads to offer jobs in
banks, insurance companies, and securities firms with good
salaries, promotion prospects, and overseas training opportunities.
</P>
<P>
About 90 percent of the positions require a bachelor's degree
at the minimum, and 40 percent a doctorate or a master's degree.
</P>
<P>
To meet the growing market demand, a dozen local universities
now offer degrees in finance and graduate more than 3,000 students
annually. Many graduates with degrees in finance from other parts
of the country have come to hunt jobs in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
One local expert notes that, while the number of professionals
is now sufficient to meet the general demands of the local
financial sector, industry is still experiencing a severe shortage
of top-flight personnel, especially those good at analytic work,
management, and administrative affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever an employee has his monthly salary raised to 10,000 yuan
or more, head-hunters start flocking around him," said a credit
officer with a foreign bank.
</P>
<P>
Yoshiaki Kawamata, Diretor of Sanwa Bank's Shanghai Branch,
told Xinhua that it normally takes five years to train
senior bank personnel and 10 years a branch manager, but in
Shanghai, foreign banks have had to cut the training period by
half.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 200 overseas banking institutions in
Shanghai and most would rather hire Chinese nationals who are
more familiar with local laws, have better contacts, and demand
less pay.
</P>
<P>
"The headquarters of my bank wants us to employ more local
people," Mr. Kawamata said, while admitting that it is not very
easy to do so. He pointed out that some local staff members have
left for foreign countries after years of training on the job,
which has had a negative effect on the local banking industry.
</P>
<P>
Eight foreign banks have been approved by the People's Bank of
China to open branches in the city's Pudong New Area to deal in
RMB. They are likely to hire more professionals for the new
business. This will mean a new round of searching for skillful
people among local banks, observers said.

<HEADLINE> NZ to Deregulate Mail Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government
introduced a bill in the parliament this afternoon which will
deregulate the post service, the last monopoly in the country.
</P>
<P>
The legislation, the Postal Service Bill, will do away with the
sole right to deliver ordinary letters enjoyed by New Zealand
Post, a state-owned enterprise which Communication Minister
Maurice Williamson described as a good company.
</P>
<P>
The deregulation will allow the private sector to set up post
offices and deliver mail. New operators will also be able to set
up public letterboxes.
</P>
<P>
Williamson argued that the competition will benefit the
customers.
</P>
<P>
"So all and all, I think if we can see the benefits many other
industries have achieved for the consumers with competition coming
into play, rates have dropped and services have increased. Courier
companies for many years have complaints they are traveling around

<HEADLINE> Commentary: A Conspicuous Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Washington summit on Friday
between the United States and Japan on the defense situation in
the Asia-Pacific region will focus on U.S. military bases in Japan
and the Japanese-U.S. security mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The summit, between Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
and U.S. President Bill Clinton, will be of particular
significance in that it will coordinate their stances on military
cooperation and enhance their military alliance, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto has threatened to expand the scope of Japan-U.S.
defense cooperation to include China's Taiwan Province and Nansha
Islands, introducing a dangerous note into the summit, according
to the analysts.
</P>
<P>
It is well known that over recent years, Japan and the
U.S. have been trying to position their alliance ready for the
21st century and have taken practical measures to strengthen the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
At their Tokyo summit in April last year, Hashimoto and Clinton
reassessed the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between
Japan and the U.S. signed in 1960, and reached consensus on
expanding the scope of Japan-U.S. defense cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At this week's summit, they are expected to discuss the
problems they are facing in enhancing military cooperation in the
Asia-Pacific region, and to implement the agreement reached in
military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two sides faced two major stumbling blocks in strengthening
their military cooperation -- the issue of U.S. military bases in
Japan's Okinawa Prefecture, and modification of the 1978
Guidelines for U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The first issue was resolved earlier this month after the
Japanese government, in spite of strong opposition from Okinawan
residents and in accordance with U.S. wishes, provided land for
U.S. military facilities -- a "gift" for Japan to bring to the
summit table.
</P>
<P>
Now, with the land issue settled, modifying the guidelines for
cooperation has been placed on the agenda and is a core issue of
the summit this month.
</P>
<P>
The aim of modifying the guidelines is clear -- to expand the
scope of Japan-U.S. defense cooperation to cover the whole of the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto has barely been able to conceal his enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of cadres of the political affairs investigation
committee of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, he said
flagrantly that when modifying the guidelines, (he and Clinton)
would take into consideration not only possible "trouble" on the
Korean Peninsula but also "trouble" regarding China's Nansha
Islands and Taiwan Province, Nihon Hoso Kyokai (NHK) television
reported on April 9.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese newspapers did not report Hashimoto's remarks, but
the message he intends giving Clinton on the scope of
Japan-U.S. defense cooperation is obvious.
</P>
<P>
It is not accidental that Hashimoto has listed China's Taiwan
and Nansha Islands as being on the periphery of Japan's defense
area. This is closely connected with the dangerous trends emerging
in Japanese society in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Although World War Two ended over half a century ago, the ghost
of militarism still haunts Japan, and some leading politicians in
the country time and again want to reverse the nature of the war
of aggression, in which Japan inflicted tremendous suffering on
the people of Asia.
</P>
<P>
In July last year, Hashimoto, in the capacity of prime
minister, paid homage to the Yasukuni Shrine housing the memorial
tablets of 14 class-A war criminals. His action has helped spread
the trend of right-wing thought in Japan.
</P>
<P>
As a result, some right-wingers undisguisedly went to China's
Diaoyu Islands last year to create trouble, and certain people
with ulterior motives even claimed that China was Japan's "threat."
</P>
<P>
It is against such a background, that Hashimoto, as prime
minister, has openly sought to include China's Taiwan and Nansha
Islands in Japanese-U.S. defense cooperation.
</P>
<P>
His intentions are obvious. As the Chinese saying goes, "Sima
Zhao's ill intent is known to all -- the villain's design is
obvious." Such a tendency cannot but make people vigilant.

<HEADLINE> CDU Central Council Endorses Kohl's Bid for Chancellorship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's bid
to run for an unprecedented fifth term in next year's general
election was unanimously endorsed by the central council of his
Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party here today.
</P>
<P>
But his bid still needs final approval by the party's national
congress due in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
Defying opinion polls showing that a majority of Germans want
him to retire from politics, Kohl announced on April 2 that after
15 years as chancellor, he felt a personal duty to run for a fifth
term while Germany was facing challenges at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Having secured a place in history as the architect of German
reunification, Kohl obviously still has ambitions to play a major
role in pushing forward the European integration process,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that Kohl's campaign announcement also served
a political purpose -- to put pressure on the main opposition
Social Democratic Party (SPD) -- to choose its candidate for
chancellor, a move which could lead to SDP's internal power
struggles.
</P>
<P>
However, the SPD, which currently has at least three possible
candidates, has made clear that it won't decide until early next
year.

to protect the humanitarian relief operations and help restore
orders to the nation.
</P>
<P>
The force is made up of 6,230 soldiers from Italy, France,

<HEADLINE> Colombian President Arrives For Andean Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Ernesto Samper arrived in Sucre, Bolivia, today for a summit of
the presidents of the Andean Group nations to discuss the future
of regional integration.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia will also
attend the summit.
</P>
<P>
During the flight, President Samper told reporters that the
presidents will demonstrate that the Andean Group will remain
vigorous in spite of Peru's decision to withdraw from the regional
integration process.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori announced on April 12 that
his country would leave the Andean Group after its free-trade
proposals were rejected by the four other member countries.
</P>
<P>
In early April, Peru proposed eliminating subsidies and other
measures to boost free and fair trade in the region.
</P>
<P>
Samper said that they should not lose hope that Peru will
reconsider its position in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
The old Andean Group, established in May 1969, is to be renamed
the Andean Community and Samper said the change would be
accompanied by "a new integration scheme to show the community is
stronger than ever."
</P>
<P>
Samper said that during the summit, he and his Venezuelan
counterpart Rafael Caldera will holds talks on patrolling the
hundreds of kilometers of their common border.

<HEADLINE> Austria, Greece Urge Europe to Consider Small Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Austrian and Greek leaders today
called for the European Union (EU) to secure the voice and the
interests of small members in the bloc's structural reform.
</P>
<P>
Followiing their meeting, Austrian Federal Chancellor Viktor
Klima and visiting Greek Prime Minister Constantinos Simitis said
the new EU treaty to be adopted at a summit in June should take
account of the concerns of small countries.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Simitis arrived at Vienna today on a three-day
visit. He said the two countries shared views on Europe's common
foreign and security policies.
</P>
<P>
He said Greece supported Austria's right to decide whether or
not to take part in the European defense mechanism.
</P>
<P>
France, Germany and Italy, eager to accelerate the European
integration, have proposed that the new EU treaty includes the
creation of an EU defense structure, bringing the Western European
Union into the bloc. Britain and the neutral member states have
opposed the proposal.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in volatile Albania, Simitis said the EU
should pay more attention to the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also agreed that the EU treaty include reform
in employment. The 15-nation EU is suffering from an average
jobless rate of over 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
They said the launching date and the criteria of the EU
monetary union should be observed.
</P>
<P>
Simitis said although Greece could not be able to qualify for
admission into the single currency in the first group, it would
try its best to join as one of the second group.

<HEADLINE> China Opens Direct Rail Line to Hanoi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- China and neighbouring Viet Nam
have opened the first direct passenger rail traffic link via the
border port of Hekou, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based newspaper uses the source from the Ministry
of Railway as saying that two passenger service trains left Hanoi,
the Vietnamese capital, and Kunming, capital of Southwest China's
Yunnan Province, on April 18 along the narrow-track rail line
linking the two cities and arrived in the other about 30 hours
later.
</P>
<P>
This is the most recent move since rail links between the two
countries were restored at two frontier points-Pingxiang and
Hekou-last February.
</P>
<P>
Ministry resources said traffic on the Hanoi-Kunming route has
been available on the line which links Beijing with Hanoi via
Nanning, capital of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region , and the
border port of Pingxiang.
</P>
<P>
However, passengers travelling on the line still have to
transfer to another train after walking across the border, rail
officials noted.
</P>
<P>
The four return passenger trains running on the
Beijing-Nanning-Pingxiang-Hanoi line each week, for instance, do
not have many passengers and are losing money, rail official said.
</P>
<P>
The new passenger service will see four trains a week operating
on the Kunming-Hanoi line, which has yet to become a significant
link for border trade.

<HEADLINE> Peru's Withdrawal From Andean Group Regretted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUCRE, BOLIVIA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Andean Group of South
American countries is lamenting the decision by the Peruvian
government to withdraw from the subregional bloc.
</P>
<P>
A document, known as the Sucre Act, will be signed by four
presidents of the Andean Group at the ninth Andean Presidential
Council here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It said in its second paragraph that Peru's move violated the
essential principles and values of the world economy which favors
developing and enhancing economic blocs.
</P>
<P>
Peru's decision deprives the Andean Group of a partner and
adversely affects the economic integration process in the region,
the act says.
</P>
<P>
Peru decided recently to quit membership of the Andean Group
unless the other four members -- Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and
Venezuela -- stopped pressing it to reduce its customs duties to
zero.
</P>
<P>
Peru also accused those members, which had already introduced
the duty-free policy, of providing subsidies to their export
products to Peru.
</P>
<P>
The future trade ties between Peru and other member states will
be a major topic of the forthcoming summit.
</P>
<P>
The Sucre Act hoped Peru would rejoin the Andean Group in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Act called for preserving, as much as possible,
the channels for developing ties between the Andean Group and Peru.
</P>
<P>
The governments of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela
declare their unfailing pledge to continue working towards the
integration.
</P>
<P>
The Andean Group will be named as the Andean Community after
the summit.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Bangladesh Move to Strengthen Trade Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Bangladesh have
agreed to expand their economic cooperation through creating joint
ventures in more new areas with a trade target of 400 million U.S.
dollars set by 2000, reports reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The new areas will cover fishery, poultry, textiles, dyeing and
chemicals, food processing, leather, footwear, plastics and
tourism.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Pitak Intrawityanunt said Monday
that details of the cooperation will be discussed at the next
Thai-Bangladesh Joint Commission meeting scheduled in Bangkok
later this year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and Bangladesh had enjoyed close and cordial relations
since they established diplomatic ties in 1972, but the potential
of their economic relations has not been fully tapped, Pitak said.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 125 million, Bangladesh provided a vast
market for joint investments such as in the production of
high-quality and low-cost consumer products for its domestic
market, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The opportunities are also seen for joint investments in
Bangladesh in the production of textiles, processed foods,
electronics for exports to the developed world as well as joint
exploration and utilization of energy resources, he added.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and Bangladesh signed a treaty earlier this month to
avoid double taxation to pay the way for their cooperation in the
field of joint investment.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Largest Party Issues Manifesto for Local Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's largest political party
has released its manifesto for the upcoming local elections and
predicted a landslide victory for itself in the polls.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML)
in the manifesto, which was made public Monday, called for voters'
support to the party in order to make local administrative bodies
more people-oriented.
</P>
<P>
"Voting for other parties means institutionalizing corruption
for another term of five years," it said.
</P>
<P>
A landslide victory of CPN-UML in the coming local elections
would be a necessity for political stability and local bodies'
empowerment in the country, the CPN-UML manifesto said.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML, a major partner of Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur
Chand's three-party government, wants to gain more control over
the country's 4,000 local bodies through the local elections
scheduled for next month.
</P>
<P>
Currently the main opposition the Nepali Congress (NC) controls
most of local bodies in the country at the village, municipality
and district levels.
</P>
<P>
The NC party, the second largest party with almost same
strength as the CPN-UML in the hung parliament, announced its
local election manifesto Saturday with a view to maintaining its
overwhelming control of local authorities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Chand has been touring the country
since last weekend to meet with local people and workers of his
National Democratic Party (RPP) as part of the party's campaign
for the elections.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Considers Self-supporting Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma on
Monday approved an economic concept which clearly divides the
military forces into combat forces and service forces -- the
latter providing funds for the combat forces.
</P>
<P>
Valery Muntyan, director of the Economic Bureau of the Defense
Ministry, said that the concept provided for the service forces
making money for the military coffers without using a penny of the
government's money.
</P>
<P>
Muntyan noted that the combat sector would be separate from the
service sector. The service sector would include work forces,
military plants, etc., and would employ redundant personnel and
equipment only to make money.
</P>
<P>
He believed the concept would provide 8 percent of the military
budget by the end of 1997 and 20 percent a year later.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry has 46 enterprises now, eight of which are
ready to make and repair jeeps. Muntyan expected these present and
future factories could make billions of U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian government allocated 1.45 billion hryvnas (about
797 million U.S. dollars) to its armed forces this year, but this
meets only 36 percent of the military's needs.
</P>
<P>
The concept could solve Ukraine's financial crisis, the
official said.

<HEADLINE> Lending Growth Slows Down in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Lending growth by Thailand's
commercial banks was slowing down in the first quarter of this
year, averaging 0.73 percent per month over the same period last
year, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The loans offered by local commercial banks posted 4,124
billion baht (164.96 billion U.S. dollars) in January, 4,170
billion baht (166.8 billion dollars) in February, and 4,184
billion baht (167.36 billion dollars) in March.
</P>
<P>
One of the main factors attributing to the slowdown was low
savings. The lending currently is 1.4 times the savings in
commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Local commercial banks reported average savings growth of 1.18
percent in the first three months of this year, with savings
totaling 3,620 billion baht (144.8 billion dollars) in January,
3,670 billion baht (146.8 billion dollars) in February, 3,710
billion baht (148.4 billion dollars) in March.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks are finding their hands tied. Although they
hope to maintain the growth of lending, a major source of their
revenues, they cannot afford bad loans.

<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's 80,000 retirees and
laid-off workers are to enjoy discounts at designated grocers,
babers and repair shops, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
"This group of people are expected to increasingly rely on
society instead of their work units," said Xu Xiaoyu, head of
social welfare with the Beijing Labor Bureau.
</P>
<P>
About 59,000 cards promising preference and discounts were sent
out last year for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Community volunteers, mostly from local middle schools and
colleges, worked to obtain shopping, hairdressing and repair shop
discounts for card holders.
</P>
<P>
Open to all residents, the volunteer groups also went around
their neighborhoods recruiting laid-off workers and retirees into
the card discount programme.
</P>
<P>
The number of these groups will expand from 32 to 50 this year,
Xu said.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Labour Bureau estimate more than 200,000 workers
will be out of work by the end of this year, as compared to
110,000 at the end of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (37-38) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (37-38)
in a question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: What kind of a body is the Legislative Council of the
Hong Kong SAR?
</P>
<P>
Answer: The Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR is the
legislature of the Hong Kong SAR. Its functions are: to enact,
amend or repeal laws in accordance with legal procedures; to
examine and approve budgets introduced by the government; to
approve taxation and public expenditure; to receive and debate the
policy addresses of the Chief Executive; to raise questions on the
work of the government; to debate any issue concerning public
interests; to endorse the appointment and removal of the judges
of the Court of Final Appeal and the Chief Judge of the High
Court; to receive and handle complaints from Hong Kong residents;
and to pass a motion of impeachment of the Chief Executive and
report it to the central government for decision.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR is fundamentally
different from the British Hong Kong Legislative Council. The
latter was established in accordance with British royal
instructions and has acted only as an advisory body for the
governor in the enactment of laws.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR, to be established
in accordance with the Basic Law and relevant decisions of the
People's Congress, will be a legislature with the power to enact,
amend and repeal laws.
</P>
<P>
Question: How will the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR
be constituted, and what qualifications must council members meet?
</P>
<P>
Answer: It will be constituted by election. The method for
forming the Legislative Council will be specified in the light of
the actual situation in the Hong Kong SAR and in accordance with
the principle of gradual and orderly progress.
</P>
<P>
The specific method for forming the Legislative Council and its
procedures for voting on bills and motions are prescribed in Annex
2 of the Basic Law. The ultimate aim is the election of all
members of the Legislative Council by universal suffrage.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Council will be composed of Chinese citizens
who are permanent residents of the regions with no right of abode
in any foreign country.
</P>
<P>
However, permanent residents of the region who are not of
Chinese nationality may also be elected members of the Legislative
Council, provided that the proportion of such members does not
exceed 20 percent of the total membership of the Council.

<HEADLINE> Fund Helps Tibetans Recover Eyesight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Living on the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau, the Tibetan people receive the world's strongest exposure
to ultraviolet rays from the sun.
</P>
<P>
As a result, cataracts have become a widespread eye illness for
Tibetan people who have weaker eyesight or even lose their
eyesight.
</P>
<P>
Their suffering has aroused great concern from the Tibet
Development Fund (TDF), China's first non-governmental charity
organization in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, today's China Daily
said.
</P>
<P>
The TDF is focusing its 1997 charity efforts on helping Tibetan
cataract patients recover their eyesight.
</P>
<P>
According to Ngapo Jigyuan, deputy secretary-general of TDF,
the organization is preparing to set up an eye-care center this
year in the capital city of Lhasa to train opthalmologists to
treat cataract patients.
</P>
<P>
He said they are now seeking international assistance and have
held talks with some international charity organizations on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
Ngapo Jigyuan, also director of TDF's Beijing Branch Office,
said three foreign organizations have agreed to send medical teams
to China to treat Tibetan cataract patients in July-September of
this year in three Tibetan ethnic areas.
</P>
<P>
The three areas will be Ali and Nagchu prefectures of Tibet and
Ganzi prefecture of Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Nagchu prefecture has a population of about 300,000 and there
are now more than 15,000 cataract patients.
</P>
<P>
Because of the higher level of ultraviolet rays and poor living
standards of many Tibetan patients, the number of cataract
patients in Naqu is still growing by about 1,000 each year.
</P>
<P>
Jigyuan said medical experts sent by Seva Foundation of the
United States, Foundation Eye Care Himalaya of the Netherlands and
Nepal Eye Program of Nepal will conduct eye operations on some 600
Tibetan cataract patients in each prefecture during the period,
using high-quality imported and artificially produced crystalline
lenses.
</P>
<P>
Many Tibetan cataract patients used to be major food earners
for their families. But the eye disease results in deteriorating
living standards as they lose their labor abilities.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Traders Expect 50 million US Dollars at Trade Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Traders from Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region are expected to notch up deals worth 50 million
US dollars at the ongoing 81st Chinese Export Commodities Fair in
Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province, today's
"China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based newspaper quoted Yang Zhongfeng, deputy
director general of the Bureau of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation of Xinjiang as saying that they clinched deals worth
15 million US dollars in the first six days of the spring fair,
and expected this amount to more than treble by the end of the
event.
</P>
<P>
At the fair, Yang urged traders from his region to grain
invaluable modern business techniques and gather commercial
information while bidding for export contracts.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of 1997, foreign trade in the region hit
320 million US dollars, up 54 percent from a year ago. Exports
grew 109 percent to 180 million US dollars, creating a trade
surplus of 40 million US dollars. Foreign trade each month rose
more than 50 percent above the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
The central government aims to invest 12 billion US dollars in
Xinjiang during the 1996-2000 period. Xinjiang lags behind some
other provinces in terms of capital and technology. On the other
hand, it has geological advantages.
</P>
<P>
Along its 5,400-kilometer-long border, there are 15 entry
points connecting the region with eight countries. Over-the-border
trade accounts for 50 percent of the region's foreign trade total.
</P>
<P>
Vast grasslands in Xinjiang benefit the animal husbandry
industry. Xinjiang is rich in mineral resources. More than 130
varieties of minerals have been found.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang's potential oil supply, believed to be second only to
that in the Gulf, is coveted by oil companies around the world,
the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Life Insurers See Record Growth of Premium Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The life insurers in Shanghai,
China's largest trade and financial city, have matched for the
first time their counterparts in property insurance in terms of
premium income.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Insurance Association of Shanghai show that
the total premium income generated from the local insurance market
reached 5.8 billion yuan last year, of which life premium income
accounted for 49.6 percent compared with 39 percent of the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Insurance specialists say that this is the first time the
city's life premium income has matched that from property
insurance.
</P>
<P>
The premium income from the local insurance market will keep
ballooning in the coming years, thanks to the stable growth of the
national economy and the annual income of residents, experts say.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, one of the two pilot cities open to overseas
insurers, has seen a sharp expansion of local insurance market
over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the city's total life premium income rose
by 67.8 percent from that in 1995, much higher than the city's
average 32 percent in the whole sector of insurance.
</P>
<P>
The city has also established a large team of insurance sales
agents, whose number has reached 18,000 now, and has kept
increasing by 1,000 per month.
</P>
<P>
Insurance experts say that life insurers will soon beat their
counterparts in property insurance, and win a overwhelming share
of the total premium income of local insurance market.

<HEADLINE> Thai Rice Exports Plummet in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Thai rice export volume posted
1.04 million tons in the first quarter of this year, slumping by
about 30.2 percent compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Rice Exporters Association, some 60 percent of
the rice exported in the period was high-grade rice, especially
fragrant rice.
</P>
<P>
The surging price of Thai rice on the world market was among
the main factors contributing to the slump, the association said.
</P>
<P>
The value of Thai rice exports posted 10.813 billion baht
(432.5 million U.S. dollars), dropping some 16.8 percent from the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Local rice exporters doubt that the situation will improve in
the second quarter as the prices of Thai rice remain high with
fragrant rice now being sold at more than 700 U.S. dollars a ton.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is expected to import at least 250,000 tons of
Thai rice and will be the largest export market for Thai rice,
according to the association.
</P>
<P>
Iran hoped to import about 400,000 tons of Thai rice and it had
already bought 100,000 tons, the association said. However, the
Thai government is wary of signing any deal with Iran, as the
country's quality inspections are too strict, it added.
</P>
<P>
China has signed a memorandum of understanding to buy 1.03
million tons of rice from Thailand and 70 to 80 percent of the
purchase will be fragrant rice, the association said.
</P>
<P>
To reach this year's rice export target of 5.3 million tons,
Somboon Pathaichan, manager of the association, pointed out that
Thai rice exporters would have to step up marketing efforts and
push for exports of low-grade rice.

YANGON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- An 18-member fact-finding mission

Meanwhile, the ASEAN foreign ministers will meet informally in
Kuala Lumpur at the end of May to decide whether the three
observer countries will be admitted into the grouping this July.

MANILA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government, the
Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the United Nations will
sign today an agreement for development of basic services,
livelihood and job creation for former Muslim rebels and their
families.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, a big boost to the peace agreement signed last
year by the government and the MNLF, includes a funding of 28
million pesos (1 million U.S. dollars) from the United Nations
Development Program and 18 million pesos (0.6 million U.S.
dollars) for pilot emergency assistance.
</P>
<P>
Nur Misuari, MNLF chairman and governor of the Autonomous
Region in Muslim Mindanao, Director-General Cielito Habito of the
National Economic and Development Authority and UN Resident
Coordinator Sarah Timson will sign the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is expected to turn the armed MNLF rebels who can
not be absorbed by the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the
Philippine National Police into soldiers of development in their
communities.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that many MNLF members were dissatisfied with
the peace deal between the government and the MNLF and thousands
of them have defected to the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, a
rebel group that opposes the peace agreement and has sporadic
clashes with government troops.
</P>
<P>
Considering this situation, President Fidel Ramos last week
ordered all government agencies in the southern Philippines to
extend all-out support to MNLF members who can not be integrated

<HEADLINE> Ding Song Seeks Revenge on Samsonov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Ding Song,
undisputedly the best defensive table tennis player in the world,
is seeking a revenge on Belarus' Vladimir Samsonov, to whom he
has lost two important games and his reputation as a
"European-killer".
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Chinese, who has amused and bemused his rivals
with the unique chop-and-attack play, saw his glories and
experiences collected in the 1995 World Championships fell apart
at Samsonov's feet in their two confrontations.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov, currently world No. 4 who outlived a marathon
five-set match against Ding in the World Cup last October, handed
a second defeat to the Chinese in the Qatar Open in Feburary, the
last major event before the 44th World Championships.
</P>
<P>
"I don't care too much how far I will go in individual events
and I just hope I can meet Samsonov again and take a revenge,"
said Ding, an ace player on the Chinese men's squad bidding for
its 12th team title in the Manchester championships starting on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ding, who helped China snatch the team title from three-time
world champion Sweden in the 1995 Worlds held in the northern
Chinese city of Tianjin, is expected to join China's five-men
lineup in the team competitions here.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese, who also ended the singles run of then world
No. 1 Jean-Michael Saive of Belgium en route to finishing fourth
in last championships, is tipped as medal hopefuls in the men's
singles, men's doubles and mixed doubles events.
</P>
<P>
Ding will pair up with three-time world championship veteran
Ma Wenge in the men's doubles and combine with 18-year-old Wang
Hui in the mixed doubles. Wang last year became the first
defensive player for a decade to win the Chinese nationals.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't lost to any Europeans other than Samsonov in recent
years," said world seventh-ranked Ding. "I'm ready for stronger
challenges here because they have been studying my style since
1995.
</P>
<P>
"But I have bad news for them: I am no longer the one in the
Tianjin championships, I am much better than that," said Ding,
who has modified traditional defensive game by adding large doses
of attacking to his play.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese can serve various spins with deceptively the same
flick of the wrist to set up killing shots. "Ding is one of the
best servers in the Chinese team," said Chinese coach Cai Zhenhua.
</P>
<P>
Ding's career is the archetypal rags to riches story. He made
the national team in 1986 and was kicked out for indiscipline in
1988, the year his father died.
</P>
<P>
Rejoining the national squad in 1991, Ding was a changed man,
a man of few words and shaking confidence which earned him a
nickname of "lonely pine" because "song" means pine in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
After two lackluster years on the Chinese team, Ding wanted to
retire in 1993. "I felt so frustrated at that time that I wanted
to end my career," Ding recalled.
</P>
<P>
Ding regained his confidence in the Swedish Open in 1994,
where he upset five world top players to win his first
international title.
</P>
<P>
"The year of 1994 was a turning point in my career," Ding said.
</P>
<P>
"Ding Song used to be a player of weak mentality and now he is
a man of lion heart," Cai said.

<HEADLINE> Don't Rely on Me Too Much, Says Chinese Table Tennis Queen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Plagued by shoulder,
back and ankle injuries, Chinese table tennis queen Deng Yaping
warned her teammates not to rely on her too much.
</P>
<P>
"I can't promise to win two points from every team match at
the world championships," said the 24-year-old Deng. "I am
worried whether I could maintain my technical and physical form."
</P>
<P>
Deng, who has won 15 world championship and World Cup titles
and four Olympic gold medals in her 11-year-long career, is
leading a Chinese women team whose strength has been sapped by
recent retirements of top players Qiao Hong and Liu Wei.
</P>
<P>
Qiao and Liu, currently ranked second and sixth in the world,
had retired from national service to join Japanese clubs after
the Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Bidding for China's 12th team title in the 44th World Table
Tennis Championships is a squad of brilliant youngsters and
differing styles.
</P>
<P>
Besides fast-attacking Deng, the Chinese team has Yang Ying, a
19-year-old penholder, Li Ju, 21, a topspin player in handshake
grip, Wang Nan, a 19-year-old lefthander, Wang Chen, 22, a lanky
all-around handshaker, and Wang Hui, an 18-year-old defensive
player.
</P>
<P>
"Technically, these youngsters and I are on the equal
footing," Deng said. "What they want are stronger nerves."
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xielin agreed with his protege for eight years. "A few
youngsters may be technically better than Deng, but in terms of
mentality and experience, there is no match," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coaches are worried about these youngsters' nerves to
hold pressure in the world championships.
</P>
<P>
"We have thrown international responsibilty on their
shoulders," said the Chinese women's team head coach Lu
Yuansheng. "I'm afraid it may be too heavy for them."
</P>
<P>
None of Yang (world No. 4), Li (No. 5), Wang Chen (No. 7) and
Wang Nan (No. 9), made the Olympic squad after an unimpressive
European tour early last year. Deng and three other veterans,
the same four Olympians who went to Barcelona and then completed
China's clean sweep victory in the 1995 Worlds, hit the road to
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
"One thing these young players have to bear in mind: You
aren't defending the team title here, you are fighting for it,"
Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Deng Yaping's physical condition has long been worrisome to
Chinese coaches, who know Chinese fans have got used to winning
and accept nothing less no matter what reasons.
</P>
<P>
"Deng, troubled with injuries, is no longer as strong as
before and it's the same with the Chinese team because of Qiao
and Liu's retirements," said Lu. "The Chinese team is no longer
a shoo-in at this championships.
</P>
<P>
Deng has been suffering various injuries including a lower
back problem which sometimes causes numbness in her legs.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said numbness caused by injuries was rare for table
tennis players but warned Deng's condition would deteriorate if
not treated immediately.
</P>
<P>
Deng, who wears a special belt around her waist to prevent
further injuries, had reduced her daily training time to about
three hours early this year.
</P>
<P>
"I always trained harder than the other players but this time
my physical condition doesn't allow," Deng told China Sports
Daily early April.
</P>
<P>
China's major threats in the women's team event are expected
to come from Japan, Chinese Taipei, South Korea and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Former Chinese nationals Koyama Chire and Chen Jing, playing
for Japan and Chinese Taipei, will give considerable troubles to
the defending champion team.
</P>
<P>
Chire had upset Deng Yaping in the 1994 Asian Games in
Hiroshima, Japan, while Chen had stretched the world No. 1 to
five sets in the Olympic singles final last summer.
</P>
<P>
"If Deng loses two games in team match, do you have guts to
beat strong players like Chen and Chire and win back three
points," Lu asked his young students.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I do," answered Yang Ying.

<HEADLINE> (rpt with correction) Bosnian President Criticizes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Alija Izetbegovic, chairman of
the Bosnian presidency, said on Monday that he was deeply
concerned about the slow implementation of the Dayton peace
accords.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his concerns at a meeting with representatives of
the 5-nation contact group and the Islamic countries as well as
Carl Bildt, the international community's High Representative and
presented them with an analysis of the implementation process.
</P>
<P>
The analysis, done by his aides and reported by BH Press,
listed nine areas where provisions of the peace agreement are not
implemented or being implemented slowly, such as return of
refugees, common institutions and the dispute on Brcko.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the whole peace process had a negative trend of
development until now and leads to further disintegration of
Bosnia, thus endangering the basis of peace, the analysis said.
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic urged the Western powers which also signed the
Dayton peace agreement to fulfill their promises in helping
implementing fully the accords and use political and economic
means to punish those who obstruct the implementation process.

<HEADLINE> German, Italian Presidents Discuss Social Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Italian President Oscar
Luigi Scalfaro met his German counterpart Roman Herzog today in
Berlin with discussions focusing on fundamental reforms in the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Herzog told reporters after the meeting that while Germany was
making great efforts to reform its taxation and social welfare
systems, Italy was giving top priority to overhaul its state
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the difficulties of social welfare states were
obvious in both countries, Scalfaro stressed that social reforms
must result in changes during which the weak group of the
population should be taken into consideration.
</P>
<P>
In combating unemployment, economic growth alone cannot solve
the problem, Scalfaro said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Italian president started his four-day visit to Germany on
Sunday in the eastern cities of Erfurt and Weimar. He is due in
Bonn on Wednesday to meet German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Rita
Suessmuth, President of the German Bundestag, the lower house of
the parliament.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Weakened in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar fell against the
German mark Monday as uncertainty about the launching of the
single European currency was heightened.
</P>
<P>
The mood came from French President Jacques Chirac's
dissolvement of the National Assembly and ordering early
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
In New York, the dollar settled at 1.6978 marks, down from
1.7119 marks on Friday. The dollar cost 125.31 yen, down from
125.88 yen. The pound cost 1.6353 U.S. dollars, up from 1.6332
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of delay in the monetary union benefits the
mark, since the establishment of a single currency would eliminate
the German currency from its current dominant position in Europe.
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, the dollar has hit a 4-year high of
127.14 yen and a 3-year high of 1.7374 marks.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday:
1.4425 Swiss francs, down from 1.4560; 5.7305 French francs, down
from 5.7650; 1,691.00 Italian lira, down from 1,691.50; 1.3984

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Second Annual ESAF Loan for Mali </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) today approved the second annual loan for Mali under
the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF), in an amount
of some 28 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The loan is provided to support the Mali government's economic
program for 1997. The loan is available in two equal semiannual
installments, the first of which is available immediately.
</P>
<P>
The Mali government's 1997 program is designed to achieve a
growth in real GDP of almost 6 percent, while average annual
inflation is to be lowered to 3.5 percent and the external current
account deficit will be decreased to 11 percent of GDP from more
than 13 percent of GDP in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The ESAF is a concessional IMF facility for backing member
countries which are undertaking economic reform programs to
strengthen their balance of payment and improve their growth
prospects.
</P>
<P>
Mali joined the IMF in September 1963. Its quota is about 94
million dollars equivalent and its outstanding use of IMF credit
current totals about 154 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> China Energy Resources Listed on American Stock Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The China Energy Resources
Corporation today announced the listing of its common shares on
the American Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased to announce the listing of our common shares on
the American Stock Exchange," said Li Hongwu, Chairman of the
Board and President of this British Virgin Islands holding company
which, through its wholly owned subsidiary, has an interest in a
mainland China-based coal refining joint venture.
</P>
<P>
Its first batch of shares being traded on the market were set
at 5,700 at an opening price of 6 U.S. dollars a share. Its
closing price was 5.75 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, China granted the Mishan City, in Heilongjiang
province, the right to operate the joint venture to mine certain
sizable coal reserves in five of the city's districts for a period
of 100 years. All of China Energy Resources' operations are
conducted through this joint venture.
</P>
<P>
"China's energy market has enormous potential," Mr. Li stated.
"Presently, China is producing approximately one billion tons of
coal per year, about 30 percent of which is used for power
generation. The State Planning Commission forecasts that by the
year 2000, annual output will be increased to approximately 1.5
billion tons, with roughly one-third used for power generation.
The substantial majority of energy in China is coal-fired thermal
power."
</P>
<P>
China Energy Resources is a British Virgin Islands holding
company which owns an 80 percent interest in Mishan Hua Xing Coke
Limited, a foreign equity joint venture company. A local Chinese
government entity owns the remaining 20 percent interest in the
Joint Venture. The term of the Joint Venture, which commenced in
October 1995, is for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Venture has production facilities located in Mishan
City and Qitaihe City in the northeast region of China's
Heilongjiang Province. The Joint Venture produces metallurgical
coke and steam coal and is developing its capabilities to produce
foundry coke.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Government Signs Peace Agreement With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, APRIL 21 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese government signed here
today a peace agreement with four small southern rebel factions in
a bid to put an end to the 13-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
However, the largest anti-government group operating in
southern Sudan, the Sudan People's Liberation Army refused to sign
the accords, creating uncertainty whether the peace can be holding.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Sudanese Vice President Al-Zubeir
Mohammed Salih, on behalf of the Sudanese government, and the
leaders of the four factions.
</P>
<P>
Among those present at the signing ceremony were Sudanese
President Omar al-Bashir, President Ange Patasse of the Central
African Republic and President of Chad Idriss Deby.
</P>
<P>
The agreement defined a four-year transition period, during
which a coordination council composed of government officials and
representatives from the four factions will take charge of affairs
in the south.
</P>
<P>
After the transition period, citizens in the south will decide
by ballot whether they will stay in or to separate from the
country.
</P>
<P>
Rebels have fought the government in Khartoum since 1983,
seeking a greater say for the south in Sudan's affairs.

NEW YORK, April 21 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks slid today,
giving back part of last week's rally, with the Dow Jones
industrial average declining 43.34 points to 6,660.21.
</P>
<P>
The Dow bounced back from an 86-point slide over the last a few
minutes. The barometer of 30 big companies added 310 points last
week, recovering nearly half of the 700 points it lost over the
prior month.
</P>
<P>
Broader measures also turned sharply lower in the afternoon
after Alice Rivlin, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve,
heightened fears the central bank will raise interest rates
repeatedly to fight inflation.
</P>
<P>
Rivlin cautioned that persistent strength in consumer demand
could aggravate inflationary pressures at the nation's factories.
After her comments reached the market, bond prices fell, lifting
the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to 7.09 percent from 7.06
percent of last week.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Deficit Declines 13% in First Half of Fiscal 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- In the first half of fiscal
1997, steady economic growth in the country is helping to make the
federal budget deficit 13 percent below the same period of last
year, according to a report from the Treasury Department today.
</P>
<P>
March's deficit was some 21.3 billion U.S. dollars, which
brought the deficit from October through March to 111.3 billion
dollars as compared with 127.7 billion dollars during the first
half of fiscal 1996.
</P>
<P>
For all of 1996, the deficit totaled 107 billion dollars, the
lowest figure in the past 17 years. The Clinton administration
forecast a 125.6 billion dollar deficit for all of fiscal 1997.
</P>
<P>
U.S. economic growth, by raising individuals' incomes and
corporations' profits, increases the government's tax revenue.
Individual income tax collections, at 320.4 billion dollars in the
first six months of this fiscal year, are running 9 percent higher
than that of 1996. Total revenue, at 695.1 billion dollars, is 8
percent increase over the corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, over-all spending stood at 806.4 billion dollars for
the first half of the fiscal year, which is up only 4.3 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government signed
over to Quebec control of job-training programs in the province in
Montreal today.
</P>
<P>
The federal government agreed to pay Quebec 1.9 billion U.S.
dollars over the next five years to assume responsibility for
helping unemployed workers re-enter the work force.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Ottawa also will pay Quebec 190 million dollars to
cover the administrative costs of the transition.
</P>
<P>
"This agreement demonstrates that our governments can work
together to find practical solutions that are adapted to the real
problems of Quebecers," Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said
at the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was also attended by Quebec Premier Lucien
Bouchard, who said that his province has been seeking more powers
in job training since 1965.
</P>
<P>
"It also demonstrates the Government of Canada's determination
to renew the federation, step by step, in an orderly fashion, and
in the interests of all Canadians," Chretien added.
</P>
<P>
Last May, Canada's federal government offered all provinces the
possibility of assuming responsibility for employment-related
services and programs, and thus adapting them to their specific
circumstances and needs.
</P>
<P>
Quebec is the fifth province to sign a manpower deal with
Ottawa after Alberta, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Manitoba.

<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Alija Izetbegovic, chairman of
the Bosnian presidency, said on Monday that he was deeply
concerned about the slow implementation of the Dayton peace
accords.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his concerns at a meeting with representatives of
the 5-nation contact group and the Islamic countries as well as
Carl Bildt, the international community's High Representative and
presented them with an analysis of the implementation process.
</P>
<P>
The analysis, done by his aides and reported by BH Press,
listed nine areas where provisions of the peace agreement are not
implemented or being implemented slowly, such as return of
refugees, common institutions and the dispute on Brcko.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the whole peace process had a negative trend of
development until now and leads to further disintegration of
Bosnia, thus endangering the basis of peace, the analysis said.
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic urged the Western powers which also signed the
Dayton peace agreement to fulfill their promises in helping
implementing fully the accords and use political and economic
means to punish those who obstruct the implementation process.

<HEADLINE> US Considers Still More Food Aid to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States might
consider to provide still more food assistance to the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) if the United Nations World Food
Program staged another appeal to the international community, the
State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
"If the World Food Program comes forward again and say: `It's
not enough from the international community. We need more,' we
would obviously look at that very seriously," State Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
The United States has responded twice this year to the World
Food Program for food aid to the DPRK, and Burns said last week
that the United States will provide no more as that was what it
could have afforded.
</P>
<P>
But DPRK officials have raised the issue of food aid throughout
a series of meetings they held with U.S. and South Korean
officials in New York since last Wednesday, Burns admitted.
</P>
<P>
The New York meeting is designed to discuss the possibility of
four-party peace talks on the Korean Peninsula, proposed by U.S.
President Bill Clinton and South Korean President Kim Yong-sam.
The U.S. and South Korean officials had briefed the DPRK officials
about the proposal and are awaiting a reply from the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Burns revised his remarks of no more food aid with regard to
the DPRK officials' request and said he could not put an end to
the story of food aid.
</P>
<P>
Again, he dismissed any links between the food aid and the New
York meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Our view is we are responding adequatedly and vigorously and
with some compassion from the humanitarian point of view to the
desperate food situation of the North Korea... but let's not link
food aid or any other issues as preconditions or conditions to the
four-party talks proposal," he said.

<HEADLINE> Children Overlooked in E. Europe: UNICEF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The needs of millions of
vulnerable children had been overlooked by the planners of
economic reform in Central and Eastern Europe, according to the
latest report of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
The report, titled Children at Risk in Central and Eastern
Europe: Perils and Promises, noted that social reform across the
region had been piecemeal and uncertain in its aims, strategies
and funding.
</P>
<P>
The report launched in Bonn today said that while too many
children were still being abandoned to state care, the public
child protection system in some countries had virtually collapsed.
</P>
<P>
Many families had to cope with a devastating deterioration
in their material conditions. Skills, social values and coping
strategies developed in the earlier decades had proved vastly
inadequate, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Poverty and social dislocation had put enormous burdens on
families who often had limited capacity of experience in taking
responsibility for children's welfare. Since child monitoring and
checking mechanisms, including those normally to be expected in
school and health systems, had been eroded and were in need of
reform, children were suffering, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The answer lay in political will to put the needs of children
high on the reform agenda, said the report covering 18 countries
in Central and Eastern Europe, the Baltic states and the
Commonwealth of Independent States.

<P>
SARAJEVO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian officials today denied
that chairman of the Bosnian presidency Alija Izetbegovic will
meet with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic within a month.
</P>
<P>
Mirza Hajric, an advisor to Izetbegovic, told the local press
that the Bosnian side had not planned such a meeting with
Milosevic, but a summit with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman was
being prepared.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Bosnian Ambassador to Croatia Kasim Trnka, the Belgrade
weekly Nasa Borba reported last week that preparations for the
Izetbegovic-Milosevic summit were underway and the venue would be
somewhere in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
Trnka said that he was misquoted by the journalist of Nasa
Borba who had interviewed him, according to the Sarajevo press.
</P>
<P>
The reported summit was supposed to focus on the establishment
of diplomatic relations between Bosnia and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The process of normalizing ties between the two countries has
been bogged down on Belgrade's requirement that Bosnia should
withdraw its lawsuit against Yugoslavia from the international
court in the Hague. The Bosnian side has insisted on unconditional
establishment of bilateral relations.

<P>
OTTAWA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Across-the-board increases led to
a 3.0 percent jump in sales by Canadian wholesalers in February,
Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>

<HEADLINE> EU President Criticizes Euro-Sceptics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Jacques Santer, president of the
European Commission, the European Union (EU)'s executive body,
today lashed out at the Euro-sceptics and called for confidence
building in Europe.
</P>
<P>
He made the speech Monday in Amsterdam, where the heads of
state or government of the EU member states are scheduled in two
months time to reform the Maastricht Treaty and adopt the
Amsterdam Treaty.
</P>
<P>
"Questioning cannot be an end in itself, or be used to feed
doubt about our overall objectives. It must be transformed into
decision, determination and action," Santer said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the EU had no choice but move on with its
integration plan. "We must act, not react -- be shapers, not
takers," he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU president expressed his disappointment with both the
media and the public debate about European integration, from which
he said he got the impression that European people themselves
"seem singularly unimpressed by" what they have achieved so far.
</P>
<P>
He criticized those who do not know "what they are talking
about," questioning if those people wanted to step backwards
towards a Europe only composed of simple trading arrangements.
</P>
<P>
"If regression is unthinkable, what other options are left? We
can stick to the status quo or move on," he said, immediately
adding that there was no such a thing as status quo since people
had to adapt themselves to changing circumstances on a daily
basis.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the younger generations needed new
motivation to move on because the initial post-war motivation for
European integration had lost its force.
</P>
<P>
The EU president believed that the prospective European single
currency Euro can act as a good example of added value, which the
EU can offer a new motivation by demonstrating.
</P>
<P>
In the speech, Santer defended the European Monetary Union
(EMU) as a factor which could boost the economic growth in Europe.
However, the Euro-sceptics have been labeling the EMU as a threat
to national monetary sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"Inspiring confidence should also be our guiding principle for
the Intergovernmental Conference," he said, adding that the number
one priority should be getting as many of the 18 million
unemployed EU citizens back to work.
</P>
<P>
He also outlined in the speech the other two priorities which
the EU is supposed to pay close attention to -- institutional
reform and the way in which the EU comes across to its citizens.
</P>
<P>
He was worried that the EU's future enlargement would pose
another problem of efficiency, saying that the possible solution
was to widen the use of majority voting as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
Santer also called for a military capability of Europe,
explaining that the EU's credibility would be at stake if crises
at Europe's immediate borders could only be solved when the United
States threw in its weight.
</P>
<P>
"Be constructive, not destructive. That is my message for the
sceptics -- wherever in Europe," he finally said.

<HEADLINE> German Beer Consumption Saw Another Drop in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Beer Consumption in Germany dropped
again in 1996, continuing a trend evident since 1992, a German
brewers' group said here today.
</P>
<P>
The German Brewery Federation said per-capita consumption of
beer in the country of 80 million fell to 131.7 liters last year
from 142 liters in 1992.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the shrinking market, the number of breweries
declined from 1,356 in 1991 to 1,234 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the federation, people nowadays drink less and go
out to taverns less as affected by the sluggish economy. Changing
drinking habits, health concerns as well as the cold and rainy
weather in last summer had also contributed to the declined beer
consumption in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Germany's beer output last year was 114.5 million hecto-liters,
2.5 million less than in 1995, coming after the United States and
China in the world.
</P>
<P>
The country's beer exports grew by 180,000 hecto-liters to 8.55
million in 1996. An increase was meanwhile reported in imports,
which totaled 2.37 million hecto-liters, up about 500,000
hecto-liters from 1995.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. launched a new
campaign to persuade its European allies to take a tougher policy
to Iran by sending a senior official to Europe, the U.S. State
Department announced today.
</P>
<P>
Peter Tarnoff, as special adviser to Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, was asked by the secretary to lead a State
Department delegation to Europe, which left Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"This mission is to consult with our European allies on our
respective policies towards Iran," State Department spokesman

</P>
<P>
Tarnoff, who stepped down last Friday after four years as
undersecretary of state for political affairs, will explore
"practical steps" that can be taken towards Iran, Burns said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been accusing Iran of supporting terrorism.
</P>

<HEADLINE> UN Secretary-General on Chemical Weapons Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan hopes that the Convention on Chemical Weapons will
become an integral part of the web of international agreements
designed to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, one week before the
convention enters into force on April 29 1997, the
Secretary-General said that the Chemical Weapons Convention would
contribute to international peace and security in three important
ways:
</P>
<P>
- Creating an international norm prohibiting the development,
production and acquisition of chemical weapons;
</P>
<P>
- Leading to the destruction of chemical weapon stockpiles,
thereby eliminating the threat of chemical warfare;
</P>
<P>
- Establishing very stringent verification measures.
</P>
<P>
"The great potential of the convention to contribute to
international peace and security will depend on the degree of
universality it achieves," Annan said. "I have taken every
opportunity to urge member states to ratify the treaty to ensure
that the decades of difficult negotiations will not have been in
vain."
</P>
<P>
The agreement took the international community almost 30 years
to negotiate and another five years to win the requisite number of
ratifications. As of today, the convention has 74 states parties
and 162 states signatories.
</P>
<P>
"I urgently appeal to all states to take, in this final week,
the steps they must to allow the convention to fulfill its promise
and to foster a climate that will promote further advances in arms
regulation and disarmament in the years ahead.

<HEADLINE> French Opposition Parties Embattled for Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Lionel Jospin, first secretary of
France's opposition Socialist Party, said this evening that he is
fully embattled for the early legislative elections on May 25 and
June 1, to "make this tactical dissolution the occasion for an
act of real democracy."
</P>
<P>
Jospin accused Chirac of "precipitating" France toward "a
increased austerity treatment" and "making a step closer to hard
capitalism" by dissolving the parliament.
</P>
<P>
"In this country, unemployment has not ceased to increase and
the inequality is widening... and the meaning of the future slips
away," said Jospin in a statement made after Chirac declared the
dissolution of parliament.
</P>
<P>
He condemned the "Anglo-Saxon model" of social inequality and
said that France should seek "a Europe of the citizens" without
abandoning its own model of civilization.
</P>
<P>
"It is this project of society and this model of civilization
that I will propose to you in this (election) campaign," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The national secretary of the Communist Party, Robert Hue, said
that the dissolution of parliament has taken place because a
terrible tighting up of the social and economic policy.
</P>
<P>
"People know that the problem of unemployment crushes
everybody, and the hardships are enormous," said Hue on a
televised discussion on the decision by Chirac to dissolve the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president of the extreme-right National Front
(FN) party Jean-Marie Le Pen said that the dissolution of the
parliament is a "real political robbery."
</P>
<P>
He accused Chirac of only giving some 20 days, "of which 11
days are holidays," to others to prepare for the legislative
elections.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the FN would present 550 to 560 candidates for
the elections and said that it would "considerably raise its
scores."

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM: No Euro-Med Partnership Without Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- European-Mediterranean partnership
can not survive when instability still endangers the
Mediterranean region, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa warned
today.
</P>
<P>
Everybody feels the necessity of maintaining
European-Mediterranean partnership as it concentrates on regional
cooperation instead of regional disputes, Moussa told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Such partnership, however, can not be unaffected by the
problems overshadowing the regional disputes," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Especially when one speaks about common security in the
Mediterranean, it requires stability, while stability calls for
peace and peace needs justice," Moussa added.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) pursues a free trade area with its
southern neighbors and hopes to sign one day a "Charter for Peace
and Stability in the Euro-Med Region."
</P>
<P>
But Arab countries, turned away by Israel's non-compliance in
the peace process, hold deep reservations about any regional
cooperation at the moment.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on reports that the Euro-Med foreign ministers
conference in Malta ended without issuing a final statement,
Moussa said the Mideast peace process has cast dark shadows on
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The item concerning the peace process, which affected the
final outcome of Malta talks, was a controversial one," Moussa
added, saying that negotiations are still under way in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference last week failed to agree on a final
declaration. Also, the participants haggled over the exact text
on peace in the Mideast and how to achieve it.
</P>
<P>
Arab delegates insisted on the denunciation of Israel while
the Europeans favored a weaker text focusing on looking forward
and making progress rather than finding faults with the past.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the Malta ministerial conference was mainly
devoted to discuss the Barcelona process, which started in 1995
in a bid to develop security, political, economic, cultural and
social ties between the 15 EU members and 12 south Mediterranean
countries.

<HEADLINE> Kohl's CDU Opposes Immigration, Dual Nationality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democrats (CDU) opposes loosening control over
immigration and dual nationality, having rejected such proposals
from both ruling partner and opposition, according to a top CDU
leader today.
</P>
<P>
CDU secretary-general Peter Hintze reiterated the party's
reluctance to allow in immigrants except for ethnic Germans and
Jews from central and eastern Europe, saying after an executive
committee meeting here: "We are in agreement that dual-nationality
offers no general solutions."
</P>
<P>
CDU have rejected proposals for loosening the strict laws on
immigration and dual-nationality from its coalition partner Free
Democrats as well as opposition Greens Party.
</P>
<P>
Germany bases citizenship on blood. Children born to the over
seven million foreigners living in the country cannot obtain
German nationality automatically.
</P>
<P>
At present, the about two million Turkish nationals are the
biggest single group of foreigners in Germany. Like people from
other Mediterranean countries, they came to Germany during 1950s
and early 1970s as guest workers.
