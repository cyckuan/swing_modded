<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Getting a flight ticket from
the city of Nepalganj to other parts of western Nepal is a
difficult thing these days as the grand festival of Dashain
approaches.
</P>
<P>
Large number of people have been flocking to the local
ticketing office of the Royal Nepal Airlines (RNA) to grab flight
tickets for their respective homes, said a report reaching here
today from the western Nepali city, about 350 km southwest of
Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
For those who work in other parts of the country and want to go
back to their homes in remote hilly areas for the Dashain
festival, there is no other alternative except for the air flights
due to the lack of land transport means in the areas.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the surging demand for flight tickets, people
have started queuing up for tickets one day in advance and even
spending nights at the ticketing office.
</P>
<P>
Many elderly people, women and children were also waiting in
the lines, office workers said.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the state-owned RAN airline suggested that private
 airlines in the country should increase their number of flights
to these popular destinations and give priority to passengers'
need.

<HEADLINE> 13 African Nations Face Food Emergencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen African countries are
suffering from continued food shortages and emergencies, according
to a report released here today by the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO).
</P>
<P>
The quarterly Special Report on the Food Supply Situation and
Crop Prospects in Sub-Saharan Africa said Burundi, Liberia, and
Somalia have been hardest-hit.
</P>
<P>
"Pockets of famine have developed in several parts of Liberia
following a sharp reduction in food production and a serious
disruption of relief distributions," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Severe malnutrition and deaths from starvation-related causes
have been reported in several regions where food assistance was
interrupted for prolonged periods because of civil strife.
</P>
<P>
The report called on the international community to focus on
"four areas requiring assistance including Liberia, Somalia and
Sudan, Great Lakes region, and Rwanda and Sierra Leone. Despite
these continuing problem areas, the report said, there has been
some improvement in the outlook for food supplies in sub-Saharan
Africa, following a recovery in production in southern African.
</P>
<P>
However, Abdur Rashid, chief of the FAO's Global Information
and Early Warning System, which published the report, warned,
"Many low-income food deficit countries in Africa, which continue
to face a difficult economic outlook and severe balance of
payments problems, will be unable to import their full food
requirements."
</P>
<P>
About 40 percent of the total population, or 215 million
people, of sub-Saharan Africa is already chronically
undernourished. The number could rise to 265 million in the year
2010, unless action is taken to stem the current trend.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has extended
to November 30 the deadline for illegal immigrants to apply for
permanent residence in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement today, the Department of Home Affairs said said
152,730 applications for permanent residence had been lodged with
the department between July 1 and September 30, the initial
cut-off date.
</P>
<P>
"The extension was decided on after it became apparent that
offices of the Department of Home Affairs were still being
inundated with applications by the end of September," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Of the total applications, about one-third of them had been
received in Gauteng Province.
</P>
<P>
However, a department spokesman said on Wednesday that the
number of the applications did not necessarily mean that all
applicants would be successful in obtaining their permanent
residence.
</P>
<P>
In terms of a recent cabinet decision, citizens from Angola,
Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia,
Swaziland, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and Zambia could qualify for
permanent residence in South Africa if they met certain criteria.
</P>
<P>
The applicants should be able to provide evidence of
continuous residence in the country from July 1, 1991, be engaged
in productive economic activity, have dependent children born or
residing legally in South Africa, and have no criminal record.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are about 2.5 to 4 million illegal
aliens currently living in South Africa, of them a large
percentage are from the above neighbouring countries.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Calls on Palestinians to Be Prepared for All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat today called on all Palestinians to be "fully prepared to
confront all possibilities" in face of lack of progress in
Israeli-Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Palestinian Council at the West Bank town of
Ramallah, Arafat expressed disappointment with the stagnation of
peace talks with Israel which resumed early this week after blood
conflicts between Palestinians and Israeli forces two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
"So we have to be fully prepared. We need to be fully prepared
to confront all possibilities, difficult possibilities, harsh
possibilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the military closure on Palestinian territories
imposed by Israel, Arafat said the Palestinians would "fear
neither a tank and armored vehicle, nor the strongest army in the
region."
</P>
<P>
"This people has been fighting since a hundred years ago, It
seems that the new Israeli government does not know who the
Palestinian people are," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Arafat stressed that peace is the "strategic choice"
for Palestinian people as well as for all Arabs. He called on
Israel to realize peace with all Arabs, advance the peace talks
"not only on the Palestinian, Egyptian or Jordanian tracks, but
also on the Lebanese and Syrian tracks."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Israel's demand for major changes in security
arrangements in implementing the signed agreements, Arafat ruled
out any compromise on the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also blamed the economic difficulties in the Palestinian
territories on Israel's closure where some people "reach the brink
of starvation."
</P>
<P>
This is the first strong warning that Arafat issued after the
Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed late last month which killed 75
people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in an interview with an Egyptian newspaper published
today, Arafat expressed pessimism on the success of the current
round of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He warned the situation in the Palestinian territories
remained volatile and could "explode at any time." He added that
if another Intifada, or Arab uprising, broke out, it would be
impossible for him to stop it.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said at today's
meeting that no progress had been made after four days of talks at
the Erez checkpoint because of Israel's insistence on changes in
security arrangements, especially on the issue of Hebron
redeployment, which is the leading obstacle in the talks.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the joint Israeli-Palestinian steering committee
broke up into security and civil affairs subcommittees, after
talks on Hebron redeployment made little headway. The security
subcommittee focused specifically on the Hebron issue.
</P>
<P>
By breaking up into smaller committees, the two sides hoped to
make progress on some issues, including Hebron redeployment. But
Erekat said Wednesday that the Palestinian side would resist any
Israeli attempt to change the signed agreement on Hebron
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Erekat claimed Palestinians would seek international
arbitration if Israel continue to block the talks with its
insistence on security changes.
</P>
<P>
Fears increase again about another flare-up of violence in
the Palestinian territories if the current talks fail to achieve
any progress.
</P>
<P>
Israeli military has warned that the volatile situation in
the territories would lead to new bloodshed which could end the
peace process.

<HEADLINE> Strike Shuts Down GM Plants in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Production has ceased at all
General Motors (GM) Canada plants today, with all of its 26,000
autoworkers on the picket lines now.
</P>
<P>
Some 6,000 workers at three Ontario plants walked off the job
Wednesday night, joining about 20,000 other GM members of the
Canadian Auto Workers (CAW) who began striking last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The company and the CAW union met Wednesday. But there was no
progress over the issue of contracting out jobs to cheaper outside
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
GM wants to sell plants or lay off workers for a total job loss
of 5,500 in a bid to become more competitive. The union wants a
guarantee that any outsourced job will be replaced by another.
</P>
<P>
The workers "are frustrated by the lack of progress," union
leader Buzz Hargrove was quoted by today's local media reports as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The week-long strike has already forced a halt to production of
GM's Chevrolet and GMC pickups and Chevrolet Lumina and Monte
Carlo sedans, all of them made in Oshawa, Canada.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,800 GM workers were laid off Tuesday at U.S. plants,
which supplied engines and other parts for idled Canadian assembly
operations.
</P>
<P>
And a majority of GM's U.S. and Mexican assembly plants will be
hit by the strike, some as early as next week, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Child-Abuse Deaths Down in New York, Up Across US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The cases of child-abuse
deaths have declined sharply in New York City and State in the
last five years, but such cases have increased across the country.
</P>
<P>
Child-abuse deaths -- defined as deaths caused by parents or
caretakers like foster parents and legal guardians -- fell by 50
percent from 1991 to 1995 in both the city and state, according to
the New York State Department of Social Services.
</P>
<P>
Statewide last year, there were 60 deaths of children caused by
a parent's or gurdian's abuse or maltreatment, down from 113 such
deaths in 1991. In the city, the figures slid to 29, from 60.
</P>
<P>
Judges, prosecutors and medical examiners, as well s foster
care expers, lawyers for abused children and officials with the
city's child welfare agency all attributed the decline partly to a
drop in crack-cocaine use and better medical care to prevent badly
injured children from dying.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the state and city child-abuse fatalities
differs greatly from th national experience. Across the country,
child-abuse fatalities increased by almost 40 percent from 1985 to
1991, according to the National Committee to Prevent Child Abuse,
and have roughly held steady since then at about 1,250 a year.
</P>
<P>
The overall rates of abuse, particularly what is categorized as
serious physical abuse, have also skyrocketed nationwide. A study
released this year by the Unite States Department of Health and
Human Services showed that from 1986 to 1993, confirmed incidents
of abuse and neglect doubled in the country. The report found that
serious physical abuse increased 400 percent over those years.

<HEADLINE> Christopher Urges Forming African Peacekeeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Chen Cailin
</P>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting United States
Secretary of State Warren Christopher pledged here today that the
U.S. government would help Africa form a peacekeeping force
responding to crisis in the continent.
</P>
<P>
"The time has come to build on your expertise to create a new
political and military partnership - what we have called an
African Crisis Response Force (ACRF)," said Christopher in a
speech delivered at the Organisation of African Unity (OAU)
headquarters in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
In the lecture titled "The OAU and Peace in Africa" which was
obtained by Xinhua, Christopher explained African countries,
having gained experience in various United Nations peacekeeping
operations around the world, should provide troops to the
proposed 10,000 strong ACRF, which would be financed by western
donors.
</P>
<P>
Senior American officials said the U.S. government is willing
to provide half of the expense to create the African peacekeeping
force and is persuading its European allies to cover the rest of
fund.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 25 million to 40 million U.S. Dollars are needed
to create the ACRF, according to military experts.
</P>
<P>
"It would not be a standing force, but one that could be
assembled quickly, led by Africans, and deployed under U.N.
auspices. Its mission would be to protect innocent civilians,
ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid and help resolve
conflicts in African and beyond," said Christopher.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said the African peacekeeping force could be
deployed in crisis-stricken countries such as Burundi, a central
African country which is on the verge of an ethnic war between
the majority Hutu and the ruling minority Tutsi.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Secretary of State, who is on his first ever trip to
Africa during his four-year term, also pledged "American
commitment" to the African continent in the latter's strive for
maintaining peace, developing economies, fighting drug
trafficking, enhancing women's social roles and achieving
democracy.
</P>
<P>
African diplomats believed that Christopher, whose major
diplomatic activity spheres have been in the Middle East and
Bosnia, chose this specific time for his first African tour in a
bid to drum up African-American voters' support for Bill
Clinton's campaign in the presidential elections scheduled for
November 5.
</P>
<P>
He is also here to seek African support to choose another U.N.
Secretary General candidate to replace Boutros Boutros-Ghali
whose term will expire at the end of December this year,
indicating that the U.S. would surely veto Ghali's candidature.
</P>
<P>
"We have made clear that we are sympathetic to Africa's desire
for a second term. I urge you to identify strong African
candidates for (U.N.) Secretary General," said Christopher.
</P>
<P>
Christopher arrived in the Ethiopian capital today from Mali
where he started his eight-day African tour on October 7. He is
also expected to visit Tanzania and Angola and wrap up his
five-nation African tour in South Africa.

<HEADLINE> 5,000 Council Houses Sold in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, 10 (Xinhua) -- About 5,000 council houses were sold to the
sitting tenants in Zambia from January to May this year as part of
the government new housing policy to suppport home ownership, Local
Government and Housing Deputy Minister Mbunda Chisenga said
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting in parliament, Mbunda Chisenga said more
than 667 million Kwacha (about 500,000 U.S.
Dollars) has been collected from the sale of the houses.
</P>
<P>
The Local Government and Housing Ministry did not benefit from the
sale because the houses belonged to individual councils, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Local Government and Housing Minister Ben Mwiinga
directed all the councils to take stern action against council
officials interfering in the sale of houses.
</P>
<P>
He said all proceeds from the sale of houses will go to the
housing development revolving fund, part of which will be used to
build new houses.
</P>
<P>
Mwiinga warned that any council or their officials who will use
these funds for other purposes other than the stipulated purpose
will be severely dealt with.

<HEADLINE> Chang's Suffers Surprise Exit in Beijing Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Unseeded Martin Damm of
Czech Republic stunned top seed Michael Chang 6-3, 6-4 in the
second round of the Beijing Open tennis tournament on Thursday,
dashing the Asian idol's dream of winning a title in Asia this
year.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese-American Chang, who vaulted to the career-high
second place in the world rankings, had been looking for a fourth
consecutive title at the event, which was inaugurated in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Chang, a finalist at the Australian and U.S. Opens this year,
has won ten titles in Asia.
</P>
<P>
He suffered a blow en route to his 11th last week in
Singapore when he lost to compatriot Jonathan Stark in the finale.
</P>
<P>
But Chang denied the loss to Stark exerted pressure on his mind
in the clash against Damm. "You have your good days and bad
days," he said. "There's a difference between trying your best and
playing your best. I tried my best, but that wasn't good enough."
</P>

<HEADLINE> France Urges Protection of Human Body Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The French parliament today
unanimously adopted a resolution calling for the protection of the
integrity of human body for each person against possible
violations by biological technology.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentarians were reacting to a draft law presented by
the European Commission to the European Parliament and the
European Council of Ministers on the promotion of inventions in
biological technology.
</P>
<P>
The members of the French National Assembly said that such a
law should include a clause obliging all members of the European
Union (EU) to "protect human being in its dignity and identity,
and to guarantee each person, without discrimination, the respect
of its integrity."
</P>
<P>
They said that the EU should also be committed to the principle
that human body, its elements and its products, cannot become "the
object of a patrimonial right."
</P>
<P>
"In the form, the original proposal of the European Commission
is unacceptable because there is an incompatibility between the
French Constitution and the text which was submitted to us," said
Jean-Francois Matei, a member of the National Assembly from the
Union pour la Democratie Francaise (UDF).
</P>
<P>
He said that the proposal also lacks distinctions between "what
is human, animal and vegetable" and between "what is technique,
law, administration and ethnics."
</P>
<P>
"The question is to know whether we will have tomorrow the
right to feed our industries with a primitive material, which
could be a living material and especially the human material," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The UDF deputy noted that France adopted in 1994 a series of
laws on biological technology banning anyone from inheriting or
claiming patent to products from human body.

<HEADLINE> Irish PM Launches Verbal Attacks Upon IRA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister John Bruton
launched fierce verbal attacks upon the Irish Republican Army
(IRA) today in Dublin, saying the Republicans would be banned from
peace talks unless they promised to end violence.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Irish Parliament earlier today, Bruton said that
the IRA's bomb attacks at a British Army base in Lisburn Monday
was "directly and cynically aimed at destabilizing the Northern
Ireland Loyalists cease-fire."
</P>
<P>
The Irish leader made it clear that violence and democracy did
not mix and "we must not allow IRA to succeed in this betrayal" of
the on-going Northern Ireland peace process, according to reports
from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Bruton insisted that the use of violence would not pressure the
British and Irish governments into dropping their condition that
the IRA calls a new cease-fire before its political wing Sinn Fein
is allowed to take part in the multi-party peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"Let me say this to the hardliners: if the Republican movement
wants to be taken seriously as democrats, with all the benefits
that confer, they will have to get rid of the tactical use of
violence for good," Bruton added.

<HEADLINE> Salim on African Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim,
Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
today told visiting U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher that
his five-nation African tour came "at a critical juncture."
</P>
<P>
"African countries are currently engaged in fundamental
political and economic reforms aimed at releasing all the
energies and resources of our people and ensuring a more
propitious environment for political and economic advancement,"
said Salim in talks with Christopher at the OAU headquarters in
the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
African states have been taking bold steps to bring about
rapid transformation and create enabling conditions for speedy
economic growth, recovery and social progress, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We are very conscious of the fact that without peace and
security, our efforts towards socio-economic development and
progress will continue to be hampered," he added.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief said Africa considers the U.S. support as a major
source of strength in the African endevour to address the problem
of conflict.
</P>
<P>
On OAU's increasing role in observation of elections, Salim
said that during the last two years, the organization has been
associated in the observation and monitoring of close to 50
elections or referenda held in the continent.
</P>
<P>
"This particular role is highly appreciated by member states
and increasingly recognized by our partners in the international
community," said Salim.
</P>
<P>
He also said the OAU has been implementing of the Abuja Treaty
aiming at establishing the African Economic Community (AEC).
</P>
<P>
"We see the forthcoming inaugural session of the Economic and
Social Commission of the AEC scheduled from November 19 to 21 in
Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire as a crucial step in this endeavor," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Salim said they discussed African conflicts and Africa's
role in the world political and economic affairs as well as the
U.S. commitment to Africa.
</P>
<P>
Answering question about whether he and Christopher talked
about African candidates for the post of U.N. Secretary General,
Salim said the two sides did not mention this topic during the
talks.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October (Xinhua) -- An Swedish delegation
arrived here today to find out whether South African security
agents were behind the 1986 assassination of former Swedish Prime
Minister and anti-apartheid campaigner Olof Palme.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if there is a connection, but We will
investigate thoroughly," Jan Danielsson, Chief Prosecutor of the
Swedish government, told a press conference after talks with
South African Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi.
</P>
<P>
On whether he believed in an allegation made by former South
African security officer Eugene De Kock, that South African
security agents were responsible for Palme's assassination in a
Stockholm street, Omar said: "Anything is possible."
</P>
<P>
Kock had been convicted on 89 charges by a court in Cape Town
for his criminal activities during the past years, including six
murders.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish investigators will travel to Pretoria on Friday
where they will hold talks with Transvaal Regional
Attorney-General Jan D'Oliveira who had successfully prosecuted De
Kock on several charges.
</P>

Danielsson said only after talks with D'Oliveira would the
Swedish delegation decide who to contact, including De Kock.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Criticizes Arafat's Warning of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer
Weizman today criticized Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat for his
warning that he could not stop a new intifada, or Arab uprising,
if the Israeli-Palestinian talks collapsed.
</P>
<P>
Arafat issued the warning today in a speech to the Palestinian
Council in the West Bank town of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
This is the first warning Arafat has given since the
Israeli-Palestinian talks resumed early this week after last
month's bloodshed between Palestinians and Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his disappointment with the lack of progress in
the talks, Arafat called on all Palestinians to be "prepared for
all possibilities."
</P>
<P>
During an interview with an Egyptian newspaper published
today, Arafat said he was pessimistic about the success of the
current talks. He added that the situation in the Palestinian
territories remained volatile and could lead to another intifada,
which he could not stop in case it occurs.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said Arafat's remarks contradicted those he made
during his visit to Weizman's residence in Caesarea two days
ago. Arafat promised Weizman he would pursue peace without
violence and prevent Palestinian policemen from shooting at
Israeli soldiers as in the bloodshed last month.
</P>
<P>
Weizman invited Arafat to make his first public visit to
Israel in an attempt to ease the current tension caused by the
bloody conflicts triggered by the Israeli opening of an
archaeological tunnel near the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third
holiest shrine. The conflicts left 75 people dead on both sides.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an Israeli government spokesman called on the
Palestinians to be patient over the lack of progress in the peace
talks, saying that it would take time before the interim agreement
could be implemented.
</P>
<P>
Moshe Fogel, Israeli spokesman for the current peace talks,
told Israel Radio that he believed the parties would solve the
differences through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, confidence-building measures were needed
first to stablize the situation following the recent violence. He
called on Palestinians to better understand Israeli concern about
security, without which, he said, it would be "impossible to
bridge the gap."
</P>
<P>
"Our point of view is that these meetings allow us to air the
different types of issues. And I think first we have to
understand that what is of concern to Israel, and the security
issue is of primary importance to us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Arafat's warning, Fogel said lack of progress in
the talks was because the two sides were currently at the
beginning of negotiations. As the talks proceeded, the two sides
could solve differences.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Arafat's statements made at Weizman's home, Fogel
said that violence was incompatible with peace-making. He
expressed the belief that Arafat would "better understand what's
of concern to us in coming days, or coming weeks."
</P>
<P>
No tangible progress has been made between Israel and the
Palestinians after four days of peace talks at the Erez checkpoint
between Israel and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The major obstacle is the implementation of the agreement on
Israel's redeployment from the West Bank town of Hebron. Israel has
been demanding for major changes in security arrangements, which
was flatly ruled out by the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the joint Israeli-Palestinian steering committee
broke up into security and civil affairs sub-committees after
talks on the Hebron redeployment made little headway. The security
sub-committees focused specifically on the Hebron issue.
</P>
<P>
The talks would resume next Monday although the venue of
the meeting has not yet been decided.
</P>
<P>
Arafat had reportedly ordered no compromise on the agreement,
and Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat claimed Palestinians
would seek international arbitration if Israel continued blocking
the talks.
</P>
<P>
Fears increase again about another flare-up of violence in
the Palestinian territories if the current talks continue
deadlocked. The Israeli military has already warned the volatile
situation in the territories would lead to new bloodshed which
could end the peace process.

NAIROBI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi today rejected a demand by churches and opposition parties
for a constitutional reform in the East African country.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the nation to mark this year's Moi Day, the
president noted the Constitution is an important document which
"cannot be subjected to short-term changes to suit the desire of
certain groups".
</P>
<P>
"Constitutional reforms are an involving task which takes a
long time to complete," said President Moi, adding that it is
impossible to carry out a constitutional review before the
multi-party general elections scheduled for next year.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Moi also ruled out a call made by opposition
leaders for a coalition government, saying the coalition
government would be "tantamount to fragmenting the nation along
tribal lines."
</P>
<P>
The president assured Kenyans that the registration exercise
for the multi-party general elections will be carried out fairly
so that all eligible voters can exercise their rights to vote.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Calls for Quick Delivery of Promised aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat today urged international donor countries to deliver
their promised aid quickly to ease economic difficulties in the
Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Arafat renewed the call in an address to a meeting of donor
countries held in the West Bank town of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the Palestinians in the self-rule areas are on
the "brink of starvation" because of the protracted crippling
closure imposed by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat blasted the closure for costing the fledging
Palestinian economy six million U.S. dollars a day in lost wages
of Palestinian workers and exports. Some reports said that the
unemployment rate in the territories was as high as 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The closure, imposed from late February after four suicide
bombings by Hamas activists against Israel took place, prevented
tens of thousands of Palestinian workers from entering Israel to
seek jobs. Consequently, the free flow of Palestinian goods was
also impeded.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Arafat praised the European Union (EU) for
realizing 90 percent of its promised aid, adding that most of other
donors had failed to deliver their promised aid. The donor
countries have so far pledged to provide a total of three billion
dollars of aid by the year 1999.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Likud government promised that it would work to lift
the closure, but has only allowed about 20,000 Palestinian
workers to return to their jobs in Israel.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the recent bloody conflicts, Israel has reduced
again the number of Palestinian workers allowed into the country
and imposed internal closure in certain Palestinian towns to
prevent more violence.
</P>
<P>
The economic plight in the territories is widely regarded as
one of the major causes for the bloodshed last month, which
killed 75 people.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Arafat warned that the volatile situation in the
territories could explode at any time. He added that if another
intifada, or Arab uprising, broke out, he could not possibly stop
it.

<HEADLINE> OSCE Monitors for Bosnia's Local Elections Arrive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A group of 44 monitors who
will supervise the local elections in Bosnia scheduled for next
month arrived in Sarajevo today, the OSCE mission in Bosnia said.
</P>
<P>
The monitors, who will be staying through December 10, came
from Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland,
Spain, Sweden, Great Britain and the United States, the Tanjug
news agency quoted the OSCE officials in the Serb city of Banja
Luka as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was the first large group to come and hundreds more of
personnel would arrive in the coming days and weeks, the OSCE
officials said.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), these monitors will supervise the
entire election process and provide logistics support.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE is charged by the United Nations for organizing and
monitoring the first post-war general elections in Bosnia. The
national elections were held on September 14, but municipal
elections have been delayed until November as the OSCE has been
aware of possible fraud in local elections.
</P>
<P>
Many of the monitors participated in the supervision of the
September 14 elections for the joint authorities of Bosnia and the
two entities, Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat Federation,
the OSCE officials said.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day general election, most of the 2.9 million
eligible voters cast their ballots to choose the three-member
presidency, the house of representatives of Bosnia, the
parliaments of Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat Federation
and the Republika Srpska president.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, OSCE spokesman David Foley said in Sarajevo today
that the local elections in Bosnia will last two instead of three
days as earlier announced and will be held on November 23-24,
</P>
<P>
The municipal elections, which were originally planned to be
held on November 22-24, will mark the end of the last phase of the
implementation of the Dayton accords, after which a part of the
multinational Implementation Force (IFOR) will withdraw.

<HEADLINE> Greenpeace's Ship Anchors near Lebanon after </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A Greenpeace ship has anchored
off the Lebanon's coast after its entry was dismissed by the
Lebanese authorities, and a Lebanese minister ruled out today a
possibility to reconsider the decision.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here today, a spokesman of the
international environment-monitoring group announced that the
ship Artic Sunrise would navigate back to Cyprus if the Lebanese
government does not change its mind.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Environment Pierre Pharaon was quoted by the
Lebanese Central News Agency as saying that the government "has
taken the decision banning the Artic Sunrise's entry and will
not retreat from it."
</P>
<P>
He said that he "will not meet anybody in order to reconsider
the decision."
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government has been annoyed at Greenpeace's
repeated accusations in the past two years on the government's
alleged failure to process toxic waste dumped by Italian
companies on Lebanon's land during the country's 1975-90 civil
war.
</P>
<P>
In September 1995, the Lebanese authorities forced the
Greenpeace ship Altair to Leave Beirut, preventing it from
giving more information on the Italian industrial waste.
</P>
<P>
Fuad Hamdan, spokesman of Greenpeace's Mediterranean office,
told a press conference that the Artic Sunrise anchored in the
Mediterranean waters 12 miles away from Lebanon's coast at 10:00
a.m. (08:00 GMT) today.
</P>
<P>
He said the ship would wait for 24 hours and if the Lebanese
authorities does not approve its entry the ship would return to
Cyprus "to continue its activities in the Mediterranean sea."
</P>
<P>
"We are knocking the door and we will wait for one day in
order to obtain the Lebanese authority's agreement on a visit to
the ports of Jounieh and Saida (Sidon)," the Greenpeace
spokesman noted.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa's Census '96 Gets Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, October 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's first
post-apartheid population count, census '96, went into full
operation today, said sources here.
</P>
<P>
Census '96 kicked off last night throughout the country
with the counting of homeless people who gathered at specially
arranged street parties where they were treated with food and
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
Census '96 Co-ordinator Pali Lehohla said in Johannesburg that it
was the first time that South Africa's homeless were counted.
</P>
<P>
Lehohla said: "By taking this approach we are giving the homeless
something in return for their commitment to South Africa's first true
population count."
</P>
<P>
In Cape Town, a special team comprising field workers from
non-governmental organisations and census enumerators went out in
search of the homeless and street children on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Kwazulu/natal census co-ordinator Mariam Seedat also described the
enumeration of the homeless people in the province as successful.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, census spokesman Shahieda Hendricks said most of the
people they spoke to during the counting process were co-operative.
</P>
<P>
However, the counting process ran into problems in various areas of
the country as conflict over the employment and security of
enumerators caused delays and disruptions.
</P>
<P>
In some areas, enumerators demanded contracts to ensure their
safety and to guarantee payment. While in some remote rural areas,
problems also reported when villagers protested against the use of
enumerators from outside communities.
</P>
<P>
In order to make sure the census '96 go on smoothly, Safety and
Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi on Wednesday announced a security
network utilising the joint security staff of the South African Police
Services and South African National Defence Force had been established
to meet the safety and security needs.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi said the police force would secure the safety of
enumerators in volatile areas and provide escorts to enumerators in
potential trouble spots.
</P>
<P>
Census '96 will continue until the end of October and President
Nelson Mandela is expected to make public the findings at the end of
November. enditem

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher will arrive at the northern Tanzanian town
of Arusha tomorrow morning for a day-long visit.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to hold talks with the presidents of Tanzania,
Kenya and Uganda, who are expected to attend a regional summit in
Arusha on the assessment of the situation in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania Kiki Munshi told
reporters today in Arusha that Christopher would have separate
meetings with presidents Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania, Daniel Arap
Moi of Kenya, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and retired Tanzanian
president Mwalimu Julius Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
Christopher will also tour the International Criminal Tribunal
for Rwanda (ICTR), which is based in the town, before leaving for
South Africa in the evening, according to the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
There has been wide speculation that Christopher will press
for a 10,000-strong African force to deal with humanitarian
crises, while persuading African leaders to choose another
African candidate, rather than Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the
post of the U.N. secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Christopher flew to Addis Ababa on Wednesday, where he held
talks with officials of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU)
on peace initiatives.

<HEADLINE> Regional Integration Indispensible to Africa's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Regional integration will
help bring African countries into the increasingly competitive
global economy of the 21st century in which regional economic
blocs are destined to play an increased role, K. Y. Amoako,
Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for
Africa (ECA) said here today.
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-day conference on regional integration and trade
liberalization in sub-Saharan Africa, Amoako said African
countries want to become a stronger, more integral part of the
world-wide move towards political pluralism and democracy,
globalization, and liberalization of the world economy, and
greater integration of financial markets.
</P>
<P>
"These happenings not only challenge us to help broaden
opportunities for Africa'', but also ''point to the need to
broaden the concept of regionalism and to rethink or reaffirm
Africa's integration strategy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the process of integration in Africa should be
based on two sets of fundamental policies: 1/ market integration
through trade liberalization, monetary harmonization, and private
sector promotion= and 2/ expansion and interconnection of
Africa's physical infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Aileen Marshal, representative of the Global Coalition for
Africa (GCA), said Africa's development efforts are unlikely to
reach their full potential without effective cooperation between
countries.
</P>
<P>
''Greater regional integration within the continent would
probably help individual countries better take advantage of the
new global environment, and make the region a more attractive
partner for other trading blocks,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
The conference was organized by the African Economic Research
Consortium and the ECA. It will deliberate on issues of regional
integration and trade liberalization in Africa. enditem

months this week, according to a national survey released today by
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia Urged Cooperation With Int'l Tribunal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council today strongly appealed to the parties of Bosnia
and Herzegovina to make every effort to identify the fate of the
missing persons, both for humanitarian and legal purposes.
</P>
<P>
Honduras Ambassador Gerardo Martinez Blanco, council president
for October, said in a statement that the council expressed deep
concern about the little progress in the investigations of
violations of international humanitarian law in Srebrenica, Zepa,
Banja Luka and Sanski Most and other areas in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council expressed concern that the endeavors to
identify the fate of the missing by inter alia carrying out
exhumations have met with limited success largely due to
obstruction by Republika Srpska. The fate of only a few hundred
missing persons has been so far established.
</P>
<P>
While urging cooperation between Republika Srpska and the
International Tribunal, the council condemned all attempts to
obstruct the investigations or to destroy, alter, conceal or
damage any related evidence.
</P>
<P>
"The council stresses again the obligations of all the parties
to cooperate fully and unconditionally with the relevant
international authorities and among themselves with respect to
such investigations and reminds the parties of their commitment"
under the Peace Agreement, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council reaffirmed that the violations of
international humanitarian law throughout Bosnia must be fully and
properly investigated.
</P>
<P>
It reiterated that all states and concerned parties have an
obligation to cooperate fully with the International Tribunal and
to comply with requests for assistance or orders issued by a trial
chamber, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Six Acquitted in S.Africa's Malan Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Six alleged members accused of
having been part of a massacre squad that killed 13 people in
Kwazulu/natal Province in 1987 were acquitted in the Durban Supreme
Court today, said sources here.
</P>
<P>
The six, co-accused of Magnus Malan, former South African Defence
Minister, were facing 13 counts of murder, five of attempted murder
and two separate charges of conspiracy to murder, arisig from the
attack at United Democratic Front activist Victor Ntuli's house in
Kwamakutha Township south of Durban on January 21, 1987.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 10 accused, including Malan and some other powerful
figures of the apartheid regime, were to learn their fate on Friday,
said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Justice Jan Hugo ruled that evidence against the six by three
witnesses, all confessed accomplices in the massacre, was
unreliable.
</P>
<P>
Describing the key witness, former Military Intelligence
Operative Captain J. P. Opperman, as a lying witness, Hugo said the
state had not proved their guilt beyond any reasonable doubt.
</P>
<P>
Although there were defects in the testmony of the six accused,
Hugo said they were entitled to the benefit of the doubt and were
therefore acquitted.
</P>
<P>
Justice Hugo also criticised the way in which the Malan case was
investigated and prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
However, the acquittal of the six caused mixed reaction from
the political parties.
</P>
<P>
The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), which was allegedly involved in
the massacre, welcomed the court judgement, saying the judgement would
bring an end to an era in which the IFP had been vilified as being
involved in murder.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Durban, the IFP said the judgement so far
proved the state should in future be more prudent and cautious before
embarking on prosecutions which were widely perceived to have
high-level political connotations.
</P>
<P>
The African National Congress (ANC) in Kwazulu/natal, however,
expressed shock and disappointment at the acquittals, saying the
verdict might be acceptable in the eyes of the people.
</P>
<P>
The ANC said the consequences of the judgement would be
far-reaching, adding "it is doubtful whether our people will ever have
confidence in the judicial system if it remains the same". enditem

<HEADLINE> Krajisnik Says Serbs Ready to Cooperate in Joint Organs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A Bosnian Serb senior official
said Thursday the Serbs were ready to cooperate with the other
entities in Bosnia's joint organs.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared for the presidency to convene as soon as
possible, and to call our deputies to sign a joint statement and
contribute to the functioning of joint organs," said Momcilo
Krajisnik, the Serb member of the three-seat Bosnian presidency.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in Serb capital Pale after talks with
British Foreign Office Secretary Nicholas Bonsor and British
ambassador in Sarajevo Charles Crawfold on the implementation of
the Dayton accord.
</P>
<P>
The Serb representatives boycotted the inaugural session of
Bosnia's newly-elected parliament in Sarajevo last Saturday,
dealing a setback to the international peace efforts. The Serb
officials cited safety as reasons for the boycott but the West
says the Serb authority was unwilling to sign an oath to Bosnian
constitution for a united country.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik told reporters that he conveyed to the British
diplomats the willingness of Republika Srpska to work in the joint
organs of Bosnia which he hoped would be constituted as quickly as
possible, Tanjug news agency reported from Pale.
</P>
<P>
His statement was apparently a compromise after international
High Representative Carl Bildt sent a strong message to Serb
officials Tuesday urging them to take part in Bosnia's joint
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik also said a Bosnian Serb parliament session would be
held on November 19 to elect delegates to the Bosnian parliament's
house of peoples.

LUANDA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher will focus his talks with Angolan leaders on
peace and bilateral relations during his upcoming visit, the
U.S. Embassy announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Donald Steinberg told a press conference that
Christopher would concentrate on such issues as the formation
of an African crisis prevention force and African conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador praised the current relations between the two
countries, saying that Angola has become the third trading
partner of the United States in the sub-Sahara region, with the
trade volume between the two countries reaching three billion
U.S. Dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The second largest destination of the U.S. investment in the
region, Angola could expect expanded cooperation with the United
States in agriculture, communications, fishery and mining
industry, the U.S. ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Christopher will begin his day-long visit to the southern
African country next Monday. During the visit, ever to be paid
by a U.S. secretary of state since 1975, Christopher is
expected to meet Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador ruled out the possibility of a meeting
between Christopher and Angola's former rebel UNITA
movement leader, Jonas Savimbi.

foreign policy aiming "to ensure the most favorable conditions to
perform domestic tasks," according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before a party of Russian diplomats, Primakov said
these tasks include the preservation of the Russian territorial
integrity, the development of the democratic process, the creation
of favorable conditions for economic growth and integration of the

He stressed that Russian diplomats should solve all these tasks

difficulties including the lack of money.

In compliance with a presidential decree granting the Foreign
Ministry "coordinative functions," the body should become a

<P>
"The Russian Foreign Ministry is completely loyal to the
Russian president who has a priority in decision-making," Primakov
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, "foreign policy cannot be carried out by a
single person or a group of people, or a group of parties." "It

<P>
NEW DELHI, October 11 (Xinhua) -- India is planning to take to
the World Trade Organization (WTO) its dispute with the European
Union (EU) over the imposition of an anti-dumping duty on its
unbleached fabric, a government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The EU decision to levy the anti-dumping duty on such imports
is unfair and its allegation of causing injury to the domestic
industry is not justified, he said.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission has imposed an anti-dumping duty
between 15 and 20 percent on the import of unbleached fabric from
India, China, Indonesia, Turkey and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
A majority of the EU member countries opposed the imposition of
anti-dumping duty on the imports of unbleached fabric during the
meetings of the Anti-Dumping Advisory Committee of EU.
</P>
<P>
In its complaint, the European Industry Association accused
India of dumping four categories of products -- twine, cordage,
ropes and cables -- in the European markets at prices
substantially lower than the domestic prices.
</P>
<P>
The other Indian products that are facing the anti-dumping
proceedings by the European Commission are: bed linen, polyester
textured filament yarn and polyethylene, polypropylene, woven
sacks and bags.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Scandinavian Airlines
System (SAS) is planning to approach the Indian government for an
increase in its bilateral air services rights next year.
</P>
<P>
SAS Country Manager (India) Benegt Callinggard said that since
SAS came to India on September 5 last year, the market response
has been inspiring and the future prospects look good. The
airlines plans to go in for two additional flights, raising the
present frequency of three to five a week.
</P>
<P>
Although the present operations are restricted to the
Copenhagen-Delhi route, the possibility of covering Mumbai
(Bombay) is not ruled out.
</P>
<P>
There has been a boom in business traffic between India and
Scandinavian countries. This is evident from the current Indian
rush for visa to these countries. On an average, there are 50
applicants every day for visa to just one country -- Sweden, the
SAS country manager said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, SAS carried 33,000 passengers from India with an
average load factor of 80 percent. The Scandinavian Airlines'
market share would go up to 8 percent next year from five percent
at the moment, he further said.
</P>
<P>
The Scandinavian Airlines has had a code-sharing arrangement
with Air India and an inter-line arrangement with almost every
domestic airline. Callinggard hinted that the foreign airlines
might not be averse to the idea of "fare-sharing" with partner
airlines to boost mutual business prospects.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Appoints Envoy to WTO to Handle Car Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
appointed Ms. Halida Miljani as its representative for special
assignments with the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Geneva,
according to a Foreign Ministry statement published here today.
</P>
<P>
Among the first tasks to be handled by Ms. Miljani would be
matters arising from complaints filed to the WTO about Indonesia's
national car policy by Japan, the European Union (EU) and the
United States, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
With Ms. Miljani's appointment, Indonesia will have two
representatives with the world trade watchdog organization to take
care of its interests. The other envoy is Ms. Saodah Ba.
Syahrudin, whose assignment covers human rights, intellectual
property and workers' rights.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Miljani said in WTO-mandated consultations on its
disputed national car policy, Indonesia will strive to arrive at a
compromise settlement without having to make any compensation.
</P>
<P>
"Why should we provide compensations while what we did was
right. Our national car policy does not run counter to WTO rules,'
she said.
</P>
<P>
She said the Indonesian national car program had become an
international issue because WTO regulations were often being
interpreted differently by many member countries.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia had arguments of its own, based on domestic law, to
show that its national car policy was not against WTO rules, she
noted.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto ruled in February that producers of a
"national car" would be exempted from import duties and luxury
taxes, which add about 60 percent to the price of cars in
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Japan, the EU and the US, which hold more than 95 percent of
the Indonesian auto market, filed their complaints recently to
WTO, claiming the Indonesian auto program violates international
trade rules.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Won't Quit WTO: Trade Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will not resign its
World Trade Organization (WTO) membership and it wants a peaceful
solution to its car dispute with the world's three largest trading
powers, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
"We will not quit the WTO just because of our domestic policy
(on the national car development)," Minister of Industry and Trade
Tunky Ariwibowo said Thursday in Cimanggis, West Java, according
to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU), Japan and the United States have all
filed complaints with the WTO, protesting against Indonesia's
national car policy.
</P>
<P>
The complaints were filed after President Soeharto ruled in
February that producers of a "national car" would be exempted from
import duties and luxury taxes, which add about 60 percent to the
price of cars in the country.
</P>
<P>
A number of experts, including World Bank consultant Hartojo
Wignjowijono, suggested recently that Indonesia should abandon the
WTO if it wanted to proceed with its controversial national car
program.
</P>
<P>
Tunky explained that Indonesia, a signatory to the WTO
agreement, would continue to support the WTO to help facilitate
international fair trade.
</P>
<P>
"I realize that we are facing the world's three economic
giants. However, I am still optimistic that we will win. I also
hope this matter can be settled through bilateral consultations,"
Tunky said.

BANGKOK, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Securities and Exchange
Commission (sec) of Thailand Thursday approved the establishment
of the Thai Trust Fund (TTF), providing a facility for foreigners
to buy Thai stocks without ceiling.

<HEADLINE> Tories Won't Buy Election: Chancellor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOURNMOUTH, England, October 10 (Xinhua) -- British Chancellor
of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke said here today that his party
would not buy the next election by "unsustainable tax cuts" and
would only cut taxes when they could afford to.
</P>
<P>
The chancellor's remarks at the annual Tory party conference
were greeted with a long standing ovation from delegates.
</P>
<P>
Real incomes in Britain had never been higher; Unemployment had
fallen by nearly 900,000; Britain was enjoying the longest run of
low inflation, and now it was leading the European economy as
never before, Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
However, some decisions the government had to make were tough.
They did not always make the Tory government popular. But without
them the country would not have had the growing economy of today,
the chancellor added.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the need for a sustainable recovery which would
deliver low taxes, low inflation and low interest rates over a
long period.
</P>
<P>
Since last year's tax cut -- which led to a 3.2 billion pound
(4.8 billion U.S. dollars) net budget tax cut, the first in three
years -- Clarke's unpopularity with the Euro-sceptic wing of the
party has deepened to the point where a persistent campaign is
under way to undermine him or remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
The campaign against the chancellor includes repeated claims
that Prime Minister John Major offered his job to Michael
Heseltine at the height of the crisis over John Redwood's
leadership challenge last year.
</P>
<P>
Right-wing Tories see the chancellor as arrogant and
provocative in the fights over Europe. However, the claim that he
was close to leaving the Treasury was categorically denied at the
party conference.
</P>
<P>
What Clarke won from delegates today proved that he was
credited with a good performance.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Pledges to Protect Financial Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
stressed that the government will not open the country's financial
services too much to foreign investors, even though many of them
want to enter the country.
</P>
<P>
"The head of state said that if we open the sector too much, we
will lose because we are not strong enough (in the sector)," Bank
Bukopin President Muchtar Mandala said today.
</P>
<P>
Muchtar, who met President Soeharto Thursday, said many foreign
investors in financial services have expressed their interest in
expanding their business in Indonesia but could not do so because
of the limitations set by the government.
</P>
<P>
The government has so far licensed 10 foreign banks to operate
in the country -- four from Europe, two from the Netherlands and
one each from Germany and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Muchtar noted that the opening of foreign banks will be
allright. However, Indonesia has its own interest in protecting
its banking industry because the country, with some 240 banks, has
been considered to have too many banks.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Increase Investment in Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Germany will increase its
investment in Peru to develop its already strong economic
relationship with the South American country.
</P>
<P>
At a dinner given for visiting Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori, German President, Roman Herzog, today praised Peru for
its impressive economic achievements. Peru had attained a
convincing new start after the difficult 1980s, Herzog said.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl told Fujimori at a meeting that
German-Peruvian economic relations would further develop as
Germany increased its investment.
</P>
<P>
Kohl said Germany hoped Peru would continue its economic and
political reforms.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori said he welcomed German enterprises which invested in
his country.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori arrived in Bonn on October 8 and started his four-day
visit to Germany. It is the first official visit by a Peruvian
head of state to a European country in six years.
</P>
<P>
Peru is the major development and cooperation partner of
Germany in Latin America. Since 1950, Germany has provided it
with 2.7 billion marks in aid.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between Peru and Germany totaled 572.564
million U.S. dollars in 1995 and is estimated to increase by 30
percent in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Women's Rights Bill Unlikely to Be Tabled in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Despite a consensus among
major political parties and the government's earlier promise, a
bill on women's property rights is unlikely to be tabled before
the Nepali Parliament as its current session is concluding today.
</P>
<P>
A senior government official said earlier this week that the
government would present the important bill to the parliament
session and major parties in the parliament had reached consensus
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist
Leninist, CPN-UML) has already pledged its support for the bill
if it is presented to the parliament.
 The Ministry of Law and Justice sent the draft bill to the
cabinet for approval only on Thursday and there would be no time
left for parliamentary discussion even if it could be tabled
today at the last minute, a local newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
But officials of the parliament secretariat said they stopped
accepting any bill three days ago due to lack of time.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali Supreme Court in September last year ordered the
government to present the bill on women's equal rights to parental
property within one year.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing property laws in Nepal, women could get  a
share of the parental property only if they remain unmarried till
the age of 35.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a group of women's rights activists Thursday
submitted a memorandum to Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba in
protest of the government's failure to fulfill its promise.

<HEADLINE> WFP Halts Distributing Food in Western Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) has
stopped distributing dry food rations to tens of thousands of
people in strife-torn western Liberia because of fear of attacks
on civilians by faction fighters.
</P>
<P>
The WFP, the United Nation's food aid agency, said today in a
statement that only cooked food which could be eaten on the spot
was now being handed out in the Cape Mount County and the town of
Tubmanburg, cutting the number of recipients to only about 2,500
people.
</P>
<P>
Distribution of uncooked food, or so-called "dry food rations",
 would resume as the situation for the civilians improves and
recipients could carry rations away without being robbed, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The fighters harass the civilians, stealing food and any
other commodities they have," the Rome-based agency's Country
Director in Liberia, Arnt Breivik, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Although we are very concerned about the malnutrition levels
in these parts of Liberia, we cannot put these people at risk,"
Breivik said. "Even the people themselves have asked us to stop
giving them food because they are afraid."
</P>
<P>
The WFP and its partners are distributing cooked food -- only
during daylight hours -- to 600 of the most malnourished people in
the Cape Mount County towns of Medina and Vonzula.
</P>
<P>
In Tubmanburg, WFP food is being distributed already cooked to
only about 2,000 of the most severe cases, mostly women and
children.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the WFP had distributed two-week rations last month
to almost 40,000 hungry people in the Cape Mount County and
Tubmanburg. However, recipients became targets of faction
fighters.
</P>
<P>
On September 28, fighters attacked the town of Sinje in the
Cape Mount County, killing some 21 civilians, mostly women and
children.
</P>
<P>
Tubmanburg, a stronghold of warlord Roosevelt Johnson's Krahn
tribe, is at the heart of the most volatile region in Liberia,
which has been devastated by civil war since December 1989. More
than 150,000 people have died in the conflict.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Stock Exchange to Reintroduce Circuit Breaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dhaka, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE),
which has been a wild bull over the last two weeks, will
reintroduce the circuit breaker tomorrow to avert any major rise
or fall in securities prices amid fears of a possible crash.
</P>
<P>
The decision to apply a 10-percent circuit breaker came from an
emergency meeting of the DSE Council held Thursday following an
order issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the
country's market watchdog.
</P>
<P>
"No bid for any securities in a day shall be allowed in the
exchange in excess of plus/minus 10 percent compared to the
previous day's rate," said a DSE notification issued after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The break followed a wild bull market that witnessed galloping
prices of securities of many companies and mushroom growth of
operators in the curb market -- trading that takes place outside
the official market, even on the street.
</P>
<P>
In little more than a three-month period, the benchmark DSE all
share price index has jumped to 2000 points from 1000 points in
July since the DSE authorities withdrew the circuit breaker system
following sharp criticism.
</P>
<P>
The market operators expressed their deep concern over the
continued bullish run caused mainly by a mad buying spree and
soaring prices of stocks, driving the prices of most of the scrips
above all past records.
</P>
<P>
The SEC has already started making investors careful about the
unreasonable price hike of some shares and warned them not to go
for trading outside the official market.
</P>
<P>
After the SEC warning, the all share price index shed to stand
at 2024.43 points Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Thailand New Promotional Privilege Projects Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Both the number and value of
projects receiving promotional privileges from the Thai government
were down in the first eight months of this year, compared to the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The government's Board of Investment (BOI) in the period
approved 634 projects for promotional privileges, down 13 percent,
with a total value of 291.7 billion baht (11.67 billion U.S.
dollars), down 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
Approvals were up for businesses in the automobile parts,
electronics and petrochemical sectors, while there was a sharp
drop in approvals in industries such as footwear, toys and
jewelry, according to BOI Secretary-General Staporn Kavitanon.
</P>
<P>
During the period, the electrical and electronics sectors
enjoyed the highest exports, while exports of footwear, toys and
jewelry dropped steadily throughout the period.
</P>
<P>
The metals and machine-building industry recorded the strongest
growth in the eight months, mainly due to the production of
automobile parts and engines.
</P>
<P>
In the eight months, Japan was the largest foreign investor in
the country, with 171 projects worth 10.48 billion baht (419.2
million dollars), as the Japanese relocated many of their
automobile-related businesses to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Europeans were the second largest investors, with 76 projects
worth 1.99 billion baht (79.6 million dollars) in combined
registered capital.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan, with 39 new projects worth 9.55 billion baht (382
million dollars) in registered capital ranked third, while the
United States ranked fourth with 33 new projects worth 10.62
billion baht (424.8 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Russian FM on Signing Agreement With NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said here today that signing an agreement with NATO was
not the final aim, stressing that such an agreement should provide
Russia with a guarantee to its security.
</P>
<P>
Primakov made the remarks in an interview with young Russian
diplomats, according to Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Russia still strongly opposes NATO's eastward
expansion, but the possibility of realizing such expansion cannot
be ruled out. Therefore, the negative factors stemmed from the
expansion should be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
He said that the future Russian-NATO agreement should take into
consideration the revision of the treaty on reducing conventional
armed forces in Europe. He pointed out that those issues involving
Russia directly should be discussed with the participation of
Russia. Any decision on those issues should be made on the basis
of unanimity through consultation.
</P>
<P>
He voiced rejection to working out an agreement within one
month, saying that acting with undue haste will certainly make the
agreement look like a declaration.
</P>
<P>
Primakov revealed that Russia had held or was holding secret
talks or dialogue with the United States, France, Germany and
Britain on the issue of NATO's eastward expansion. He said that
France shared many identical views with his country, while
Germany's viewpoints on a series of issues were very similar to
those of Russia.

<P>
BANGKOk, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Malev Hungarian Airlines is
seeking a special prorate agreement with the Thai Airways
International (Thai) in a bid to increase traffic on its
Asia-Pacific routes, a report said here today.
</P>
<P>
By concluding the agreement, Malev expects to link the two
carriers' reservation networks and flight schedules based on
shared profits and costs on specific routes and increase its
European traffic on the Budapest-Bangkok route by 20-30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Using Thailand as its hub in Southeast Asia, Malev also hopes
to expand its service throughout the region by piggybacking with
Thai's existing operations.
</P>
<P>
An alliance with Thai would allow Malev passengers to enjoy
more convenient flight connections between European and Asian
destinations.
</P>
<P>
Malev, which launched first flight to Bangkok on October 4,
flies between Budapest and Bangkok twice a week and it plans to
double the flights.
</P>
<P>
Malev officials said there exist bright prospectd for routes
between Asia and eastern Europe because the two areas are new
tourism destinations for each other.

under the Commerce Ministry, Thailand's imports of rough rubies
from Africa, which recorded a 30-percent drop during 1995, soared
by 371.4 percent in value in the first six months of this year
over a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The import value of rough sapphires from Africa also
skyrocketed 297.5 percent during the period, while it fell by 26.6
percent during 1995 against 1994.
</P>
<P>
Significant growth was also seen in imports of miscellaneous
gemstones, posting a 171.5-percent rise in value in the first half
of this year.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the imports strongly backed the Thai gem-cutting
industry at a time when supplies of rough gems from traditional
sources have been under pressure.
</P>
<P>
African countries, especially Tanzania, Kenya and Nigeria, have
emerged as Thailand's new suppliers of semi-precious colored
gemstones.

<HEADLINE> Uruguayan Students on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Uruguayan high school and
Labor University students held a strike today, protesting against
the education reform carried out by the Central Directive Council
of Public Education (Codicen).
</P>
<P>
The demonstration, including a march this afternoon in the
center of the capital city, aim to also seek the lifting of
sanctions imposed by Codicen on students who occupied a school
campus on October 1.
</P>
<P>
No students and teachers have classes today in the university
and technical schools because of a 24-hour stoppage called by
unions to support the students' movement.
</P>
<P>
Codicen had hoped to restart the dialogue with students last
night, which was suspended because of the October 1 occupation.
</P>
<P>
The students occupied several campuses in the capital and other
cities on August 15 and September 6 to protest against the Codicen
educational reform. They withdrew from the campuses peacefully
and started talking with Codicen about the reform.
</P>
<P>
But, the dialogue was suspended when 36 students occupied the
"Bauza" campus on October 1, protesting against the Codicen's
refusal to stop the reform.
</P>
<P>
Those students were dislodged by police after a two-hour
occupation and punished by being suspended 150 days from school.

<HEADLINE> Bonded Zone in Tianjin Port Attracts More Overseas Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Tianjin Harbor Bonded Zone,
established just five years ago, has more than 3,000 enterprises
backed by business people from 67 countries and regions, and 25
Chinese provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of investment in the zone is 2.8 billion US
dollars, 1.73 billion of which came from overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the country's reforms and opening-up and preferential
policies, the zone in north China's Tianjin City has been rather
attractive to investors, a number of whom are renowned
multinationals.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of this year, more than 360 projects
were launched in the zone, 286 of which were funded by overseas
investors. Total contracted investment was 370 million US dollars,
up by 49 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The zone will use overseas investment to build four deepwater
berths in the Tianjin Harbor to handle more foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say that in five years its management will be
geared entirely to international trade, meaning that the current
preferential policies will be removed.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, many overseas business people have sped up the
establishing of enterprises for the coming five years.

<HEADLINE> Specialists Needed to Curb IPR Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The fostering of a large
number of specialists in intellectual property rights (IPR) is
badly needed to curb IPR violations and improve IPR law
enforcement in China, a senior court official said.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily quoted Luo Haocai, Vice-President of the
Supreme People's Court, as saying Thursday that more and more
Chinese courts at various levels require judges and other judicial
officers equipped with good IPR knowledge.
</P>
<P>
He said that the number of IPR disputes has increased by an
average of 30 percent annually in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The official added that quite a number of big foreign companies
such as General Electric and P&AMP;G have begun to recruit Chinese
graduates from IPR knowledge courses.
</P>
<P>
Luo, also a law professor at Beijing University spoke at a
ceremony in Beijing University, where five students of Beijing
University's IPR Institute were awarded IPR scholarships of 5,000
yuan (600 U.S. dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
The IPR Scholarship Program has been set up by the DuPont
Company, one of the world's largest industrial enterprise.
</P>
<P>
The IPR Institute of Beijing University and the IPR Institute
of Shanghai University are the only two colleges of its kind
in China dedicated to the study of patent protection and IPR.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Investigates Military Links With Drug Dealers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The General
Prosecutorate of Colombia said today that an investigation is
under way to establish links of at least 20 members of the
Colombian Air Force (FAC) with drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The FAC personnel who are being investigated include officers,
non-commissioned officers and technicians.
</P>
<P>
General Prosecutor Alfonso Valdivieso said that a document
mentioned the names of several FAC members including Jaime Bueno,
the pilot of the presidential plane, in which 3.72 kilograms of
heroin were found three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The document was sent by an anonymous person to the Criminal
Activities Information Center of the General Prosecutorate of the
country.
</P>
<P>
However, it was too soon to say it was a cartel as some people
had been saying, said Valdivieso.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the anonymous document was also sent to the
FAC department of investigation and control and to Defense
Minister Juan Carlos Esguerra for investigation.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the General Prosecutorate said that Jaime Bueno
was a millionaire with real estate in several parts of the
country, and had not been able to explain this in light of his
work in the Air Force.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Company to Stay in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian company has decided
to maintain its investments in Cuba despite pressures created by
the Helms-Burton Law of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Shareholders of the Canadian "Sherrit" company, including the
British, are united against the legislation because the United
States has no right to dictate standards of trade to other
countries, Sherrit President Ian Delaney said today, in Matanzas
province.
</P>
<P>
The United States promulgated the Helms-Burton Law in an
attempt to drive away foreign investments from Cuba by applying
penalties to enterprises and entrepreneurs of third countries
which invest in the island nation.
</P>
<P>
Delaney said Cuba offered all the necessary conditions for
business and his firm had important investments in several sectors
of the Cuban economy such as oil, agriculture and mining.
</P>
<P>
The firm was negotiating a joint project with the Cuban
authorities for the exploitation of 200 hectares of land in the
Maximo Gomez municipality, whose production would supply the needs
of the Varadero tourist center.

<HEADLINE> Thai Stock Exchange Index Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 11 (Xinhua) -- For the first time in several
days, the selloff at the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) was led
by local investors on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The SET index lost another 16.44 points (1.73 percent), closing
at 933 on a total trading turnover of 5,267.25 million baht
(210.69 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Local investors were reacting to rumors that property developer
Somprasong Land Development plc was headed for bankruptcy amid
cash flow problems. They were selling to protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
Reports say Somprasong would not be able to bring in partners
from Hong Kong and Singapore as planned and it was assumed that
the company would have to sell land to generate cash.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Somprasong has already sold two apartment projects
along with the Somprasong Plaza in Pattaya and several plots of
land to raise cash, with some projects having been delayed and
complaints being lodged by home buyers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, brokerage houses attribute the significant selloff
by foreigners in the past week to their lack of confidence in
local political developments, economic problems and poor
third-quarter performances by many listed companies.
</P>
<P>
So far this month, foreign investors' net sales at the SET
amounted to some 8 billion baht (320 million U.S. dollars). But
the amount was not considered large as 700 billion-800 billion
baht (28 billion-32 billion dollars) of foreign money is still in
the bourse, according to Securities and Exchange Commission
Secretary-General Pakorn Malakul Na Ayutthaya.

<HEADLINE> Gulf War Chemical Victims Number Still Unknown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Defense Department
said today that it will never be able to give an exact number of
soldiers who might have been exposed to chemical agents during the
Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Also it will never be able to have a precise picture of how
chemical warfare agents may have been dispersed over U.S. troops
at an Iraqi weapons depot that was destroyed by U.S. troops in
March 1991, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon told a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said officials just expect to get "a range" of the number
of people who might have been affected during an operation in
which U.S. forces destroyed the Iraqi depot.
</P>
<P>
He said the Pentagon could not know the number of weapons that
have been exploded, their pattern of dispersal and the wind and
weather patterns at the time.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon estimated recently that the number could be more than
15,000. In June, the Pentagon said about 300 to 400 Army
engineers may have been exposed.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department has come under criticism in the last few
weeks as it has struggled to sort out whether the demolition job
at the Iraqi weapons depot released toxic gases over
U.S. soldiers, and how many have been affected.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon announced that it has determined the units which
were in the area during the first of two explosions at the weapons
depot.

<HEADLINE> Sex Discrimination May Keep Afghanistan Hungry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) has
announced that it could reconsider its food aid to Afghanistan in
view of Taliban's sex discriminatory policies and the
deteriorating situation in the embattled country.
</P>
<P>
Catherine Bertini, the executive director of the WFP,
said: "The decision by the Taliban movement to ban women from
working outside the home as well as to ban education for girls
poses serious consequences for the WFP's activities in
Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that among United Nations agencies operating in
Afghanistan, the WFP had the highest number of female workers and
more than half of the WFP's food and rehabilitation projects were
aimed at women.
</P>
<P>
"Because the task of assessing and targeting beneficiaries is
carried out by women workers, the added needs, let alone the
current needs, can't be met as a result of the recent ban on
women," Bertini said.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Rome-based agency said a bakery in Kabul
run by war widows had been closed, leaving 15,000 beneficiaries
without bread. Also, vocational programs that trained women in
carpet weaving and tailoring had been forced to shut down.
</P>
<P>
Bertini's comments echoed a statement by U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Monday, warning that discrimination could
seriously affect relief programs in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The WFP, the largest relief agency in Afghanistan, currently
feeds more than 1.8 million people throughout the land-locked
country.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, as much as 57 percent of the total international
assistance to the country was channeled through the agency.
</P>
<P>
Since the Afghan capital of Kabul was seized on September 27,
the Taliban militia, born in religious schools in Pakistan, had
announced its aim of setting up a purist Islamic country, and has
forced women to stop working outside the home and closed girls'
schools.

<HEADLINE> China's Universities Reform Management Systems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's major colleges and
universities are pioneering new management systems to help develop
students' talents, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, these colleges and universities have
succeeded in stimulating students' enthusiasm with the new
systems, said a spokeswoman for the Beijing Municipal Education
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Various universities select five percent of their students each
year and provide exclusive training with special teachers and
teaching programs. These students may finish their courses and
graduate one year earlier, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing Science and Engineering University, six students
have entered postgraduate institutions over the past two years,
one year ahead of other students.
</P>
<P>
Some colleges allow qualified students engaged in secondary
professional training programs to study for a bachelor's degree.
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, more than 30 colleges and universities have
followed this practice in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Some students, who were not recruited for a bachelor's degree
program, were usually enrolled for secondary professional training
certificates. But now they have the opportunity to further their
studies and earn a bachelor's degree.
</P>
<P>
Some universities also allow students to select a second
speciality when they enter the third year of college. And they can
get a university-issued certificate after they complete the study
of their second speciality.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 students at Beijing University Study for a second
speciality each year.
</P>
<P>
This practice has been warmly welcomed by college students who
said that this will increase their knowledge and qualify them for
more employment opportunities after graduation.
</P>
<P>
Some universities also allow students to change their
specialities, while previously they had to hold to their
speciality in order to get a bachelor's degree.
</P>
<P>
The above new methods have also been introduced in major
colleges and universities across the country, according to an
official with the College Students Affairs Department under the
State Education Commission.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The output of agricultural
products in Venezuela will register an overall drop this year due
to the increase of imported food staples, said an official of the
National Agriculturists Federation.
</P>
<P>
The import of foreign farm produce complied with the country's
economic policy, but the products entered without paying customs
taxes and their producers were protected and subsidized by their
own countries, said Hiram Gaviria, president of the federation.
</P>
<P>
The imports had caused losses to the agricultural sector of
Venezuela, Gaviria added.
</P>
<P>
The harvests of yellow maize, sorghum and tobacco will drop
respectively by 24 percent, 40 percent and 10 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The elimination of a 14-percent subsidy on the rates of
interest on credits to agriculture was a threat for local
agricultural producers of Venezuela, Gaviria warned.

HAVANA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban and Polish health
ministers, Carlos Dotres and Ryszard Jacek Zochowsky, signed a
collaboration agreement today to reactivate medical cooperation
between the two countries.

The accord includes personnel exchanges in cardiology,

The agreement foresaw cooperation in the pharmaceutical

medicine Policosdanol of natural origin, which has proven
effective in the reduction of cholesterol, added Zochowsky.

<P>
Poland was interested in this Cuban product because of
cardiovascular diseases, the first cause of death in the European
country, Zochowsky said.

HELSINKI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Greek President
Constantine Stephanopoulos and his Finnish counterpart Martti
Ahtisaari have agreed to further develop the foreign policies of
the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Stephanopoulos, who ended his three-day visit to Finland today,
held talks with Ahtisaari on other EU issues and the situation in
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents expected the EU to reach consensus in making
its foreign policy decisions and speak with one voice in the
international society.
</P>
<P>
They said that it was important to EU's future to settle the
issue of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Stephanopoulos hoped that Cyprus and Malta could join the EU in
the next group of the list.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari stressed the importance of Russia's role in keeping
stability in Europe, saying that in a changing European security
and political situation, Russia and NATO should establish a
relationship on the basis of cooperation and mutual trust.

<HEADLINE> Net Foreign Investments Up in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Net foreign investment flows
into the Philippines surged by 178 percent to 1.6 billion U.S.
dollars in the first half of this year, compared to the 577
million dollars a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Central Bank announced Thursday that during the
period, direct and portfolio investments in the country reached
5.4 billion dollars while outflows amounted to 3.8 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank said, the phenomenon that most investments
were portfolio investments continued to haunt the country's
economy. In the first half of the year, portfolio investments
accounted for 68 percent of the total and only 32 percent were
direct investments.
</P>
<P>
Portfolio investments are also called "hot" or speculative
money invested mainly by fund managers in the local stock markets.
Unlike direct investments which stay invested for longer periods,
portfolio investments are always the first to be withdrawn from
the economy at the first sign of trouble or hint of more lucrative
returns elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Developing Countries Urge Fair Investment Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of developing
countries at an international investment forum here have voiced
their concerns about concluding a multilateral investment
agreement, fearing that such an accord could undermine their
economic interests.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Global Investment Forum organized by the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) today, senior
officials from the developing world said that a multilateral
agreement on investments being proposed by developed countries was
unbalanced.
</P>
<P>
It overemphasized the interests of the investors mainly based
in developed countries while overlooking that of the developing
world.
</P>
<P>
They feared that the removal of all or most conditions required
of developing countries on foreign investment, as suggested in
such an accord, meant they would have to give up their right to
adopt a selective approach to foreign investment, which would not
be in their interests in promoting their chosen development
strategy.
</P>
<P>
They said that by participating in the multilateral investment
accord, they would be subjecting themselves to potentially
aggressive competition from powerful overseas investors whose
business practices might distort the local market structure.
</P>
<P>
A fair and just multilateral investment accord, if formulated
in the future, should be based on a balance between the rights and
obligations of both the investors and the host countries, said
Long Yongtu, minister assistant of the Chinese Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the development objectives of developing countries
should be put in first place and special treatment should be given
them according to their different stages of development, he said.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the UNCTAD forum is to help governments get a
better understanding of policies related to foreign direct
investment and development in a globalizing economy, and to help
them to determine their position in this area.
</P>
<P>
It is also expected to help governments to prepare for the
forthcoming ministerial conference of the World Trade Organization
to be held in Singapore in December this year.

<HEADLINE> NZ Parties All Optimistic Over Election Result </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Political parties in New
Zealand have wound up their election campaign, all confident that
they will perform well in the election on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
National Party leader Jim Bolger said yesterday in Paeroa,
some 600 kilometers north of Wellington, said his party will score
close to 40 percent of the votes, and its major rival the Labour
Party will get about 10 percent less votes than the 34.7 percent
it received in the last election in 1993.
</P>
<P>
However, opinion polls show a continued decline of support for
National in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Bolger also claimed that his campaign message that New Zealand
is a better place to live in than before National came to power in
1990 has got through.
</P>
<P>
Labour leader Helen Clark yesterday warned Labour supporters
against complacency although polls indicate that a National lead
over Labour has narrowed in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
"The race is close. We must fight it right to Friday midnight,"
she urged.
</P>
<P>
Closing his campaign last night, Alliance leader Jim Anderton
expressed his confidence that his party will take at least 24
seats in the 120-member parliament.
</P>
<P>
The figure, translated into votes, means that Alliance will
receive 20 percent of the total votes, against the poll results
that it has a support rate of 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, New Zealand First leader Winston Peters was
less specific, saying only that his party would win more
electorate seats in the election. At present, New Zealand First
has two members in the parliament.

<HEADLINE> Greek PM Issues Policy Statement in Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Greece's equitable participation
in European unification, the defense of its sovereign rights,
social and institutional modernization, and a leading role in the
Balkans are the basic orientations of the government's policy in
the next four years, the country's Prime Minister Costas Simitis
said in his policy statement in parliament tonight.
</P>
<P>
"Our successful response to convergence is not a need that
arises from external compulsion, it is a national strategy, which
renders Greece competitive in the international division of
labour, which secures the development of the economy, which crates
the healthy prerequisites for the exercise of effective social
policy", the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the economy, the premier described the fiscal
problem as a national issue, and as especially crucial for 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Fiscal adjustment will not be based on exerting pressure on
workers' incomes. Our incomes policy guarantees incomes which will
be above the inflation rate and maintain the balance between
stabilization and social cohesion.
</P>
<P>
"The fairer distribution of national income and wealth is a
steady pursuit of our policy", he said.
</P>
<P>
Simitis pledged a determined intervention in crucial aspects of
public finance.
</P>
<P>
First, he said, is a clampdown on waste and utilization of
state property. State expenses must correspond to the real needs
of society, the functioning of the state must restrict itself to
contemporary needs, he added.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, he continued, is the intervention in the field of tax
exemption, grants, and subsidies.
</P>
<P>
"We shall not accept the perpetuation of privileges and
favoritiest treatment which increase social inequality and have no
place in a modern and fair taxation system", Simitis said.
</P>
<P>
Fair distribution of the cost among all social classes is cited
by the premier as the third important target of the government.
</P>
<P>
"The fight against tax-evasion and the informal economy will be
intensified. Social justice demands this", the premier stressed.
</P>
<P>
The parliament, which emerged from the last month's general
elections, will hold debate on the policy statement Friday and
Saturday, with a vote of confidence on Saturday evening.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
said on Thursday that a Swedish diplomat will visit an American
detained on spy charges by the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
"We hope and trust that the American citizen is in good health,
is being given the proper care and treatment that he deserves
under international law and regulations, and we hope that the
North Korean government will elect to release him immediately,"
said State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns.
</P>
<P>
The visit is scheduled for Friday, Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Sweden handles U.S. business in DPRK in the absence of formal
U.S.-DPRK diplomatic relationship. A diplomat of the Swedish
embassy in Pyongyang will visit a hotel, about four hours travel
time from the capital, where Hunziker is being detained.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK Central News Agency said on Sunday that Hunziker was
arrested on August 24 when illegally entering the country on
espionage mission for South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Burns said among the questions that need to be answered are
whether Hunziker is being well-treated and whether he is aware of
the espionage and illegal entry charges against him.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Europe's major stock markets all
closed sharply down Thursday, depressed by new fears of higher
U.S. interest rates and an opening fall on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
British shares had slipped as low as 3,981.2 points and had
stayed below the 4,000 level during afternoon trade despite a mild
bounce on Wall Street before regaining some of the early losses
and finishing 14.6 points lower at 3,994.4 on the FTSE 100 index.
</P>
<P>
One dealer said that there was a desperate struggle to get back
over 4,000 but momentum just faded, and investors hoping for a
further cut in base rates were rattled by official figures
released today of firmer rate of British underlying inflation.
</P>
<P>
German share prices in Frankfurt also finished sharply lower in
response to pressure from weaker government bonds and overnight
losses on Wall Street, with the DAX-30 share index down 22.24
points at 2,680.75.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Investors were cautious ahead of U.S. producer
prices data on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse, following London and Frankfurt's suit, ended
the day lower after Wall street's early fall in response to a
surprise decline in U.S. unemployment totals. The CAC-40 index was
11.08 points down at 2,135.63 at the close.
</P>
<P>
London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading
British shares closed 14.6 points down at 3,994.7. The Frankfurt
DAX-30 share index ended 22.24 points lower at 2,680.75. The Paris

<HEADLINE> Lilic: Lifting of Sanctions Creates Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic
said Thursday the recent lifting of the sanctions had created the
basic conditions in Yugoslavia for realizing its most important
task -- economic revival and development.
</P>
<P>
While visiting some big enterprises in Belgrade, Lilic said
that "the lifting of the sanctions has also created conditions for
Yugoslavia's full reintegration in the international community and
the normalization of relations with international financial
institutions and other organizations."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council voted early this month to
permanently lift the sanctions against Yugoslavia and Bosnian Serb
republic to reward Belgrade for its endorsement of the Dayton
agreement. The overall trade and transport embargo was imposed in
late May, 1992 and suspended in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
Lilic noted the Yugoslav people "have every reason to be
satisfied with and proud of the policy conducted over the past
five years which has preserved peace in the region, ensured
freedom of our citizens, created conditions for the country's
economic revival and, above all, resulted in the creation of
Republika Srpska," the Serb entity in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The president also said that huge efforts were being made for
the normalization of relations with the former Yugoslav republics.
</P>
<P>
Among the four republics which gained independence from the
former Yugoslavia -- Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia and Slovenia, the
rump Yugoslavia has established diplomatic relations with the
former three over the past six months.
</P>
<P>
"I think we should not have any illusions that we will live in
a community similar to the one we lived in," he said, adding the
members of the former Yugoslavia needed to cooperate, particularly
in the economic domains.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned that in the past two months 18 laws and
regulations had been passed that have created a favorable
environment for domestic producers and also for foreign investors
and partners.
</P>
<P>
Further changes in legal regulations in order to create better
market conditions will take place in the future, he added.

for keeping the international trade open and free for all nations.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Amnuay Viravan,

he went on to say that all states should be treated with
fairness and be given the same opportunities in the international

However, he observed "what we see now is a disturbing tendency

rights and labour standards, as a leverage in the trade
negotiations."

<HEADLINE> Russia, Italy Plan for Expansion of Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Italy are planning
for further expansion of bilateral economic relations now, while
the two nations' trade is going up, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
During their talks held here today, Russian Economics Minister
Yevgeny Yasin and Italian Foreign Trade Minister Augusto Fantozi
discussed prospects for the development of economic ties and
investment cooperation between Italy and Russia, Itar-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
For the first six months of this year, the trade turnover
between the two countries increased approximately by 6 percent and
amounted to 2,568 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 700 joint ventures with the participation of
Italian firms have been registered in Russia.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also discussed during their talks Russia's
debt to Italy. The debt amounts to about 14 billion dollars, of
which 8 billion was government debt.
</P>
<P>
Fantozi arrived here on Wednesday and plans to take part in
the second meeting of the working group within the framework of
the Russian-Italian Council for economic, industrial and monetary
and financial cooperation, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
This council was set up in April 1996 to determine main
directions of bilateral cooperation and work out corresponding
recommendations. Two working groups function within the council,
on problems of economic and industrial cooperation, and on
financial issues.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls for Speedy Peace in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council is calling for a speedy process of peace in Angola, which
is considered to have the last hot spot issue to be resolved in
southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
During a special meeting of the council on Thursday,
representatives from more than 30 countries made speeches to give
their support for peace and stability in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Chinese ambassador Qin Huasun to the United Nations called on
both parties in the Angola conflict and UNITA leadership, in
particular, to earnestly honor their obligations under the reached
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Prolonged civil wars have left the economy of Angola in a deep
crisis. Skyrocketing inflation, high unemployment rate, along with
inadequate supply of water and electricity made life extremely
tough in the country.
</P>
<P>
The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
delayed in participating in the formation of a government of
national unity and unified armed forces. The Chinese ambassador
and representatives from many other countries expressed their
concern for the delay. Qin said that "We are concerned especially
at the rejection by UNITA's Third Extraordinary Congress of the
vice-presidency offered to Dr. Savinbi in the government of
national unity."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation would like to reiterate that the
implementation of the Lusaka Protocol and relevant agreements
reached by the two parties brooks no further delay, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely hope that the two parties and the UNITA
leadership will demonstrate their political will and good faith in
scrupulously honoring their obligations under the agreements," he
said, adding that only then will the peace process in Angola enjoy
the continued support of the international community.
</P>
<P>
Many other representatives also expressed their support for an
international effort for helping restore a long-term peace and
stability in Angola.

<HEADLINE> Tory Government Is to Take Action on Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bournemouth, England, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Tory
Government's plans to restrict strikes in key public services
which unveiled at its party conference yesterday, have been
greeted with hostility from trade unions.
</P>
<P>
Recent opinion polls show that the public opposes further
anti-union legislation and has supported the strikers' case in the
public-sector disputes.
</P>
<P>
In a move aimed at inflaming Union-Labor Party tensions, the
president of Trade Committee, Ian Lang told delegates that a new
concept in industrial relations of "proportionality" was at the
heart of the plans.
</P>
<P>
He said: "If a strike's effects are disproportionately damaging
to the public, then the trade union which organizes the strike
will risk losing its immunity and being sued for damages."
</P>
<P>
Lang said this summer's wave of strikes in the Royal Mail,
British Rail and London Underground had convinced him of the need
to take legislation on unions "one step further".
</P>
<P>
The President said that if unions tried to "make the public
pay, they will find they have to pay the public."
</P>
<P>
Scrapping power for industrial action in what Lang called the
"monopoly public services" would allow businesses and customers to
make potentially destructive claims for damages against unions.
</P>
<P>
Unions believe the plans are principally aimed at embarrassing
the Labor Party, which Lang described as the unions' "silent
co-conspirators".
</P>
<P>
However, Union leaders were less restrained, John Monks, Trade
Union Congress (TUC) general secretary, said the plan was a
"blatant pre-election gimmick" which was "impractical and totally
unworkable".
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Knapp, the Rail Maritime and Transport union leader, said
the Tories were now "only a short step from banning trade unions
altogether".
</P>
<P>
More embarrassingly for the Government, Ruth Lea, head of policy
at the Institute of Director, also said there were serious
difficulties over defining a monopoly public service.
</P>
<P>
Industrial relations experts believe that legislation is
unlikely before the general election, not least because of the
huge technical difficulties.

<HEADLINE> Perry to Visit Moscow to Urge Start-2 Passage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Perry will pay a three-day visit to Russia, starting from
next Wednesday, to press the Russian Parliament to approve the
Start-2 strategic arms reduction treaty, the Pentagon said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He will meet with his Russian counterpart Igor Rodionov and
speak to Russia's State Duma, the lower house of Parliament, to
urge Russian legislators to pass the Start-2 treaty, signed in
1993, as a way of reduction of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Start-2 requires the United States and Russia to slash their
nuclear arsenals to between 3,000 and 3,500 long-range warheads
each by the year 2003, a reduction of some two-thirds from Cold
War levels.
</P>
<P>
There were objections among Russian legislators for the passage
of the treaty when the U.S. senate approved the Start-2 by an 87-4
vote last January 26.
</P>
<P>
Perry met with Rodionov last month at a NATO meeting of defense
ministers in Bergen, Norway, during which Rodionov promised to
continue improving Russian military ties with the West. But Russia
is opposed to NATO enlargement into Eastern Europe.

<HEADLINE> Brady Asks Supreme Court to Support Gun Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Jim Brady and supporters of
the gun control law -- the Brady Act -- gathered outside the
Supreme Court Thursday to urge the justices not to "mess with
success."
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court is to hear argument later this term on the
constitutionality of the Brady Act, which requires an instant
background check for handgun purchases, or a five-day waiting
period in those 33 states that do not have that capability.
</P>
<P>
The law is named after Brady, who was former President Ronald
Reagan's press secretary when would-be assassin John Hinckley Jr.
began firing shots into a group of officials.
</P>
<P>
Reagan eventually recovered from his wound, but Brady, who was
shot in the head, was severely disabled and confined to a
wheelchair. He later become a champion of handgun control, along
with his wife Sarah.
</P>
<P>
In front of the Supreme Court Thursday, Brady accused the
National Rifle Association and "its war against the Brady law."
</P>
<P>
"The gun lobby seeks to snatch the American people's victory
away in the Supreme Court," Brady said. "The Brady law is
working...I hope, and trust, that the high court will not mess
with success."
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration says the act has been an unqualified
success _ more than 60,000 handgun sales to felons, fugitives and
others were blocked as of last February in its first two years in
effect.
</P>
<P>
The NRA has countered by saying despite the blocked sales,
there have been only seven prosecutions under the Brady Act.
</P>
<P>
"The Brady Act is neither effective nor constitutional," NRA
spokesman Tom Wyld said after the event on the Supreme Court
plaza.
</P>
<P>
The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act was passed by the
Democratic-controlled Congress in 1993 and signed into law by
President Clinton. The law went into effect in February 1994.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Attracts 4.5B Dollars of Foreign Direct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia badly needs
export-oriented and competitive imvestment to balance the small
amount of foreign direct investment (FDI) -- only 4.5 billion US
dollars -- it attracted in 1995, Investment Minister Sanyoto
Sastrowardoyo said.
</P>
<P>
Even though last year Indonesia was better than Thailand which
attracted only 2.3 billion dollars in FDI, it was outclassed by
China which was able to attract 37.5 billion dollars in FDI, he
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
East, South and Southeast Asian countries were able to absorb
only about 65 billion US dollars of the 315 billion FDI worldwide
last year, said Sastrowardoyo who is also chairman of the
Investment Coordinating Board.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, the government was encouraging investment
in export-oriented activities to turn out products selling in the
world market and capable of increasing Indonesia's competitive
edge on a global scale.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was intent on creating the most
favorable investment climate possible or investment conditions at
least comparable to those in other countries by issuing continuous
deregulation packages. One such condition was the recently
introduced tax incentives.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Trade Minister Calls on Visiting Swiss President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- China hopes to have more
exchanges and cooperation with the small and medium-sized
businesses in Switzerland, in order to raise bilateral trade and
economic cooperation between the two countries to a new high,
Chinese trade minister said today.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Swiss trade ties have developed smoothly in recent years,
according to Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation Wu Yi, who met here today with Jean-Pascal Delamuraz,
President of the Swiss Confederation.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the total trade volume reached a record high of
1.351 billion US dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
China has approved more than 260 joint venture projects with
investment from Swiss companies, Wu said, adding that their
promised investment neared one billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, more help and support is needed from both
governments to strengthen the cooperation between the small and
medium-sized businesses of the two countries, she said.
</P>
<P>
China's market has great potential and faces fierce
competition, while Switzerland has many powerful transnational
corporations and a large number of small and medium-sized
companies with unique and professional technology. Therefore, the
prospects for further development of bilateral trade and economic
cooperation are promising.
</P>
<P>
Delamuraz agreed with Wu, saying that the Swiss government is
willing to help advance the cooperation between the two countries'
enterprises, and the Swiss financial institutions and banks are
also willing to help.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, a memorandum of understanding on the
establishment of a fund for business cooperation between the two
countries was signed by Delamuraz and Dai Xianglong, governor of
the People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
The fund is designed to aid the cooperation between the small
and medium-sized businesses of the two countries and to promote
the Swiss companies' investment in China and their technology
transfer.

<P>
In recent years, the basin, like other areas in China, has been
hit by a wave of highway construction. An extensive highway
network with big and medium-size cities as hubs has been
established. The national and provincial highway arteries link
with supporting roads to all counties and most villages.
</P>
<P>
And more top-grade roads have been built, with high-grade
highways accounting for 20 percent in the area. More than ten
expressways and high-grade highways have been built and open to
traffic between Shanghai at the mouth of river, to Chengdu in the
middle reaches.
</P>
<P>
With China's reform and opening up drive, an air traffic
corridor, supported by big international airports in cities such
Shanghai, Wuhan, Changsha and Chongqing, has been created along
the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The area boasts two of the country's six major airlines,
Shanghai-based China Eastern Airlines, and Chengdu-based China
Southwest Airlines, and numerous regional airlines.
</P>
<P>
Cities along the river are also busy expanding and building new
airports. Carriers are constantly purchasing new aircraft and
initiating new routes to accommodate a growing demand for more air
traffic within the area, and between the area and other places in
China and across the world.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1980s, one new bridge has been built
each year on the river. The Yangtze used to be regarded as a
natural obstacle for traffic between the north and south sides
because of the one time shortage of bridges.
</P>
<P>
More than ten major cross-river bridges have been built,
forming five railway and five highway traffic links between north
and south sides of the river.
</P>
<P>
And by the end of the century at least another 20 new bridges
will be spanning Chinese mightiest river.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Vice-President on General Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Vice-President Godfrey
Miyanda has reassured the country that general elections will be
held this year.
</P>
<P>
''We are very genuine and we mean well. We will definitely
hold elections this year,'' Miyanda said on Thursday night in a
special interview on Television Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He noted, ''we are not happy that there are people who think
the MMD (Movement for Multi-Party Democracy) does not want to
hold elections. Elections will be held, definitely not in 1997.''
</P>
<P>
Miyanda was reacting to some opinions that the MMD does not
like to hold the general elections but to remain in office after
the end of its five-year term on October 31.
</P>
<P>
On whether the government would bar Kenneth Kaunda, former
republican president and leader of the opposition United
Independence Party, from filing his nomination for the
presidency, Miyanda said that only the returning officer would
know how to deal with the matter.
</P>
<P>
A constitution amendment that was adopted earlier this year
bars Zambians of foreign parentage from contesting the republican
presidency. This actually disqualifies Kaunda from running for
the highest leading post of the country as his parents were
immigrants.

<HEADLINE> Transport Network Formed Along Yangtze River (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, October 11 (Xinhua) -- A transport network of water,
land and air has taken shape along the Yangtze River, China's
longest waterway.
</P>
<P>
It has laid the foundation for opening of the area along the
river and for economic take-off of central and western China.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River, known as the "Golden Waterway", is the
world's biggest navigable river, and China's most important inland
waterway.
</P>
<P>
More than 70,000 kilometers of navigable waterways, including
its main course and tributaries, have been open to traffic,
accounting for over two thirds of the country's total navigable
mileage.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the People's Republic, 25 major ports,
with a combined annual handling capacity of 150 million tons have
been built in cities along the river, such as Shanghai, Nanjing,
Jiujiang, Wuhan and Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
At present there are more than 560 berths in the ports,
including nearly 40 with a capacity of 10,000-DWT (deadweight
tonnage).
</P>
<P>
Links have also been established between the ever expanding
transportation system on the Yangtze River and the international
ocean shipping market, with 10,000-DWT cargo ships able to sail to
Nanjing in the Yangtze River Delta area, and 5,000-DWT vessels
able to reach Wuhan in the middle reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
Railway construction has progressed at the same pace as that of
waterway. The length of railway lines along the river has reacned
12,000 kilometers, accounting for 22.4 percent of China's total. A
railway trunk network, connecting both sides of the river and the
eastern, central and western parts of the country, has been
established.
</P>
<P>
Railway and water traffic hubs established in major cities
along the river, such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Nanchang and Chengdu
have linked up railway and water traffic in the Yangtze River
Basin, greatly promoting economic development in the area.

<P>
NAIROBI, October 11 (Xinhua) -- President Daniel arap Moi will
leave for Arusha in Tanzania this moraning to attend a
consultative meeting on Burundi with other East African Heads of
State.
</P>
<P>
East African countries slammed an embargo on Burundi
immediately after Major Pierre Buyoya took over leadership in a
coup on July 25, this year.
</P>
<P>
The African states, enforcing the sanctions against Burundi in
early August, recently recommended that Major Buyoya be invited
for the next regional summit on Burundi which will began in
Arusha on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Times of Kenya paper said Major Buyoya told reporters in
Bujumbura on Thursday he would only agree to attend the Summit as
head of state, not merely as the army's representative.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya said he wanted to go to the Arusha Summit to explain
his peace plan and the "perverse and devastating" effects of
sanctions, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is due to come to
Arusha from Addis Ababa today and he will meet leaders of central
and east African states on African issues including Burundi,
diplomats here said.
</P>
<P>
About 150,000 people are estimated to have been killed in
Burundi since the country's first democratically elected
president was killed in a failed coup in October 1993.
</P>
<P>
All Burundi's neighbors including Kenya imposed a total trade
and transport embargo on Burundi to force Buyoya to open talks
with rebel Hutus unconditionally and they meet this time to
study whether the sanctions will be carried on, possibly with
the presence of Buyoya.

<HEADLINE> Charges Filed in Thailand's Bank Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Prosecutors have filed charges
against nine of the 12 suspects in the 1.657-billion-baht (66.28
million U.S. dollars) embezzlement case involving the Bangkok Bank
of Commerce, which nearly went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
Of the nine suspects, five are charged with collaborating to
embezzle assets from the bank and they include former bank
president Krirkkiat Jalichandra, former bank treasury adviser
Rakesh Saxena and his sister-in-law Sunantha Harnvorakiat.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution said that between February 10 and July 20 last
year, the five suspects, including the City Trading Corporation as
a juristic person, embezzled a total of 1.657 billion baht from
the bank.
</P>
<P>
They had requested a 2-billion-baht (80 million dollars) loan
from the bank to buy shares in order to take over three companies.
</P>
<P>
The collateral for the loan included shares worth 1.2775
billion baht (51.1 million dollars), to be acquired after the
takeover, and nine land plots.
</P>
<P>
The land plots, worth only 26.9 million baht (1.076 million
dollars), was overvalued to be worth 1.35 billion baht (54 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The then bank president Krirkkiat, acting upon documents
prepared by bank treasury adviser Saxena, abused his authority by
approving a loan of 1.657 billion baht, which far exceeded the
30-million-baht limit which he had the right to approve.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor alleged that the suspects had damaged the bank
and those who deposited their money with the bank.
</P>
<P>
On June 13, Ekachai Atikhomnantha, the bank's assistant
managing director, took away 75 million baht (3 million dollars)
from that amount although he knew that the money had been
embezzled.
</P>
<P>
However, of the nine suspects prosecuted on Thursday, four have
so far avoided arrest and warrants have been issued for their
arrest.

YINCHUAN, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region is expected to bring in a record harvest this
year of more than 2.49 billion kg of grain, a 23 percent rise over
1995.
</P>
<P>
The harvest of summer and autumn grain in the region's southern

This year's local cash crops, such as oil-bearing crops and
beets, also enjoy a marked increase over the previous years.
</P>
<P>
One of northwest China's important commodity grain bases, the

<P>
ZHENGZHOU, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan
Province has started to directly receive and dispatch
international mail and handle various overseas mail services.
</P>
<P>
The progress is due to a recent move by the Zhengzhou Customs
Administration to open a business office in the provincial posts
and telecommunications bureau.
</P>
<P>
Henan's international mail volume has been increasing rapidly
every year for the past several years. And other new businesses
that involve shipping and receiving large international packages
and letters are also on rise.
</P>
<P>
Previously, postmen had to send international mail to
neighboring provinces to go through customs procedures, because
there were no such business offices in the posts and
telecommunication bureau. This inconvenience limited the
province's development of foreign trade and economic cooperation,
and cultural exchanges, said local officials.
</P>
<P>
Now the time it takes to transfer international letters into
and outside of the province is shortened by one to two days.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Ease Closure on Palestinian Territories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Israel is to significantly
ease the closure on the Palestinian territories from Sunday in a
bid to create better atmosphere for the current
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai made the decision after
assessing the situation with top military and security officials
in a meeting held in Tel Aviv Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Starting from Sunday, the closure will be eased, removing the
seal around most Palestinian-controlled cities, allowing 35,000
Palestinian laborers to work in Israel and opening all the
crossings in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
However, the siege laid to the West Bank town of Nablus
will continue.
</P>
<P>
However, the easing of closure will be conducted with
reinforced security checks and inspection in order to deter the
possible infiltration of terrorists, the Defense Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The closure had been eased to some extent last week around most
 Palestinian-controlled cities, and now the residents of those
cities will be allowed to travel freely throughout the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai also ordered the Karni and Sufa Crossings to resume
full operation in order to ease the movement of goods in and
out of the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the lifting of closures and other significant
easing of the closure approved today will contribute to a
positive atmosphere between Israel and the Palestinian Authority
(PA)," Mordechai said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Israel and the Palestinians resumed peace
talks in the wake of the bloodshed two weeks ago. However, the
first four days of talks failed to produce any tangible result
as the two sides remained far apart on the issue of Israeli
redeployment from the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai took the steps after PA President Yasser Arafat
issued a warning that a new Intifada, or Arab uprising, could
break out at any time if Israel fails to advance the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Palestinian Council, Arafat blast Israeli
closure for causing severe economic difficulties across the
territories where he said some people were on "the brink of
starvation."
</P>
<P>
Arafat said the closure cost Palestinian economy 6 million
U.S. dollars a day in lost wages and trade. Media reports said
that the unemployment rate in the territories stands as high
as 50 percent, and the PA is facing a deficit of nearly 200
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the economic plight in the
territories had fueled the increasing anger among Palestinians,
which led to the outbreak of the bloodshed two weeks ago.

<HEADLINE> International Cooperation in Public Administration Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese official said here
today that the international community should increase cooperation
and exchanges in the field of public administration to meet the
common challenges of the coming century -- efficiency and the
decentralization of power.
</P>
<P>
"But such cooperation and exchanges must be carried out in the
principles of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit," said
State Councillor Li Guixian at the closing ceremony of the third
International Conference on Administrative Sciences.
</P>
<P>
He said he greatly appreciated one of the doctrines of the
International Institute of Administrative Sciences, which says
that when all countries confront the same challenge, it is not
right to presume which practical or theoretical model is the best,
nor should people believe that the best model exists in only one
place.
</P>
<P>
Li said China has made great efforts to reform and develop its
public administration system, and has made considerable
achievements in this regard.
</P>
<P>
China's reforms have been based mainly on its own specific
conditions, and the country has learned from the experiences of
others, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the willingness of the Chinese government to
further expand the cooperation and exchanges in this field to both
promote reforms and the development of administrative system.
</P>
<P>
David Brown, president of the IIAS, thanked the Chinese
government for hosting the successful conference.
</P>
<P>
Ould Dhada, secretary-general of the IIAS, said that she hopes
the institute will maintain a close partnership with the Chinese
government and its institutional restructuring bodies.
</P>
<P>
More than 700 government officials and specialists from nearly
100 countries and regions participated the conference, themed "New
challenges for the 21st century: civil service efficiency and
decentralization."
</P>
<P>
It was also learned from today's meeting that IIAS is expected
to hold a roundtable conference next July in Canada.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Decides to Tighten Tax Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
announced on Friday that he had decided to set up a provisional
emergency commission for the strengthening of tax and budget
discipline in the country.
</P>
<P>
The new commission will oversee customs and tax services which
"are still not working well enough," Yeltsin said in a radio
address to the nation, which was focused on the delayed payment of
salaries and pensions.
</P>
<P>
"We will take tough and radical measures" against all those who
are responsible for the "irregular payments", said the president,
who attributed the payment delay to the fact that both central and
local authorities have been unable to collect taxes.
</P>
<P>
About 600 Russian scientists, waving banners which read
"Without Science Russia is on Road to Nowhere" and "Scientists --
Get Up Off Your Knees," gathered in central Moscow on Thursday to
protest against payment delay and the lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Anatoly Chubais, Yeltsin's chief of staff, was
summoned to meet with the president to discuss a number of urgent
issues including the payment delay crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The United States has agreed to finance the Lebanese
project of importing 3,000 purebred American milk cows, Lebanese
Minister of Agriculture Shawki Fakhoury was quoted by Beirut's
An-Nahar daily today as saying.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Richard Jones
Thursday, the Lebanese minister said that the U.S. ambassador
informed him of Washington's approval of low-interest loans on the
importation.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that a first batch of 300 cows were loaded
on a cargo ship a week ago and would arrive at the Beirut port
next week,
</P>
<P>
He said that all the cows would be distributed among Lebanese
small farmers.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Most Americans of Arab origins supported the lifting
of a ban on American citizens' travel to Lebanon imposed by the
U.S. administration during the Middle East country's 1975-90 civil
war, Beirut's An-Nahar daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a recent survey made in the U.S. with 400
American Arabs as saying that three forths of them supported the
lift of the ban, which has impeded investments of
U.S. businessmen in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Beirut says Washington, by refusing to lift the ban
implemented following a series of terrorist attacks on American
targets in mid-1980s, is exerting pressure on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Plans to build coal-fired plants by the
"build-operate" method for the next 16 years have been completed,
local newspaper Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that a total of six power plants will be built
at the first stage in Adapazaeri, Ankara, Izmir, Iskenderun and
two in Gebze with a total capacity of 5,200 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Turkish Energy Minister Recai Kutan as saying
that the six coal-fired and another 11 hydropower plants to be
built by the "build-operate" method would cost about 4 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Kutan said that Turkey was determined to build a nuclear plant
and would invite bids by mid-November.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian government is exerting enormous efforts
to guarantee the success of the Cairo economic summit to be held
on November 12, the English-language newspaper Egyptian Gazette

tourism and transport projects to be submitted to the conference.
</P>

CANBERRA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
firmer against major currencies today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was traded at 78.96 US cents from 78.78
US cents on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It was also firmer against the Japanese yen, ending at 87.97
yen from 87.61 yen yesterday.

<P>
The Australian dollar ended firmer against the German mark at
1.2098 marks from 1.2035 marks on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar became firmer ahead of the national poll
in New Zealand this weekend. The local currency was boosted by
buying orders from investors who transferred their funds from New
Zealand dollar-denominated equities to Australian ones.
</P>
<P>
However, the Australian dollar drifted within a tight range
amid lackluster trade during the day, largely due to a
consolidation after yesterday's gains.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President to Visit Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer
Weizman will pay an official visit to Jordan soon at the
invitation of King Hussein of Jordan, but the date of the trip
still needs to be worked out.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported today that King Hussein telephoned
Weizman Thursday night and invited him to visit Jordan after his
trip to Egypt next week.
</P>
<P>
Weizman replied that he would be happy to go to Amman, capital
of Jordan, after consultation with Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
During the telephone conversation, Hussein also expressed
satisfaction at the Tuesday meeting between Weizman and
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat and at the
president's upcoming visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Weizman then telephoned Netanyahu and informed him of
Hussein's call, and the two had agreed that the president
would accept the invitation.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu reportedly has said that he respects Weizman to
coordinate all his trips. However, he added that the president
is not a substitute for conducting government policy.
</P>
<P>
This development came at a time when the Israeli-Jordanian
relations were in a state of "deterioration," as termed by
Jordanian Ambassador to Israel Omar Rifai.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was caused by what Jordan perceives to be
Netanyahu's insensitivity in not informing Hussein in advance
about the opening of the Hasmonean Tunnel in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Hussein has made blistering attacks on Netanyahu in recent
days, charging the Israeli prime minister with "arrogance."
This is the worst crisis in the Israeli-Jordanian relations
since the two countries signed a peace treaty in October
1994.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has expressed pride in the past in what he
considered to be a special relationship with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Early this week, Netanyahu tried to dispatch his foreign
policy adviser Dore Gold to Jordan, in an attempt to calm
down the situation, but he did not succeed in arranging
the trip with the Jordanian side.
</P>
<P>
During Thursday's phone conversation, Hussein reportedly told
Weizman that only progress in the peace process will lead to
a warm-up of relations with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, today's Jerusalem Post reported that the Jordanian
Embassy in Tel Aviv received two bomb threats this week,
including one Thursday, when Employees were evacuated from the
embassy for two hours, but no explosives were found.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Israel Radio reported today that
shooting was heard near the border between Israel and Jordan in
small hours of Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Israeli army troops on patrol in
the area opened fire toward the suspected source of
shooting, but no trace of gunmen was revealed in subsequent
searches.

LUSAKA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Some top management officials
in Zambia's state-owned companies have been identified as the
main culprits involved in asset stripping in the privatization

</P>
<P>
The parliamentary committee on parastatal bodies fears that
the government will lose millions of Kwacha in asset stripping
and undervalued assets in parastatal companies if the trend is
not checked, Times of Zambia paper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary committee said in a report that it has
uncovered inconsistencies in the sale of assets in parastatal
companies earmarked for privatization.
</P>
<P>
It also said that there is no transparency in the exercise
which has given way to asset stripping and undervaluing of some
assets.
</P>
<P>
The committee has told the Zambia Privatization Agency (ZPA)
to uphold transparency and consistency in the program.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the asset monitoring unit at ZPA to work in
collaboration with other security agencies of the government to
monitor the sale of assets to avoid thefts and undervaluing.

<HEADLINE> Land Hungry Peasants Invade Idle Farms in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 11 (Xinhua) -- About 2,000 land hungry
peasants recently invaded idle state farms in defiance of the
government, the country's leading paper Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
The unilateral action by otherwise law-abiding citizens is an
illustration of the growing impatience among thousands of
landless Zimbabweans over the implementation of the nationwide
land redistribution program to correct pre-independence
imbalances.
</P>
<P>
It also confirms fears by the government and the ruling ZANU
(PF) party that unless the imbalance was corrected, there is a
likelihood of another revolution, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Their anger is increasingly diverting from the colonial legacy
to senior government or ZANU (PF) party officials whom they now
accuse of benefiting from the farms so far acquired by the state
for resettlement purposes, it said.
</P>
<P>
Since the country's independence in 1980, the government has
resettled 62,000 landless families, with the remaining 100,000
families waiting for resettlement.

<HEADLINE> Ecstasy Pills Trafficking Group Crippled in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian police have
crippled a syndicate supplying ecstasy pills to the local market
with the arrests of four syndicate members and the seizure of
5,045 pills in Pulau Pinang State, the Malaysian national news
agency Bernama said today.
</P>
<P>
Bernama quoted Pulau Pinang police officer Abdul Hamid Mustapha
as saying today that police, acting on information from the state
Anti-Drug Division, detained three men at a parking lot in front
of a hotel in Butterworth, the state capital, some 370 kilometers
northwest of Kuala Lumpur, on Wednesday evening and seized the
pills kept in a pouch.
</P>
<P>
Another man was detained on Thursday, he said.
</P>
<P>
The pills, comprising red pills worth 200 ringgit (about 80 US
dollars) each and white ones worth 80 to 100 ringgit (about 32 to
40 US dollars) each, were believed to have been smuggled into the
country and destined for the local market, the officer said at a
news conference there.
</P>
<P>
The four men, aged between 26 and 40, are expected to be
charged with trafficking under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs
Act which carries the mandatory death sentence on conviction, the
officer said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abdul Hamid identified the British national who died
on Wednesday after one of the 40 condoms filled with heroin burst
in his stomach as Cunningham Paul Anthony, 25, from Manchester.
</P>
<P>
The black man was reported to have been found unconscious along
a road in Butterworth and taken to a local hospital where he was
certified dead. An autopsy found 39 lumps of heroin weighing 493.8
grams stuffed in condoms in his stomach. One condom broke in his
stomach.

<P>
The man was believed to have been trying to smuggle the heroin
out of Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean, U.S. Discuss DPRK Submarine Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 11 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and the United States
have claimed that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
has to "pay the price for its submarine infiltration."
</P>
<P>
"North Korea cannot live on its own and, in that sense,
withholding economic assistance and suspending talks meant to
improve relations between North Korea and the U.S. and Japan could
be the price Pyongyang will have to pay in connection with the
submarine incident," a South Korean Foreign Ministry official said
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when he was commenting on the results of
the talks between South Korean Foreign Minister Gong Ro-myung and
visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord, who
arrived here on Thursday for a three-day visit to quell doubts on
the solidarity between Seoul and Washington in dealing with the
issue of a DPRK submarine "infiltration" into South Korea.
</P>
<P>
During today's talks, Gong and Lord failed to produce an
agreement on what kind of measures will be taken against the DPRK,
the official added.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that Gong and Lord reaffirmed that improvement
in relations between Washington and Pyongyang should go in
parallel with improvement in inter-Korean relations.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has said that a group of armed DPRK people
"infiltrated" into the country's Kangwon province from a grounded
submarine in the East Sea on September 18.
</P>
<P>
But the DPRK said that the submarine, while on a training
mission, drifted after having an engine trouble and hitting a rock
in the sea.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three weeks, 11 DPRK people were founded to have
killed themselves, 11 were killed by South Korean troops and one
was captured alive. Three are reportedly still missing.

<HEADLINE> Delhi Court Refuses to Give Bail to Ex-PM Rao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Delhi Court today
rejected a bail plea by former Indian Prime Minister P.V.
Narasimha Rao in the St Kitts forgery case.
</P>
<P>
The court said that the bail plea, made here Thursday to the
court, was premature. However, it exempted Rao from personal
appearance in court on October 14.
</P>
<P>
The exemption order was based on the Supreme Court's granting
of the petition by Delhi police seeking a change of the trial
court's venue in a cheating case also involving Rao.
</P>
<P>
Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM) Prem Kumar said today that
since the trial venue of the L. Pathak case was yet to be decided,
Rao does not have to appear in person in this court in the St
Kitts case on October 14.
</P>
<P>
The CMM issued a non-bailable arrest warrant against Rao in the
St Kitts case on October 4, which was stayed by the Supreme Court
till October 14.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court today ordered the shifting of the trial venue
of the Pathak case and the St Kitts case from Tis Hazari court to
a special court in the capital's security zone out of security
considerations for Rao.
</P>
<P>
The special court's exact venue is to be decided by the Delhi
High Court.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bureau of Investigation alleged that Rao, in
conspiracy with others, attested forged documents to support
framed charges that Ajeya Singh, son of former Prime Minister V.P.
Singh, maintained a secret account in St Kitts islands in West
Indies and deposited 21 million US dollars in it during 1986-87.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Polish Deputy Prime Ministers Hold Talks in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
held talks in Beijing's Great Hall of the People this afternoon
with the deputy Prime Minister of Poland Grzegorz W. Kolodko.
</P>
<P>
During the talks the two deputy prime ministers agreed to
further two-way relations between China and Poland.
</P>
<P>
Li said that there were no obstacles to further development of
Sino-Polish relations, and closer cooperation would serve the
interests of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to make concerted efforts, together with the
Polish government, to maintain a stable and long-term growth of
bilateral ties, Li said.
</P>
<P>
China and Poland enjoy a profound and traditional friendship,
which has been developing smoothly and stood the test of time, he
said, adding that this pleased China.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China and Poland have shown mutual trust in
politics and cooperated economically on the basis of mutual
benefit. Cooperation in science, technology, culture and
education, he added, has constantly strengthened.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have also demonstrated a mutual understanding
and given support to each other on many major international
issues, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government treasures its ties with Poland and is
willing to enhance its friendship and cooperation with Poland in
various fields, based on the principles of mutual respect,
equality, mutual benefit and non-interference in each other's
internal affairs, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Kolodko said that China is a country of major significance in
international and regional affairs, and Poland attaches much
importance to its ties with China, and hopes China will become its
major cooperation partner.
</P>
<P>
The Polish government and its people follow with interest the
rapid growth of China's economy. Poland's economy, he said, has
developed in a comparatively sound way over recent years. This, he
added, has created favourable conditions for furthering trade and
economic ties, as well as the cooperation between businesses of
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two deputy prime ministers agreed that the two countries
should explore new ways for promoting economic and technological
cooperation, while expanding two-way trade.
</P>
<P>
The governments of the two countries should provide convenience
for more exchanges and closer cooperation between their businesses
to push forward bilateral trade and economic ties to a new high.
</P>
<P>
Following the talks, they attended a signing ceremony for a
protocol on the settlement of debts between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Kolodko arrived in Beijing today at the start of a 6-day
official visit to China as Li's guest.

HONG KONG, October 11 (Xinhua) -- French business
representatives in Hong Kong said that they are confident that
French business links with Hong Kong are likely to grow in the
years after 1997.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony today to mark the tenth anniversary of the French
Business Association (FBA) in Hong kong, President of the FBA
Didier Balme said: "Trade links are growing very fast and French
investment in Hong Kong is now worth six billion HK dollars (769
million US dollars) as French businesses have confidence in the
future of Hong Kong beyond 1997.
</P>
<P>
The FBA, which was formed in 1986 with 140 members, now boasts
a membership of 500 including representatives from some of
France's largest corporate names.
</P>
<P>
"There are more French businesses, more French investors, more
French people based in Hong Kong than ever before. The attraction
of Hong Kong and China is growing all the time, so we see no
reason why the French presence should not continue to grow as
well," said Balme, who is also Chief Executive of Banque Nationale
de Paris in Hong Kong and China.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 France was Hong Kong's ninth largest trading partner,
its ninth supplier and the tenth market of Hong Kong goods.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: A Major Step in Law Localization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The event was greeted by almost a
chorus of praise when three local residents in Macao were sworn
in as judges and public procurator earlier this month, because
they are the first ever Macao residents in Macao's judicial
organs.
</P>
<P>
Local media praised it as a "good sign" when legal cases were
tried in Cantonese for the first time ever instead of Portuguese
this week. Officials of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch hailed
it as a "remarkable step" in the localization of law.
</P>
<P>
Due to historical reasons, all judges and public prosecutors in
Macao's judicial organs came from Portugal and all legal cases
were handled in the Portuguese language, which was dubbed into
Cantonese over the earphone.
</P>
<P>
Cases tried in that way often lasted quite long, thus giving
rise to complaints among local residents.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the appointment of local Macao residents
as judges and prosecutors constitutes a major part of the process
of the localization of law, which has been deemed one of the three
leading issues in the transitional period.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of 27-year-old Zhu Jian and 35-year-old Zha Yun
as judges and 30-year-old Song Minli as prosecutor, therefore,
was hailed as a major step forward in the law localization
process.
</P>
<P>
All the three hold a bachelor's degree in law, and know both
the Chinese and Portuguese languages.
</P>
<P>
The "Macao Daily News" commented that the Cantonese-language
trial in Macao was an "applaudable first step forward" and a
"significant landmark in the localization of judicial organs."
</P>
<P>
Another commentary in the "Va Kio" newspaper praised it as
"encouraging," saying further efforts should be made so that more
local residents would become judges, prosecutors and lawyers and
the law localization process would be accelerated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a deputy-director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao
Branch, Zong Guangyao, attributed the appointment to the "active
efforts made by both the Macao government and people in Macao."
</P>
<P>
Currently, dozens of people are being trained to be legal
officers. Another group of judges and procurators will take office
next year, according to Zong.
</P>
<P>
The deputy director said the Chinese side will offer full
support and cooperation in training legal personnel so that the
process of localization would meet the demand for a smooth
handover of power in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Only 7 African States Ban Using Landmines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Seven African countries have
now ratified the U.N. weapons convention of 1980 which calls for
a total ban on the use of anti-personnel mines, an international
Red Cross official said here.
</P>
<P>
Information Officer of the International Committee of Red
Cross (ICRC) in Harare Munyama Ngangura said on Thursday that
South African, Mauritius, Togo and Uganda had ratified the
convention joining Niger, Benin and Tunisia who had long ratified
it.
</P>
<P>
He said many countries were not considering ratifying the
convention despite thousands of deaths and maimings as a result
of stepping on landmines.
</P>
<P>
''What we can only do is to urge governments to see the
importance of banning these deadly mines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Only 50 countries in the world have ratified the 16-year old
convention. It is estimated that 1,000 people are killed by
landmines every month, most of them in Africa which is littered
with landmines laid during the civil wars.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe was recently granted a 12.6 million U.S. Dollars
European Union grant to embark on a mine clearing exercise in
some parts of the country.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Starts Spraying to Curb Locust Invasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Air Force of Zimbabwe
helicopters and a private company are now spraying the huge
swarms of red locusts that have invaded the country's east areas,
the Daily Herald paper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Urgent action has been taken by state agencies and local
farmers because if the swarms are not controlled before the onset
of the rainy season, the areas' entire crops could be wiped out.
</P>
<P>
The red locusts came from Mozambique. In an effort to control
the invasion the Food and Agriculture Organization of Zimbabwe
has agreed to pay for 10,000 litres of the highly toxic
deltamethrin to be sent to Mozambique soon to spray the breeding
ground and other swarms elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Foreign Minister to Visit Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Foreign Affairs and
International Cooperation Minister, Jakaya Kikwete will begin an
official visit to Havana, Cuba on October 17, this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a local newspaper today, Kikwete said here on
Thursday that he would attend a meeting of Tanzania-Cuba
permanent joint commission on cooperation and explore ways to
strengthen that cooperation.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Washington was angered with last month's
visit to Tanzania of Iranian President Akbar Rafsanjani where he
held official talks with President Benjamin Mkapa and affirmed
increased political and economic relations.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania is an independent country like the United States. We
as an independent state can not be forced by anybody to choose a
friend," Kikwete told reporters on Thursday when he came back
from a tour of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The United States has blacklisted Cuba, Iran and Libya as
"unwanted countries for their records on funding terrorism", and
appealed to the countries of the world to isolate them.
</P>
<P>
Cuba and Tanzania have enjoyed political and economic ties for
many years. There are three secondary schools built with Cuban
assistance, in Kibiti, Ruve and Kilosa respectively in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"So, there is no diplomatic row with Washington Because we are
an independent state. We are a sovereign country and not the 51st
state of the United States," Kikwete said.
</P>
<P>
On the United States' rejection of Boutrous Boutrous-Ghali to
run for a second term as U.N. Secretary-General, the foreign
minister said that Tanzania's position would not be changed.
</P>
<P>
"Our position in the OAU is that Boutrous-Ghali is our
candidate," he added.

<HEADLINE> Israel vows not to Concede on Security Demands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Israel will not concede on
security matters in the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli talks on
Hebron redeployment, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
was quoted today as saying.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview printed in The Jerusalem Post today,
Mordechai insisted on Israel's freedom of action to foil
potential terrorist incidents in the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Hebron is the leading obstacle that blocks progress in the
current round of Israeli-Palestinian talks which resumed early
this week. The Palestinians insist on accurate implementation of
the agreement on Israeli redeployment from Hebron, while Israel
demands revising security arrangements in the volatile town where
450 Jews live among 120,000 Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"The main thing which guides us is that we have the authority
and the military capability to operate during alerts and
incidents, and following incidents so that we can simply prevent
dangers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed two weeks ago,
Mordechai said the crisis "caused us to strengthen our
guidelines, because without clear security foundations and without
the army and security services in every place possible, we are
likely to get into very dangerous situations."
</P>
<P>
As part of Israel's security demands, Mordechai made it clear
that Israel would request Palestinian policemen be equipped only
with pistols in order to reduce the dangers.
</P>
<P>
On civilian matters in Hebron, Mordechai said the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) should coordinate with Israel on making
any infrastructure changes in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
"We want all matters of building and changes in the
infrastructure in the section (of Hebron) that falls under our
security responsibility done in coordination with us. If there
isn't coordination, it could come to conflicts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Citing the difficulties created by the recent bloodshed,
Mordechai admitted that a long and tough road lies ahead to
restore mutual trust and cooperation between Israel and the PNA.
</P>
<P>
"In order to stabilize the situation and return the faith and
joint activities, we on our side need a lot of goodwill, the
ability to overcome the pain, and the ability to look beyond the
present obstacles to break through to a future way that advances
the peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Israeli policies on expanding Jewish settlements, Mordechai
said Israel does not intend to confiscate more Arab land and any
new building plan is subject to careful examination.
</P>
<P>
"Are we going to set up new settlements? No. Are we planning
to confiscate Arab land? No. Perhaps if we need to pave a road to
serve both Arabs and Jews we will do so, just as we do in
Israel," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel's new Likud government lifted in August a freeze on
expanding settlements imposed by the previous Labor government,
and has approved several large-scale plans to build new homes in
Palestinian territories. The fury about this policy by the
Palestinians was regarded as one of the main reasons that led to
the bloody clashes late last month.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the closure on Palestinian territories, Mordechai
said that Israel did so only out of security reasons. "I don't
have a policy and the government doesn't have a policy of
imposing a closure for economic hardship," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai ordered Thursday to ease the closure from Sunday to
allow more Palestinian workers to return to work in Israel and
free flow of Palestinian goods. The military blockade imposed
around most Palestinian towns after recent violence will also be
lifted.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been imposing a closure on the territories since
late February when the first of four suicide bombing attacks took
place. The closure costs the fledging Palestinian economy 6
million dollars a day, fueling the increasing anger among the
Palestinians.

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Medical College of Xiamen
University was formally established today as a result of the joint
efforts by the Xiamen municipal government and Xiamen University.
</P>
<P>
Funded by the local government and overseas and domestic
donators, the medical college is designed to foster high-quality
medical personnel for the next century.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two students from all over the country are currently
enrolled at the college, which expects to sign up 280 to 400
students a year for study after the construction of all projects
of the college are completed.
</P>
<P>
In the next few years, it plans to enroll students from inland
provinces, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao and southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The college has formed a clinical medicine speciality, which
will focus on angiocardiopathy, ophthalmology, tumors and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
The college is to introduce domestic and overseas investments,
and welcome excellent overseas teachers and researchers.
</P>
<P>
It will also look nationwide for a permanent vice president.
</P>
<P>
Before the establishment of the new college, Fujian Province
only had one medical college and a college of traditional Chinese
medicine. About 700 students graduate from the two colleges, but
the number could not meet the needs of the province.

<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng met
here this afternoon with visiting Polish Deputy Prime Minister
Grzegorz W. Kolodko, saying that China attaches great importance
to developing Sino-Polish relations.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China is ready to push forward the overall
development of Sino-Polish friendship and relations of cooperation
along with Poland, on the basis of mutual respect,
non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and
mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
During the past few years, Li noted, Sino-Polish friendship and
cooperation continued to develop, and leaders of the two countries
have kept constant contacts which enhanced mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
Those contacts have played an important role in pushing forward
the continuous development of bilateral exchanges and cooperation
in politics, economy, science, technology, culture and education,
the Chinese leader added.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the two countries also have a close
cooperation in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Facts have proved that the differences in historical and
cultural traditions, social systems, ideologies and concepts of
value do not hinder the development of state-to-state relations,
Li noted.
</P>
<P>
The development of relations and cooperation between China and
Poland is in the fundamental interests of the people of the two
countries, said Li.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Poland is an important country in the middle
eastern Europe, Li said that China always respects the development
road chosen by the Polish people, and the internal and external
policies adopted by the Polish government.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his appreciation for the "one China" policy
which Poland adheres to.
</P>
<P>
Kolodko said that the Polish government and people felt very
happy about the rapid economic development in China and the great
achievements in various fields China has made.
</P>
<P>
He said that Poland values its friendship and cooperation with
China and his country is confident of the future development of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Poland hopes to increase bilateral exchanges and cooperation in
economy, trade, science, technology, education, culture, and

<HEADLINE> Dependence on Foreign Workers Poses Social Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior Singapore government
official called today for greater efforts to tackle the issue of
increased cases of crimes and other social problems caused by the
country's dependence on foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of this year's Construction
Safety Campaign, Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng said
over-dependence on foreign workers would add to crime and other
social problems.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there were 11 murders and 50 cases of workers
inflicting injuries on others at worksites last year, Wong said
that efforts must be made to ensure that crimes at worksites did
not spill over into the residential estates.
</P>
<P>
The minister warned that the situation would become
unmanageable if the problem of illegal workers, which, he said,
has deteriorated in recent years, was not solved.
</P>
<P>
An average of 580 illegal immigrants and overstayers were
arrested each month between March and September this year, Wong
added.
</P>
<P>
Lee Boon Yang, Minister for Labor, revealed last month that
there were currently more than 350,000 foreign workers in
Singapore, constituting some 20 percent of the country's
workforce.
</P>
<P>
"Singapore is becoming increasingly reliant on foreign workers.
While they can help to boost our economic growth, the presence of
a large pool of unskilled foreign workers and over reliance on
them can have serious social, economic and political implications
for Singapore," the minister warned.

<HEADLINE> Rural Surplus Labor Remains a Major Problem in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- China's already very huge force
of surplus rural labor will continue to grow in the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
It will mean the task of re-employment remaining a major
problem for a long time.
</P>
<P>
Lin Yongsan, vice-minister of labor, made the prediction today
in Beijing, at a national conference on rural employment.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference was convened by the Ministry of Labor,
Ministry of Agriculture, and the Development Research Center,
under the State Council, China's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
During the period of the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000),
there will be a huge imbalance between supply and demand of rural
labor, the vice labor minister forecast.
</P>
<P>
He said the total number of rural surplus laborers, and new
laborers, will surpass 210 million, while various jobs the
government can offer are estimated at less than 70 million.
</P>
<P>
"If no effective measures are taken, the size of surplus rural
labor could go beyond 140 million by the end of 2000, even larger
than its present size," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the present situation for rural
employment is by no means optimistic.
</P>
<P>
"Factors, like the steady decrease of arable land area, lack of
funds, and surge of agricultural production costs, have affected
the peasants' enthusiasm for agricultural input, and led to a rise
in surplus labor," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Township industries, which have absorbed a large number of
surplus rural laborers, now face their own problems, and have much
difficulty in providing more job opportunities for a period of
time, he added.
</P>
<P>
"It is also unrealistic to expect cities and towns, which are
poor in infrastructure, and have been already heavily burdened by
the large number of laid-off workers from state enterprises, to
contribute much to rural employment," he conceded.
</P>
<P>
He suggested two possible ways to create more job opportunities
in the vast rural areas.
</P>
<P>
One is to stabilize and enlarge current employment by means of
increasing agricultural input, and deepening internal reform of
township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The other is to make use of the unexploited natural resources,
and try to develop new sectors and businesses, such as gardening
agriculture and cultivation, to absorb more surplus labor.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the importance of speeding up construction of
the labor market and ensuring the "reasonable and orderly" flow of
rural labor.
</P>
<P>
"In the coming years, some counties or cities should lead the
country in abolishing the distinctions between city and
countryside, and setting up an employment system that is based
upon fair competition and free choice," he urged.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 percent of China's current population live in
rural areas. Official statistics put the size of the country's
surplus labor in rural areas at 130 million.

<HEADLINE> Smokers Have Only Half the Chance of Surviving Into 70s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Lifelong male smokers are only
half as likely as non smokers to reach their 70s, a study in The
British Medical Journal said today.
</P>
<P>
The study monitored the health of 7,000 men for 15 years and
found that those who started smoking by the age of 20 and
continued throughout their lives had only a 42 percent chance of
being alive at the age of 73. Those who had never smoked had a 78
percent chance.
</P>
<P>
The study is part of the British Regional Heart Study, a
long-term research project sponsored by the British Heart
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The researchers, led by Dr. Andrew Phillips of the Royal Free
Hospital, Hampstead, north London, monitored the medical history
of 7,735 men picked from GP (general practitioner) practices in 24
towns.
</P>
<P>
All were aged 40 to 59 when the study started between 1978 and
1980.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1993, when the study concluded, 560 lifelong
smokers and 127 non-smokers had died.

<HEADLINE> 10 South Korean Legislators Charged With Violating Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Ten lawmakers in the South Korean
National Assembly, three from the ruling New Korea Party, have
been indicted for breaking election laws during last April's
general elections.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 120 members of the assembly were investigated by the
South Korean Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office for offenses
allegedly committed in the run up to the April 11 poll.
</P>
<P>
But the public prosecutor decided to proceed with only 10
cases, an official said today.
</P>
<P>
Two of those charged are from the main opposition National
Congress for New Politics, four from the conservative opposition
United Liberal Democrats and one independent, the official added.
</P>
<P>
In the 15th South Korean National Assembly elections held on
April 11 this year, the ruling NKP headed by President Kim
Young-sam won 139 seats, 11 short of a simple majority of 150 in
the 299-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, the NKP later lured into its fold 12 opposition
members and independent legislators to secure 151 seats.

<HEADLINE> Zaire Declares Province Bordering Rwanda Under State of War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Zaire has declared its eastern
province of Sud-Kivu to be under a state of war after month-long
clashes between the Zairean troops and ethnic Tutsi Banyamurenge
rebels in the border area close to Rwanda and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted General Eluki Mponga Aunda of
the Zairean Army as saying today in Goma that the "state of war"
resulted from "aggression against Zaire by the armed bands of
Banyamurenge."
</P>
<P>
He also accused Rwanda, Burundi and the United Nations High
Commission for Refugees (HCR) of backing attacks by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
"The Banyamurenge came from Rwanda with the military men of the
ARR (Rwandan Patriotic Army), with the vehicles of the HCR, and
traversed Burundi," said the general.
</P>
<P>
Both Rwanda and Burundi rejected a similar accusation by Zaire,
which for the first time accused the two countries of backing the
rebels on September 13.
</P>
<P>
The Banyamurenge people, who have been living in eastern
Zaire's plateau regions for generations, are numbered between
250,000 and 400,000.
</P>
<P>
The AFP quoted Lwabandji Lwasi Ngabo, vice-governor of
Sud-Kivu, as saying that there is really a situation of war in his
province, particularly in the Uriva region bordering Burundi.
</P>
<P>
"There have been attacks, deaths. A colonel of the Zairean
Army has been killed, the troops are reinforced," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for the establishment of a "human corridor" to let
the Banyamurenge civilians evacuate from the areas where fighting
is going on.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the HCR has evacuated most of its staff from the
region to Kenya, according to the AFP.

<HEADLINE> US Not to Change Its Policy on APEC: US Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States' policy
toward creating free and open trade and investment under the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum will not change no
matter who wins the next US presidential election, a US official
said today.
</P>
<P>
"I think that whoever will win the presidential election, the
US will remain committed to the APEC," US Coordinator for APEC
John Wolf said in a dialogue with Asian interviewers via satellite
TV.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue, which hooked him up with interviewers from China,
Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, was aired live at the US embassy
here.
</P>
<P>
Like other Asia-Pacific countries, the US attaches importance
to APEC in an effort to create a free and open world trade system,
he said.
</P>
<P>
One of the US goals in the forum is to make APEC a driving
force for the world trading system, he added.
</P>
<P>
In their 1994 meeting in Bogor, Indonesia, APEC members
committed themselves to liberalizing trade and investment by 2010
for developed APEC economies and by 2020 for developing APEC
economies.
</P>
<P>
APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea,
the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the
US.
</P>
<P>
US trade with other APEC economies in 1995 amounted to 884
billion US dollars or about 66 percent of its total trade with the
world. In the same year, its trade with Europe stood at 259
billion US dollars or less than 20 percent of its total trade.
</P>
<P>
The average growth rate of the Asian economies is three times
higher than the rest of the world, with their total output
doubling every eight to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
According to Wolf, APEC aims to provide the business world with
facilities granted by the governments of APEC members, for
instance, by launching deregulatory and debureaucratization
measures.
</P>
<P>
"The goal of the APEC cooperation is to create facilities for
the business world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is the private sector that will benefit (from) the APEC
cooperation," he added.

<HEADLINE> Islamic Fundamentalism, Nuclear Acquisition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Islamic fundamentalism and
the attempt to acquire nuclear weapons by certain countries are
two central dangers in the Middle East, Israeli Defense Minister
Mordechai has said.
</P>
<P>
In an wide-ranging interview published on today's The
Jerusalem Post, Mordechai said Israel was one of the main goals
of Islamic fundamentalism, which also targets the whole Western
world.
</P>
<P>
The second central danger in the Middle East is "the ability of
nations like Iran and Iraq to get nuclear weapons," the minister
added.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai singled out Iran for being "a source of Islamic
fundamentalism and has the great desire to make, or purchase
non-conventional weapons."
</P>
<P>
"Imagine what would have happened if Iraq had nuclear weapons
during the Gulf war," he said, referring to Iraq's missile
attacks on Israel in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Israel destroyed Iraq's nuclear reactor in 1987 in a
surprise air bombing operation, retaining its monopoly on
nuclear weapons in the region. Israel is regarded to be the
single country in the region that has nuclear capability, and
experts suspected it had possessed 100 nuclear heads.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai also expressed Israel's concern about the attempt
by some Arab countries in the region to acquire powerful
conventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
"The other danger is the arming of Arab nations, with an
emphasis on surface-to-surface missiles with long ranges of over
500 kilometers so they can fire at Israel from afar like in the
Gulf War," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the interview, Mordechai also talked about Israeli
relations with Syria, Egypt, Turkey and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the recent military tension with Syria
following Syrian troop movements, Mordechai ruled out the
possibility that Syrian President Hafez al-Assad would launch an
attack on Israel in the short period.
</P>
<P>
"Al-Assad is a cool-headed, calculating man and if he does an
operation he wants to know what dangers it involves. Therefore, I
don't believe that in the short range al-Assad will make a grave
mistake," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister warned Syria that any provocation could cause "a
very grave, extreme and immediate reaction" from Israel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mordechai reiterated that Israel has "no intentions
for war and I will make all efforts to prevent war." Two days
ago, Mordechai sent a message to al-Assad, inviting him to visit
Israel in order to resume peace talks that have been stalled so
far.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the recent tense relations with Egypt, which
conducted a large-scale military exercise last month, Mordechai
said Israel has no intentions of harming Egyptian sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"We have peace with Egypt, I think the Egyptians have to put
forth all efforts to refrain from verbal attacks, which don't
help anyone," he said, adding he would like to pay a visit to
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country making peace with Israel, has
escalated its criticism of Israel recently for the lack of
progress in the peace process on all tracks.
</P>
<P>
Mentioning Israel's strategic relations with Turkey, Mordechai
said he hoped Turkey would continue to be a democratic Western
state even after the formation of an Islamic government.
</P>
<P>
"We have welcomed military relations for our benefit and
Turkey's benefit. I hope these ties will continue. We both have
an interest in strengthening the moderate elements in Turkey,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
In February, Israel and Turkey signed a controversial treaty
on military cooperation, which allows Israeli pilots to conduct
training flights over Turkish air space. It aroused protests from
Arab countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Talking about his upcoming visit to the United States next week,
Mordechai said it would "create a personal chemistry and a common
ground for strengthening the relations with the Americans."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he admitted differences of opinion exist
between the two close allies, including those on peace talks
with the Palestinians and Syrians.

<HEADLINE> China's Textile Industry Shrinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- China will decrease the
production capacity of its textile industry and improve the
sector's efficiency, according to Wu Wenying, chief of the China
National Textile Council.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the council will use production permits for
spinning frames and permits to buy spinning frames to curb the
rampant growth of the textile industry.
</P>
<P>
"Those spinning frame production firms which already have
permits, will be re-examined by authorities," she said. "Those
that are not qualified for production permits should not be
engaged in spinning frames production."
</P>
<P>
Companies that need to buy spinning frames must apply to the
council for permits to do so, the official said. China is
determined to remove 10 million outdated spindles from the
more than 41 million, she noted.
</P>
<P>
From 1992 to 1994, she said, 1.96 million spindles were added,
despite the government's warnings about overheating in the sector.
</P>
<P>
During this period, China eliminated 2.79 million outdated
spindles.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen rebels of the
outlawed Kurdish Worker's Party (PKK) were killed in a two-day
military operation staged by the Turkish security forces in
eastern Turkey, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that a 200-strong special team of the
security forces Thursday morning started to encircle about 30 PKK
militants who stayed near Kirkgecit village in Gurpinar town, Van
province, and attacked them with the support of Cobra helicopters.
</P>
<P>
The helicopters continuously bombarded the rebels' position for
30 minutes Thursday and the mopping-up operation would continue.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted officials from the Gendarme Commandership as
saying that the death toll of the PKK militants may increase.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 12-year-old guerrilla war for
autonomy, which has claimed over 21,000 lives in the
southeastern Turkey since August 1984.

<HEADLINE> IOC Finds New Way to Detect Dangerous Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- International Olympic Committee
(IOC) medical chief Prince Alexandre de Merode said on Friday that
IOC had found a way of detecting erythropoietin (EPO) which is
believed to be the most dangerous drugs used by athletes.
</P>
<P>
EPO stimulates the production of red blood cells which
transport oxygen around the body, which can replace hard
training at high altitude.
</P>
<P>
It is used by athletes who want to cheat in endurance events
like cycling and rowing. It is suspected that the drug has killed
18 riders in Europe since it was first introduced to treat kidney
disease in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
Several leading anti-doping experts have been campaigning
for a test to be introduced after scientific breakthroughs in
the last year.
</P>
<P>
EPO is produced naturally in humans but if it enters the
body artificially it can be fatal, making the blood thick and
gluey and breaking down the entire circulatory system.
</P>
<P>
This can cause high blood pressure and thrombosis and lead
to a heart attack.

JOHANNESBURG, October 11 (Xinhua) -- At least 20 cases of
leprosy have been reported in Botswana recently, according to
Radio Gaborone monitored here today.
</P>
<P>
Most of the patients are in the north-western Okavango region.
And seven cases have been found in five villages in the country's
Central District, said the report.

Surveys of leprosy, which is a chronic disease characterised
by the development of widely-distributed lumps on the skin, were
carried out in Botswana in the 1970s and 1980s, and the cases at
that time were found to be too few to warrant vigorous control

<HEADLINE> Slovenian President on Sino-Slovenian Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LJUBLJANA, SLOVENIA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Slovenia's
President Milan Kucan said that developing friendly and
cooperative ties with China was strategically important to his
country.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Chinese journalists, Kucan said Slovenia
also appreciates China's principle of impartiality in the former
Yugoslav crisis.
</P>
<P>
Kucan is expected to start a five-day official visit to China
on October 14, the first since he took office in December 1992.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia declared independence on June 25, 1991, and China
established diplomatic ties with this central European state in
May 1992.
</P>
<P>
Kucan said China, with its huge population and market
potential, offers good prospects for economic cooperation with
other countries, including Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Taiwan, Kucan said that Slovenia adheres to the
"one China" policy and will not abandon this political principle
for economic benefit.
</P>
<P>
Since its independence in 1991, Slovenia has adopted a foreign
policy based on cooperation on an equal footing, mutual respect
for sovereignty and territorial integration, Kucan said.
</P>
<P>
He added that due to its geographic location, Slovenia regards
the European Union as its most important partner and joining the
EU is the top priority of his country's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
However, Slovenia also seeks to strengthen cooperation with
other countries including China in order to avoid being
over-dependent on any one region.
</P>
<P>
"To develop long-term friendly cooperative ties with China is
also of strategic significance," Kucan said.

<HEADLINE> Oman's Exports/Imports rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Statistics released in Muscat today by the Omani Ministry of
Development say that the value of Oman's exports by the end of
June 1996 have amounted to some 1.26 billion Omani rials (about
3.28 billion U.S. dollars) as compared to some 1.15 billion rials
(about 3 billion dollars) during the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The rise in Oman's exports is attributed to an increase in its
petroleum exports during the period under review. The value of oil
exports amounted to some 989.5 million rials (2.5 billion dollars)
compared to 909.2 million rials (2.36 billion dollars) during the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Non petroleum exports have also registered an increase of 4.4
percent to approximately 91 million rials (236.6 million dollars)
by the end of June from 87.2 million rials (226.7 million dollars)
of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Non petroleum exports include such items as dates and lemon,
mineral and animal products, textile, minerals, animal fats as
well as animal and vegetable oil.
</P>
<P>
Re-exports during the same period have also increased by 19.9
percent to some 180.3 million rials (486.8 million dollars) from
150.4 million rials (391 million dollar) of the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The statistics show that the rise in Oman's imports during the
first half of this year has increased by 13.1 percent, amounting to
870 million rials (2.26 billion dollars) as compared to 769.1
million rials (about 2 billion dollars) during the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
The most important imports of Oman include industrial products,
foodstuff, tobacco, chemical and mineral industry products,
machinery, electrical appliances and textile.

BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The 7th Plenum of the Central
Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) was held in Beijing on October 11 for the purpose of
working out ways of implementing the CPC Central Committee's
decision regarding ethical and cultural progress, issued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The plenum said that greater effort should be made in the
Party's work style and building a clean government, intensifying
the struggle against corruption, and implementing the various
tasks put forth by the 6th Plenum of the 14th CPC Central
Committee.

made by Wei Jianxin, secretary of the CPC Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection (CCDI), on behalf of the CCDI Standing
Committee, and adopted the report.

<P>
The Plenum emphasized that what is most important in enhancing
ethical and cultural progress is stricter Party administration and
a better working style.
</P>
<P>
Improving the Party's work style and continuing the Party's
fine traditions and work style is an important part of promoting
socialist ethical and cultural progress, which plays a leading
role.
</P>
<P>
The work style of the ruling party is a matter of life and
death, and Party organizations and members should conscientiously
carry on the Party's fine traditions and work style.
</P>
<P>
The Plenum is urging the Party organizations and Party members
to carry on the style of combining theory with practice, freeing
minds, and seeking truth from facts and continuing reforms and
renovation while fighting fraud, formalism, and old ways.
</P>
<P>
The work style of close links to the masses, criticism and
self-criticism, hard work, and building a clean and honest
government should also be continued.
</P>
<P>
Leading Party officials in an exemplary role, promoting the
Party's work style and ethical and cultural progress is of great
significance.
</P>
<P>
The Plenum said that the crackdown on corruption is one of the
important tasks of improving the Party's work style and clean
government and for promoting ethical and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
Party committees at all levels should increase their confidence
and be determined in intensifying leadership in the
anti-corruption fight.
</P>
<P>
They should severely punish those who are involved in corrupt
activities, and should deal with policy, structure, legislation,
and management problems to pull up the roots of corruption at its
source.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Pulls Staff Out of Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has pulled 11 of its 18
international staff out of Zaire because of its concern over the
security situation in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
However, its operations are continuing in refugee camps in the
unstable Uvira region in eastern Zaire with the support of local
staff and non-governmental organizations, UNHCR spokesman Ron
Redmond told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Redmond said his agency hoped that further consultations
between Tanzania, Rwanda and Zaire would begin soon after their
officials return to their capitals following an UNHCR Executive
Committee meeting which ended Friday.
</P>
<P>
The agency's staff in Goma, a city in eastern Zaire near the
border with Rwanda, said that Zairean soldiers were reportedly
diverting several thousands people fleeing the village of Bambu,
about 110 kilometers north of Goma, to the nearby town of
Rutsuru. The villagers fled after an attack on Wednesday night by
unidentified men that left 50 to 60 people dead.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been mounting along the Zairean-Rwandan because of
the spillover into Zaire of fierce inter-ethnic fighting in Rwanda
between the majority Hutus and minority Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
In early September, Zaire accused Rwanda and Burundi of
stirring up trouble in the Uvira region and there has been
fighting between Zairean army troops against Tutsi armed groups in
the mountains in Uvira.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda has accused Zaire of backing Hutu rebels to mount raids
into Rwanda from across the border.

VIENNA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Austrian Tennis Federation
(OTV) said on Friday it would appeal against the ITF's decision
that it must forfeit 59,000 U.S. dollars in prize money for
quiting last month's Davis Cup tie in middle against Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The International Tennis Federation also decided in London
on Monday to give Brazil a 4-1 victory over Austria.
</P>
<P>
The OTV vice-president Christian Ransmayer said OTV would
demand the money earned through advertising, some 40,000
U.S. dollars of the 59,000.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian Davis Cup team refused to complete the tie in
Sao Paolo after world number three Thomas Muster pulled out of
the doubles, saying he was insulted by the spectators.
</P>
<P>
Ransmayer said the OTV fully supported and respected Muster's
decision to abandon the tie and expected the ITF to next handle
the issue in December.

WASHINGTON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. Newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Yasser Arafat warned that negotiations regarding the Israeli
pullout from Hebron on the West Bank had achieved nothing so far,
and that the Palestinians had to be prepared "to confront all
possibilities."
</P>
<P>
-- House Republicans released a report accusing the
Administration of lying about President Clinton's decision not to
block Iranian arm shipments to Bosnia in 1994 and called for a
criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton administration proposed Thursday to give every
school and library in the United States free basic access to the
Internet, with the cost to be paid collectively by the nation's
communications carriers.
</P>
<P>
-- The Immigration and Naturalization Service came under legal
attack this week, in one case for allegedly discriminating against
Latino employees and, in a separate case, for deporting thousands
of suspected illegal immigrants without following proper
procedures.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton administration is studying a request from
Russia's nuclear-weapons labs to buy three U.S. supercomputers.
The request has sparked opposition in Congress because at least
one of the very high-speed computers would be used to test the
reliability of bombs and missiles in Russia's nuclear-arms
stockpile.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Vows To End liberian Crisis in 9 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior officer of the African
peace-keeping force in Liberia, known as ECOMOG, has pledged to
end the lingering crisis in Liberia in nine months, when a
democratically elected government would have been installed, the
"Daily Time" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Adressing a new batch of Ghanian troops at the freeport of
Monrovia on Tuesday, the ECOMOG Field Commander, Major-General
Samuel Victor Malu said the past bitter experiences when warring
factions held the force to ransom would never be tolerated again.
</P>
<P>
He advised Liberian factions agaisnt taking chances with the
force on the implementation of the Abuja Accord, warning that the
ECOMOG was in a position to contain menace from any of the
groups.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that ECOMOG troops backed by tanks
extended patrols in western Liberia yesterday after rebels
blocking highways melted into the bush as the peacekeepers moved
closer to them.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue patrol and keep the roads open and safe for
relief workers to resume food distribution," the commander was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Truckloads of peacekeepers rolled out into western Liberia on
Wednesday to clear out ULIMO-J gurrillas loyal to warlord General
Hoosevelt Johnson.
</P>
<P>
A military spokesman said the troops encountered no rebels as
they swept into the hinterland and fanned out towards Cape Mount
County and Tubmanburg, a stronghold of Jonhson 's Krahn tribe.
</P>
<P>
However, the final disarmament of the factions fighters as
ordered by the Abuja Accord signed in last August would take time
as the ECOMOG is still waiting fro troops reinforcements, the
report said.

<HEADLINE> New Tibetan Interest In Stock Market (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- When dawn was breaking over the
golden top of the Potala Palace and the ancient city of Lhasa was
beginning to wake up, elderly were circling the city, spinning
prayer wheels and chanting Buddhist scriptures, but a number of
others were gathering in front of the new stock market, located on
the western side of the Potala, waiting for the business day to
begin.
</P>
<P>
"I've been a stock trader for half a year, and have bought
Shanghai securities," Gesangzholma, a Tibetan woman living nearby,
told the reporter. She is a self-employed street peddler and
manager of a small grocery.
</P>
<P>
"I used to think of the street where I did business as the
whole market place, but now I have access to a far larger market
by trading securities, and it has really broadened my horizons,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Ever since she bought 5,000 yuan (600 US dollars) worth of
stock half a year ago, she has devoted herself to the stock market
and asked her mother to look after the grocery.
</P>
<P>
When asked how much money she had earned in the market, she
shook her head, and with her right hand made a spiral gesture in
the air, meaning "no comment".
</P>
<P>
The Lhasa stock market was set up in the early 1990s. At first,
it was a bit too voguish for most Tibetans, and very few people
even knew where it was or what its function was.
</P>
<P>
One journalist spent three days outside the market entrance
just waiting for a chance to take a photo of a Tibetan in ethnic
dress entering into the strange place, but finally gave up in
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
By early 1995, however, just as "Tibet Pearl" stock was coming
in, tens of thousands of buyers from inland provinces rushed in,
pushing the price of the stock to 25 yuan, from about four yuan
when it was issued.
</P>
<P>
The price hike greatly enlarged Tibetans' financial awareness,
driving more of them into the market.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Major Mining Company for Sale </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's major drilling company
in the copper mining industry, Mpelembe Drilling Company Ltd.,
(MDC), is for sale as part of the privatisation plan of the
state-owned Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM).
</P>
<P>
Offers are invited for the purchase of up to 80 percent MDC
shares and investors are required to bid within the next four
months, said a spokesman of the company.
</P>
<P>
MDC is a totally owned subsidiary of the state-run
conglomerate ZCCM which the Zambian government announced in July
to privatize in an effort to ensure the survival and growth of
the key components of the Zambian mining industry and to
contribute to the growth of Zambia's economy.
</P>
<P>
The major customer of MDC is ZCCM which accounts for one
hundred percent of MDC's contract mining activities and related
works. ZCCM earns eighty percent of Zambia's annual foreign
exchange.

<HEADLINE> C'wealth Ministers To Visit Nigeria on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 11 (Xinhua) -- A mission of the Commonwealth
Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) will visit Nigeria on November 11
to report on the nation's human rights and democracy situation,
CMAG Chairman Stan Mudenge announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The CMAG met in New York on September 29 and decided to send
the mission despite failure to receive guarantees on free access
from Nigeria authorities.
</P>
<P>
The CMAG report will be submitted to the next Commonwealth
summit scheduled in Edinburgh in October 1997 and will decide
whether to impose further sanctions against Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth suspended Nigeria's membership last November
after nine Ogoni activists, including the famous author, Ken
Saro-Wiwa, were hanged by the military government.
</P>
<P>
The CMAG agreed last April to impose an arms embargo on
Nigeria's military administration, together with visa denial to
Nigeria's government officials.
</P>
<P>
But in June, the group agreed to suspend the implementation of
the sanctions until a fact-finding team are sent to Nigeria to
assess the human rights and democratic situation in the West
African country.

<HEADLINE> New Tibetan Interest In Stock Market (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This year marks another turning point in Tibet's stock market
development, with the first locally-issued stock -- "Shengdi" --
coming out in September, as local traders become the overwhelming
majority in the market.
</P>
<P>
The "Golden Pearl" stock issue coincided with a decline in
interest rates for savings, causing another purchasing frenzy in
Lhasa on October 7. Although some people bought stock blindly, it
was a clear sign of the change in Tibetans' viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very good phenomenon: on the one hand, it shows
people's market awareness, and on the other, it reveals their
confidence in enterprises," noted Xu Mingyang, vice-chairman of
the Tibetan Autonomous Regional people's government.
</P>
<P>
"But many people have little knowledge of the stock market, so
stock distribution departments should provide more convenient
services," he said, during an inspection tour of the market in
October.
</P>
<P>
At nine-thirty, the Lhasa Stock Exchange opened, and traders
jostled each other rushing into the marketplace, some grabbing up
securities news, some buying and selling, and some just standing
there, staring at the quotations on the screen to watch the
fluctuating market.
</P>
<P>
An employee with the city's Post and Telecommunication Bureau
bought 10,000 "Golden Pearl" stocks in one move. When asked why so
many, he said confidantly, "The stock is just coming in, it is
primary stock, whose price will rise if it has the lucky number."
</P>
<P>
A farmer from the suburbs of Lhasa, who happened to be there
and knew little about the market, was asking in a loud voice "If
the stock doesn't have a lucky number, will you refund my money?"
</P>
<P>
When he was told that not only would the money be refunded, but
with interest added, three months after the lot drawing, he spent
all of the 1,000 yuan he had with him on the stock.
</P>
<P>
"Now that my money is just lying idle at home, I'd like to take
the chance to make a fortune. There's nothing to be afraid of,
because the money will be refunded," the man was mumbling to
himself as he walked out of the market, clutching the
newly-purchased securities in his hand.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Welcomes OECD Decision to Invite It as New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government today
welcomed the decision of the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) to invite South Korea as a new member.
</P>
<P>
The government said that the decision is a result of the
international community's recognition of the impressive economic
development the country has achieved.
</P>
<P>
The OECD decision will serve as a momentum for South Korea to
further expediting its reforms and globalization and also to
developing diplomatic relations with OECD countries at a higher
dimension, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Suh Dae-won said here in a
comment.
</P>
<P>
The OECD Council formally decided in Paris earlier today to
invite South Korea as a new OECD member, confirming that South
Korea has the ability and preparedness to fulfil the obligations
required as an OECD member country.
</P>
<P>
"We will try to respect the three major OECD ideas of multiple
democracy, the operation of economy based on market principles and
human rights and other membership obligations," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea applied for OECD membership in March last year and
has since undergone extensive OECD examinations on many of its
areas such as banking, finance, environment, employment and labor,
and trade.
</P>
<P>
When South Korea joins the organization of industrialized
countries within this year as expected after going through
required domestic procedures, it will be the 29th OECD member
country and the third nation to join it this year after Hungary
and Poland.

<HEADLINE> Tax Collection Top Priority for Russia: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Tax collection is now a top
priority in Russia, Russian Economics Minister Yevgeni Yasin said
today, as he admitted that the country's economic situation is
gloomy.
</P>
<P>
Yasin was addressing the lower house of parliament which is
meeting to debate the government's austere draft budget for 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry supported the idea of shifting the burden
of tax collection away from enterprises and increasing penalties
on people who evade paying tax.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, President Boris Yeltsin, who is in a
sanatorium preparing for heart surgery, announced the creation of
a special commission headed by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
to ensure taxes are collected, oversee customs and tax services,
and make sure budget funds are spent correctly.
</P>
<P>
The economics minister said improving tax collection and
tightening up on tax evasion were essential if economic reform and
growth are to be realized.
</P>
<P>
Tax evasion is threatening the government's budget. Tax
revenues were only 75 percent of target levels in the first nine
months of the year. With the government already cutting spending
severely, priority has fallen on raising tax collection in a
country where evasion is a national pastime.
</P>
<P>
Yasin admitted that the acute economic crisis facing the
country had made the current time a "difficult phase in the
transition period" to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production had slumped 6 percent so far this year,
non-payment of wages is running at about 80 billion U.S. dollars
and the government is facing a budget deficit of about 17 billion
dollars, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The economic situation looks difficult on the whole," Yasin
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed to the year's economic achievements --
inflation has been brought under control, down from 130 percent in
1995 to an expected 19 percent by the end of this year; the
volatile rouble has been stabilized; substantial hard currency
reserves have been created and there has been a persistent
positive balance of trade.
</P>
<P>
A situation, favorable for a rebound, is shaping up in the
economy," said Yasin, citing the "readiness of many enterprises to
work under new market conditions."

<HEADLINE> New Caledonian Party Rejects French Proposal on Negotiation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Kanak Socialist National
Liberation Front (FLNKS), the mainstream independence movement of
the South Pacific island of New Caledonia, today rejected a
working document by France for new talks over the French colony's
future status.
</P>
<P>
Talks between the FLNKS and France broke off in April after the
FLNKS pulled out, accusing French Prime Minister Alain Juppe of
trying to indefinitely delay the island's independence process.
</P>
<P>
The FLNKS reaffirmed in a communique its will to negotiate an
irreversible process for the colony's accession to independence
and France's renunciation of its rights to mineral resources to a
proposed nickel factory on the island.
</P>
<P>
The political bureau of the FLNKS, which held a meeting today
in Kone, 270 kilometers north of the New Caledonian capital
Noumea, said that the working document submitted by France last
month only reflected the position of the French government.
</P>
<P>
It said that the document, whose contents have not been
revealed, cannot "in any case make up the basis for negotiation on
the country's future."
</P>
<P>
The FLNKS plans to set up a 5 billion franc (1 billion U.S.
dollars) nickel processing factory with the Canadian company
Falconbridge, through exploiting a nickel ore mine owned by the
French government in the north of the island.
</P>
<P>
The French government has so far refused to let FLNKS use the
nickel ore, although its minister for overseas territories,
Jean-Jacques de Peretti, agreed in principle to the plan during
his visit in the island in July, and Prime Minister Alain Juppe
also said that he did not oppose the project.
</P>
<P>
The FLNKS has rejected France's plan to impose a local French
state-owned company, ERAMET, as a partner in the project.
</P>
<P>
Late French President Francois Mitterrand agreed in principle
to the launching of an independence process in the French
territory in 1988 after the militant wing of the FLNKS launched a
series of attacks on French police forces on the island.
</P>
<P>
The FLNKS this week decided on a 12-point framework for
negotiating with the French government to settle once for all "the
colonial dispute between the Kanak people and French state,
created by the unilateral taking into possession of the Kanak
country (by France) in 1853."
</P>
<P>
The FLNKS, the moderate wing of the independence movement, has
also asked for the status of an "associate state" with France
after independence whereby France would be responsible for
security, law and order and currency for 10 to 18 years.
</P>
<P>
New Caledonia, with a population of under 200,000 has a strong
indigenous Kanak population which has driven the island's
independence movement.

<HEADLINE> France Warns Afghan Taliban Over Women's Rights </HEADLINE>

<P>
PARIS, October 11 (Xinhua) -- France today warned the Afghan
Taliban Islamic Militia against violating the rights of women,
after the group imposed a strict Islamic Sharia law banning women
from working and going to school.
</P>
<P>
France is "profoundly attached to the respect of human rights,
and the condition of women in particular," said Foreign Ministry
spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
But he said France would continue to provide humanitarian aid
to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia movement, which has been fighting
government forces in Afghanistan since it appeared in 1994, took
control of the the capital Kabul two weeks ago, and formed a
provisional government. But the group is still fighting
government forces in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
France renewed its call for a ceasefire and the start of
dialogue between the warring factions in Afghanistan, "in the
perspective of a necessary national reconciliation and the forming
of a government representative of all parties," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban have imposed strict separation of men and women on
buses and other public places, and has even banned women from
leaving home except out of absolute necessity.
</P>
<P>
Buses in the Afghan capital were also ordered to stop running
five times during the day to allow people go to pray in the
mosques.

<P>
KAMPALA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- More than 150 school girls
were abducted by Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) Rebels after a raid
on a school at Apac district in northern Uganda on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today said the rebels killed two
policemen and took the girls aged between 12 and 18 away from St.
Mary's School, but so far only seven of them have escaped.
</P>
<P>
In another development, pressure due to heavy deployment of
government troops around Gulu and Kitgum districts in northern
Uganda has forced a rebels group to surrender.
</P>
<P>
The group of 200 rebels led by Otti Lagony have run short of
supplies, and the supplies brought by some 250 rebels from Sudan
recently could not cross to Gulu because of the army deployment
there.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Lagony and LRA leader Joseph Kony disagree over
their war strategy with Kony emphasizing superstition which
Lagony has opposed to.

<HEADLINE> First Private TV to Be On Air in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Shangrila Channel is to
become the first TV broadcaster in the private sector in Nepal
when it begins to transmit programs in Nepali language next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The channel, a private company, will start to telecast one hour
 morning program every day on a trial basis at the beginning as
permitted by the government.
</P>
<P>
According to company officials, the programs on the channel
would be telecast only after being censored by the Ministry of
Information.
</P>
<P>
The Shangrila Channel has a plan to link up with satellites and
expand its airing time to 12 hours daily within one year, company
chairman Nir Bikram Shah said.
</P>
<P>
The initial transmitting capacity of the channel could cover an
area of 20 kilometers from its transmitting station in Kathmandu,
he said.
</P>
<P>
After the channel's uplink to satellites, the Shangrila's
Nepali programs could be watched from every corner of the world,
he told reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to him, his channel will be a pay channel as the
income of advertisements and sponsorship from Nepal's relatively
small market is not adequate for the company's operation.
</P>
<P>
Shangrila, a long-time cable TV operator for relay transmission
of international channels in Nepal, has recently pulled out from
two pay channels -- the Star Movies and Zee Movies, a Hindi movie
channel, due to huge subscription fees, the chairman said.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Expecting Grain Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province in northeast
China is expecting a bumper harvest for 1996, despite problems
caused by serious flooding over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the province's total output for
the year is expected to reach 32 billion kg, a rise of four
billion kg compared with the 1995 figure.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, every person in the industrial province, which
has a population of 40 million and formerly relied on grain
transfer from outside areas, will have 50 kg more grain than last
year, bringing the per capita grain quota to 450 kg.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that in the past, local governments at
various levels have attached priority to agriculture and have
increased investment in farming.
</P>
<P>
This year, the province has channeled 1.58 billion yuan into
farming, a rise of 20 percent compared with the figure of last
year, including 500 million yuan for rebuilding farmland and
agricultural facilities damaged by floods.
</P>
<P>
The province has taken measures to strengthen management of
agricultural work, including the supervision of the seed market
and the circulation orders of commodities for agricultural use. It
has also adopted measures to encourage more people to turn to
farming on a fairly large scale by providing them with
low-interest loans and an adequate supply of agricultural
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Local governments at all levels and related departments have
sponsored 11,000 training courses, and helped three million local
farmers receive training in scientific farming, which has proved
effective in raising per unit yield of the farmland.
