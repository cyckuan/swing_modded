<HEADLINE> Minister: France Not to Take Side in Congo War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Daniel Vaillant, French minister
for relations with parliament, said Wednesday that France will not
take sides in the on-going war in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC).
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to what could be said, France does not interfere or
express its preference. France does not choose camps or play a
particular or partisan role in this affair," he said.
</P>
<P>
But France wishes to see the emergence in the region,
particularly in ex-Zaire, of a "respectable but not Ubuesque
government that has a form of legitimacy, knows how to listen to
the people and to take them into account," he said.
</P>
<P>
He quoted French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin as saying on
Wednesday that France hopes some "real governments" would come up
in the Great Lakes region of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Jospin told a cabinet meeting that if real governments could
emerge in that region, it would be "a gleam of hope," said
Vaillant.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister and the government hope that an
international action can exert pressure so that in this region,
solid, serious, respectable governments that know how to listen
to the people and preserve the population, could become the
reality," Vaillant said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that France is worried about outside
interference and "overlapping" of difference forces in the
Great Lakes region.

<HEADLINE> Botswana Not to Support Intervention in Congo: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Botswana was adopting a
wait-and-see attitude over events in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC), and was unlikely to support any military action
against rebel forces there, an official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The situation of the DRC versus the 14-member states of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) was confusing,
South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted Botswana's
permanent secretary for foreign affairs, Ernest Mpofu, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Botswana had not been involved in events to date. It had been
invited to a meeting in Zimbabwe on Tuesday at which a decision
was taken to sent assistance to DRC President Laurent Kabila, but
had attended only at ambassadorial level, Mpofu said.
</P>
<P>
"The decision was taken without us."
</P>
<P>
"There was no way our representative could have committed
himself. We would not want any SADC country to become involved in
the take-over of the government... by force."
</P>
<P>
He said the best solution would not necessarily be
intervention by a regional force, but by international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
"I doubt if we would want to be involved. With such a complex
situation the best thing is to involve the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
"Botswana has been involved in peace-keeping exercises before,
but I am not sure that this is a peace-keeping exercise," he
said.

WUHAN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's Liberation
Army (PLA) today air-dropped 3,000 officers and soldiers
into Wuhan to fight the upcoming sixth flood crest.
</P>
<P>
The officers and men, who came from central China's Henan
Province, were air-dropped by 14 airplanes at noon today.
</P>
<P>
So far, the number of PLA soldiers and armed police fighting
floods on the Yangtze River dikes have increased to 150,000, said
a PLA commander directing the anti-flood battle on the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
During the past three days, the military area commands of
Guangzhou and Jinan have sent emergency troops to reinforce
the Yangtze dikes as many sections are in danger of breaches as a
result of swollen water and flood-weakened dikes.

<HEADLINE> Africa's Rhino Grows in Number </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Conservation efforts in several
African countries have helped add more than 1,000 rhinos to the
total population of the black and white rhinoceros' population.
</P>
<P>
The good news was released Wednesday by the World Wide Fund for
Nature (WWF) and the World Conservation Union (IUCN).
</P>
<P>
The total number of rhinos rose to 11,065 in 1997 from a
previous estimate of 9,971 in 1995. The species suffered a severe
reduction from around 65,000 in 1970 to just over 2,000 in the
mid-1990's, said the WWF in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The number of black rhinos rose to a new total of 2,599 in
1997 from 2,408 in 1995; the total population of white
rhino rose to about 8,466 in 1997 from 7,563 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"It may not seem a very large increase, but when you take into
consideration the difficulties in dealing with illegal hunting
over large areas, this is definitely good news," explained Dr.
Holly Dublin, chair of the WWF African Rhino Working Group.
</P>
<P>
"These figures are a sign that Africa's rhinos are not lost and
can be conserved if adequate safeguards and conservation
strategies are set in place and strengthened in the countries
where rhinos still exist," Dublin said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Flood Coping With Life in Temporary Shelters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Though millions of Chinese flood
victims are homeless, their basic daily needs have been ensured,
according to government officials.
</P>
<P>
More than 470,000 residents in Qiqihar, a heavy industrial
center in northernmost Heilongjiang Province, were evacuated
before floods reached their hometown, according to a city official.
</P>
<P>
Most of those evacuated are either living with relatives or
sharing the homes of strangers in urban areas, the Qiqihar
official said. Some 120,000 have built temporary shelters in the
open country, he said, adding that they are living a normal life
and remain calm.
</P>
<P>
The flood relief headquarters in Qiqihar has set up six special
groups to take charge of such duties as collecting relief
materials, transportation, disease prevention and public
security. These groups have distributed 6.26 million yuan of
grain, edible oil, plastic sheeting, clothing and medicine to
flood victims.
</P>
<P>
The city's industrial and commercial department has provided
3,100 tons of steamed buns daily since Aug. 12 to flood-affected
areas and ordered the quick production of 1,000 cotton quilts, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Liu Haisheng, mayor of Qiqihar, on Monday visited 290
households in temporary shelters built on the three hills outside
Banla Village. He met with the displaced people and inquired about
their lives. The mayor also delivered 50 tons of dried noodles and
200 gas stoves, and promised to bring them more dried noodles,
edible oil, salt and stoves.
</P>
<P>
One middle-aged woman tearfully said that she is grateful to
the Communist Party and the government. When the flood recedes,
she said, she and her fellow villagers will sell more grain to the
state to return their thanks.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the government of Yueyang, where the
Yangtze meets the Dongting Lake, has delivered 700 tons of rice,
110,000 articles of clothing and 7 million yuan of medicine to
flooded areas, according to a local civil service official.
</P>
<P>
All 220,000 local people stranded by floods have been evacuated
to safer places, the official said, adding that their daily meals
include rice, vegetables and meat. Drinking water has been shipped
from other parts of China, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Medical centers and toilet facilities have been set up near the
shelters, said Zhou Changgong, mayor of Yueyang. Doctors from
Beijing are treating 700 patients a day while visiting the
temporary shelters, the mayor said. The city also sent 487 medical
teams to patrol the Yangtze embankments, he said.
</P>
<P>
Medical teams have inoculated 50,000 flood victims against
disease and distributed snail fever medicine to 600,000 people,
Zhou said, adding that their efforts have helped curb the spread
of intestinal infectious diseases.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Punish Officials Responsible for Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister
Abdul-Salam Majali said on Wednesday that any officials who are
found responsible for the July tap water pollution in the capital
will be punished.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian official news agency Petra quoted Majali as
saying that the punitive measures would be taken after he studies
the investigation report presented to him Wednesday by a special
committee that investigated the pollution.
</P>
<P>
The special commission was formed by the government on August 4
to see into the water pollution.
</P>
<P>
Majali did not reveal the contents of the 100-page report
presented by the committee, but he said that it contained "lengthy
and accurate" details of the incident.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would handle the issue "very attentively"
according to the directives of King Hussein and Crown Prince
Hassan.
</P>
<P>
In early July, the tap water in western part of the capital
became foul-smelling and murky, leading to the hospitalization of
some residents who suffered from diarrhea and nausea-related
diseases after drinking the water.
</P>
<P>
This caused panic and sparked widespread protests from the
residents, the parliament and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Water and Irrigation Munther Haddadin resigned on
August 10 to shoulder the responsibility for the pollution. And
Majali himself has also offered resignation due to the pollution
incident.

<HEADLINE> Wuhan Faces Daunting Flood-Control Task </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- This capital of central China's
Hubei Province now faces a daunting task in flood control as the
water level of the part of Yangtze River running through the city
reached new heights.
</P>
<P>
The water level of the Yangtze River measured at Wuhan Pass in
Wuhan was 29.41 meters at 8 p.m. today, 1.13 meters higher than
the official warning line.
</P>
<P>
The latest water level, which rose by 0.13 meters between
Tuesday night and tonight, is also two centimeters higher than the
second all-time high reported earlier this month when the fourth
flood crest passed through Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
An official forecast by the Yangtze River Water Resources
Committee said that the water level is expected to rise to 29.47
meters, the highest this year, when the sixth flood crest passes
through Wuhan on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze's water flow reached 72,100 cubic meters per second
at 8 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
The flood-control headquarters of Wuhan tonight ordered a
closer watch of the flood situation and warned that the major
embankment must be protected at all cost.
</P>
<P>
More than 180,000 civilians and soldiers are working to protect
the major embankment, while another 80,000 people have been
mobilized and more than 2,000 vehicles and 100 vessels are
prepared to fight against flooding risks.
</P>
<P>
In a similar development, flooding of Dongting Lake, one of
China's two major lakes in central Hunan Province, worsened today
as a result of the arrival of the sixth flood crest of the Yangtze
River and of renewed torrential rains in the valleys of two local
rivers.
</P>
<P>
The water level along a 1,500-kilometer-long embankment of the
lake today exceeded the historic high.
</P>
<P>
Some 13,500 people of the military forces have been dispatched
to the endangered sections of the embankment to counter floods,
raising to nearly 30,000 the number of officers and soldiers
fighting floods in the lake area, according to a provincial
official.
</P>
<P>
To guard against the worst possibilities, all old, physically
weak, sick and handicapped people were relocated to safety by the
start of today, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Bank Bails out Local Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe
Wednesday came into the market to save the Zimbabwean Dollar
which had come under renewed pressure from importers.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Foreign Exchange Association of Zimbabwe
Zibusiso Nkomo said that the pressure on the local currency began
Tuesday and went on until Wednesday morning when the central bank
intervened.
</P>
<P>
"It is being caused by demand," Nkomo said, "The importers are
back."
</P>
<P>
At one time the Zimbabwean Dollar was trading at between 21.85
and 22.85 to the U.S. Dollar but the reserve bank's intervention
saw it coming down to 20.80 and 22.10.
</P>
<P>
"That is where it closed at today. In other words, the
intervention has assisted... I do not know what will happen
tomorrow," the Zimbabwe News Agency quoted Nkomo as saying.
</P>
<P>
The local unit fell by 12.5 percent against the U.S. Dollar
two weeks ago and traders blamed the central bank for failing to
come into the market on time.
</P>
<P>
But the Reserve Bank said that the Zimbabwean Dollar had been
attacked by speculators and hiked the rediscount rate by three
percentage points to defend it.

LONDON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Despite comparatively higher
prices than elsewhere, people in Britain spend more on compact
discs than any other nation, according to the latest figures
compiled by the music industry, which shows that the average
Briton buys four albums a year.
</P>
<P>
The figures also show that consumers in Europe are buying more
European music than ever before. Although the European market is
growing more slowly than other countries, Europe still represents
a third of all music sales in the world, according to the
International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.
</P>
<P>
Figures also showed that more and more Europeans are buying
homegrown tunes - 42 percent of sales in the past year were by
European artists, the highest-ever level.
</P>

Last month the UK's Consumers' Association magazine revealed
that CDs in Britain cost far more than those sold in other
countries. However, this has not deterred millions of Britain's

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Opposition Leader Hails Egypt's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A leading Sudanese opposition
leader Wednesday hailed Egypt's intensified efforts to mediate
between the Khartoum government and opposition parties in a bid to
end the 15-year civil war in its southern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak el-Mahdi, secretary general of the Sudanese National
Democratic Alliance (NDA) told a press conference here that said
Cairo's active involvement has lent an "African, Arab dimension
to" the current mediation efforts to end the fighting in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrea-based NDA, which groups all opposition factions
from northern and southern Sudan, held a three-day meeting here
under the host of Egypt since last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that Egypt, which is at odds with the
Khartoum government over border dispute, has hosted such meeting.
Egypt has accused Sudan of harboring Muslim militants and demanded
the extradition of the Sudanese suspects involved in the
assassination attempt on Mubarak in Addis Ababa in 1995.
</P>
<P>
But Khartoum charged Cairo for interfering in its internal
affair for hosting its opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt is raising profile of its involvement," said Mahdi, who
underscored the importance of Egyptian role in ending the Sudanese
conflict and its bearing on Egypt's national security.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has kept a low profile in the Sudanese conflict but is
apparently adjusting the stance as fighting between the Sudanese
government and rebels is escalating and the famine crisis in
southern Sudan deepening.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with major Sudanese opposition leaders last
Wednesday, Mubarak reiterated the necessity of ending fightings
and urged the Sudanese leadership to exert serious efforts to
attain Sudan's territorial integrity and unity.
</P>
<P>
The war between the government troops and rebels forces
fighting for autonomy in southern Sudan, combined with famine, has
claimed over 1.5 million lives since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Mahdi, renewing the opposition's commitment to maintaining
Sudan's unity and territorial integrity, urged more neighboring
countries to join the "unified mediation efforts" led by Egypt.
</P>
<P>
But he said Egypt should cooperate with other concerned
countries and work through the framework of the Inter-governmental
Authority for Development (IGAD).
</P>
<P>
The latest NDA conference in Cairo was held after the collapse
of the initiative made by the IGAD to arrange a reconciliation
between the Khartoum government and the opposition alliance during
talks in Ethiopia early this month.
</P>
<P>
The second NDA meeting is slated for September 26 in Asmara,
Eritrea, to resume discussions and preparation for a statement
on the future of Sudan.

<HEADLINE> Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Senior Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat rebutted Wednesday the statement made by a senior
Israeli minister that Israel has accepted the U.S. initiative
calling for a 13 percent West Bank withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Erekat was quoted by the Voice of Palestine radio as saying
that that it was not true that Israel will soon reach an
agreement with the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) on Israeli
troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on the remarks made Tuesday by the hawkish
Israeli National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon that Israel
has agreed to implement the U.S. plan and withdraw from an
additional 13 percent of the West bank.
</P>
<P>
Sharon revealed that Israeli government, against his
opposition, had also decided to carry out a further 1 percent West
Bank pullback in the third and last stage of redeployment. But he
blamed the Palestinians for simply seeking excuses to refuse to
sign a redeployment agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said all these statements were "maneuvers and games."
</P>
<P>
"All these statements are part of Israeli internal
disagreements on troop redeployment and aimed only at scoring
points," Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
He said he still refused to resume talks with the Israeli side
who continues its disrespect to the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
The PNA and Israel resumed direct talks on the West Bank
redeployment on July 19, but have failed to produce concrete
results so far due to the dispute over the content of the next
pullback.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the Israeli side proposed to have a 13
percent withdrawal, 3 percent of which should be made nature
reserves where the Palestinians could neither police nor build.
</P>
<P>
This proposal was rejected by the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Illan, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
communication director, said on Tuesday that Israel was still
interested in the nature reserve concept.

NEW DELHI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 200 people were
injured, some of them critically, when an overcrowded gallery at a
sports ground in Calcutta, the largest city in eastern India,
collapsed on Wednesday, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
The gallery collapsed barely 20 minutes into a football match
at the Mohammedan Sports Ground. Nearly 10,000 spectators were
watching the Calcutta supper division league tie between
Mohammedan Sporting Club and Peerless, PTI said.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a police officer, PTI said that irate fans set the
gallery and the press box on fire, reducing them to ashes, and
ransacked the club tent nearby.

<P>
Rapid Action Force personnel rushed to the spot and made a
lathi charge to bring the situation under control as the players
were escorted to safety, said PTI.
</P>
<P>
Police and the fire brigade personnel rushed the injured to
nearby hospitals.

The state government of West Bengal has ordered a high-level

banditry in Mogadishu and its surrounding areas to curb the

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Syria Hold Oil Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Oil Minister Amir
Mohammed Rasheed held talks here Wednesday with his visiting
Syrian counterpart Mohammed Mohammed Mahir Jamal to discuss
enhancing cooperation in the oil sector.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers mainly discussed the executive plans of the
joint agreement on oil cooperation that was signed in last July
during Rasheed's Damascus trip.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two sides agreed to reopen the
pipelines from Iraq's northern oil fields in Kirkuk to the Syrian
port city Banias, and to construct a new pipeline with greater
capacity to meet Iraq's exporting requirements in the future.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian minister and his delegation arrived in Baghdad
Tuesday afternoon for a three-day visit to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time in 18 years that a Syrian oil minister
has paid an official visit to Iraq. During the Iran-Iraq War
between 1980 and 1988), Syria sided with Iran.
</P>
<P>
After their talks, Rasheed said that the date for resuming the
exports of Iraqi oil via the Syrian Port of Banias had not yet
fixed.
</P>
<P>
The United States has expressed opposition to the Iraqi-Syrian
agreement on the reopening and construction of pipelines, saying
the agreement should have the approval of the U.N. Sanctions
Committee first.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Iraqi Finance Minister Hikmat al-Azzawi also
met the Syrian minister and discussed means of further developing
bilateral economic relations.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Says No to Oslo's 5th Anniversary Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has turned down an invitation to attend a meeting in
Norway next week to mark the fifth anniversary of the Oslo Accords.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported Wednesday that Norwegian foreign minister
on Tuesday personally requested that Netanyahu attend the meeting,
but Netanyahu said he was too busy to go to Norway.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Illan, media adviser to Netanyahu, also said the
prime minister had to deal with "more important things" in Israel
at the present time.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Netanyahu said he did not intend to travel to the
birth place of the Oslo Accords since he had no part in the
historic peace agreements. But he reportedly would send his
diplomatic advisor Uzi Arad to take part in the commemoration.
</P>
<P>
The question was in fact cropping up earlier this month when
the Norwegian government invited Netanyahu to attend the
celebrations. An aide to the prime minister said then that
Netanyahu "thought it would not look good if he attended, when
the Oslo work is not completed here."
</P>
<P>
Both Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat and
former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres are planning to attend
and scheduled to speak at the meeting to be held in Oslo next
Monday. U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross would also
participate, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
Following months of secret talks held in Oslo, the Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators reached agreement on August 20 of 1993 on
principles of Palestinian self-rule, widely-known later as the
Oslo Accords which started the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Since their signing in September in 1993, Netanyahu has
regularly attacked the Oslo Accords but has grudgingly reiterated
commitment to carry them forward.
</P>
<P>
Israel is still at loggerheads with the Palestinians over its
withdrawal from the West Bank, although the two sides should have
moved forward to final-status talks two years ago according to the
Oslo Accords.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Regional Split over Military Aid to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Southern African countries
Wednesday appeared to be divided over military assistance to the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to help it end the turmoil in
the third biggest central African country in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe said Wednesday that the Southern African Development
Community (SADC), the 14-nation regional economic bloc, would
provide military aid to DRC President Laurent Kabila to fight
against the rebels, who Kabila claims are backed by Rwanda and
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
This was contradictory to gestures of South Africa, which is
currently busy maneuvering a possible political solution to the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo and Defense Minister
Joe Modise are on the second day of a peace-seeking mission to
Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Nzo told British Broadcasting Corporation that "we are not
thinking in terms of any intervention force at the moment."
</P>
<P>
The situation in the DRC is worsening rapidly as the Tutsi-led
rebels advance closer to capital Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
"All the political forces should be brought together to look
at how to bring about a stable political solution in that
country," said the South African foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Nzo and Modise were expected to discuss with the Rwandan and
Ugandan governments about the charges of invasion made by Kabila,
as well as "broader problems in that area."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Defense Minister Moven Mahachi said on Zimbabwe's
state radio Wednesday that southern African countries agreed
unanimously to send troops and arms to help Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi's statement followed a meeting Tuesday in Harare,
where defense ministers and high commissioners from nine of the
SADC members discussed the situation in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that the rebel force is supported from
Uganda and Rwanda," Mahachi said. "It became very clear to us
that our sister country (Democratic Congo) has been invaded.
Therefore, we have to support the appeal for assistance."
</P>
<P>
The DRC was accepted as the 14th member of the SADC last year,
largely at Zimbabwe's insistence.
</P>
<P>
"It was unanimously agreed that we must, with urgency, make
sure practical assistance, both material and manpower, is given
to the DRC in order to restore peace and stability," Mahachi
said.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that the people of (Democratic) Congo
support President Kabila," Mahachi said. "We are convinced that
our intention is to stop the fighting."
</P>
<P>
But he said no decision had been taken on what strengths would
be sent into the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Hours earlier, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe announced
that the SADC would help the DRC overcome rebel forces wishing to
oust Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's announcement of a general SADC agreement on
military intervention was considered to be rather quick as no
SADC summit had been held on this issue.
</P>
<P>
The Tuesday meeting was reportedly attended only by four full
defense ministers, from Zimbabwe, Zambia, Namibia and Mozambique
apart from Congo. Also present were Angola's deputy defense
minister, high commissioners of Botswana and Tanzania, and South
Africa's deputy high commissioner.
</P>
<P>
Botswana's Permanent Secretary for Foreign Affairs Ernest
Mpofu, who was invited to the meeting in Harare, said Wednesday
that the decision on military aid to Democratic Congo was taken
without consulting Botswanan representatives.
</P>
<P>
"The decision was taken without us," Mpofu said. "There was no
way our representative could have committed himself."
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela, who chairs the SADC,
said in Johannesburg Wednesday that Pretoria did not refer to any
decision to provide military aid to the DRC.
</P>
<P>
He said former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere phoned him
Tuesday and made certain appeals to him. "I will now be
discussing it with other heads of state," he said, declining to
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, South African Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad
made it clear that his country did not believe a military
solution was possible. He called for restraint in the actions of
the fighting sections in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Botswana said it was adopting a wait-and-see
attitude, but was unlikely to support military action against the
rebels.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Wednesday urged parties in Tajikistan to
increase their efforts to fully implement the peace agreement
reached between them.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the Council reviewed U.N.
Secretary-General's latest report on the situation in the country,
the Current Council President Danilo Turk said through some
progress had been achieved in the process of Tajikistan's national
reconciliation, the situation there remained unstable.
</P>
<P>
The members of the Council called upon the parties concerned to
make good use of the continuing international backing for the
peace process of the country and urged them to refrain form any
actions that were contrary to the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Council welcomed U.N. Secretary-General's intention to take
additional steps to ensure the safety of U.N. mission there and
reiterated that the main responsibility for the security of U.N.
mission lies within the Tajik parties.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also urged the Government of Tajikistan
and the United Tajik Opposition to take steps to accelerate the
investigation of the murder of four members of U.N. mission on
July 20 and bring those responsible for the murder to justice as
soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Russians' Real Income Down 9 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Russians' real income, or
after-tax income adjusted for inflation, during the first seven
months went down by 8.9 percent as compared with the same period
last year, the State Statistics Committee said.
</P>
<P>
The downward trend is set to pick up in the coming months as a
devalued ruble pushes prices up and fuels inflation, observers
say.
</P>
<P>
The nominal income, or the residents' pre-tax income without
inflation adjustment, fell 1.6 percent, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The average money income in July was 906.6 rubles (about 130
U.S. dollars according to the latest official exchange rate), 4
percent down from July 1997. If inflation and mandatory payments
were considered, the real money income last month dropped 8.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
About 32.1 million people, or 21.8 percent of the total
population, were living below subsistence level last month, up
from July 1997's 29.8 million people, or 20.2 percent of total
population.
</P>
<P>
The latest monthly subsistence wage, which changes from month
to month, was 438 rubles (about 63 dollars) in July. The average
monthly subsistence wage in January-July was 430 rubles (61.5
dollars) against 412 rubles (59 dollars) of the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russia's wage arrears totalled 75,844
million rubles (10,850 million dollars) in 10 basic industries on
August 1, up 6.5 percent from the beginning of July, the State
Statistics Committee said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Unpaid wages increased 4.4 percent in the production industries
and 14.9 percent in the social sphere.
</P>
<P>
The debt consists of amounts to be paid from the state budget
and by the enterprises, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The sharpest increases in wage arrears was registered in the
public health, culture and arts, and the education sectors, at
33.9 percent, 28.4 percent and 16.6 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The lower standard of living for the Russians would fuel
discontent and threaten social stability, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey taken in mid-August, 65 percent of
Russians believed the government, in implementing reforms, "can no
longer count on people's patience," Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear if the survey was taken before or after August
17, the day when the government raised the ceiling of the ruble
exchange corridor to 9.5 rubles to the dollar from 6.3 rubles to
the dollar. Nor was it known how many people were polled in the
survey.
</P>
<P>
Nugzar Betaneli, director of the Sociology and Parliamentarism
Institute which conducted the poll, said the number of Russians
"inclined to express their protest in some form" was on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Twelve percent of the respondents expressed readiness to join
strikes, 11 percent would take part in armed insurrection, 8
percent would block automobile and railroads and 6 percent might
choose to seize enterprises, organizations and offices, the poll
results show.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 43 percent of the respondents said they support the
recent railroad blockades by coal miners in the Urals and Siberia.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 44 percent of those polled said they view Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko's performance "rather negatively". Only
27 percent of those surveyed saw his activity "rather positively".
</P>
<P>
Only 8 percent of the respondents believe the government's
stabilization program would "improve the economic situation" as
against 37 who said "it would fail to make any impact on the
economy."

<HEADLINE> EU Deeply Concerned Over DRC: Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Union expressed on
Wednesday its concern over the humanitarian situation in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Austria that is serving the rotating
presidency of the 15-nation union, said that the union is "deeply
concerned by the ongoing crisis in the DRC".
</P>
<P>
The union, the statement added, was particularly alarmed by
reports on human rights abuses in the African country.
</P>
<P>
"These reports credibly allege rounding-up, detention, beating,
torture, ethnic propaganda including hate radio broadcasts and in
some cases summary execution of Tutsis and possibly civilians of
other ethnic groups by authorities of the DRC," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The European Union strongly condemned all violations of human
rights and international humanitarian law and urged all parties to
the conflict to take the necessary measures to prevent such
violations and urged security forces to abstain from inciting
ethnic hatred in order to avoid the expansion of the human rights
violations in the region.
</P>
<P>
The union reiterated its support for the principles of
territorial integrity and respect for the sovereignty of the DRC
as well as for its appeal for peaceful solutions to the current
problems so that the process of reconstruction and democratization
can proceed.
</P>
<P>
The central and eastern European countries and Cyprus expressed
their alignment with the stance of the European Union. These
countries are applying for membership of the union.

<HEADLINE> Israel Criticizes PNA for Barring Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel sharply criticized the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) on Wednesday for its barring
the entry into a Jewish holy site in the West Bank city of
Nablus.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, Israeli Prime Minister's Office
said that the PNA's refusal to allow Jews to pray at the Jewish
patriarch Joseph's Tomb in Nablus was a violation of the Oslo
accords.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords, both Israel and the Palestinians will
protect the religious rights of Jews, Christians and Muslims. This
includes protection of holy sites, ensuring free access to the
sites and freedom of worship and religious practice.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after the Palestinian police continued to
blockade the tomb on Wednesday and only allowed food and
beverages to be taken into the site, where 28 Jewish religious
students have remained since last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials decided to close the site last week,
which is inside the Nablus city that was under the PNA control,
after the Jewish students refused to leave the tomb at night.
</P>
<P>
During the Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed in September 1996 that
was sparked by Israel's opening an underground tunnel in East
Jerusalem, the site of Joseph's Tomb witnessed one of the
bloodiest clashes between Israeli troops and Palestinian police
and protesters, during which six Israeli soldiers were killed.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side feared that the students will turn the
tomb into a permanent settlement if they are allowed to remain in
the site 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an Israeli senior defense source was quoted by
Israel Radio as saying that the issue of staying overnight in
the tomb is not detailed in any agreement between Israel and the
PNA.
</P>
<P>
He said the Israeli discussions with the PNA were continuing
and a peaceful solution could be found shortly.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Says to Continue Bid for Iranians' Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan on Wednesday promised
Iran that it would continue its efforts to help secure the release
of the Iranian nationals held by the Afghan Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani ambassador to Iran Javid Husain met with Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi and submitted a written message from
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. No detail of the content
available.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency IRNA, Husain briefed
Kharrazi on Islamabad's efforts in seeking the Iranians' release
from the hands of the Taliban forces.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi expressed dissatisfaction with Islamabad's
"insufficient efforts" and said Pakistan should adopt more serious
measures in view of its "high influence" on the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is believed to have been supporting the Taliban
militia in its swift rise to prominence and sweeping victory over
the opposition Northern Alliances, reportedly supported by Iran.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that a few days prior to Taliban's conquest of
Mazar-e-Sharif, the main stronghold of the opposition forces in
northern Afghanistan, Iran had officially called on Pakistani
government to secure guarantees from the Taliban on the safety of
Iranian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Following contacts with the Taliban, the Pakistani government
gave Iran necessary assurances about the security and safety of
Iranians at the consulate office in the city, he said.
</P>
<P>
Eleven Iranian diplomats, an IRNA correspondent and 35 drivers
were reported captured by Taliban forces storming into the city on
August 8. The Taliban conceded that it had arrested 35 Iranian
drivers, but said it had no information about the whereabouts of
the diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi warned that the issue, if continued, would undoubtedly
leave negative impacts on Tehran-Islamabad ties.
</P>
<P>
Tehran has been putting even greater pressure on Pakistan to
seek an early release of its nationals through diplomatic
channels. But to achieve that goal it also vowed to take "every
action it deems necessary."

NICOSIA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Wednesday protested
against what it called Turkey's military build-up in the
Turkish-Cypriot controlled north of the Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry's Permanent Secretary Alecos Shiambos made oral
representations to the ambassadors or charges d'affaires of the five
United Nations Security Council permanent members of Britain,
China, France, Russia and the United States in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
He showed the diplomats concrete evidences to back the case, an
official press release said.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot Defense Minister Yiannakis Omirou said on Monday that
the Turkish troops in northern Cyprus last week received 50 more
tanks and heavy artillery pieces, which have been deployed in
attack formation.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot government spokesman Christos Stylianides said on
Tuesday that Turkey has been stepping up its military presence in
northern Cyprus since last summer.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island after a
failed coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 the
breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which is only
recognized by Ankara. Turkey is maintaining more than 35,000
troops there to allegedly protect the Turkish Cypriot minorities.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriot-dominated Cypriot government, which is
internationally recognized, maintains a 14,500-strong armed
force.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Angola, Russia Resume Military Coop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A Russian delegation of
ministers headed by Defense Minister Igor Sergueev has signed a
series of pacts on resuming military cooperation with Angola
during their brief tour to Luanda.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreements reached by the two sides on the
cooperation in military technologies, the two states will
establish mixed defense industries so as to help maintain the
weaponry and to transfer military technologies.
</P>
<P>
Russia has agreed to train officers for Angola in order to
improve the battling capacity of the Angolan troops.
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation in military technologies should be made the
locomotive of the cooperation in economy and finance," Sergueev
noted.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Defense Minister Pedro Sebastiao explained that most
of the weapons his troops use have come from Russia.
</P>
<P>
He said Angola should have its arms industries since there are
such joint arms industries in Angola's neighboring countries,
namely the Democratic Republic of Congo, Namibia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Sebastiao also said that Angola's debt of two billion U.S.
Dollars to Russia will not affect the military cooperation
between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Angola's debt to Russia resulted from purchasing weapons from
the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Prime Minister
Franca van-Dunem respectively held talks with the Russian
ministers of defense, fishery, petroleum, and geology and mines.
</P>
<P>
The visit of Russian ministers was aimed at furthering the
traditional friendly relationship between the two nations. In
June this year, President Dos Santos paid a visit to Moscow,
mending the fence with Russia which had backed its war against
UNITA in the 70s and 80s.
</P>
<P>
During the visit which ended Tuesday, the Russian delegation
also signed with their Angolan counterparts protocols of intent
on resuming cooperation in petroleum and fishery. They have
agreed to submit the issue to the binational mixed commission to
convene in Moscow in November this year.
</P>
<P>
Noticeably, the Russian ministers came here as the Angolan
peace process has fallen into the most serious crisis in four
years and the Tutsi-led rebels in eastern part of the Democratic
Republic of Congo are pushing toward the capital Kinshasa.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Urges World Intervention in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa Wednesday urged the international community to intervene
and address the threat to peace and security if the Mideast peace
process collapses.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said in an interview that the peace process is a serious
international issue that has gone beyond a regional crisis, due to
the negative stance of the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Such negative attitude is reflected in Israel's rejection of
all means to break the deadlock in peace talks, including the
Franco-Egyptian idea of holding an international peace conference
to rescue peace, and an American proposal on West Bank withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"But in spite of Israel's balking at a lukewarm American
intervention and other proposals, we must pursue the effort to
make the Egyptian-French initiative a reality," he urged.
</P>
<P>
The joint initiative put forward by Egypt and France came as
Washington failed to persuade Israel to accept its proposal on a
further Israeli withdrawal from 13.1 percent of the West Bank in
return for better Palestinian security guarantees.
</P>
<P>
Moussa went to Paris last month to thrash out the details of
the proposed international conference, which might in the first
stage involves the U.S., the European Union, and other parties
concerned.
</P>
<P>
This initiative does not make it a condition that the parties
directly concerned with the peace process - Israel, Syria and the

It was only one day ago that Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat told Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
during a meeting in Egypt's Mediterranean resort of Mersa Matrouh
that he was frustrated with the failure of Washington to sell its
peace proposal to Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have accepted the American idea and is waiting
for a yes from Israel.

Mubarak and Arafat also discuss means to implement the
Franco-Egyptian initiative.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks were frozen over Israel's
settlement expansion in Arab East Jerusalem and long delays in
troop redeployment. The recent direct contacts between the two
sides fail to make a breakthrough.

BAGHDAD, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Prime Minister Moumeer
Polatovic has expressed the intention of promoting the bilateral
relations with Iraq, the Iraqi News Agency INA reported on

</P>
<P>
Polatovic's expression was contained in a letter to Iraqi

President Taha Yassen Ramadhan by visiting Yugoslav Trade Minister
Vokovic Borislav, the INA said.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Polatovic said that the Yugoslav leadership

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of the
Islamic Conference (OIC) Wednesday called on the world community
to employ greater efforts to revive the stalled Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The OIC made the call in a statement issued by its Secretary
General Ezzidine Laraki at the OIC headquarters in Jeddah, Saudi
Arabia, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The OIC appealed to the international community to shoulder its
responsibility to salvage the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between Israel and its two neighbors Syria and
Lebanon has broken down in early 1996 due to the dispute over the
future of the Golan Heights that Israel captured from Syria in the
1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have also been deadlocked
since March 1997 after the Jewish state began construction of a
Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians
want as the capital of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The talks are currently stuck over the long overdue Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The OIC accused the Israeli government of obstructing the peace
process by resorting to hard-line policy on the peace talks and
plans to judaize Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic organization called for additional efforts to
pressure Israel into carrying out the relevant United Nations
resolutions on the Arab-Israeli conflicts and the status of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
It urged U.N. member states to support the Palestinian people
in their struggle to regain their legitimate rights, including the
establishment of their own state.

<HEADLINE> Museveni Meets With S. African FM on Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni Wednesday met with visiting South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo on issues concerning regional security.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held at State Lodge in the northern district
of Gulu where Museveni is currently on a working visit, according
to a press release from the President's Office.
</P>
<P>
They are said to have held consultative discussions on the
current situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Zimbabwe said the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) will provide military aid to DRC President
Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
As head of the SADC, South African President Nelson Mandela
said the 14-member regional economic bloc is not considering to
help Kabila militarily, adding that he is still pursuing a
peaceful solution to the worsening situation in Congo (k),the
third largest central African country.
</P>
<P>
The situation in DRC deteriorated on August 2 when Tutsi
soldiers in eastern Congo (K) started rebellion against the
Kabila government following his order that Rwandan army return
home. The fighting between the government army and the
Banyamulenge soldiers quickly spread to eastern part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday the rebel Tutsi soldiers claimed that they had
occupied one third of the country and taken Matadi, a city which
serves as the lifeline for the capital Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Kabila blamed the rebellion on neighboring Rwanda and Uganda,
both of which quickly denied.
</P>
<P>
On the deterioration in DRC, southern African countries tend
to adopt widely different attitudes. Some prefer to back Kabila
while others tend to be behind the Tutsi soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Museveni has recently held many discussions on the matter with
foreign delegations and envoys of regional as well as
international organizations.

<HEADLINE> Russian Opposition Calls for Yeltsin's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia's 40 opposition
organizations on Wednesday called for President Boris Yeltsin's
resignation and early presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the organizations, who met in the State Duma
building, would formally present the requests at Friday's meeting
of the Duma, or lower house of parliament, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The Monday financial crisis is a logical climax to the policy
pursued by President Boris Yeltsin over the last seven years,"
said Nikolai Ryzhkov, chairman of the Popular Patriotic Front
Executive Committee and leader of the Popular Rule parliamentary
faction.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the announcement made by the government and
the central bank to raise the ceiling of the ruble's exchange
corridor from 6.3 rubles to the US dollar to 9.5 rubles to the
dollar, which amounted to the devaluation of the national
currency.
</P>
<P>
The Wednesday meeting was also attended by the Union of
Communist Parties, the Russian Communist Workers' Party, the
Socialist People's Party, the Congress of Russian Communities, the
Agrarian Party, and the Movement in Support of the Army.
</P>
<P>
The meeting expressed support for the trade unions' plan to
start "an indefinite protest action" on October 7 in which
Yeltsin's ouster will be the chief political demand.
</P>
<P>
"When the legislators and broad masses of working people join
their efforts, the president can be forced to resign," Communist
Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Denies Zimbabwea's Charges of Invading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda Wednesday denied the
accusations by Zimbabwean Defense Minister Moven Mahachi that
Kigali is supporting the rebels in Democratic Congo (DRC) and
invading Congo, the Rwanda News Agency (RNA) said.
</P>
<P>
"We are surprised by President Robert Mugabe's position with
regard to the conflict in the Congo," a senior Rwandan government
official told RNA Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The official described the allegations by Zimbabwe's Defense
Minister Moven Mohachi as "highly irresponsible and dangerously
inflammatory."
</P>
<P>
Soldiers of Congo's ethnic Tutsi community rebelled on August
in the eastern part, and Kabila accused Rwanda of backing the
rebellion and invading the country.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's declared support to embattled DRC President Laurent
Desire Kabila comes as no surprise in the diplomatic circles in
Kigali, RNA said, in a dispatch to Xinhua based here in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts in the Rwandan capital argue that President
Mugabe's support for Kabila is motivated by personal interests.
</P>
<P>
A veteran African diplomat here has echoed similar suspicions
about Zimbabwe's determination to help President Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat noted that the forces of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) were never used to back the
Congolese rebels fighting to topple late dictator Mobutu Sese
Seko.
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's meeting of SADC ministers of defense, Mahachi
said, "it was unanimously agreed that we must, with urgency, make
sure practical assistance, both material and manpower, is given
to the DRC in order to restore peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
But Botswana said Wednesday that the decision on military aid
to Congo was taken without consulting Botswanan representatives.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela, who chairs the SADC,
said in Johannesburg Wednesday that his country did not refer to
any decision to provide military aid to the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Pretoria did not believe a military solution was possible,
said a South African Foreign Ministry official, who called for
restraint in the actions of the fighting sections in the DRC.

<HEADLINE> UN Takes Steps to Speed Up Iraq's Oil Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations had
recruited two oil experts from Dutch Saybolt firm to help speed up
Iraq's order, receiving and installation of oil equipment, U.N.
spokesman said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council of the United Nations last May authorized
Iraq to sell 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil during the
subsequent six months, the so-called new U.N. oil-for-food
program.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq complained that it did not have the capacity to export
such an amount of oil due to its shabby oil equipment. The Council
last June agreed to allow Iraq to export 300 million U.S. dollars
worth of spare parts to ungrade its dilapidated oil industry.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the two experts would provide
information on the contracts to the Security Council's Sanctions
Committee on Iraq in an effort to speed up the processing of
contracts for spare parts for Iraq's oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said the Council's sanctions committee had received 55
contracts it needed to approve as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
Saybolt, an oil industry consulting firm in the Netherlands,
has advised the United Nations to endorse Iraq's request for a
minimum of 300 U.S. dollars worth of oil equipment to meet the oil
export targets under the new U.N. oil-for-food program.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Urged to Respond to Teachers' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia National Union of
Teachers (ZNUT) appealed to the government Wednesday to respond
quickly to the plight of the untrained teachers working in the
country's remote areas.
</P>
<P>
All untrained teachers manning some schools in remote areas
have not received their salaries for the last eight months, Roy
Mwaba, a ZNUT official, said in a statement released in Lusaka,
according to Zambia News Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
The ZNUT, said Mwaba, wishes to condemn the government's
attitude and insensitivity over the plight of the untrained
teachers countrywide since the government has done nothing to
pay the teachers, forcing most of them to desert their homes in
search food.
</P>
<P>
He described the government's attitude as "immoral" and a
violation of human rights for workers to go for eight months
without being paid their dues in a Christian nation like Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The government is setting a bad precedent to other employers
in the country to start treating their workers in the same way,
Mwaba said.
</P>
<P>
He also deplored the conditions in some schools in remote
areas which are being manned by very few untrained teachers with
no teaching materials and therefore with poor results.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by the union showed that some schools depend
almost entirely on the services of untrained teachers.
</P>
<P>
Mwaba wondered how pupils in examination classes would pass
their examinations, especially in schools being run by only a
head teacher and a single teacher, which is the usual case in the
country's remote areas.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Bill to Raise Electorate Age Opposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran's moderates on Wednesday
voiced strong opposition to a bill proposed by the conservatives
to raise the minimum electorate age from 15 to 16.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Party of Constructive Executives (CEI),
which groups close allies of President Mohammad Khatami, called on
the Majlis (parliament) to drop the bill, which has been approved
by the legislature's commission for Domestic Affairs.
</P>
<P>
It is important for the youth to participate in the third
election of the Experts Assembly slated for October 23, which has
the power to determine the country's supreme leader, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The young people, together with intellectuals and women, played
a decisive role in Khatami's landslide victory in the May 1997
presidential election over his conservative rival, the Majlis
speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri.
</P>
<P>
The CEI said that 15 is considered as the age of maturity in
the religion of Islam and that by raising the age limit, the
conservatives would be contented to see some 1 million young
people deprived of the right to vote for the country's future.
</P>
<P>
The young generation, born after the 1979 Islamic Revolution
which brought the rule of the clergymen, make up more than 50
percent of the country's population.
</P>
<P>
The bill, passed on the eve of the sensitive election of the
Experts Assembly, is seen as a ploy to prevent the moderates from
being elected into the powerful body.
</P>
<P>
To break the conservatives' monopoly of power, the moderates
also have to seek a change in the Guardians Council, which has
been empowered by the election law to screen and thus decide the
qualification of candidates for any elections.
</P>
<P>
The CEI called on different groups to refrain from restricting
the Experts Assembly to factional monopoly, and the Guardians
Council to execute its power impartially.
</P>
<P>
The conservative-dominated council has come under sharp
criticism after it rejected some key candidates of the coalition
of the leftists and the moderates in the mid-term Majlis elections
in March.
</P>
<P>
Over the past months, supporters of the coalition have
repeatedly demanded the divestment of the council's screening
right in order that impartial elections be held.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Calls for Resumption of Cyprus Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. State Department special
coordinator for Cyprus Thomas Miller Wednesday called for a
resumption of the peace talks on the protracted Cyprus problem,
Turkey's official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit
and State Minister Sukru Sina Gurel, Miller said that peace talks
would be effective ways to ease the tension prevailing in the
island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the Mediterranean
island, in the wake of an abortive coup by Greek Cypriots seeking
union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is keeping more than 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus to
protect the Turkish Cypriot minorities.
</P>
<P>
Miller urged the four parties related to the Cyprus issue -
Greece, Greek Cypriots, Turkey and Turkish Cypriots - to make
efforts in finding a framework of dialog aimed at bridging the gap
in key issues.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy arrived here Tuesday on a mission to help ward
off a possible confrontation between Turkey and Greece, both
members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, over Cyprus'
planned deployment of Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
Early last year, Cyprus signed a deal with Russia to buy the
missiles, which will be delivered in November.
</P>
<P>
The missile plan has prompted strong opposition from Turkey and
Turkish Cypriots. Ankara has vowed to take all necessary measures
to prevent the missile deployment.
</P>
<P>
Referring to speculation that the U.S. is pressing Turkey to
accept a no-fly zone over Cyprus, Miller said that he himself is
not aware of such a suggestion.
</P>
<P>
"I am not aware of any proposals of a moratorium. Looking at my
hands, do you see any proposals?" he said.
</P>
<P>
Greece and the Cypriot government dominated by the Greek
Cypriots have expressed support for a plan to create a no-fly zone
over Cyprus to ease tensions.

hard currency control will soon be put in force with a view to
bolstering the country's export.
</P>
<P>
Sufian told the official Ethiopian News Agency that while the
hard currency control is relaxed in the current 1998/99 fiscal
year, the country's export will be prop up, leading to the
increase in the foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
He said the liberalization will avoid unnecessary procedures
exporters had to pass through and make smooth export activities.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks will take over the work of hard currency
control from the National Bank, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that an institution watching export promotion
activities and facilitating the expansion of Ethiopia's foreign
market will soon be set up.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia introduced foreign currency auction system in 1993.
In July, 1996, the government announced to lift some restrictions
on hard currency control, including merchants allowed to deposit
10 percent of the foreign curtrency they earn in their private
accounts and Ethiopiansloweo buy restricted mount of foreign
currency for the purpose of education, medication and
traveling abroad.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Vie for Inter-Africa Coffee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Angola proposed Wednesday to vie
for the secretary-general of Inter-Africa Coffee Organization
(OIAC), bringing the total candidates for the post to six.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan candidate is Josefa Sacko, an engineer and
counselor in the state secretariat for coffee. She will be the
first woman candidate in Africa for the post, the Angola News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Sacko promised that if she is elected, she will make the
organization more vigorous.
</P>
<P>
Africa is one of the main coffee producing areas in the world,
she said, adding with a suggestion that the organization put
forth a new plan to increase productivity and improve the quality
of African coffee.
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old Sacko has obtained a bachelor degree in
agriculture in Nigeria. However, she admitted that the post is a
mere political one, which has nothing to do with production.
</P>
<P>
The other five candidates are from Cameroon, Gabon, Nigeria
and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the election of OIAC chief will be held in
September in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire where the headquarters of the
Organization is based.
</P>
<P>
The OIAC was founded in 1960 in Antananarivo, capital of
Madagascar. It consists Kenya, Uganda, DRC, Cote d'Ivoire, Gabon,
Madagascar, Benin and Angola.
</P>
<P>
Angola used to be a major coffee producer, the world's third
in terms of production. However, due to decades of civil war,
its current production can hardly meet domestic needs.

<HEADLINE> Germany Sees More Poor People in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The number of people who had to get
social welfare aid increased to 2.92 million in Germany by the end
of 1997, up 7.1 percent from a year ago, the German Federal
Statistics Office said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic increase was registered in the poorer eastern
Germany, where the total number of social welfare recipients grew
by 23.9 percent in 1997 compared with an increase of only 4.9
percent in the western half of the country, the latest figures
released by the Wiesbaden-based statistics office showed.
</P>
<P>
German authorities blamed the latest increase in the number of
social welfare recipients mainly to high unemployment in the
country which rose to about 4.5 million by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Among those poor people, 56 percent were women and 44 percent
men, the statistics office said.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Self-Sufficient With Food: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is now self-sufficient
with food although some people are still suffering from hunger
and malnutrition, an agricultural official told Xinhua Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Joseph K. Mukiibi, the Director-General of the National
Agricultural Research Organization, said maize, millet, matoke,
rice are staple food for Ugandans.
</P>
<P>
Rice production has been on the rise in recent years, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Although the total amount of food the country produces is
sufficient for its population, the imbalanced distribution
results in famine and malnutrition in some places, the official
admitted.
</P>
<P>
Lack of storage facilities and food processing factories as
well as poor transport conditions are mainly responsible for the
imbalanced distribution of food.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that Ugandans eat less meat, not only because
the price of meat is very high but also because they just do not
have cattle, sheep or pigs for meat.
</P>
<P>
Cattle in Uganda are considered as property. The more cattle
one possesses, the higher social status he enjoys. So cattle are
kept as an indicator of wealth and in some parts of the country
serve as dowry for a bride.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Canada's Supreme Court to Revive Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Canada is to
release its historic ruling Thursday on whether it would be legal
for Quebec to unilaterally secede from Canada.
</P>
<P>
The ruling is expected to revive the explosive debate and the
possibility that Quebec's pro-independence Parti Quebecois
government will call an election later this fall.
</P>
<P>
The case was brought by Canada's federal government, which
asked the top court for a legal opinion on three questions: Can
Quebec legally declare unilateral independence under domestic law?
Can it be done under international law? And, if there is a
conflict, which law rules?
</P>
<P>
Putting the case to the court was part of Ottawa' get-tough
approach toward separatists in the French-speaking province, which
voted almost itself out of Canada in a 1995 referendum on
independence.
</P>
<P>
The Quebec government has been vehemently opposed to the court
case and has refused to participate, forcing the court to appoint
a Quebec lawyer to argue the sovereigntist side.
</P>
<P>
Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard has criticized Ottawa and the
Supreme Court for interfering with Quebeckers' right to decide
whether to remain in Canada.
</P>
<P>
"This is a unilateral move by the federal government," he said
days before the ruling. "It's not up to the Supreme Court to
decide or limit in any way whatsoever the right of the Quebec
people to choose their future."
</P>
<P>
Most analysts here expect the federally-appointed nine judges
of the top court to rule in Ottawa's favor, even if they had to
nuance their words to try to deny ammunition to the separatists.
</P>
<P>
When the decision is released Thursday, politicians in Ottawa
and Quebec City will be poised to simplify and interpret,
celebrate, denounce or dismiss the judgement, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
"In the short term, it could mean a resurgence of nationalist
excitement and a provincial election; it could be the platform for
an election in Quebec," noted David Cameron, political scientist
at the University of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Premier Bouchard postponed a planned economic tour
of Latin America that was scheduled for November. It is seen as a
sure sign that a Quebec election may be in the making.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Japan to Do More to Open Photo Film Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Wednesday urged Japan to do more to open its photo market as a
way to solve the long-standing issue between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Our report clearly points to the need for more aggressive
action by the Japanese government to ensure that all market access
barriers and practices that unreasonably restrict competition in
this sector are eliminated," said U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky in a statement accompanying the release of a
report by the U.S. Trade Representative Office and the U.S.
Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to press Japan through formal and informal
means to reform its archaic distribution structure and address
practices that unreasonably restrain trade," she added.
</P>
<P>
The United States began monitoring Japan's photo film market
last February after it lost a landmark case in the World Trade
Organization -- the first case it brought and lost at the world
trade body. It was seen as a major setback for U.S. efforts to
open up the Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
After the loss of the case, the United States established the
Monitoring and Enforcement Committee, co-chaired by the U.S.
Trade Representative Office and the Commerce Department, to
review implementation of formal representations made by Japan to
a WTO panel regarding its efforts to ensure the openess of its
market to imports of film. And the U.S. inspection panel made
its first report on the photo film issue.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the availability of foreign photo film
declined slightly in traditional photo speciality stores, which
represents about half of Japan's film market by sales volume,
and competition in that segment of the market continues to be
less robust.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Removes Water Hyacinth With Mechanical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has been mainly using
mechanical means to remove water hyacinth in Lake Victoria as a
protection measure to the environment, an agricultural expert
told Xinhua in Entebbe, south Uganda, Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Mukiibi, an official with the Ministry of Agriculture
based in Entebbe, 45 kms south of capital city Kampala, said Uganda
has compared biological and chemical ways with mechanical ways of
removing the water weed which covers large stretches of the lake
surface.
</P>
<P>
Four machines are being used on the lake surface near Jinja,
some 80 kms east of Kampala and near the capital, he added, with
each machine dragging out some 150 tons of hyacinth every day.
</P>
<P>
Some other methods have been tried, he said. Small insects are
introduced to eat the water weed, but the progress is very slow.
</P>
<P>
There are reportedly some 4,000 hectares of water surface and
70 percent of Uganda's lake shore covered with this weed. It
affects transport across the lake, fishing activities and power
generation.
</P>
<P>
The weed was allegedly flown into River Nile, causing flooding
of Lake Kyoga north of Kampala which displaced 15,000 people in
the area.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian experts have been invited to remove the blockage in
the lake.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Close Off Day's Highs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets lost most
of the day's gains as they closed Wednesday, in response to a
lackluster performance on Wall Street, despite a strong showing
from Asian equities and an improvement in the yen.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 in London enjoyed a late burst of activity to
finish with modest gains, with the index closing 46.1 higher at
5694.3, on moderate volume of 747 million shares.
</P>
<P>
A positive performance on most Asian markets and Wall Street's
strong gains Tuesday made a bullish mood early on, with the FTSE
100 recording a session high of 5,712.8 in late morning.
</P>
<P>
But as U.S. stocks were unable to build on Tuesday's gains,
London was lost in direction in afternoon trade.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said there was still some bearish sentiment about as
Asian concerns continued to figure, despite recent gains in those
markets. Volatility was predicted to continue for some time.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the German Dax slumped near its close, giving up
much of an early 2 percent advance. This underscored analysts'
concerns that the temporary show of strength did not hail a return
of a bull market.
</P>
<P>
At the close, the 30-share, blue-chip Dax index stood at
5,596.41, up 27.53 points or 0.49 percent, below the key 5,600
level and well off its early high of 56,72.07.
</P>
<P>
In electronic trading, which continues for a half hour after
the floor session, the Xetra DAX was virtually unchanged, ending
at 5,601.93, down about one quarter of one point.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, share prices closed off the day's highs, too, falling
back from its early levels late in the session as Wall Street
pared early gains.
</P>
<P>
The CAC 40 index closed 2.47 points higher at 4,125.72, below
the day's high of 4,159.70. August CAC-40 futures closed 26 points
higher at 4,146.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Suggests Unity Government in Guinea Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) has suggested the establishment of a
unity government in Guinea Bissau as a way to solve the country's
political crisis, a report reaching here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Andriene Diop, the spokeswoman for the
ECOWAS, as saying in Banjul, capital of Gambia, that the peace
plan was put to both sides of the conflict in Guinea Bissau
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Diop said the ECOWAS suggested parliamentary elections in
February 1999, with a national unity government until then.
</P>
<P>
It also suggested sending 100 ECOWAS observers to monitor the
ceasefire agreed on July 26.
</P>
<P>
An ECOWAS mediation delegation held separate meeting with the
government of President Joao Bernado Vieira and the rebels led by
dismissed Chief of Defense Staff, Ansumane Mane Monday
and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have been engaged in fierce fightings in several
parts of the country since early June before a ceasefire was
agreed on July 26.
</P>
<P>
The two parties are expected to hold a face-to-face talk
Wednesday in Cape Verde, under the auspices of the Community of
Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP), the report said, adding
that it is their first direct contact since the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
"It is positive that they have not decided to come here
because there cannot be dialog without the people (involved)
being present," Cape Verde Foreign Minister Jose Luis de Jesus
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama, who is in Cape Verde,
said the CPLP and the ECOWAS had agreed to meet within the next
few days to resolve outstanding problems that could impede moves
toward peace in Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, ECOWAS has been asked to steer clear of the crisis in
Guinea Bissau, but it refused on the ground that Guinea Bissau is
a member of the sub-regional body.
</P>
<P>
The rebels had initially rejected any mediation by ECOWAS
because two of its members, Guinea and Senegal, were supporting
President Vieira militarily.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, ECOWAS's peace plan envisages scaling
down the number of troops from the two countries. Enitem

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Says Let Legal Process Work in Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- America should move past the
titillating talk about President Bill Clinton's relationship with
Monica Lewinsky and let the legal process do its job, Speaker Newt
Gingrich of the House of Representatives said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The core of this civilization is the rule of law," Gingrich
told the Gwinnett County Chamber of Commerce in Georgia. "We have
an absolute obligation to ensure the rule of law. I have no
interest in personal scandals."
</P>
<P>
"No one is above the law," The Associated Press quoted Gingrich
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Georgia Republican said he will continue to wait for the
report that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr is expected to
submit to Congress. And he said Congress -- led by the Judiciary
Committee and its chairman, Republican Representative Henry Hyde
-- will review the report in a "dispassionate manner."
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we should go an inch beyond our constitutional
duties, and I don't think we should go an inch less than our
constitutional duties," the speaker said.
</P>
<P>
Congress has "lots to do without all of us being totally
mesmerized," he said, adding that that advice applies to the media
as well.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich suggested they devote 15 minutes of every half hour to
"Monica-less time."
</P>
<P>
"It would make us a much healthier country if the news media
took a pretty big break and just said, `Let's focus on other
things for a while and let Judge Starr continue his job,'"
Gingrich said.

<HEADLINE> Ireland Announces "Draconian" Measures to Omagh Bombers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern
announced "extremely draconion" measures on Wednesday to crack
down on terrorism in the wake of the Omagh bomb attack.
</P>
<P>
"These measures are extremely draconian, but I am not prepared
to take the chance of anything else and these measures have to be
implemented quickly," Ahern was quoted as saying in Dublin after a
cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ahern said Ireland's anti-terrorism laws would restrict the
right to silence of guerrilla suspects and extend the maximum
detention period from 48 to 96 hours before being charged.
</P>
<P>
The new measures were intended to bring to justice the
guerrillas responsible for the Omagh blast last Saturday which
killed 28 people and wounded more than 200.
</P>
<P>
The Irish parliament will be recalled in two weeks time to push
through the new security legislation, Ahern told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The "Real IRA", which has admitted responsibility for the Omagh
attack, declared a ceasefire on Wednesday after Ahern on Tuesday
gave paramilitary groups 24 hours to declare ceasefires or face
the wrath of his government.
</P>
<P>
While welcoming the suspension of military violence, both
Britain and Ireland said the truce would make no difference to
their plans to hunt down on the bombers.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to leave no stone unturned to hunt the men
that did this," Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Urged to Import More Raw Sugar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine food processors and
exporters have asked the government for a special allocation of
20,000 to 30,000 metric tons (MT) raw sugar that could be imported
at zero to 10 percent tariff.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Food Processors and Exporters Organization Inc
(Philfoodex) President Jesus Tanchanco told reporters Thursday
that the volume is separate from the 200,000 MT raw sugar imports
the government hopes to bring in in August and next month.
</P>
<P>
Tanchanco said the sector is also asking for at least zero
percent tariff for proposed volume instead of 65 percent imposed
on minimum access volume (MAV) plus.
</P>
<P>
Low tariff, he said, is expected to provide due advantage for
Philippine sugar-based products as against competitors including
Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"Our members have already slowed down their production,"
Tanchanco said. "Right now, many of them could not get sugar in
the local market."
</P>
<P>
He said the group thus hopes the government could give them the
allocation initially at 10,000 MT as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The sector has not yet received any favorable response to the
request. Concerned agencies including the Sugar Regulatory
Administration are currently studying the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Philfoodex comprises the country's 200 biggest food processors
and exporters.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Flood-Control Workers to Persist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- China today urged soldiers and
civilians to persist to the end in the struggle against the worst
flooding on several major rivers.
</P>
<P>
Flooding on the Yangtze and Songhua rivers evolved to new
historic disaster levels today, according to the State
Headquarters for Flood Control and Drought Relief.
</P>
<P>
"Soldiers and civilians fighting floods on the middle and lower
reaches of the Yangtze and in the Songhua River Valley are now
facing new serious challenges," a headquarters spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Affected by the sixth flood crest of the Yangtze River and the
surging waters in Dongting Lake, the water level of the Yangtze
between Lianhuatang in Yueyang of central Hunan Province and
Wuhan, capital of central Hubei Province, hit this year's high
today.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze's water level measured at Lianhuatang rose to 35.79
meters at 8 p.m. today, up 0.05 meters from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The level of Dongting Lake measured at Chenglingji also reached
35.92 meters, up 0.11 meters from Wednesday, or 0.61 meters higher
than the previous all-time high.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in northeast China, the flood crest of the Songhua
River is passing through Harbin, capital of Heilongjiang
Province. The water level at Harbin reached 120.78 meters at 8
p.m. today, 0.73 meters higher than the previous historic
high. The water flow of 17,300 cubic meters is also an all-time
high.
</P>
<P>
A headquarters expert said that some three million soldiers and
civilians are fighting floods along the Yangtze's major
embankments on the middle and lower reaches. In northeast China,
the number of flood-control people exceeds 900,000.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains are expected in part of the Yangtze River Valley in
the days ahead, while the Songhua River Valley in the northeast is
undergoing a season of torrential rains, according to official
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
"The bad weather in the two flooding areas will further
exacerbate the situation," the expert said, urging flood-control
soldiers and civilians to remain on high alert.
</P>
<P>
"The safety of life and property of people on the middle and
lower reaches of the Yangtze River and of people in the
river-bound areas in northeast China, together with the
achievements of 20 years of reforms and opening-up, now hinge on
our struggle with floods," he said.

<HEADLINE> Young Painters from Mainland Visit HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-one young painters from
Shaanxi province of China's mainland and the same number of
children from Hong Kong here Thursday jointly drew a 120-meter
long picture to show each other what their respective lives are
like.
</P>
<P>
The 61 children from China's mainland, aged between 6 to 10
years old, are members of the Little Swan Arts Group in Xi'an, the
capital city of Shaanxi province. The purpose of their visit to
Hong Kong is to make children in the mainland and Hong Kong know
more about each other's lives, said Li Shao Hua, director of the
group.
</P>
<P>
These little artists have visited many countries and regions as
representatives of China's young artists to exchange their
drawings with the local youngsters.
</P>
<P>
They demonstrated their drawing skills to U.S. President Bill
Clinton during his visit to Xi'an at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
On their way to Hong Kong, they saw the severe floods along the
Yangtze River and contributed some of their drawings and clothes
to children in the flood-hit areas, Li said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Scale Down Use of Dollar in ASEAN Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia expects to use its
currency more widely for trade with its ASEAN partners through
signing bilateral payment agreements (BPA) with them to reduce the
dependence on the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Finance Ministry Deputy Secretary-General (Policy) Abdul Aziz
Mohd Yaacob said Thursday that Malaysia, which has already signed
the BPAs with the Philippines, Vietnam and Laos in the wake of the
regional economic crisis, is negotiating with Thailand to sign a
similar agreement.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and Myanmar have also indicated their interest and it
is expected that the other ASEAN countries would follow suit,
Abdul Aziz said at a seminar in Petaling Jaya near here.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to use regional currencies in intra-ASEAN trade
was made by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and was well
received by ASEAN leaders at their second informal summit held in
Kuala Lumpur last December.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN is Malaysia's largest trading partner with volume
increasing from 29.33 billion U.S. dollars in 1994 to 37.32
billion U.S. dollars in 1996 before declining to 27.46 billion
U.S. dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of Malaysia's trade settlements are conducted
using the U.S. dollar which has appreciated against many
currencies. Only about 15 percent of the trade are in the
Malaysian currency ringgit and 6.5 percent in the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a fair share of Malaysia's trade with Brunei,
Singapore and Thailand was settled using their respective
currencies.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all trade with Myanmar, Vietnam and Laos were settled in
the U.S. dollar which was also used for 97 percent of Malaysia's
exports to and 93 percent of its imports from the Philippines and
for 90 percent imports from and 77 percent exports to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Aziz said the use of ASEAN currencies will enhance trade
within the region because of the reduction in exchange rate
uncertainty and transaction costs as the values of the ASEAN
currencies relative to one another are more stable than in the
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
He said the promotion of intra-ASEAN trade using local
currencies will be a strategic initiative in light of its expected
significant expansion with the creation of the ASEAN Free Trade
Area and the ASEAN Investment Area.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that with the growing acceptance of the BPA
mechanism within ASEAN, the bilateral arrangement can be expanded
into a multi-lateral arrangement.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) groups Brunei,
Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Huaneng Power Company's Net Profit Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The net profit of the Huaneng
Power International, Inc., one of the largest independent power
producers in China, amounted to 801 million (RMB) Yuan (97 million
U.S. dollars) in the first half of this year, a top company
official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This represents a 32.07 percent increase over the same period
of last year.
</P>
<P>
Announcing Huaneng's interim results at a press conference
here, Wang Xiaosong, deputy general manager of the company, said
its net operating revenues for the first half of the year were
about 3,754 million (RMB) Yuan (453 million U.S. dollars).
Earnings per American Depository Share were 6 (RMB) Yuan, an
increase of 25 percent as compared to the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Huaneng, which listed its shares on the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange in January this year, has seven operating power plants
with a total power generation of 12.423 billion KWH during the
first six months of the year.
</P>
<P>
This accounts for 45 percent of the total planned generation
for the whole year of 1998, and is also a 49.57 percent increase
over the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the company's four power projects in Dandong, Dalian,
Nantong and Fuzhou under construction are progressing well. The
investments are all within budget and the quality of construction
is satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Commissioning of Dalian Power Plant Phase 2 and Dandong Power
Plant has commenced on schedule, he added.
</P>
<P>
Wang also acknowledged that the company's results were
adversely affected by market and natural factors in the first half
of the year.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Tightens Control on Foreign Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnam government has issued
a new decree on foreign exchange management, an official said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The decree, signed by Prime Minister Phan Van Khai on August
17, introduces new stipulations for foreign exchange transactions,
trading and transfer of capital to and from Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The government issued the decree in order to improve Vietnam's
foreign exchange control system, to make the Vietnamese dong
convertible in foreign trading, to stimulate economic growth, and
to improve the balance of international payments.
</P>
<P>
In the decree, the state bank of Vietnam will determine and
announce daily foreign exchange rates between the Vietnamese dong
and foreign currencies; the rates will be regulated on a
supply-demand basis.
</P>
<P>
The decree stipulates that the government shall exercise
uniform control of all foreign exchanges and foreign
exchange-related activities, which shall be conducted only through
the banking system or by individuals or organizations permitted to
do so.
</P>
<P>
The decree says that foreign investment capital in cash must be
deposited at banks currently operating in Vietnam and that
investors must register their capital contributions in foreign
currency at the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Capital in cash transferred abroad must be conducted through
accounts opened at local banks and registered at the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Investors must remit all their investment capital, profits and
legal income to Vietnam after their projects expire.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors can trade in stocks and other valuable papers
in accordance with foreign exchanges rules.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said the central bank will soon issue a circular
guiding the implementation of the decree, including a regulation
requiring those carrying 5,000 U.S.dollars or ten million
Vietnamese dong abroad must declare it at the border gates.

<HEADLINE> HK New Airport's Cargo Handling To Be Fully Resumed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals
Ltd. (HACTL), the operator of SuperTerminal 1 at Hong Kong
International Airport, said Thursday that all HACTL's air cargo,
both inbound and outbound, will be handled at SuperTerminal 1 from
next Monday.
</P>
<P>
This move represents the successful completion some eight days
ahead of schedule of a four-phase air cargo recovery program, said
HACTL, the major air cargo operator at the new airport.
</P>
<P>
The Special Administrative Region (SAR) government welcomed the
announcement. "We are pleased to learn that HACTL will resume all
cargo handling services at the new airport ahead of its schedule
of recovery program," said a government spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"With full recovery of the air cargo operation at the new
airport, we are confident that Hong Kong will continue to be a
major air cargo center in the world," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
SuperTerminal 1, built at a cost of over 1 billion U.S.
dollars, is now handling 90 percent of HACTL's cargo, with the
remainder processed at Terminal 2 of Kai Tak, Hong Kong's old
airport.
</P>
<P>
"Since the recovery program began (on July 18), the measured
build up of operations at SuperTerminal 1 has progressed smoothly
and has enabled us to address and rectify teething problems in a
controlled manner," said Anthony Charter, HACTL's managing
director.
</P>
<P>
"It has indeed been unfortunate that SuperTerminal 1 was not
able fully to meet all customer needs from start up and we regret
the inconvenience caused," Charter said.
</P>
<P>
With the early completion of the recovery program,
SuperTerminal 1 will be well prepared for the start of Hong Kong's
peak period for cargo handling which normally begins in September
and lasts for about four months, he added.

<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- People in north China's
Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces and Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region are sparing no effort to fight the disastrous floods.
</P>
<P>
In northernmost Heilongjiang Province, Xu Youfang, secretary of
the provincial committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC),
and provincial governor Tian Fengshan have been staying at
dangerous sections of the Nenjiang and Songhua rivers for days to
help solve problems of all kinds.
</P>
<P>
The 26-km-long riverbank in Harbin, capital of Heilongjiang,
looks like a battlefield. Officers and men of the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) have built a 300-m-long second defense
barrier in the city proper and piled up sandbags on the Songhua
embankment to raise its height.
</P>
<P>
A tricycle team made up of farmers travelled 100 km every day
to transport stone and sandbags to the river embankment.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials at provincial and bureau levels in Jilin
Province rushed to dangerous sections to direct flood-fighting
when the crest reached there.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Dejiang, secretary of the Jilin CPC Provincial Committee,

local residents and helped them with foodstuffs, living conditions
and drinking water.
</P>

The city of Baicheng has aroused 4 million people to reinforce
river dikes and repair dangerous sections. Local railway
departments formed shock repair teams to maintain normal rail
traffic.

<HEADLINE> Russia Moves to Placate Investors, Depositors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia's central bank on
Thursday assured nationals that their deposits in banks would be
fully guaranteed, a fresh effort to soothe the panicked citizens
rushing to dump their devalued rubles in exchange for hard
currency.
</P>
<P>
"The Central Bank is urging Russian citizens not to convert
their deposits in haste and not to withdraw their money from
banks," Sergei Dubinin, chairman of the Central Bank of Russia,
told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The ruble's official exchange rate shot to 6.996 to the
U.S. dollar Thursday, three days after the government and the
central bank raised the ceiling of the exchange corridor of the
national currency from 6.3 to 9.5 rubles to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Dubinin also urged the country's commercial banks to create a
system of mutual guarantees on deposits, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He said commercial banks should conclude agreements with
Sberbank (Savings Bank of the Russian Federation) assuring that
every private investor has the right to state-guaranteed safety of
deposits pending a law guaranteeing the safety of deposits.
</P>
<P>
The central bank, as Sberbank's main shareholder, has already
issued relevant instructions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko is scheduled to
meet with a group of foreign investors later Thursday to address
their concerns over Russia's obligations to international loans.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko will brief the investors on the government's measures
for stabilizing the Russian financial market, the government
information department said.
</P>
<P>
Russia's top negotiator with international lending agencies
Anatoly Chubais, Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov, Deputy Prime
Minister Boris Fyodorov, and Dubinin are likely to take part in
the meeting, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The government skipped a self-imposed deadline Wednesday to
announce how it intended to restructure the domestic debt market.
Western bankers greeted the silence with relief, saying Russia
could use the extra time to hear their concerns and suggestions.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko on Thursday continued to defend the government moves
on restructuring the state debt and a broader corridor for the
ruble, a euphemism for ruble devaluation.
</P>
<P>
The measures, although painful and unpleasant, are necessary to
prevent the general situation from sliding out of control, he told
a government meeting.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the core reason for the country's
economic chaos came from inside the country, although the Asian
financial crisis and battered world oil prices also hit the
Russian economy hard.
</P>
<P>
"No outside factors could have affected so negatively our
economy if we had not had our own domestic problems," Kiriyenko
said.
</P>
<P>
He said if the decision on restructuring the state debt had not
been taken, the government would have to service it, sacrificing
wages of miners, teachers, medical workers and the servicemen in
the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The country's wage arrears reached 75.84 billion rubles (10.85
billion dollars) on August 1 in 10 basic industries, up 6.5
percent from the beginning of July, the State Statistics Committee
said Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Last Eight Omagh Victims Laid to Rest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- People in Omagh, a Northern
Ireland market town which had a car bomb blast last weekend,
buried the last eight victims on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Omagh said the funerals were held in and around
the town, 80 km west of Belfast, during the day.
</P>
<P>
The blast claimed 28 lives, including three small boys from an
Irish Republic seaside town, a baby, a mother and a grandmother
from one family, and two visiting Spaniards.
</P>
<P>
Two funeral ceremonies were held in the center of Omagh on
Thursday just meters from the courthouse that warning messages had
led police to believe was the target for bombers from the
so-called Real IRA.
</P>
<P>
The funeral for Debra-Anne Cartwright, 20, a Protestant who
worked in a beauty salon in the town center, was held at St
Columba's Church.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of mourners were attending ceremonies in and around
the town. Northern Ireland First Minister David Trmible was among
mourners at the Holy Trinity Church in Lislimnaghan.

<P>
Reports said 76 of the more than 200 people injured when the
bomb exploded are still in hospital.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Top Court Rules Against Quebec Separation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Canada ruled
here Thursday that Quebec does not have the right to separate
unilaterally, which represents a legal victory for the Canadian
government.
</P>
<P>
In its historic ruling on the Quebec issue, the top court said
the French-speaking province can not separate unilaterally from
Canada under the Constitution of Canada.
</P>
<P>
The nine-judge court also ruled unanimously that Quebec does
not have the right to separate under international law.
</P>
<P>
But the court noted that if a clear majority of Quebecers vote
to get out of Canada, then the federal government and the rest of
the provinces would have the obligation to negotiate with Quebec and
amend the constitution so that Quebec could leave.
</P>
<P>
The ruling has been a key part of Ottawa's unity strategy since
it almost lost a referendum on Quebec's independence in October
1995.
</P>
<P>
Ottawa is hoping that Thursday's ruling by the top court will
persuade middle-ground Quebeckers to support the unity of Canada.
</P>
<P>
It also sent a strong message to hardcore separatists in Quebec
that a vote for sovereignty would mean a prolonged and painful
process.
</P>
<P>
Ottawa asked the court for its opinion on three deceptively
simple questions. Can Quebec unilaterally declare independence
under domestic law? Does international law give Quebec a right to
secede? If two laws conflict, which prevails?
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that Quebec does not have the right to go
unilaterally under either domestic or international law, and that
there is no conflict between the two.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Political Groups Refuse to Register </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of about 100
newly-emerged political associations have rejected the idea they
should be screened and registered by the government before they
can participate in the country's new democratization process as
political parties.
</P>
<P>
They made their position known in a meeting with the
Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) Wednesday in Abuja, the
federal capital.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the All Nigerian Congress and 20 other
political groups in the south, former governor of Oyo State,
Chief Bola Ige said there was no need for registration of
parties.
</P>
<P>
"Political parties formed by citizens need to be recognized by
INEC," he was quoted by the Post Express newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also said that since the government would not fund the new
parties, there was no need for the government to monitor their
finances just as there should be no rules to govern the parties
except the rules for campaigns.
</P>
<P>
On the elections, he suggested that all the polls should take
place at about the same time, as well as the handover in all
tiers of government.
</P>
<P>
Ige also rejected the idea of screening candidates by the
secret police, State Security Services (SSS), saying that once a
candidate meets the criteria in the constitution of the country,
he should be eligible to contest for election.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the INEC should be enlarged so that all the
parties will have their representatives in it.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Ige's position received almost
universal support from the political groups, who then followed by
one and another in making one or two additions of their own.
</P>
<P>
The INEC chairman, Justice Ephraim Akpata, however, insisted
that political groups must be registered as it is demanded by the
law.
</P>
<P>
He cited provisions of the Decree No. 17 of 1998 which
establishes the INEC and the 1995 dr!M
=9Mh%QUQ%=9@Q=Uport
his point.
</P>
<P>
"We are independent, but certainly not above the law and we
should not be seen to subvert it," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the new transition to civil rule program
announced by Nigerian military leader, General Abdulsalam
Abubakar, the country will hold a presidential election in the
first quarter of 1999, while the new civilian president will
assume office on May 29, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Top Court Rules on Quebec Separation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Canada ruled
out Thursday any chance for French-speaking province of Quebec to
unilaterally claim independence from the country.
</P>
<P>
In its historic ruling on the Quebec issue, the top court said

<HEADLINE> A Primer on Canada's Supreme Court References </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Canada is to
hand down its ruling on the legality of a unilateral separation by
Quebec Thursday morning. The following are some questions and
answers about the issue.
</P>
<P>
What's a reference?
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government has used its reference power to ask the
court to make the ruling on the Quebec issue.
</P>
<P>
A reference is a process which allows the government to ask the
court for advice on legal or factual questions having to do with
interpreting the constitution, laws or the powers of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Is it unusual?
</P>
<P>
There have been a total of 74 references by the federal government
since the first one in 1892. In 1981, for example, the top court was
asked to decided whether Ottawa could patriate the constitution without the
consent of all the provinces.
</P>
<P>
But internationally, it is an unusual power. The high courts of
Australia and the United States, for example, can't issue advisory opinions.
</P>
<P>
What questions has the court been asked?
</P>
<P>
1. Under Canada's constitution, can Quebec unilaterally separate
from the rest of the country?
</P>
<P>
2. Under international law, can Quebec secede ?
</P>
<P>
3. If Canadian and international law conflict, which prevails?
</P>
<P>
Is the court's judgement binding?
</P>
<P>
No. The court issues an advisory opinion. Since it's from the
highest court it has always been treated as binding, but it can be
disregarded by the government.
</P>
<P>
Why did the Canadian government ask the court of its opinion?
</P>
<P>
The reference is part of the government's get-tough approach to
Quebec separation. It hopes to set out ground rules for sucession.
But Quebec has refused to take part.

<HEADLINE> Pledges Made to Fight Against Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINGZHOU, August 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 soldiers and
civilians today gathered at a major embankment on the Yangtze
River to pledge mass effort to fight against the raging floods.
</P>
<P>
The gathering, organized by the Hubei provincial government and
the headquarters of the flood-control military forces on the
forefront, was designed to spread the important instructions of
President Jiang Zemin on flood control and to mobilize people to
unite to win the anti-flood battle.
</P>
<P>
Among the participants at the gathering were Tao Bojun,
Commander of the Guangzhou Military Area Command; Shi Yuxiao,
Political Commissar of the Guangzhou Military Area Command; Jia
Zhijie, Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the
Communist Party of China; and Jiang Zhuping, governor of Hubei.
</P>
<P>
The worst-ever flooding has hit the Yangtze River Valley since
this summer, resulting in a great loss of lives and property.
</P>
<P>
Because of the concerted effort of hundreds of thousands of
soldiers and civilians, the major dikes on the Yangtze River have
survived the ravages of five flood crests this year, with a sixth
moving downstream.
</P>
<P>
"Though great victories have been scored, the high water level
is expected to stay for a fairly long period of time and the
flood-control task is still gravely arduous," Jia Zhijie said at
the gathering.
</P>
<P>
"We must persist, persist and persist again to ensure the
safety of the major embankments of the Yangtze River," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tao Bojun urged the military forces to build up a great wall of
iron and steel to counter the floods.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that leading officials of the flooded areas have
been role models in flood-control.
</P>
<P>
In Hubei, both Jia Zhijie and Jiang Zhuping have for weeks
fought on the forefront.
</P>
<P>
In Hunan Province, Chu Bo, Deputy Secretary of the
Provincial Party Committee, has been commanding the anti-flood
effort for nearly one month.
</P>
<P>
Luo Diansu, publicity chief of Yueyang City, Hunan Province,
fell faint on an embankment. Luo's heart problem was attributed to
working more than 40 days on the embankment.
</P>
<P>
In east China's Jiangxi Province, Secretary of Provincial Party
Committee Shu Huiguo, Governor Shu Shengyou and many other
grassroots officials have been among the first to appear whenever
the flooding situation was most critical.

<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- While the sixth flood crest
flowed through the middle reaches of the Yangtze river today, the
flooding situation on the Nenjiang and Songhua rivers caused
concern.
</P>
<P>
A new flood crest on the Songhua river is pressing toward

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Remains Low in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. nationwide
unemployment rate still remains low, the Labor Department said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Asian economic crisis helped slow the nation's economic
growth from a 5.5 percent annual rate during the first three
months of this year to 1.4 percent during the second quarter
period. However, jobs remain plentiful and the unemployment rate
in July, at 4.5 percent, remained near a 28-year low.
</P>
<P>
The number of first-time claims for unemployment benefits fell
by 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 303,000 last week, according to
the department. The figure is well below the 394,000 reached for
two consecutive weeks in late June and early July, when
unemployment was nudged higher by the nearly-two-month General
Motors strike.
</P>
<P>
A four-week average of claims fell to 303,000, down from
307,000 for the period ending one week earlier. It was the lowest
level in a year.

<P>
GENEVA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Canada's ambassador to the
Conference on Disarmament (CD) Mark Moher was named here Thursday
as chairman of a newly-established ad hoc committee on talks to
ban production of bomb-level fissile material.
</P>
<P>
After his appointment by consensus within the CD, Moher pledged
to be neutral as chairman of the negotiations to be re-launched
after having been stalled since 1995.
</P>
<P>
"Canada, as chairman of the committee, undertakes and commits
itself to behave as a chairman should, i.e. in a neutral way. The
Canadian chair will do its best to move the work of the committee
forward but to do so in a way sensitive to member states of the
conference," Moher said.
</P>
<P>
On August 11, the 61-member CD decided to establish the ad hoc
committee on the prohibition of production of fissile material for
nuclear purposes.
</P>
<P>
The mandate of the committee is to negotiate a
non-discriminatory, multilateral and internationally and
effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile
material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices,
said a statement issued by the 61-member disarmament conference.
</P>
<P>
The ad hoc committee shall present a report to the Conference
on Disarmament on the progress of its efforts to launch fresh
talks on a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty (FMCT) before the
conclusion of the 1998 session of CD on September 9.

performance during his office after March 1997, the official Radio
Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
"This actual stage needs new efforts and hope as well as a new
governmental team which will work for serving the country and its
citizens," Majali told reporters after the last session of the

</P>
<P>
Majali resigned late Wednesday under criticism sparked by the
recent pollution of drinking water in the capital and public
discontent with economic policy.
</P>
<P>
A new government headed by Prime Minister-designate Fayez
Tarawneh, a close confidant of King Hussein, is expected to step
in later Thursday.

<P>
"We are the soldiers of King Hussein whether we are inside the
government or outside it. I will continue to serve the king and
the country as long as I live," Majali said.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan, deputizing for King Hussein who
is in the United States for cancer treatment, ordered Thursday the
publication of a report on the water scandal in July, the radio
said.
</P>
<P>
A special commission appointed by Hussein on August 4 for
investigating the water pollution submitted the 100-page report on
Wednesday.

HONG KONG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A Preparatory Committee for
celebration of the 49th anniversary of the founding of the
People's Republic of China (PRC) composed of representatives from
Hong Kong's industrial and commercial sectors was set up here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Noting brilliant achievements China has scored since the PRC's
founding in 1949, committee chairman Tsang Hin Chi said at the
ceremony that China's national economy has grown rapidly with
people's living standard improved, the national strength boosted
and its international prestige raised especially after the country
fully implemented the policy of reform and opening up.
</P>
<P>
He said the motherland's political stability and sound economic
development are major favorable factors for maintaining Hong
Kong's stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said that although Hong Kong is facing economic
difficulties, its economic foundation remains solid thanks to the
powerful support by the motherland on the one hand, and various
kinds of measures the government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) has taken on the other.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that with the full support rendered by
the Central People's Government and the concerted efforts by the
SAR Government and the people from all walks of life, Hong Kong
will surely overcome temporally difficulties and build a brighter
future by giving full play to its advantages.

<HEADLINE> No Military Response to Congo (K) Crisis: Nzo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo Thursday repeated South Africa's position
that there should be no military intervention in the present
crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
"In fact, there can be no military solution to this problem,"
Nzo told the National Assembly in Cape Town. "A solution that we
are convinced will be meaningful will be one decided upon by the
Congolese people themselves."
</P>
<P>
His speech was televised live on South African national
television, the SABC.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said South Africa's ultimate goal is to
help bring about a broad-based political order in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the present conflict in the country was the
failure to establish such an order, said Nzo.
</P>
<P>
He said that the best way to resolve the problem is to seek a
cease-fire in the country and then let the DRC people decide
their own future by a general election.
</P>
<P>
"It was clear to us that what needed to be done in this
situation was to work for a situation of a cease-fire so as to
enable the Congolese in a calm atmosphere to sit around a table
and to determine the future of their country, a solution which
would entail, among other things, the establishment of a
broad-based interim government to prepare for eventual elections
later, in other words, for the Congolese people to be given an
opportunity to decide their own future."
</P>
<P>
"I must now indicate that what we are busily engaged in at
this moment is to precisely reach that position whereby a
cease-fire is declared and the beginnings of a discussion by the
Congolese people themselves for the settlement of their problem
will take place," said Nzo.
</P>
<P>
He said that during his mission to Rwanda and Uganda Tuesday
and Wednesday, he warned the leaders of the two countries that
the crisis would not end even after Kinshasa has been taken by
rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
"During the course of our discussions with the leadership of
both Rwanda and Uganda, we indicated that this crisis will by no
means end after Kinshasa has been taken," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a crisis that is likely to continue to bedevil the
region for a very long time," the South African minister added.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda were accused by DRC President Laurent Kabila
of being behind the rebel forces in his country, but both
countries denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
Certain southern African countries led by Zimbabwe are in
favor of military assistance to Kabila to help quell the revolt.

BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji this morning
phoned Wang Maolin, secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of
the Communist Party of China (CPC), inquiring about the flood
situation there.
</P>
<P>
He fully affirmed the principle of "placing stress on
prevention rather than rush repairs" made by the government of
Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
Zhu urged flood-fighters to abide by flood-control regulations,
patrol the river dikes round the clock and deal with dangerous
situations at any cost.
</P>
<P>
Adequate relief materials and flood workers should be placed on
the embankments in case of possible cave-ins or river breaches, he
said. Protection of people's lives should be placed above all, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu expressed solicitude for Luo Diansu, publicity director of
the Yueyang City Party Committee, who fell down on the Yangtze
embankment because of heart disease and fatigue, and asked Wang to
forward his cordial regards to him and to take good care of
flood-fighters who are weary after a two-month battle with floods.
</P>
<P>
Wang expressed his thanks to the Party Central Committee and
the State Council on behalf of the local party committee and the
government. He also pledged to go all out to win the final

<HEADLINE> IOC to Strengthen Fight against Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) executive committee on Thursday charged four
special task forces with the job to fight against drugs in sport
in Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The four groups have until February next year to come up with
a solution which will then be presented to a special two-day
international world conference on sports doping to be held in
Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
Following are the four areas to be covered:
</P>
<P>
1. Protection of athletes.
</P>
<P>
2. The political and legal position, the definition of doping
and government co-operation.
</P>
<P>
3. Ethics and prevention.
</P>
<P>
4. The financial stakes and the relationship between doping
and money. How to fight against doping.
</P>
<P>
Revealing the four target areas, IOC director general Francois
Carrard said the executive committee was determined to do
everything possible to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
The IOC hopes Thursday's decision will be the first step in
revolutionizing how doping cheats in sport are caught and
punished.
</P>
<P>
However, how to define what doping is will be the most
important problem the IOC task forces is facing.
</P>
<P>
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch complained there were too
long list on substances and that he saw nothing wrong with
performance-enhancing drugs if there was no health risk.
</P>
<P>
The task force will have to find a compromise between the two
opposite views.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Moves to Tighten Grip on Banking Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia has passed an
amendment to tighten the legal grip on banking activities.
</P>
<P>
The amendment to the banking law was approved Thursday by the
Great Hural, or the parliament. The amendment will target
liability dodgers and those who abuse power for personal gain.
</P>
<P>
Those persons who deliberately evade their debt payment
responsibility and abuse power to serve their personal interest
will be subject to imprisonment for up to five years and the
confiscation of their illegal gains.
</P>
<P>
Under the amendment, commercial banks could be fined 10 million
tugriks (118,000 U.S. dollars) if they fail to present their final
reports and balance sheets to the central bank.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, those in charge could be fined 250,000
tugriks (2,900 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Mongolia has decided to intensify control of the banking system
since banks in the inland Asian country are plagued by bad debts.
</P>
<P>
An aborted merger of a state bank with a private counterpart in
May led to the fall of the former cabinet.

<HEADLINE> China Draws Lessons From Asian Financial Crisis  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A major lesson China's financial
leaders have learned from the still lingering Asian crisis is that
efforts must be made to prevent economic bubbles during periods of
rapid expansion.
</P>
<P>
During periods of rapid economic growth, both domestic and
overseas investment should be directed to sustainable growth
projects to prevent excessive increases in stock and real estate
prices, said Liu Mingkang, vice-governor of the People's Bank of
China, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Speaking today to participants of a seminar on the Asian
financial crisis and the development of financial markets on the
Chinese mainland and Hong Kong, Liu also said that currency
convertibility under the capital account must be achieved
gradually.
</P>
<P>
A stable and efficient domestic banking system, a balanced
macro economy and a mature domestic capital market are three
prerequites for capital-account convertibility, he said.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of a currency, meanwhile, should be decided
in accordance with the soundness of the balance of international
payments as well as that of the macro economy, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
"Only when the exchange rate is rightfully set, can adequate
foreign exchange reserves be meaningful as a stabilizer," he said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should also be made to control the expansion of the
size of foreign debt to keep the debt-service ratio below the
international warning level, Liu said, adding that the foreign
debt structure must also be kept reasonable.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the central bank must enhance
supervision over the banking sector to ensure that commercial
banks do operate according to accepted international standards.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, administrative intervention in banking
business must be cut to the minimum level while openness must be
increased in making financial policies.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that it is common knowledge that China has contributed
greatly to regional economic stability during the financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"China's policy of maintaining the yuan's exchange rate has
eased the export pressure of crisis-hit countries and helped to
avoid competitive, hostile currency devaluations in the region,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Wuhan Flood-Fighters Prepare for Arrival of Sixth Flood Crest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 280,000 army and
civilian flood-fighters are working day and night on the
465-kilometer-long embankment of the Yangtze River in Wuhan to
prepare for the arrival of the sixth flood crest.
</P>
<P>
The water level in Wuhan remained at 29.43 meters for 23 hours
ending at 8 p.m. today. The flow rate reached 73,200 cubic meters
per second.
</P>
<P>
The sustained high water level was fed by water pouring down
from the upper reaches of the Yangtze, which joined floodwaters
from the Hanjiang, Yuanshui and Lishui rivers, said an official
from the Yangtze Water Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
When the flood crest passes Wuhan on Friday, the water level is
expected to reach 29.47 meters, according to the State Flood
Control and Drought Relief Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
To date, the river embankments in Wuhan have been soaked in
water above the record level of 29 meters for more than 20
days. Thunderstorms with gale-force winds were pouring down on the
city at 8 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
A rally for flood-fighters was held this morning on the
embankment of the Yangtze amid roaring shouts of slogans and vows
to overcome the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Wuhan flood control headquarters issued its ninth order
today, calling on all the people in the city to be on high alert
and prepare to pay any price to ensure the city's safety.
</P>
<P>
At present, huge amounts of sandbags, stones and other
necessary materials are being shipped to key sections of the
embankments.

<TEXT>
<P>
China also has been largely successful in taking measures to
minimize the negative impact of the crisis, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the crisis has had a direct impact on Chinese exports
and the potential to inhibit China's effort to raise funds
overseas and on foreign direct investment in China, he admitted.
</P>
<P>
China's export growth has slowed since January, with total
exports rising 7.6 percent year-on-year to 87 billion U.S. dollars
for the first half of this year, official figures indicate.
</P>
<P>
In a sharp contrast to massive drops in overseas capital inflow
into Asia, China still registered 20.5 billion U.S. dollars in
overseas direct investment in the first six months of this year,
which is almost the same as for the same period last year, Liu
said.
</P>
<P>
Newly pledged overseas investment in China reached 24.2 billion
yuan in the January-June period, up 5.5 percent from a year ago,
as against a downward trend in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
"Massive reductions in investment from Asia have been offset by
significant increases in investment from Europe and America," Liu
said.
</P>
<P>
While actively drawing lessons from the Asian financial crisis,
China is also resolutely pushing ahead financial reforms to
prevent and ward off financial risks, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis has posed a rigorous test for the
sustained and stable development of the Chinese economy, Liu
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
"However, the active fiscal and administrative policies and the
monetary policy of appropriately increasing money supply will, to
a great extent, offset the negative impact from without," he said.
</P>
<P>
So long as China sticks to its economic restructuring and the
policies of reform and opening to the outside world, it still can
realize relatively rapid economic growth, Liu said, and this
itself is a great contribution to the economy of the region and
that of the whole world.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Aston Villa accepted a 12
million pounds (19.50 million U.S. dollars) offer by Manchester
United for their Trinidad and Tobago striker Dwight Yorke on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports today, Yorke was already in the
Manchester United club to discuss personal terms with United
manager Alex Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
The deal was expected to be completed before Thursday's 2200
GMT European transfer deadline which will enable Yorke to play
for United in the Champions' League this season.
</P>
<P>
If it goes through, the transfer will end weeks of speculation
in the media and negotiation between the clubs.
</P>
<P>
United initially offered around 8m for the 26-year-old Yorke,
but Villa valued him at 16m and it looked as though no deal could
be reached, even after the bid was increased to 10m.
</P>
<P>
Yorke has said he is keen to make the move as he wants to play
at the highest level in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United are in the Champions' League while Aston
Villa are only in the UEFA Cup.
</P>
<P>
Just three days ago, Yorke said: "I want to go to Manchester
United. The Champions' League deadline is on Thursday and I want
to be there by then."
</P>
<P>
Villa chairman Doug Ellis tried to placate Yorke by arguing
that his team would soon compete at United's level, but he failed
to convince his star.

<HEADLINE> EU Takes Vehicle Trade Dispute with Canada to WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said on
Thursday that it is taking Canada to the World Trade Organization
(WTO) over automobile trade discrimination.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union (EU), is requesting formal consultation with the WTO to end
the Canadian policy of subsidizing local automobile companies.
</P>
<P>
The commission argued that the Canadian policy breaks WTO rules
and distorts international trade practices by giving some
companies an unfair advantage over their European competitors.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government, commission officials said, grants
selected companies the right to import both automobile components
and finished vehicles duty-free, provided they use a minimum
portion of Canadian components and their production in Canada
represents a designated percentage of sales in the country.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of required local components and the mandatory

Canada now levies a 6.7-percent tariff on vehicles and a
6-percent tariff on automobile components imported from the
European Union.

EU exports of automobile products to the North American country
increased to 1,026 million ECU (1,128 million U.S. dollars) in
1997, from 775 million ECU (852.5 million dollars) a year earlier.
</P>

Commission officials quoted official Canadian sources as saying
that more than 16 percent of the total imports of vehicles from
the EU were duty-free in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Thursday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- Prosecutors have demanded a sample of President Clinton's
genetic material to establish forensic proof that his relationship
with Monica S. Lewinsky was sexual, a lawyer familiar with the
request said.
</P>
<P>
-- As United States officials focus on a Saudi exile, Osama bin
Laden, as a prime suspect in the embassy bombings in Africa, they
are considering strategies for how they might negotiate his capture
with the Taliban, the fundamentalist Muslim who control
Afghanistan, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- Monica S. Lewinsky has contradicted President Clinton's
grand jury testimony about the nature of their sexual relationship
and her return of presidential gifts that had been subpoenaed in
the Paula Jones lawsuit, sources familiar with their accounts
said.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton's speech Monday night was increasingly
seen by Democrats as a political failure that has unleashed a
torrent of anger among some of the president's most loyal
supporters and created problems no one at the White House
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- AIG agreed to buy SunAmerica, an industry leader in
annuities, for more than 18 billion dollars in stock, according to
people familiar with the matter. The proposed transaction is the
second-biggest ever in the insurance industry and the latest
megadeal in the financial-services business.
</P>
<P>
-- An Islamic militant group warned of further attacks on U.S.
targets as Afghanistan's rulers reiterated they wouldn't turn
over the group's leader, Osama Bin Laden, even if it is proved
he ordered the Africa embassy bombings. FBI agents raided a hotel
in Kenya where local media said one bomb was built.

<P>
SEOUL, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Seoul Share prices rose 4.87
percent Thursday as the Japanese yen stabilized and foreign
investors registered a rare net selling in the market.
</P>
<P>
The composite stock price index surged 14.69 points to close
the day at 316.59. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners at 638
against 155, with 77 issues remaining unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Turnover rose to 91.46 million shares worth 509.99 billion won
(about 394.12 million U.S. dollars) changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors launched a rare buying spree in the market,
concentrating on key blue-chips and under-valued large cap
issues. They marked a net purchase figure of 14 billion won, while
retail investors outdid their foreign counterparts to mark net
purchases of 26.9 billion won.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, institutional investors remained bearish, marking
net selling figures of a whopping 45.1 billion won.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean won Thursday strengthened to 1,294 against the

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Online Advertising to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Global spending for online
advertising will hit 15 billion U.S. dollars in 2003, an American
technology research firm said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Forrester Research, Inc. based its estimation on the steady
growth in the world's online population and the arrival of
mainstream advertisers.
</P>
<P>
The company said that spending for online advertising will
continue to be dominated by the United States, with Internet
advertisements growing from 1.3 billion dollars in 1998 to 10.5
billion dollars in 2003.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. share of the worldwide market will decline from 87
percent in 1998 to 70 percent in 2003, Forrester said, adding that
the global online advertisement spending was estimated at one
billion dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Outside the United States, advertisement spending will be led
by Europe, where the online market is expected to grow from 105
million dollars in 1998 to 2.8 billion dollars in 2003.
</P>
<P>
This spending, Forrester said, will be pushed by an
increasingly cohesive European market, a growing Internet
population, competition from U.S.-based companies and maturing
technologies.
</P>
<P>
Slowed by ongoing economic difficulties, Asian advertisement
spending will grow to 1.25 billion dollars in 2003. Dramatic
growth in Latin America will be masked by a small Internet
population and a low starting point for advertisement spending, it
said.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet has arrived as an accepted advertising medium,"
Forrester's report said. "This is evidenced by the amounts that
will be spent for online advertisements during the next five
years, as well as by the arrival of large mainstream advertisers."
</P>
<P>
In addition to the growth in overall spending, Forrester
expected per capita spending for online advertisements in the
United States to bypass radio and magazine advertisements by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Internet advertisers will spend 25 dollars per person in 1998
-- double the amount spent in 1997. By 2003, this number will grow
to 104 dollars per person, roughly one-third of per capita
spending for television advertisements but slightly ahead of
magazine and radio spending.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Shopping Festival Boosts Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's first month-long Shopping
and Tourism Festival, which ends Thursday, turned out to be
successful, giving a big stimulus to the country's tourism, the
Middle East News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The number of tourists was up from the same period last
year. Moreover, hotel occupancy rates were very high, even
unprecedented," said Tourism Minister Mamdouh El-Beltagui Monday.
</P>
<P>
About 174,000 foreigners and 112,000 Egyptian expatriates
flocked to Egypt during the festival, which made the number of
visitors to Egypt this summer far greater than the same period
last year despite a five-week-long heat wave.
</P>
<P>
The visitors mostly came to buy carpets, crystals and
chandeliers, which are among the wide-ranging merchandise sold at
up to 50 percent discount in the festival, the agency said,
quoting customs and banking officials.
</P>
<P>
During the festival started July 20 in Cairo and the Red Sea
resort of Hurghada, visitors can not only enjoy a maximum discount
of 50 percent in stores, but also in hotels and the EgyptAir.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the two cities, the average hotel
occupancy reached over 90 percent in the month.
</P>
<P>
The festival is part of Egypt's efforts to boost its tourism,
the second key foreign currency earner which suffered a grave
setback last year after the Luxor incident in southern Egypt, in
which 58 foreign tourists were killed by terrorists.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that a total of 4 million tourists, about 20
percent of them from other Arab states, visited Egypt last year,
bringing 3.8 billion dollars to the state treasury.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Plays Role in Flood Situation  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President and Party
General Secretary Jiang Zemin has concerned himself with the
anti-flood battle along the two major rivers in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Jiang placed two calls to Wen Jiabao, vice-premier
and head of the State Flood Control and Drought Relief
Headquarters, to ask about the flood situation on the Nenjiang and
Songhua rivers. Jiang also issued a series of important directives
to Wen.
</P>
<P>
He then called Xu Youfang, secretary of the Heilongjiang
Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), to
inquire about detailed anti-flood measures taken there.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday evening, the president made a third call to Wen
after the vice-premier had arrived in Harbin, capital of
Heilongjiang.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called on all army and civilian flood-fighters along the
two rivers to spare no effort to protect major cities, the Daqing
Oilfield and the lives of local people.
</P>
<P>
Wen inspected Harbin and the Dorbod Autonomous County of ethnic
Mongolia group in Heilongjiang Province as well as Zhenlai County
in Jilin and Horqin Left Wing Middle Banner in the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
He extended cordial regards to military and civilian
flood-fighters and flood victims on behalf of the CPC Central
Committee and the State Council as well as Jiang Zemin and Premier
Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
Wen also visited the third defense embankment on Wednesday,
which is under construction to protect the Daqing Oilfield. He
conveyed Jiang's message on flood-fighting and urged all people
present to unite as one to safeguard the Daqing Oilfield. In the
afternoon, he arrived at the embankments in Harbin and encouraged
people to exert themselves to the utmost to combat the
unprecedented flood crest.

While visiting a village in Inner Mongolia this morning, Wen
chatted with villagers in a shelter for flood victims. He conveyed
greetings from Jiang Zemin and encouraged them to restore
production and rebuild their hometown through self-reliant
efforts. Wen also asked leading regional officials to provide
flood victims with adequate food, clean water and clothing as well
as new housing.
</P>
<P>
After hearing reports from leading officials in Heilongjiang,
Jilin and Inner Mongolia, Wen praised their strenuous efforts and
the backbone role of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in
battling floods. He asked Liang Guanglie, commander of the
Shenyang Military Areas Command, and political commissar Jiang
Futang to convey President Jiang's regards to the 75,000 PLA
soldiers and armed police on the flood front line.
</P>
<P>
Wen urged party committees and governments at all levels to
implement the flood directives of the Central Committee and Jiang
Zemin concerning flood control and relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
"Jiang's speech is a mobilization order in the final stage of
flood-fighting," Wen said. "We should turn his directive into
action, persevere in strenuous effort and win the final victory."

<HEADLINE> National Medical Team to Perform Eye Surgeries in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A national medical team of 20
outstanding ophthalmologists will soon leave for Tibet to provide
free surgeries for about 1,000 blind cataract patients.
</P>
<P>
This will be the biggest rehabilitation service in the history
of the Tibet Autonomous Region, Health Minister Zhang Wenkang said
today at a ceremony to present a mission flag to team members.
</P>
<P>
One month of medical service will be given to farmers and
herdsmen in four areas of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Tibetans run much higher risks of cataract-related blindness
because of the high altitude and strong ultraviolet rays.
</P>
<P>
"The incidence of cataracts in Tibet is twice as high as in
other regions of China, and cataracts generally occur 10-to-15
years earlier," Zhang said, adding that the lack of medical
facilities and transportation problems make the situation even
worse.
</P>
<P>
Cataracts are the cause of blindness for more than four million
Chinese, almost half of the total number of blind people across
the country. Each year, about 400,000 new cases of blindness are
caused by cataracts.
</P>
<P>
However, only 2.1 million cataract operations and artificial
lens implants were performed in the 1988-1997 period.
</P>
<P>
The health minister admitted that reducing the number of
cataract sufferers "remains a major challenge to the country's
medical community" because of the limited economic resources and
inadequate technology.
</P>
<P>
There are no independent ophthalmology services in about 500
counties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Also attending today's ceremony were He Luli, vice chairwoman
of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; State
Councilor Wang Zhongyu; and Bai Lichen, vice chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference.
</P>
<P>
The mission to Tibet is also an important part of "Sight First
China Action," a joint project launched by the Ministry of Health,
the China Disabled Persons' Federation and Lions Clubs
International in August of last year.
</P>
<P>
The project will undertake 1.75 million cataract operations
within five years and should be able to complete 450,000
operations annually by 2001, according to Tam Wing Kun, executive
committee chairman of Sight First and board appointee of Lions
Clubs International.
</P>
<P>
A total of 250 national and provincial medical teams will go to
remote and poverty-stricken areas during the project. Some 348,000
operations were performed in China last year, he said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Rejects Request to Resume Arms Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz on Thursday turned down a request by the chief
U.N. arms inspector Richard Butler to resume arms inspections, the
Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Butler, chairman of the U.N. Special Commission for disarming
Iraq, known as UNSCOM, sent a letter to Aziz asking Iraq to allow
the resumption of arms inspections that Iraq suspended on August
5.
</P>
<P>
INA quoted Aziz as responding that "Butler and some elements in
the Special Commission are not international officials but serve
the U.S. policies to maintain the sanctions on Iraq by following
its orders."
</P>
<P>
"The decision (to suspend U.N. arms inspections in Iraq) is
firm and will not change until the Security Council considers
Iraq's legitimate demands seriously, responsibly, honestly and
away from U.S. pressure and blackmail, and immediately lifts
sanctions off Iraq," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Security Council asked UNSCOM and the
International Atomic Energy Agency to continue arms inspections
when replying to their letters asking for guidance from the
Council after Baghdad's announcement of suspension of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad's announcement came on August 5 after the breakdown of
disarmament talks between Butler and Aziz on August 3. Aziz said
Butler' refusal to certify that Iraq has destroyed all its
prohibited weapons led to the collapse of their talks.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions on Iraq cannot be lifted unless UNSCOM
verifies that it is free of nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons and long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
INA quoted Aziz as accusing Butler of "deliberately exercising
a policy of maneuvering, foot-dragging and confusion between
substantive issues relevant to the requirements of disarmament and
minor sham issues."
</P>
<P>
"We do not trust Butler, nor do we trust the elements
controlling the Special Commission, and we do not believe that the
resumption of work with them would be of any use," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz's comment came just before the Security Council is to
hear the briefing of Prakash Shah, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's special envoy to Iraq, on his talks with Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Shah held talks last week in Baghdad with Aziz on a mission of
trying to persuade Iraq into agreeing to allow the resumption of
U.N. arms inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq insisted that the Security Council must look
into its legitimate demands before it can change its position.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been claiming that the United States is manipulating
U.N. inspections to prolong sanctions on it, and that it has
complied with all relevant U.N. resolutions.

<HEADLINE> HK's Free Market Principles Not to Be Changed: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) reaffirmed
here Thursday that Hong Kong will not depart from its traditional
free market economy principles.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the SAR government's action last Friday of drawing
on its hefty foreign exchange reserves to counterattack
speculators in the stock and futures markets, Tung said that the
SAR government is not out there to support the stock market.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a luncheon organized by the Australian Chamber of
Commerce, Tung said: "We are not there to support the stock market
at any level. Neither are we against people taking short
positions on the stock market."
</P>
<P>
"What we do take is that when we see there are manipulations in
our foreign exchange market which create conditions and high
interest rates which enables the same people to take huge
positions in the short market they have created," the chief
executive said.
</P>
<P>
"That is something which is not acceptable to us. So our effort
is a very narrow effort, it is very defensive effort targeted
specifically at this particular action, and no more than that," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"As long as those conditions exist, we will do it," he said.
"We will do it at the right time when it is necessary to protect
our currency market, to protect our stock market -- the integrity
of our market needs to be protected," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Hong Kong's economy, Tung said that Hong Kong is
really having a very difficult time.
</P>
<P>
"Our second quarter GDP growth - the figures will come out next
week - will be negative. The third quarter and the fourth quarter
will be very, very difficult and I think difficulties will go well
into next year, into 1999," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen, during the past few months, substantial
correction in our property prices, in our stock market. We have
also seen unemployment going up and I know, unfortunately, it will
continue to go up in the months ahead," Tung added.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that the Asian financial turmoil has really impacted
Hong Kong, as it has done with other communities and nations in
the region, in a very, very serious manner.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Asian turmoil has now affected other emerging
markets, whether it is Russia or South America and that "if we
don't, in Asia, get things right, the impact is not just to Asia,
to the emerging markets, to Russia - I think it will impact
Australia and New Zealand - it will impact all the rest of the
world also".
</P>
<P>
So it is not just an Asian problem, it is a global problem that
really needs some global solutions, Tung noted.
</P>
<P>
Turning to Hong Kong's future, Tung said that it will not be
all doom and gloom as some people predicted because of the SAR
government's prudent and effective financial management and its
huge fiscal reserves.
</P>
<P>
"We have a civil service whose head is really screwed-on,
working very hard, totally uncorrupted," he said. "We have a
society which gives great emphasis to the rule of law."
</P>
<P>
"Our investment in education which is so important to our
future is continuing, and will continue as we move into the 21st
century because we know that without the quality of people, we
will not be competitive and in a knowledge-based society, nothing
is more important than that," he continued.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government also puts 235 billion HK dollars (30 billion
U.S. dollars) in infrastructure projects over the next five years,
of which 100 billion HK dollars (13 billion U.S. dollars) will be
in the railway expansion program, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Despite such a difficult economic climate, the SAR government
is still committed to these investments because Hong Kong has good
solid foundations and the Hong Kong people have confidence in
their own future, the chief executive said.

<HEADLINE> Grand Prix Could Be Back to S. Africa in 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Formula One racing may
return to a South African racing circuit in 2001, South African
media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Formula One Association president Bernie Ecclestone announced
Wednesday that South Africa will host official Formula One test
sessions in 1999 and 2000 attended by all race teams, in
preparation for a full world championship event in 2001.
</P>
<P>
This came as a disappointment to South African motorsport
circles which expected the global motor showpiece to be back as
soon as next year. The last Grand Prix South Africa hosted was in
1992.
</P>
<P>
Ecclestone, who met President Nelson Mandela for lunch
Wednesday, said the reason South Africa probably would not host
an F-1 race before the turn of the century was a lack of space on
the F-1 calendar.
</P>
<P>
Current agreements with the racing teams allow for 16 races
per season. This is expected to be increased to 17 next year and
18 the year after, but that still doesn't guarantee South Africa
a race.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreements with 16 countries which currently stage
rounds of the F-1 world championship. In addition, we have
agreements with five countries - including South Africa - who are
waiting for dates to become available," Ecclestone said.
</P>
<P>
He said his aim was to see South Africa hosting a round of the
F-1 world championship in 2001. But the possibility of South
Africa hosting Grand Prix earlier than that was also not ruled
out.
</P>
<P>
The F-1 boss said he and Mandela did not discuss South
Africa's impending legislation to ban tobacco sponsorships or its
impact on F-1 racing.
</P>
<P>
But he denied that South Africa's chances of hosting a Grand
Prix would be hurt by the government's new tough stance against
tobacco advertising. He said this was not even a consideration.
</P>
<P>
The South African cabinet has approved a bill which proposes
heavy fines for anyone who advertises tobacco products or brands
through sponsorships or donations.
</P>
<P>
Formula One is heavily sponsored by tobacco companies, with
some estimates placing its support in excess of 400 million U.S.
Dollars a year..
</P>
<P>
Ecclestone said he felt South Africa would adopt international
trends by phasing out F-1 tobacco sponsorship over a period
through to 2006.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Coach Warns South African Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- South African national
soccer team have the potential to dominate Africa but local
soccer officials must first get rid of their hidden agendas and
political in-fighting, former national coach Jomo Sono said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sono, who amazed South Africans when he led the national team
to the final of the African Nations Cup in February, said he did
not believe the South African Football Association (SAFA) is now
really trying to select a suitable new national coach, South
African media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
SAFA is expected to name the new head coach early next month.
Former coach of top English club Chelsea, Dutchman Ruud Gullit,
and former Nigerian World Cup coach, Yugoslav Bora Milutinovic,
are tipped to be among the candidates.
</P>
<P>
"All this business of advertising the post of head coach is
cosmetic. I'm sure they have already made up their minds about
who will be appointed and are only going through the motions in
calling for applications," Sono said.
</P>
<P>
Sono, a former soccer star and now owner and coach of local
professional soccer league club Jomo Cosmos, said he firmly
believes South Africa can eclipse Nigeria as the continent's top
dogs.
</P>
<P>
"We need the right coach and although Nigeria have better
individual players, we could build a team that could beat them,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"But we have to stop the politics inside our game and stop the
hidden agendas that go on under the table if we are to succeed,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The latest FIFA rankings showed that South Africa had dropped
to fifth place in the continent. This was largely due to its
failure to make an impact in the World Cup in June and its loss
of African Nations Cup crown to Egypt in February.
</P>
<P>
The South Africans were ousted at the group match stage on
their World Cup debut in France after mustering only two points
off two draws against Denmark and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Sono said he would make sure certain conditions are met if he
is to take the job again, including the permission for him to
install his own technical and management team.
</P>
<P>
He would also take the team only on a part-time basis and
would not accept any interference in the way he runs the team.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: New Progress to Probe of Nairobi Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Director of the U.S. Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Louis Freech is to arrive here
Thursday evening as the Kenyan-U.S. probe team has held three
more suspects involved in the August 7 Nairobi bombing.
</P>
<P>
A reliable source, on condition of anonymity, told Xinhua
Thursday that the three have been arrested since last weekend,
raising the total number of the bomb suspects currently detained
in Nairobi to at least nine. He did not reveal their
nationalities.
</P>
<P>
The figure includes the five detained by the investigators
before last Friday and Mohammed Saddiq Howaida, the key suspect
arrested in Pakistan on the day of the bombings and then flown
blindfolded back to Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The source said the FBI chief, who will arrive here at between
5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. local time Thursday from Tanzania, is
scheduled to tour the bombing site in downtown Nairobi Friday and
then hold a press conference on the progress of the bomb blast
investigation.
</P>
<P>
So far, it is unknown if the other two suspects reportedly
arrested by the Pakistani authorities this week have been handed
over to Kenya or not.
</P>
<P>
The two men, identified as a Saudi and a Sudanese, were
arrested while trying to cross into Afghanistan from Pakistan
with fake Yemeni passports, a local media report quoted Pakistani
immigration officials as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Freech, during his one-day visit in the Tanzanian capital of
Dar es Salaam Thursday, said that the investigation into the
bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania is making
progress, but it's too early to make any conclusion.
</P>
<P>
The car bomb attack at the U.S. embassy in a very busy
commercial area in Nairobi killed at least 253 people and injured
some 5,000 more.
</P>
<P>
A nearly simultaneous car bombing outside the U.S. embassy in
Tanzania killed 10 people and wounded at least 70 others.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan-U.S. joint probe team raided the Hill Top Hotel on
Tuesday, where the bomb -- 800 kilograms of highly explosive TNT
-- was believed to be assembled.
</P>
<P>
Two rooms at the hotel were reportedly rented by four bomb
suspects -- two Palestinians, one Egyptian and one Saudi Arabian
-- from August 3 to August 7.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said that Howaida, who checked in the Hill
Top Hotel on August 4, had five accomplices but three of them
died in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Howaida, a 34-year-old Palestinian from Jordan, left Nairobi
on August 6 and was arrested at the Karachi airport on the
following day, the day of the deadly blast, because immigration
officials noticed his face did not match that in his passport.
</P>
<P>
Howaida reportedly said that he was an engineer who had been
sent to Kenya to provide technical and logistical support for the
bombing, but that he had been instructed to leave Kenya hours
before the blast.
</P>
<P>
He also said the bombing was sponsored by Saudi millionaire
Ossama bin Laden, whose group consisted of 4,000 to 5,000
heavily-armed terrorists who operated full-time in Saudi Arabia,
Sudan, Egypt, Yemen, Ethiopia, Somalia, Pakistan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration has demanded Bin Laden's extradition
from Afghanistan, warning the Taliban government that it can
expect no international recognition until it hands him over.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban rejected the U.S. request, according to reports
from Islamabad, Pakistan's capital.
</P>
<P>
"We will never hand Ossama over to anyone and protect him with
our blood at all cost," the Afghan Islamic Press quoted Taliban
Chief Mulla Mohammad Omar as saying.

HANGZHOU, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The sea level near the coast of
east China's Zhejiang Province has been rising at a rate of two
millimeters a year for the past four decades, according to a
maritime scientist.
</P>
<P>
Ying Renfang, director of a research program on the rising sea
level near Zhejiang, said that the present rate is expected to
increase in the next century.
</P>
<P>
The research project, sponsored by the National Oceanography
Bureau, is exploring the relationship between the rising sea
level and the El Nino phenomenon, and will recommend a series of
measures to prevent possible harmful effects brought about by the
rising sea.
</P>
<P>
Ying said the rising level could cause serious typhoon and
flooding, and change the ecological environment of the coast.
</P>
<P>
The cities of Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangzhou have launched
similar studies in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Dell Computer Begins Direct Sales in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Dell Computer Corp., the world's
leading direct marketer of computer systems, began direct sales
today in China. The fastest growing computer firm now has found a
home in the world's fastest growing computer market.
</P>
<P>
Direct computer sales is a two-layer business operation based
on a direct relationship between the manufacturer and the customer
without intermediaries such as distributors and resellers.
</P>
<P>
Morton Topfer, vice chairman of Dell Computer, said in an
exclusive interview here today with Xinhua that the company's
direct sales will have nine locations in such major Chinese cities
as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
Customers can make purchases and request technical support via
toll-free 24-hour hotlines or by shopping at a virtual "store" on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Individual and corporate customers can receive Dell's
"built-to-order" service that is uniform around the world,
according to Topfer, and can choose from extensive configuration
choices.
</P>
<P>
Products will be delivered within seven working days after the
order is placed, he said, and technicians will provide next-day,
on-site installation and other support services.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts say the direct computer business will
generate strong incentives in China's fledgling computer market,
since cheaper computers with the latest software are more
attractive to potential buyers who have limited financial
resources.
</P>
<P>
In 14 years of business, Dell has become the second largest
computer systems company in the world after Compaq Computer
Corp.
</P>
<P>
Topfer attributed this success to the integration of research
and development, production, sales and after-sales service that
makes Dell more flexible to market changes and ready for
state-of-the-art technologies.
</P>
<P>
Jim King, sales and marketing vice president of Dell Computer
(China) Co., Ltd., said the Dell products available directly to
Chinese customers range from desktop and notebook personal
computer to servers. The Dell China Customer Center located in
Xiamen operates the manufacturing, sales and telephone services.
</P>
<P>
According to International Data Company's forecast at the end
of the first quarter, China's personal computer market is expected
to more than triple in size by 2002 to 10.6 million units, making
China the largest in the Asia Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The current annual sales of Dell is 15.2 billion U.S. dollars,
and the online Dell Store sells 6 million dollars of products and
services every day.

<HEADLINE> Former Iranian Minister Denies Taking Commissions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian Minister of Mines
and Metals Hussein Mahluj has denied that he and his deputy Ali
Shekarriz have received commissions in purchase deal, local daily
Tehran Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the daily, Mahluj rejected the report against
him carried in the latest issue of the Arzeshha (values) weekly.
</P>
<P>
The daily gave no details about the content of the letter, but
said the letter was also faxed to the State Audit Office (SAO),
the body in charge of the investigation into the alleged
embezzlement cases in the Mines and Metals Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Weekly has said that the SAO has found Mahluj and Shekarriz
guilty of taking 540,000 German marks (337,500 U.S. dollars) in
commission in a purchase deal of aluminum machinery for their
ministry when looking into alleged embezzlement cases in the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
The weekly also said the two officials have confessed to the
offense and the SAO has ordered them to return the money to the
state treasury.
</P>
<P>
And Mahluj is trying to convince the SAO to abort the ruling on
him as he is likely to be appointed ambassador to South Africa,
the weekly said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the SAO has sent a letter to the weekly's managing
director, saying that the case was still under investigation and
no final verdict on the former minister have been issued.
</P>
<P>
The SAO letter also said that Hashemi and Ghafurifard were not
found involved in any of the embezzlement cases.
</P>
<P>
According to the country's relevant laws, government officials
are prohibited from accepting commissions on state dealings.
</P>
<P>
However, the SAO only has the right to ask for the return of
the money and the judiciary can issue verdict to punish the
violators.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANZHIHUA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Over 45,000 people who had to
make way for China's largest hydro-electric power station this
century have been relocated this month..
</P>
<P>
Located on the Yalong River in southwest China's Sichuan
Province, the Ertan Hydro-Electric Power Station will have six
generating units each with a capacity of 550,000 kw. The first
generating unit has gone on line earlier this month on a trial
base.
</P>
<P>
The reservoir behind the dam began accumulating water in May,
submerging villages in 5 cities and counties and over 2130
hectares of farmland, and thus displacing 45,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The resettlement project designed for these displaced people is
known as the "Ertan Model" and is being conducted in strict
accordance with World Bank standards, which provided a loan of 93
million U.S. dollars for the construction of the station, sources
here said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the displaced people have been moved into new homes and
received financial compensation and land.
</P>
<P>
A new county seat and eight townships have been completed for
them. Since 1995, two billion yuan has been allocated for the
resettlement project and work has been done to meet the people's
material and cultural needs, according to Wang Chunyun, deputy
magistrate of Yanbian County.
</P>
<P>
As the water level continues to rise, more people are expected
to need to be relocated.

<HEADLINE> No EU Additional Fund for Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A European Commission official
said on Thursday that the executive body of the European Union had
no planning for additional financial aid for Russia right now.
</P>
<P>
Commission spokesman Verros Constantin told the press that the
European Council of Ministers had already drawn the line that all
commission financial aid would be channeled via either the World
Bank or the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
He said: "The commission continues to support the IMF aid
package."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Commission President Jacques Santer had
asked commission services to study ways as to how to assist Russia
to get out of its crisis of budgetary stability.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission will meet on September 3, immediately
after its summer recess, to discuss the development of situation
in Russia.
</P>
<P>
"The commission is willing to offer assistance in the country's
restructuring," said the official, "but the Russian authorities
have to do their part."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that the Russian central bank and monetary
monitoring authorities still need to do more to render outside
assistance effective.
</P>
<P>
When asked what tangible assistance the commission is
providing, the official said that the European Union has been
helping Russia through the TACIS technical assistance program.
</P>
<P>
The TACIS technical aid program is aimed at helping the central
and eastern European countries as well as Russia.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Political Groups Refuse to Register </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of about 100
newly-emerged political associations have rejected the idea they
should be screened and registered by the government before they
can participate in the country's new democratization process as
political parties.
</P>
<P>
They made their position known in a meeting with the
Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) Wednesday in Abuja, the
federal capital.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the All Nigerian Congress and 20 other
political groups in the south, former governor of Oyo State,
Chief Bola Ige said there was no need for registration of
parties.
</P>
<P>
"Political parties formed by citizens need to be recognized by
INEC," he was quoted by the Post Express newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also said that since the government would not fund the new
parties, there was no need for the government to monitor their
finances just as there should be no rules to govern the parties
except the rules for campaigns.
</P>
<P>
On the elections, he suggested that all the polls should take
place at about the same time, as well as the handover in all
tiers of government.
</P>
<P>
Ige also rejected the idea of screening candidates by the
secret police, State Security Services (SSS), saying that once a
candidate meets the criteria in the constitution of the country,
he should be eligible to contest for election.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the INEC should be enlarged so that all the
parties will have their representatives in it.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Ige's position received almost
universal support from the political groups, who then followed by
one and another in making one or two additions of their own.
</P>
<P>
The INEC chairman, Justice Ephraim Akpata, however, insisted
that political groups must be registered as it is demanded by the
law.
</P>
<P>
He cited provisions of the Decree No. 17 of 1998 which
establishes the INEC and the 1995 draft constitution to support
his point.
</P>
<P>
"We are independent, but certainly not above the law and we
should not be seen to subvert it," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the new transition to civil rule program
announced by Nigerian military leader, General Abdulsalam
Abubakar, the country will hold a presidential election in the
first quarter of 1999, while the new civilian president will
assume office on May 29, 1999.

<HEADLINE> China Refutes Currency Devaluation Rumors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- China today strongly refuted
rumors that its currency will be devalued and reaffirmed that
the yuan will remain solid.
</P>
<P>
"Recently, especially since August 3, there has been a sudden
renewal of rumors that the yuan will be devalued, and this is
rather confusing," Li Fuxiang, deputy director of the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange, told a seminar on the Asian
financial crisis and the development of financial markets in the
Chinese mainland and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It is well known that China's balance of international payments
remains strong, that the internal economic structure and economic
fundamentals have not changed significantly, and that no new
factors affecting the exchange rate of the yuan have emerged, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
"The spread of yuan-devaluation rumors under this sort of
situation is an abnormal phenomenon," he said.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of the yuan is determined by basic
economic factors, Li said, adding that China's exports still have
great potential yet to be tapped, and overseas investors are
confident about China's economic prospects.
</P>
<P>
Li also said China's foreign debt structure is reasonable and
that its huge foreign exchange reserves, which were valued at more
than 140 billion U.S. dollars at the end of June, have provided a
firm backing for the yuan's stability.
</P>
<P>
"It's unwise and unnecessary to devalue the yuan, and the yuan
will not be devalued," Li noted.

<HEADLINE> Technicians Help Two Million Farmers in Shaanxi Out of Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Some two million farmers in
northern Shaanxi Province in northwest China have bid farewell
to poverty, thanks to the help of agricultural technicians from
across the country.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 25 poor counties in the region, which
was China's old revolutionary base, farmers had an average annual
net income of 923 yuan in 1997, as against 440 yuan in 1990.
</P>
<P>
A scientific poverty-alleviation program, initiated by the
Ministry of Science and Technology and certain local departments
in 1990, helped provide the region with thousands of agricultural
technicians from both inside and outside the province.
</P>
<P>
"The technicians are good advisers for the farmers," said Cao
Jiuwang, a 55-year-old farmer who became better-off after
attending training classes organized by the technicians.
</P>
<P>
Cao is only one of the 800,000 beneficiaries of various kinds
of training classes, said a local official.
</P>
<P>
"More agricultural technicians will be assigned to help
implement the program within the next three years so that
the region's 500,000 farmers still living under the state-set
poverty line can get out of poverty before the end of the
century," he said.

<HEADLINE> Transport Costs Lowered in African Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) has lowered transport costs
by liberalizing and harmonizing regimes and reducing bottlenecks
in the transport sector.
</P>
<P>
Africa Recovery, a publication of the United Nations, reported
in its latest issue that COMESA has made substantial progress in
simplifying, modernizing and harmonizing customs and transit
procedures, thus facilitating and improving transport and trade.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA Assistant Secretary-General for the program,
Sindiso Ngwenya, said that harmonization is essential for the
creation of a single and liberalized market.
</P>
<P>
He said, this has helped to bring down transport costs and
make headway towards a free trade area, expected to be
established by the year 2000, adding that COMESA is also expected
to establish a customs union by 2004.
</P>
<P>
The report said the reduction of trade tariffs and customs
duties have contributed to an increase in intra-COMESA and
third-party trade and the harmonized transit regimes have also
played a crucial role, encouraging profits and economic growth
among the member countries.
</P>
<P>
Trade among COMESA countries was worth 2.7 billion U.S.
Dollars in 1997, compared to 834 million U.S. Dollars 12 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
The annual growth of trade with third parties averaged 7.1
percent and economic growth reached 4.5 percent in 1997, the
highest recorded over the last 10 years in the economic grouping.
</P>
<P>
COMESA was established in 1994 on the basis of the
preferential trade area for eastern and southern africa with over
20 member countries.

<HEADLINE> China to Import Traffic Monitoring System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- China plans to import an
advanced traffic monitoring system from the United States by the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The plan was announced during a recent Shanghai symposium
sponsored by the Shanghai Municipal Communications and
Transportation Association, Nanfang Satellite Telecommunications
Service Co. Ltd. from Guangdong Province, and US-base Qualcomm
Incorporated.
</P>
<P>
Qualcomm developed the monitoring system -- Omni TRACS -- on
the basis of patented CDMA technology. The system will use
satellites to transmit two-way information on a 24 hour basis and
provided accurate positioning reports involving accidents and
various other highway emergencies.
</P>
<P>
Omni TRACS has been introduced to more than 30 countries and
regions since 1989. The system has played a major role in
improving the efficiency of highway communications, transportation
and managing the flow of materials.
</P>
<P>
China has built 3,000 km of expressways since the
Shenyang-Dalian Expressway, the first in the country, opened to
traffic in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Plans call for increasing the length of operational expressways
to 6,500 km by the year 2000. China engaged in an extensive effort
to spur economic development by allocating massive funding to
develop infrastructure, including the expressway and highway
networks.
</P>
<P>
Experts expect the new system to enhance the nation's
management expertise related to highway communications and
transportation. They noted the system will have a profound impact
on the nation's transportation sector.

BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Guangzhao, vice chairman of
the National People's Congress Standing Committee, today called on
young Chinese scientists worldwide to make greater contributions
to the country's scientific and technological development in the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, chairman of the China Science and Technology Association
(CSTA), issued the appeal at the opening ceremony of the third
CSTA annual meeting of young scientists.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China must substantially increase the
production of grain, meat, sugar, aquatic products and cooking
oil in order to meet the needs of its growing population
which is expected to hit 1.6 billion at some point around the year
2040.
</P>
<P>
Zhou noted limited possibilities for expanding arable land and
stressed the solution to the problem will lie in relying on the
development of agricultural technology.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has sent a large contingent of young
students abroad for advanced studies over the past 20 yeas, with
the figure supplemented by a significant number of self-sponsored
students.
</P>
<P>
Zhou added that a substantial number of students have returned
and are playing an important role in China's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Young scholars remaining abroad have provided diversified
scientific technological services for the motherland, according to
Zhou.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is expected to help overseas Chinese scientists
learn more about China's most recent scientific and technological
developments and introduce avenues enabling them to contribute to
the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The 700 young scholars and experts attending the three-day
meeting to promote academic exchanges will discuss four major
topics -- information science and microelectronics, biological
science and technology, materials science and engineering, and
environmental resource and sustainable development technology.

LUANDA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has
ordered to freeze all the assets and other interests of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).

The Angolan News Agency Thursday quoted a Washington source as
saying that the holidaying Clinton issued the order Wednesday in

said that his move is to implement the United Nations' No.1173
resolution on sanctioning UNITA.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the sanction, passed in June this year, is to cut
off UNITA's economic supply.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Jordan Develops Biblical Sites to Boost Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordan is speeding up the
excavation and development of its bible-related sites as part of
its efforts to boost tourism, the semi-official Jordan Times
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The most prominent one of these sites is called "Maghtas" in
Arabic, where archaeologists believe John the Baptist performed
baptisms and Jesus Christ visited on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
Teams from Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities have been
excavating around the clock at the site on the eastern bank of the
River of Jordan and the site is open to tourists by the end of
1999, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the archaeologists are preparing for tourists
another site, where it is said that Jesus Christ spent a 40-day
retreat after his baptism.
</P>
<P>
The digging there has so far led to the discovery of ancient
churches, mosaic floors and ancient water systems, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a route used by Christian pilgrims
hundreds of years ago was found.
</P>
<P>
The route started from Jerusalem, passed through the River of
Jordan and ended in Madaba, 30 kilometers south to Amman.
</P>
<P>
Near Madaba is the Mount Nebo, where the Prophet Moses' burial
site is located and an ancient church, dating back to 560 A.D. was
discovered, in which a Byzantine mosaic map of the Holy Land was
found.
</P>
<P>
The government is working to make the route one of the most
attractive spots for travelers.
</P>
<P>
In northern Jordan, the paper said, there is another biblical
site named Um Qais. It is said that Jesus Christ performed the
miracle of the Gadarene swine there.
</P>
<P>
The religious sites may greatly help Jordan boost its tourism
if they are excavated, developed, advertized and protected
properly, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The bible-related sites, combined with religious ceremonies,
cultural and musical events, can make Jordan "an interesting
destination" for travelers, said Marwan Khoury, Managing Director
of the government-financed Jordan Tourism Board.
</P>
<P>
Tourism, which used to be Jordan's pillar industry before the
1991 Gulf War, set off by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, has been
stagnant due to the instability in the region.

<P>
KAMPALA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan First Lady Janet
Museveni has opened a women's bank in Pakwach town in the
country's West Nile district.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release from the President's Office
Thursday, the first lady who is on a two-day visit to the
district said the bank will help empower women in the area
economically.
</P>
<P>
The bank, which mobilized a capital of 10 million Ugandan
shillings (8,000 U.S. Dollars) from 1,154 women share-holders,
also received some assistance from the Private Sector Development
Program (PSDP).
</P>
<P>
It saves people from moving long distances with large sums of
money and also provides a number of facilities to rural women
which other commercial banks cannot provide to them.
</P>
<P>
Ephraim Kamuntu, the national coordinator of PSDP who was
accompanying the first lady, said that millions of Ugandans in
rural areas have no access to bank services, resulting in 33
percent of the money in circulation in Uganda outside the banking
system.
</P>
<P>
This bank will play a very big role in tapping such money and
put it in the bank system, he asserted.

LAGOS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- At least 14 people, including
two pregnant women and a five-month-old child, were killed
Tuesday in a renewed communal conflict in Ile Ife, an ancient
city in southwest Nigeria's Osun State.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here Thursday said the deceased were all
farmers from the Ogudu village in Ife East Local Government area.
</P>
<P>
They were on their way to the farm when the assailants came in
a vehicle, the report said.

<HEADLINE> PNG Moves to Push Peace Process in Bougainville </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Papua New Guinea (PNG)
government Thursday withdrew the authority of the PNG Defense
Force to carry out military operations on the war-torn island of
Bougainville in a move to advance the peace process there.
</P>
<P>
"The cabinet met yesterday and made the latest and bold
decision in terms of rescinding the call-out on Bougainville," PNG
Prime Minister Bill Skate was quoted by the Australian Associated
Press (AAP) as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A call-out order originally made in 1989 authorized the
deployment of combat troops on Bougainville to support police
after sustained civil unrest on the island. The call-out was
renewed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Rebel leaders on Bougainville have been pushing for an end to
the call-out and are also demanding independence from PNG.
</P>
<P>
Skate said he hoped the decision to end the call-out would help
"achieve peace through peaceful means".
</P>
<P>
Asked if he expected that an end to the call-out would prompt
Bougainville rebels to disarm, Skate said: "That's the whole idea.
There must be trust. The Papua New Guinea government is doing its
part and we expect the parties on the other side will also do the
same."
</P>
<P>
The 10-year civil war on Bougainville ended this year with the
signing of the Lincoln Peace Agreement in New Zealand between the
PNG government and Bougainville rebels.
</P>
<P>
Skate said it was hoped that a date could soon be set for a
meeting of Bougainville leaders and the PNG government to further
discuss the peace process and move toward a reconciliation
government for Bougainville.
</P>
<P>
Bougainville leaders are now meeting at Buin, in Bougainville's
south, to determine a common position in future talks with the
Skate government, the AAP said.

<HEADLINE> APEC Business Summit to Focus on Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Business Summit meeting in
Malaysia will focus on the financial crisis in Asia and steps to
restore investors' confidence in the region, officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The four-day meeting beginning on November 14 in Kuala Lumpur
would highlight critical issues related to the liberalization of
the global financial systems and the extent of the role and
contribution of APEC in addressing these problems, Abdullah Mat
Zaid, co-chairman of the organizing committee for the APEC
Business Summit Malaysia 1998, said at a press conference in
Petaling Jaya near here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The APEC Business Summit to be hosted by the APEC Business
Advisory Council (ABAC) would provide a golden opportunity for all
corporations, foreign and local, to strategize on how to deal with
the present economic contagion, the official said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, about 1,500 chief executives,
corporate leaders and economists from APEC members are expected
to attend the summit, which is also aimed at promoting business
and strategic alliances between entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said, "Identifying new business, investment and
technology transfer opportunities would also be accorded top
priority by corporate leaders."
</P>
<P>
He said frank discussions would also be held by leading
corporate leaders in the region on foreign direct investment
opportunities and how opportunities arise from the present risk
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
"New areas where foreign investors can benefit from direct
investments would also be closely examined," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urges Switzerland to Support, Protect Diplomats in Geneva </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Director-General of the United
Nations Office at Geneva (UNOG) Vladimir Petrovsky has called on
the Swiss authorities to help diplomatic missions of the least
developed countries by cutting the cost of living in the city of
Geneva.
</P>
<P>
"Some of these missions can barely make ends meet due to the
high cost of living, which of course seriously hampers their ability
to perform their duties," Petrovsky told Swiss parliament members
at a seminar on the U.N. and Switzerland held at UNOG Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Support from Switzerland could considerably help to improve
the situation," said Petrovsky, who is also
U.N. under-secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the seminar, Petrovsky raised another issue of
major concern -- security, saying that "the diplomatic community
is increasingly concerned about its security" in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
"Some diplomats are complaining loudly, thus damaging the image
of Geneva as a safe place for international interactions," he
said. "I believe that with the continued help and more active
involvement of the authorities of the host country we will be able
to solve this problem."
</P>
<P>
Affirming Switzerland's positive role in the history of
internationalism and its involvement with the U.N., Petrovsky
stressed that international organizations have also contributed
significantly to the identity of Geneva as a leading city in world
affairs, and they play an important role in the local economy.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, a mutually beneficial synergy has emerged and it
provides a sound base for Geneva within the U.N. system," he
added.

<HEADLINE> ARATS Contacts SEF Concerning Death of Taiwan Businessman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) today supplied the Taiwan-based
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) with information concerning the
recent death of Wang Fujing, a 40-year-old Taiwan businessman who
died in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone (SEZ), Guangdong
Province.
</P>
<P>
Wang, a resident from Kaohsiung, was on the
board of directors for a Shenzhen packaging firm. Wang joined
three people, including his brother Wang Fukuan, chairman of the
company's board of directors, for supper on the afternoon
of July 12.
</P>
<P>
Wang left the group shortly after supper and disappeared.
</P>
<P>
The company reported his disappearance to the local public
security bureau on July 15, and his body was discovered in a well
on Fenghuang Hill in the city's Bao'an District on the afternoon
of July 27.
</P>
<P>
Company representatives identified the body as that of Wang
Fujing on July 29, and a preliminary investigation by medical
experts cited suffocation as the cause of death.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities arrested Wang Lei, a 25-year-old suspect, on
August 12. The alleged perpetrator, a native of central China's
Henan Province, worked as a security guard for the Jinfang
Mortgage Company located in the Futian District.
</P>
<P>
The suspect confessed his involvement in the crime perpetrated
on the evening of July 12. Wang Lei told investigators that Taiwan
resident Chen Rongbiao, the 28-year-old board chairman of a
mortgage company, hired him and another local resident to assist
Wu Wunshun, a 38-year-old Taiwan resident, in the murder.
</P>
<P>
He also told authorities that the murder took place in Chen's
home. The perpetrators removed the victims clothing and placed the
corpse in the aforementioned well. Chen paid the perpetrators
20,000 yuan for committing the heinous crime.
</P>
<P>
Chen Rongbiao and Wu Wunshun fled to Taiwan shortly after the
homicide and ARATS called on Taiwan law enforcement departments to
provide assistance in determining their current whereabouts and to
return the suspects to Shenzhen to answer questions concerning the
ongoing investigation.

<HEADLINE> Largest Hydro-Power Station Has Positive Ecological Impact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANZHIHUA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Ertan Hydro-electric Power
Station, China's largest built in this century, will not only
provide a vast supply of electricity to southwest China, but will
improve the region's ecology as well.
</P>
<P>
The station's 101-sq-km reservoir, which went into partial
operation last week, is playing a vital role in adjusting the
climate of the surrounding mountain valleys of the Yalong River at
Panzhihua in Sichuan Province, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
Because of this adjustment, the previously sub-tropical dry
climate is turning more humid, making it better suited for
vegetation and animal life.
</P>
<P>
After touring the area, a World Bank environmental protection
delegation noted that strict measures taken during the
construction have resulted in an improved environment, which will
be conducive to alleviating soil erosion and reinforcing control.
</P>
<P>
A round-the-lake tree belt costing more than 1.9 million yuan
(229,000 U.S. dollars) is believed to be especially good for
reducing water silt and controlling soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
An environmental center is also playing an effective role in
monitoring water levels, rainfall, water and air quality and
pollution, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
With a designed generating capacity of 3.3 million KW, the
Ertan power station will become fully operational next year.

<HEADLINE> French FM to Measure Openness of Iran During Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said Thursday that he will measure Iran's will for
openness and the force of resistance it has met with during his
forthcoming visit to this Asian country on August 22-23.
</P>
<P>
"One cannot let pass the chance of a real evolution of this
country which is at a strategic moment," he said in an interview
with the private Radio-Television Luxembourg, on the eve of
his visit to Teheran.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first visit by a French foreign minister to
Iran since 1990 when former Foreign Minister Roland Dumas paid a
visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine also expressed his conviction in the intention of
Iranian President Mohammed Khatami to open up the country.
</P>
<P>
"It is about to measure what are the possibilities for the new
leaders to impose this line, because there is also the resistance
to this line, and that has the repercussions on a very great
number of problems or the conflicts which appear in this region,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the foreign minister will also discuss with
Iranian leaders the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Asked if it is possible for French President Jacques Chirac or
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin to visit Iran in the foreseeable
future, Vedrine answered, "We will see. We are not there yet."

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- For the second day running,
most of the action in the Australian dollar was in offshore trade
with the unit hit hard after a failed attempt in New York to push
it through 60 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The currency limped into the local session Thursday over half a
U.S. cent lower with further downside imminent until a lift in the
yen helped hold it just above 59 U.S. cents for most of the local
trade.
</P>
<P>
It eventually closed the session here at 59.13 U.S. cents, well
down from Wednesday's 59.78.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the unit sank quickly in "wild and heavy" trade in
New York and, breaking its recent symbiosis with the yen, was also
sold against that currency.
</P>
<P>
"A big sell order last night in the London/New York time zone
basically took the Aussie from 59.95 to 58.95 in New York and we
believe it was a very large Aussie/sterling sell order," Brent
Aggar, associate director of foreign exchange at Macquarie Bank,
said.
</P>
<P>
Adding to the somber local mood Thursday morning was a weaker
New Zealand dollar, following a larger-than-expected easing of
monetary conditions by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Aggar said the Australian currency was then oversold in
domestic trade, hitting a low of 58.87 U.S. cents before
rebounding to 59.25.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished at 84.52 yen, up from 86.26
Wednesday, while the local unit was buying 1.0600 German marks
from 1.0766.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Reports 8.5 Percent Growth For First Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region
registered an economic growth of 8.5 percent for the first half of
this year, and the regional government is striving for a 10
percent growth for the entire year.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said the domestic gross product (GDP) for the
January-June period in Tibet reached 2.67 billion yuan (322
million US dollars), up 8.5 percent over the same period last
year. The commodity retail price index dropped by 3.6 percentage
points, while the cost of housing was down 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Industrial growth for the first half year increased by 4.4
percent, while foreign trade volume expanded by over 200 percent
to reach 71.5 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tax revenues during the first half were more than 269 million
yuan, (32.4 million US dollars), an increase of 26 percent over
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Despite natural disasters including snowstorms, drought and floods
which assaulted the region last winter and spring, agricultural
production remained stable. Officials expect another bumper harvest
this autumn, baring major natural calamities.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous regional government has set a goal of 10
percent economic growth for this year, and to meet this target it
plans to increase investment in infrastructures and major capital
construction projects in the remaining months. Home construction
will receive priority, officials said.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Enforces New Rules on Marine Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- New regulations on marine
pollution that prohibit dumping of garbage at sea and place
controls on pollution from ships and boats into the marine
environment came into effect in New Zealand Thursday.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Minister of Conservation Nick Smith said in a
statement: "We have treated the coastlines and oceans as a dumping
ground for too long. It is timely in this International Year of
the Oceans that we lift our act and start treating the marine
environment with some respect. These new regulations are a huge
step forward and should be welcomed."
</P>
<P>
The new regulations place nationwide restrictions on dumping of
garbage including plastics, lining and package materials.
</P>
<P>
Under the regulations, ships or boats without a treatment
facility will not be allowed to discharge sewage closer than 500
meters to shore or to a marine farm, or if the depth of water is
less than five meters. Those with a treatment system are allowed
to discharge anywhere except within 100 meters of a marine farm.
</P>
<P>
The regulations provide a nationwide benchmark but regional
councils will be able to increase the 500 meters distance from
shore and five meters depth provision by a rule in the regional
coastal plan.
</P>
<P>
The regulations also control the discharge of oil and noxious

<HEADLINE> More Women Are Gainfully-employed in Sweden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, August 20 (Xinhua) -- More women in Sweden are
gainfully-employed than men, according to Statistics Sweden on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of gainfully-employed women between the age of 20
and 64 rose to 78 percent in 1970-97 while the corresponding
figure for men dropped from 90 to 84 percent, the organization
said in its latest report on gender equality.
</P>
<P>
Women could shuttle between paid work and child care while men
enhance their working status with economic, political and union
power.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the narrowing employment gap, most working
women still carried the burden of child-rearing with 90 percent of
them taking days off in 1997 for child care. Men, on the other
hand, enjoyed better income and benefits and held 70 percent of
the seats in labor union boards, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Earliest Vascular Plant Found in Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese scientists
claim to have found the world's oldest vascular plant, dating
back 428 million years ago, in southwest China's Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
This discovery is three million years earlier than that of the
Cooksonia, another species of senior plant dating back 425
million years, which was discovered in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The Cooksonia has been generally accepted as the first vascular
plant on Earth.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yi, an expert with the Nanjing Palaeobotany Research
Institute attached to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that
about 428 million years ago this type of one-meter-tall plant with
feather-shaped twigs for leaves grew on the shore of a peaceful
bay, now the land of Fenggang County.
</P>
<P>
The plant was found by a team of Chinese scientists, including
two academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in an
outcropping section at Dongkala in Fenggang County, 300 km from
Guizhou, capital city of Guizhou Province, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The plant has an academic Latin name -- Pinnatiramosus
Qianensis Geng -- and is the oldest reported vascular plant from
the Siliurian Period, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Wang reported his discovery to the public in an article
published by the British science magazine "Nature."
</P>
<P>
Wang and his team proved that the plant, which was sometimes
covered by tidal waves and sometimes stood above the smooth
sea water, is the earliest vascular plant species on Earth.
</P>
<P>
What the earliest vascular plants looked like, and when and
where they began to appear on Earth, are questions that have
concerned and interested many specialists for a long time, Wang
said.
</P>
<P>
"All land plants were the result of slow evolution of aquatic
plants." said Wang.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 70 percent of the newly discovered plant is made
up of single-trilete spores, most of which are characteristic and
dominate the structure of ancient vascular plants, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"The vascular plants could propagate themselves by their
spores," said Wang, and as a result it may be possible to find
many vascular plant species in southwest China, where scientists
have already found the earliest fossils of aquatic plants and
animals with complete skeletons.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Hold Talks Without </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
officials held three rounds of talks in the last few days but no
progress had been made concerning the long overdue Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank, it was disclosed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli negotiators Yitzhak Molcho held two rounds of talks
with Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker Ahmed Qureia (Abu
Ala) in Jerusalem last week, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz
reported. He also met with Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat in Gaza last Sunday, the report said.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Molcho repeatedly offered the Palestinians
an area in the southern Judean Desert as part of a further West
Bank withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
But both Arafat and Qureia rejected the proposal because Molcho
refused to reclassify the area an "Area B" which would eventually
become fully Palestinian territories under signed agreements,
Haaretz quoted sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with Arafat, Molcho defended Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's refusal to give the nature reserve envisioned
by Israel an Area B status for fear of attacks from the
right-wing of his coalition, including National Infrastructure
Minister Ariel Sharon, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Since the resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian talks last
month, Israel has refused, as it did in the past, to accept a
U.S. proposal which calls for an additional 13.1 percent Israeli
troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Molcho has routinely urged the Palestinians to accept
the Israeli proposal that Israel pullback from 10 percent of the
West Bank and designate a further 3 percent as a nature reserve,
where the Palestinians would only have limited powers.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have insisted they would not accept the
proposal unless the so-called "nature reserve" would be clearly
classified as "Area B."
</P>
<P>
Sharon said in Tel Aviv Tuesday that Israel has agreed to
carry out the American initiative and withdraw from a total of 13
percent of the West bank, but senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat dismissed the statements as "maneuvers and games."

<HEADLINE> First World Bank-Financed Highway in Xinjiang Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank-financed
Turpan-Urumqi-Dahuangshan top-grade highway in northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region opened to traffic today.
</P>
<P>
The 283-km highway begins in Turpan, a well-known tourist city
south of the Tianshan Mountains, traverses westward through the
Tianshan Range via the town of Daban to reach Urumqi, and then
connects with the existing national highway at Dahuangshan after
turning eastward and passing Miquan and Fukang cities north of the
Tianshan Range.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the highway began in March 1995 and cost three
billion yuan (361 million U.S. dollars), including 150 million
U.S. dollars in loans from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The highway was built quickly and efficiently utilizing
standard international management and construction practices.
</P>
<P>
The new highway traverses a region of great potential for
economic development, with more than 180 large and medium-sized
enterprises along the way. The total industrial and agricultural
output value of these enterprises accounts for more than 60
percent of Xinjiang's total, and their combined gross domestic
product (GDP) make up 71 percent of the region's total.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1990s, border trade between China and the
countries of Central Asia has continued to grow, with an annual
trade volume of 20 million tons, making transportation vital
and creating great pressure on the highway network.
</P>
<P>
Abdul'ahat Abdurixit, chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Regional Government, said that the opening of the new highway will
effectively improve transportation in this remote region of China,
and will play a vital role in promoting local economic and social
development, and in creating a sound investment environment.

earlier forecasting is international situation becoming "evidently
more serious".
</P>
<P>
"At the end of June, I suggested that the Asian crisis could
well constitute the most adverse shock to hit the New Zealand
economy," Brash said.
</P>
<P>
The expected growth of 0.1 percent in New Zealand's GDP in the
financial year would be the worst for eight years. The rapid
deterioration in the economy from three months ago sparked the
central bank to unveil a massive easing in monetary policy today.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Governor Brash announced that the Reserve
Bank cut the preferred level for the Monetary Conditions Index
(MCI) from 350 to zero.
</P>
<P>
The MCI measures the NZ dollar and interest rates. A lowering
of the bank's target level means it is approving recent falls in
the currency and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
According to a Wellington-based newspaper, the easing caused
wholesale interest rates to dive and helped put a rocket under the
share market.
</P>
<P>
"Lower interest rates boost spending and business investment,
helping pull the economy out of the doldrums," the Evening Post
said.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Brash as saying that there is scope for
further easing, with the MCI likely to fall as low as negative
225 before rising slowly in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to Brash, the Asian crisis, the fall of the Japanese
yen and the Australian dollar, and a shrinking of New Zealand
economy in the first half of the year are all factors in easing
monetary policy.

<HEADLINE> Yen Rises in Tokyo After Intervention Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese yen gained ground
against the dollar Thursday after Japanese vice finance minister,
Eisuke Sakakibara, warned that Tokyo was ready to intervene in the
currency markets.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar dropped to 142 yen level in Tokyo Thursday for
the first time in three weeks on fears of the market intervention
by Japanese financial authorities.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency was quoted at 142.54-56 yen at 5 p.m. (local
time), down from 143.79-81 yen at 9 a.m. in Tokyo and from 143.80-90
yen late Wednesday in New York.
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose to 144.20 yen during the morning, but fell to
142.28 yen later in the day after intervention fears were revived.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time since July 30 the dollar was traded at the
142 yen level in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Market players stepped up yen buying after a senior Japanese
financial official reportedly said the yen's weakness has to be
corrected, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
Overseas fund operators and life insurers were major yen-buyers
during the day, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
One dealer said that the yen was supported by news that the merger
between the ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan (LTCB) and Sumitomo
Trust and Banking Co. was on track.
</P>
<P>
News reports said that the government may provide public funds to
facilitate the planned merger and keep stability in the financial
sector.
</P>
<P>
The market sentiment did not change, even though Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi denied that the government had decided to use funds for
LTCB, dealers said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Tightens Hold on Jerusalem, Says PLC Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Legislative Council
speaker warned Thursday that Israel is implementing a more
aggressive policy on Jerusalem, the holy city the Palestinians
want as their future capital.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Qureia (Abu Ala) raised the alarm in an interview with
Egypt's Voice of Arabs radio.
</P>
<P>
But for the Arabs in general and the Palestinians in
particular, "without Jerusalem there will be no peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The holy city is the synonym for peace to Palestinians. It is
the red line that can not be crossed," he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel's stance towards Jerusalem has not changed at all, in
fact, it is becoming more aggressive, despite of all international
resolutions and the signed agreements that stipulate that the holy
city is one of the issues of the final-phase negotiations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the policy of Tel Aviv as procrastination, Qureia
said Israel is determined to bring about radical changes to the
signed peace agreements between the Palestinians and Israelis
since 1993.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has declined an invitation to a meeting in Norway next
week marking the fifth anniversary of the Oslo peace accords,
citing his busy engagement at home.
</P>
<P>
In a move that has sparked strong Arab condemnations, the
Israeli cabinet passed a decision on June 21 on expanding the
municipal borders of Jerusalem to cover surrounding settlements
and vast areas of the West Bank territories.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured East Jerusalem in 1967 and later annexed it, a
move that has failed to win international recognition. The
Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future
state.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks were deadlocked in March
last year over Israel's settlement building in East Jerusalem and
long-delayed troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The recent talks between the two sides failed to achieve any
progress because Israel has rejected a U.S. initiative on further
redeployment, which has been accepted by the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Long March 2C, 3B Become Major Carrier Rockets In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese Long March 2C
carrier rocket carried two U.S. satellites into orbit today.
</P>
<P>
This follows the successful launch of a Long March 3B on June
13, carrying a Sinosat-1 telecommunications satellite of France's
Aerospatiale.
</P>
<P>
The two launches have helped establish the Long March 2C and 3B
rockets' usefulness for commercial satellites, analysts say. China
has put 9 Long March models into production, and the two types of
rockets have gained an international reputation and resulted in
many contracts.
</P>
<P>
The improved Long March 2C, which has a 2.5-ton payload, is
mainly used to carry satellites into their perigean orbit and
circular orbit.
</P>
<P>
The 3B, with a 5-ton payload, is China's most powerful carrier
rocket and is mainly used to carry satellites into geosynchronous
orbit.
</P>
<P>
The 2C made its debut on September 9, 1982. Improved models
have been used in 16 successful launches and have carried 21
satellites into orbit.
</P>
<P>
The 3B three-stage liquid-fuel heavy-thrust cluster carrier
failed in its first launch in 1997, but has had successful
launches after the model was improved.

<HEADLINE> France Backs International Conference on Great Lakes Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- France supports the holding of an
international conference on peace for the Great Lakes region in
Africa, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Radio-Television Luxembourg (RTL), Vedrine
considered the idea, which was suggested by President Jacques
Chirac several months ago, as being "of greater importance than
ever."
</P>
<P>
Such a conference should include all the countries in the
region, he said.
</P>
<P>
"These countries should try to find together the conditions of
coexistence," he said in reference to the accusation by the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that Rwanda and Uganda are
involved in the rebellion in the country.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine hinted that at present it is too early to say who
should at the conference represent the DRC, which is undergoing a
civil war between the government of President Laurent Kabila and
Tutsi Banyamulenge rebels.
</P>
<P>
He said France is neutral in the on-going conflict in the DRC,
although it thinks it is a regional conflict rather than one of
a single nation.

<HEADLINE> Flood-Stricken Province Vows to Help Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Education Commission of
Hunan Province in central China has vowed to help all its students
return to school by September 1, when the new semester begins.
</P>
<P>
The provincial education authorities have allocated 15 percent
of the province's total education budget to help rebuild flooded
schools, an official with the Provincial Education Commission
said today.
</P>
<P>
Serious floods this year have damaged over 20,000 schools in
the province, 734 of them destroyed or submerged by the floods,
according to authorities.
</P>
<P>
Because of this year's flooding, some 230,000 local students
were forced to stay at home, and schools closed their doors to
students earlier than in previous years.
</P>
<P>
A survey shows that Hunan may have nearly 600,000 students who
are in danger of becoming drop-outs because of the severe losses
suffered by their families.
</P>
<P>
Provincial education official disclosed that to date, a total
of 8 million yuan has been raised to rebuild flooded schools, and
non-flooded localities are also encouraged to lend a helping hand
to these schools.
</P>
<P>
Local health departments will make strict examinations of the
flooded schools to guarantee they are free from any potential
health hazards.

<HEADLINE> Australian Company Profits Higher Than Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Australian company profits
released here Thursday showed minimal signs of slowing in the
second quarter of this year, contrasting with previous surveys of
sentiment that showed business was feeling the pinch of the Asian
economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
Company profits rose 2.8 percent before income tax, net
interest and depreciation in the second quarter to 7.6 billion
U.S. dollars, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This came on the back of a strong first quarter, where profits
had risen a revised 9.3 percent from the 8.6 percent reported
earlier.
</P>
<P>
"It's a puzzle this number. It poses more questions than it
answers," Andrew Pease, senior economist with Nomura Australia
said.
</P>
<P>
"It's surprisingly strong and surprising in its composition,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
As about 60 percent of Australia's goods and services exports
go to Asia, business communities in Australia have been worried
about the impact of the Asian economic crisis on Australia.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Kirchner, senior economist with Standard &AMP; Poor's MMS,
said it was too early to see the full impact of Asia on corporate
balance sheets.
</P>
<P>
"The full effects of Asia on corporate balance sheets will
probably not be seen until the second half of the year, as today's
profit results from Qantas illustrate," Kirchner said.
</P>
<P>
Australia's flagship air carrier Qantas Airways Ltd. has defied
Asia's economic turmoil and market expectations to produce a
stunning 20.6 percent lift in net earnings of 184 million U.S.
dollars for the financial year ending June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The airline's performance was underpinned by its domestic
airline operations and by further cost cutting, while the fall in
revenue from Asian services was offset by improved performances
mainly to the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
But Australia's tourism industry continued to feel the heat of
the Asian crisis as tourist numbers from Southeast Asia plunged by
28.8 percent last month to 39,600 and the numbers from northeast
Asia fell by 16.7 percent to 115,000 from the same month of last
year.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Syria Sign Document of Oil Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraq and Syria on Thursday
signed joint minutes to jointly rehabilitate an Iraqi-Syrian
pipeline and cooperate to promote oil cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency said the minutes was signed by Iraqi Oil
Minister Amir Mohammed Rashid and his Syrian counterpart Mohammed
Maher Jamal, who arrived in Baghdad on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rashid and Jamal on Wednesday held talks in Iraqi Oil ministry
and discussed the executive plans of the joint agreement signed in
last July during Rashid's Damascus trip.
</P>
<P>
Under the joint agreement, the two countries agreed to reopen
the pipeline from Iraq's northern oil fields in Kirkuk to the
Syrian port city Banias, and to construct a new pipeline with a
capacity larger than the current one to meet Iraq's exporting
requirements in the future.
</P>
<P>
Jamal's visit, the first by a Syrian oil minister in 18 years,
is another effort in the normalization of the bilateral
relations. During the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), Syria was the
only Arab state that sided with Iran.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Waters Not Polluted by Israeli Sewage, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian waters in the Gulf of
Aqaba are not polluted in a sewage main break in Israeli coastal
city of Eilat, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Tests conducted by the Royal Scientific Society and some
independent environmentalists since August 17 did not find "any
noticeable pollution in our waters," Akef Abu Tayeh, vice
president of the Aqaba Region Authority said.
</P>
<P>
"We have been testing consistently since August 17 when the
Israeli Ministry of Environment informed us of the incident. The
tests over the last few days have not shown any deviation between
the samples and the water standards," the semi-official Jordan
Times quoted Tayeh as saying.
</P>
<P>
Israel Saturday closed all Eilat's beaches to the public after
an old sewage line broke down to send thousands of cubic meters of
raw sewage into the Gulf of Aqaba over the past days. The main
stopped the spewing of raw sewage Monday.
</P>
<P>
The e-coil bacteria in the Israeli waters in the gulf, partly
shared by Jordan and Israel, once reached 50 times the
internationally acceptable level.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Israel have signed several agreements that bind them
to coordinate efforts to protect the environment of the Gulf of
Aqaba, home to some of the world's most spectacular coral reefs.
</P>
<P>
But most agreements and the subsequent exercises are focused on
containing the threat and damage of oil spilling.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian and Israeli officials will meet next Monday to
discuss preventive and contingent plans for sewage leaks, the
Jordan Times said.
</P>
<P>
Early last month, residents in western Amman, capital of
Jordan, complained that water flowing out of their taps has odor
and contains worms, which has stirred a wide speculation of
polluting sources, including Israel.
</P>
<P>
The water pollution incident has led to the resignation of
Abdul-Salam Majali's government.

</P>
<P>
-- "Oglaigh na hEireann", the dissident group of the Irish

Omagh, has claimed a unilateral and open-ended ceasefire with the
British government. In a communique sent to the daily Irish News
on Tuesday, while begging pardon from civilians, the Catholic
group which is most radically opposed to the Northern Ireland
peace process, said that last Saturday's attack was aimed at "a
commercial target within the framework of the war with the
British."
</P>

MAPUTO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A total of 57,942 pieces of arms
have been collected in Mozambique ever since the start of the
Project of Transforming Arms into Ploughs in October 1995.
</P>
<P>
Lucas Amosse, Secretary-General of Councillor of Mozambican
Catholic was quoted by media here as saying that the project,
which has been carried out mainly in the southern part of the
country, got wide support from the masses.
</P>
<P>
Amosse said that about one million U.S. Dollars, mostly from
non-governmental organizations, were spent on the program.
</P>
<P>
He said that because of the lack of financial back-up, the
project is still confined to the southern provinces of Maputo,
Gaza and Inhambane provinces.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to be extended to Zambezia in central
Mozambique and Nampula in the north.
</P>
<P>
In the 16 year-long civil war, a large number of weapons are
believed to be scattered among the citizens in the country, which
posing a threat to the social stability.
</P>
<P>
The transformation project is designed to exchange things like
bicycles, sewing machines and radios with weapons, and then turn
the weapons into ploughs and artifacts.

Freech, who was inspecting the damaged embassy premises, told
reporters at the destroyed U.S. embassy that the Tanzanian police
were very positive to cooperation with the FBI agents in
searching clues leading to perpetrators of the deadly bomb attack
on the US Embassy.
</P>
<P>
The FBI chief is expected to meet with his Tanzanian
counterpart Adadi Rajabu, Director of Criminal Investigation of
the Home Affairs Ministry, and other senior officials following
the site inspection which brings him into the main three-storey
building.
</P>
<P>
Freech, who arrived here Wednesday night from Washington, will
leave later Thursday for Nairobi, Kenya to visit the US embassy
there which was also hit heavily by a bomb attack nearly at the
same time on August 7.
</P>
<P>
About one hundred FBI agents have arrived here to work at the
bombing site since the car bomb blast which killed nine
Tanzanians and one Kenyan and injured more than 70 civilians
including seven Americans.
</P>
<P>
The US Secretary of States Madeleine Albright made a six-hour
visit Tuesday when she inspected the damaged embassy compound,
consoled victims of the bombing and held talks with Tanzanian
Vice-President Omar Juma and other senior officials.
</P>
<P>
She confirmed more US emergency aid to Tanzanian victims
following the first batch of 100,000 US dollars worth of relief
supply, vowing to bring those behind the bombing to justice no
matter how long the investigation will take.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Kenneth Piernick, head of the FBI team here, said
that some important evidences collected at the scene have been
sent back to Washington for analysis.
</P>
<P>
Piernick, who is the Assistant Special Agent in charge of the
FBI Washington Field Office, said nothing could be found from the
video monitoring system at the embassy, which was working at the
time when the bomb went off, because there was no tape fitted in
the system.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian police have arrested 14 suspects following the
bombing, which was widely believed to be caused by a bomb hidden
at the Embassy's own water tanker as it was checked before the
blast.
</P>
<P>
But so far no breakthrough has been made and nothing has been
found related to the co-driver of the Embassy's truck, a blue
seven-ton Toyota water tanker, though he was believed to be the
key to the investigation.

JOHANNESBURG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela and his deputy Thabo Mbeki will hold talks with
Namibian President Sam Nujoma Thursday over the crisis in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
A special envoy from Uganda was also expected in South Africa

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Unveil Drastic Economic Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Thursday called on the people to support the
drastic measures to be announced by the government for reviving
the economy.
</P>
<P>
Malaysians should support these measures as they are aimed at
reviving the economy, said Mahathir when addressing the 19th
general meeting of the Malay Contractors' Association of Malaysia
here.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Only in this way can Malaysia maintain its position
without depending on foreign financial assistance."
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government which already announced a number of
measures to extricate itself from a difficult economic position
precipitated by attacks on regional currencies in July last year
has been prompted to consider even more drastic measures as the
country's economy is still reeling from the downturn.
</P>
<P>
Urging the people to be prepared for these measures, Mahathir
said, "It may be shocking to the foreigners but they are aimed at
putting the economy back on the right track."
</P>
<P>
"I have also forewarned the people that the measures could be
shocking, but whether they are shocking or not, I hope all parties
will support them," Mahathir said without spelling out what the
measures would be.

</P>
<P>
By August 19, the headquarters had sent 200 million yuan worth

<HEADLINE> U.S. Troops Arrive in Kuwait for Joint Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 400 U.S. soldiers
arrived in Kuwait late Wednesday night, the first batch of a
1,500-member U.S. troops to take part in routine desert military
exercises with Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The soliders were flown in from Fort Stewart, Georgia. The
remaining U.S. soldiers are expected to arrive during the next
three days.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Sean Frinnegan, Deputy Commander of the Doha Camp, the
Headquarters of the U.S. army in Kuwait, told reporters that the
soldiers would head to the camp immediately where they would have
six hours to draw prepositioned equipment and deploy in the desert.
</P>
<P>
The equipment, enough for a task force of around 1,200
soldiers, includes M-1 main battle tanks, M-88 Recovery vehicles,
Bradleys vehicles and military jeeps.
</P>
<P>
The games, code-named Intrinsic Action, are "designed to
provide continued U.S. ground presence and access in Kuwait,
enhance Kuwaiti defense capabilities and regional security," a
U.S. Embassy said in a news release issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The maneuvers also aim to strengthen relations, improve
inter-operability and battle staff proficiency between U.S. and
Kuwaiti forces, as well as enhance U.S. troops' capabilities to
rapidly deploy to the region, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The joint war games came amid increased tension in the region
caused by the latest standoff between Iraq and the United Nations
over weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
On August 5, Iraq announced suspension of cooperation with the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM), complaining that it is
pro-U.S. and attempting to prolong sanctions, which were imposed
on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Members of UNSCOM have been conducting weapons inspections in
Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War, which ended the seven-month Iraqi
occupation of the oil-rich Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions will not be lifted until UNSCOM certifies that
Iraq has eliminated all weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
But a U.S. embassy spokesman has said the war games are "a
scheduled rotation of the Intrinsic Action forces and are not a
direct response to the current Iraqi confrontation with UNSCOM."
</P>
<P>
Colonel Finnegan said "this is a normal deployment and we do
that three times a year."
</P>
<P>
The exercises, which will last through November, was planned a
year ago and it had no political motive, he added.
</P>
<P>
The maneuvers are part of a 10-year U.S.-Kuwaiti defense pact
signed after the Gulf War, the release said.

HARARE, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe
expects inflation to rise to 32 percent by next month owing
largely to inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the inflation rise is said to be due to the
currency depreciation, fuel price adjustments and the effects of
this year's wage settlement.
</P>
<P>
But forecasts for the end of the year show that inflation will
decline to about 25 percent.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Involved in UN Chief's Killing: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A South Africa commission
Wednesday revealed sensational evidence pointing to direct
involvement of former South African government in an
international plot to kill former UN Secretary-General Dag
Hammarskjold.
</P>
<P>
Hammarskjold died in September 1961 when his aircraft crashed
on its approach to Ndola airport in what was then Northern
Rhodesia (now Zambia), where he was due to meet Katangese rebel
leader Moise Tshombe to negotiate a truce in Congo's civil war.
</P>
<P>
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) has found a set
of letters, contained in a batch of documents from South African
security archives, which reveal plans to blow up the UN chief's
aircraft, local media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The letters refer to the operation under the code name "How is
Celeste?" and also point to the involvement of the United States
Central Intelligence Agency and Britain's MI6 intelligence
agency.
</P>
<P>
The letters, some of which are hand-written and date from the
early 1960s, are on the letterhead of an organization called the
South African Institute for Maritime Research, which has a
Johannesburg address.
</P>
<P>
There is a current South African Institute of Maritime
Research, based in Simon's Town near Cape Town, which has links
with South Africa's state-controlled arms producer, Armscor.
</P>
<P>
One of the letters outlines the plan for the attack and refers
to the amount and type of explosives to be used.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish-chartered DC6-B Albertina carrying Hammarskjold
disappeared after the pilot had contacted Ndola airport and flown
over the landing site. It was later found crashed 10 kilometers
away from the airport.
</P>
<P>
The letters appear to be correspondence between two security
operatives who were directly involved in the plot.
</P>
<P>
The institute referred to in the letterhead is believed to
have been a front company for the South African military.
</P>
<P>
The TRC handed journalists copies of eight letters, dated
between July 12, 1960 and September 1961. They are marked
"confidential" and "top secret, your eyes only".
</P>
<P>
The TRC has handed the original documents to the government,
because the affair will have serious international repercussions
if the documents are found to be authentic.
</P>
<P>
Allegations that Britain had been involved in a plot to kill
Hammarskjold surfaced in Asian and African newspapers days after
the crash.
</P>
<P>
It was alleged that Britain was supporting Tshombe against the
UN. Tshombe declared the secession of the mineral-rich Katangese
province just two weeks after the Congo secured its independence
from Belgium on June 30, 1960 under the leadership of the
staunchly pan-Africanist and anti-colonialist prime minister,
Patrice Lumumba.
</P>
<P>
Hammarskjold, a Swede, was secretary-general from 1953.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Official on Sharing of Marcos Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Justice Secretary
Serafin Cuevas Thursday stood firm on his belief that a compromise
deal with the family of the late president Ferdinand Marcos is
still the best position the government can take to recover Marcos'
ill-gotten wealth.
</P>
<P>
Cuevas said the government is left without a better option
except engaging the Marcoses in a compromise settlement and
rejecting the idea of pursuing a court case to take back the money
hidden abroad.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is negotiating with the Marcos family
for 75-25 sharing of Marcos' deposits estimated at 5 billion U.S.
dollars, with the bigger amount going to the government.
</P>
<P>
About 570 million dollars of the Marcos wealth has been
returned to the Philippines by Swiss banks after 12 years of hard
work by the Presidential Commission on Good Government set up by
former president Corazon Aquino.
</P>
<P>
However, the money, currently put under an independent account
of the Philippine National Bank, could be used only after the
Supreme Court and the Congress have decided on how to divide it.
</P>
<P>
Marcos ruled the country for 20 years. He was ousted in 1986 in
a popular revolt and died three years later in Hawaii, the United
States.

<HEADLINE> Two More Held in Nairobi Bombing Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Two more suspects in the August
7 deadly bombing on the U.S. embassy in the Kenyan capital have
been arrested in Pakistan, the independent Daily Nation newspaper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two men, a Saudi and a Sudanese, were arrested while
trying to cross into Afghanistan from Pakistan, the report quoted
Pakistani immigration officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report said the suspects were carrying fake Yemeni
passports.
</P>
<P>
One of the men -- it was not stated which -- was said by
Pakistani officials to be "a pivotal participant" in the bombing
which killed at least 247 people and left some 5,000 injured,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
A near-simultaneous car bomb attack outside the U.S. embassy
in the Tanzanian capital of Dar es Salaam killed 10 people.
</P>
<P>
One of the suspects had been described by Mohammed Saddiq
Howaida, the suspect arrested in Pakistan on the day of the
bombings and flown blindfolded back to Nairobi, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"It is Howaida who led armed FBI (the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation) agents backed by Kenyan CID (Criminal
Investigation Department) officers to the seedy Hill Top Hotel in
Accra Road, Nairobi," said the report.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan-U.S. joint probe team confirmed Wednesday they
raided the hotel on Tuesday, where the bomb -- 800 kilos of high
explosive TNT -- was believed to be assembled. The hotel manager
now has been placed under arrest.
</P>
<P>
Two rooms at the hotel were rented by four bomb suspects --
two Palestinians, an Egyptian and a Saudi Arabian -- from August
3 to August 7.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said earlier Mohammed Saddiq Howaida, who
checked in the Hill Top Hotel on August 4, had five accomplices.
Three of them died in the bombing and two others were at large.
</P>
<P>
Howaida, a 34-year-old Palestinian from Jordan, left Nairobi
on August 6 and was arrested at the Karachi airport on the
following day because immigration officials noticed his face did
not match that in his passport.
</P>
<P>
Howaida reportedly said that he was an engineer who had been
sent to Kenya to provide technical and logistical support for the
bombing, but that he had been instructed to leave Kenya hours
before the blast.
</P>
<P>
He also reportedly said the bombing was sponsored by Saudi
millionaire Ossama bin Laden, whose group consisted of 4,000 to
5,000 heavily armed terrorists who operated full-time in Saudi
Arabia, Sudan, Egypt, Yemen, Ethiopia, Somalia, Pakistan and
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration has demanded Bin Laden's extradition
from Afghanistan, warning the Taliban government that it can
expect no international recognition until it hands him over.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban rejected the request, according to reports from
Islamabad, the Pakistan capital.
</P>
<P>
"We will never hand Ossama over to anyone and protect him with
our blood at all cost," the Afghan Islamic Press quoted Taliban
chief Mulla Mohammad Omar as saying.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright Tuesday toured the
bombed U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya to express grief for
U.S. and African victims.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's New Cabinet to Be Announced Soon, Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Chief of Royal Court Fayez
Tarawnhe, who has been entrusted with forming a new Jordanian
government, is expected to announce his cabinet soon, Jordanian
newspapers reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh will travel to the United States on Friday to consult
with King Hussein on the issue, semi-official English daily the
Jordan Times and Arabic daily the Ad Dustour both quoted informed
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The king is now at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, to
treat the cancer in his lymphatic tissue.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Hussein approved the resignation of the current
cabinet headed by Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali, which is
caught in a scandal of polluted drinking water in Amman and blamed
for a poor performance in domestic affairs, and entrusted Tarawnhe
to form a new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Semi-official Arabic daily the Al Aswaq reported Thursday that
members of the new government will be named within 24 hours right
after the appointment of Tarawneh and some parliament deputies
might join the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Al Ra'I, another semi-official leading Arabic daily, Thursday
quoted informed sources as saying that Deputy Prime Minister for
Development Affairs and Minister of Foreign Affairs Jawad Anani is
expected to replace Tarawneh as chief of royal court.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh graduated from the University of Jordan in 1971. He
then obtained a master's degree and a doctorate in economics at
the University of Southern California, the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh served as assistant chief of Royal Protocol between
1971 and 1980 and then was appointed economic adviser at the
Prime Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
In January 1988, he was appointed minister of state for prime
ministry affairs and in December transferred to minister of supply.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh left the government in 1989 and went to serve as the
board chairman of the Arab Contractors Company and meanwhile as a
member of the board of directors of the Industrial, Commercial and
Agricultural Company.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, Tarawneh was named as a member of the kingdom's
delegation to the peace talks with Israel. While the talks were
still going on, he was appointed ambassador to the United States.
</P>
<P>
He served the post in Washington from December 1992 until his
appointment as foreign minister on March, 1997, when Majali was
entrusted to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
In the February 18, 1998 reshuffle of Majali's cabinet,
Tarawneh was appointed chief of royal court.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh, 49, also has a strong family background. His father
Ahmad Tarawneh, who just died on August 8 this year, once served
as cabinet ministers, parliament deputy and chief of royal court
from the 1950's to the 1970's.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Harvest 1.68m Tons of Grain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Despite natural disasters in
some parts of the country, Mozambique is expected to harvest
about 1.686 million tons of grain this year, according to a
senior official.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Agostinho Rosario, Minister of Agriculture and Fishery
said here Wednesday that about 1.124 million tons of maize, the
staple food of Mozambicans, are to be harvested, about eight
percent higher than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Farmers are expected to get in about 318,000 tons of sorghum
and 191,000 tons of rice this year, both higher than those of
last year.
</P>
<P>
The grain harvest is attributed to the enlarged acreage after
war refugees and displaced people settled down for production.
</P>
<P>
Planting acreage this year grew to 3.72 million hectares from
3.63 hectares in the previous farming year.
</P>
<P>
Good weather is said to be another reason for the good
harvest, with only a few areas affected by drought or flood in
the year.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Key Exports Down 2.3 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore key non-oil domestic
exports fell by 2.3 percent in July 1998 from the same month last
year, reversing June's 6.1 percent year-on-year growth, the Trade
Development Board (TDB) announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The weakness was even more visible in the total trade, which at
the current prices contracted by 8.4 percent in July compared with
the corresponding month of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil domestic exports reached 7.6 billion Singapore dollars
(4.37 billion U.S. dollars) in July, registering an increase of
9.2 percent to the European Union and moderating its growth to the
United States to 3.6 percent from 16.7 percent a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil domestic exports to Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea
slid by 13.1 percent, 11.2 percent and 28 percent respectively and
those to Japan and Hong Kong declined by 12.4 percent and 0.7
percent respectively. The growth of non-oil domestic exports to
China also moderated to 7.3 percent in July from 9.2 percent in
June.
</P>
<P>
The domestic exports of oil remained weak, plunging by 23.6
percent from July last year due to continued weakness in oil
prices arising from strong competition from regional refineries
since the start of the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil imports, a short term leading indicator of the
manufacturing sector, contracted further by 16.7 percent, the
fifth consecutive month of negative growth.
</P>
<P>
The weak underlying trend was also reflected in a 5-percent drop
in exports of Singapore-made electronics and the growth of non-oil
re-exports which moderated to 2.8 percent in July from 11.6
percent a month ago.
</P>
<P>
The trade board has projected that the country's external trade
will contract by 4.5-5.5 percent this year.

<HEADLINE> Museveni Pledges to Improve Security in North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni, who is on a working visit to the north, said Wednesday
the Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF) will be better equipped
to guarantee the security for people in the north.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the President's Office Thursday
morning said the president made the remarks to a public rally at
Boma Ground in Gulu town.
</P>
<P>
All those who are now in protected villages should return to
their villages when their security is guaranteed, Museveni was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Security has much improved since the rebels of Lord's
Resistance Army ran to southern Sudan after the UPDF overwhelmed
them recently, he added.
</P>
<P>
Local people were also urged to unite and fight those who
propagate the bad politics of division based on religion and
tribes.
</P>
<P>
The government's restocking program will first cover peaceful
areas and later spread out to those which are not yet peaceful.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said the government welcomes bandits to come out
peacefully and encourage elders and other leaders to contact rebels
and convince them to drop their arms.
</P>
<P>
When asked to improve the infrastructure in the region,
Museveni said the central government will build a network of
roads there, adding that the government is working with the World
Bank and Belgium to bring 3,000 telephone lines to Gulu.
Telephone services will be extended to Kitgum, Moyo, Adjumani and
Kotido later.

<HEADLINE> Israel Approves Largest Settlement Expansion on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Israel has approved a plan to
expand four settlements in the southern Golan Heights, the
largest expansion in the Golan since the current Likud government
came to power in 1996, Israeli newspapers reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A ministerial committee headed by National Infrastructure
Minister Ariel Sharon approved the projects Wednesday to build
2,300 housing units and 2,500 vacation units in the four
settlements.
</P>
<P>
Sharon's spokesman Raanan Gissin said the approval of the
construction was important for strengthening and developing the
Golan settlements and would create 5,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Gissin noted that the new communities would be located on the
slopes leading to Lake Kinneret, areas of vital importance to
protect Israel's water sources.
</P>
<P>
Sharon denied Wednesday night that the expansion would
undermine the resumption of peace talks with Syria, saying it
meant only expanding existing settlements. "This is in keeping
with the policy of this government," he said.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the expansion decision was originally reached
a month ago, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Sharon to
delay it by a few weeks due to the visit of Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Experts warned that the expansion decision would have severe
consequences at a time when Syria was weighing the positive and
negative aspects of renewing talks with Israel, which broke down
in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Haaretz newspaper quoted an official Syrian newspaper as
saying Wednesday that peace talks with Israel would never resume
without an irrevocable Israeli commitment to a full withdrawal
from the Golan Heights, seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East
War.
</P>
<P>
The comments came in response to remarks made Tuesday by
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, who called on Syria
to resume peace talks but said Israel would not give up the
entire Golan Heights under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai had been under heavy fire in the last few days since
he reportedly told a German news magazine that the depth of an
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights should be linked with
the level of security Israeli obtains.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to his reported remarks, Netanyahu reiterated that
the Israeli government has not changed its policy on the Golan,
which he said was strategically vital for Israel.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Trying to Stabilize Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe consulted a southern African regional delegation sent to
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on the next steps to stabilize
the situation there, The Daily Herald reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, also Chairman of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) Organ on Politics, Defense and Security made the
consultations amid reports that several SADC countries were ready
to intervene militarily to block the DRC rebel advance on
Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
The decision was, however, not unanimous, with South Africa
and Botswana reportedly opposing the idea.
</P>
<P>
A SADC team of foreign ministers and military chiefs from
Zimbabwe, Zambia, Tanzania and Namibia has just returned from
DRC.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that they told the rebels that they
should accept a ceasefire to avert the possibility of regional
intervention.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Defense Minister Moven Mahachi Wednesday said that
ministers and officials of the SADC has agreed at a two-day
meeting in Harare to give the DRC government military support.
</P>
<P>
But South Africa and Botswana seem unlikely to be involved.
</P>
<P>
In Pretoria, a senior government official said South Africa
had not agreed to participate in any regional or SADC military
operation in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Later South African President Nelson Mandela went further in
opposing military involvement.
</P>
<P>
Botswana's Permanent Secretary for Foreign Affairs Ernest
Mpofu said Wednesday that the best solution would not necessarily
be intervention by a regional force, but by international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that about a dozen rounds of heavy machine gun
fire were heard early Wednesday in the southwest of Kinshasa.

NANCHANG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangxi Province, which
has been hit by heavy flooding, has increased controls on
donations to see that the money and goods really get to the
flood victims.
</P>
<P>
Ren Genshui, a provincial civil affairs official, says that the
province issued an emergency notice saying that donations need to
be handled in a clear, open, fair and orderly way and that they
are to be handed out for free, and that intercepting and holding
on to materials and diverting funds is illegal.

<P>
A hot line has also been opened to help the supervisory work,
Ren says, and they will send several teams to the worst-hit cities
and counties to supervise the distribution of relief goods.
</P>
<P>
The province has received more than 23 million yuan (2.8
million U.S. dollars) from Chinese and overseas organizations,
most of which will be used to help flood victims rebuild homes,
Ren says.
</P>
<P>
Jiujiang, one of worst-hit cities, distributed a large number
of tents, timber, and tarpaper, and 5.85 million kg of rice, which

export such an amount of oil due to its shabby oil equipment. The
Council last June agreed to allow Iraq to import 300 million
U.S. dollars worth of spare parts to ungrade its dilapidated oil
industry. (UN-Iraq-Oil Equipment)

<HEADLINE> Manila Sets Conditions on Suspended Stock Brokers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 20 (Xinhua) - The Philippine Stock Exchange
(PSE) Thursday bared the conditions set by the Securities and
Exchange Commission on member brokers who wish to suspend their
operations.
</P>
<P>
PSE president Jose Luis Yulo said there are two general
conditions that must be followed by member brokers prior to the
suspension of their operations.
</P>
<P>
One condition is that a member broker must make a request so
that he or she may be allowed to become a non-operating and
non-trading member of the stock exchange until the end of the
year, Yulo said.
</P>
<P>
The other condition is that as a non-operating member, he or
she shall be exempted from the submission of the financial
operation report and other reportorial requirements, he added.
</P>
<P>
The non-operating member can maintain a net capital of only two
million pesos (45,662 U.S. dollars). But when applying for renewal
of its license, the member must again have a minimum net capital
of five million pesos (114,155 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, Yulo said that only license nominees, officers and
staff of the non-operating member shall be allowed to continue
trading as agents of operating member brokers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- China's Supreme People's Court
dismissed an appeal by Chen Xitong, the former secretary of the
Beijing Municipal Communist Party Committee today and upheld the
original judgement.
</P>
<P>
On July 31, 1998, the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court
made a ruling of first instance on Chen's case, sentencing him to
13 years in prison for corruption and 4 years for dereliction of
duty. Chen will have to serve 16 years in prison and bribes he
accepted shall be confiscated and turned over to the State
Treasury.
</P>
<P>
Chen disagreed with the ruling and appealed to the Supreme
People's Court, which established a collegiate court to hear the
case in accordance with Article 187 of China's Criminal Procedure
Law.
</P>
<P>
The collegiate court heard Chen's statement and his lawyer's
defense and questioned him. It also reviewed the findings of first
instance of the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court before
reaching a judgement.
</P>
<P>
The judicial committee of the Supreme People's Court said that
Chen, who was serving as a senior official, violated regulations,
accepted expensive gifts and illegally kept them. These it called
criminal acts of corruption. more

The committee said that Chen also conspired with Wang Baosen,
Beijing's former Vice-Mayor, to build luxury villas with public
funds for their own use, which resulted in a great loss of public
funds and losses to the state and people and were a criminal
dereliction of duty and must be punished.
</P>
<P>
It also rejected Chen's appeal and his lawyer's defense,
calling the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court's ruling
correct in its understanding of the facts and its application of
the law and an appropriate publishment for Chen.
</P>
<P>

Supreme People's Court ruling is a judgement of final instance.

effective immediately after it was announced to the public earlier
today.

<HEADLINE> Mercury, Sting Leave Liberty out of Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Charlotte Sting and
Phoenix Mercury did Wednesday night what the New York Liberty
could not win to become the final two teams to qualify for the
WNBA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
Charlotte (18-12) put the pressure on the Liberty, who has to
go home after advancing to the title game a year ago, by blowing
out the Washington Mystics 105-69 earlier Wednesday night, but
the Sting still needed either New York or Phoenix to lose in
order to advance to the playoffs for the second straight season.
</P>
<P>
Charlotte did not have to wait long as New York (18-12) lost
to the Detriot Shock 82-68 while Phoenix (19-11) made sure it was
included in the postseason play by beating the Sacramento
Monarchs 71-62 to grab the third seed.
</P>
<P>
Cleveland Rockers (20-10), winner of the Eastern Conference
and the only newcomers to the playoffs, travel to Phoenix for
Game One of their semifinal series Saturday night. The conference
champions host Game Two and if necessary Game three.
</P>
<P>
All playoff series this season are best-of-three. The
inaugural WNBA playoffs last year were single-elimination affairs.
</P>
<P>
Charlotte posted the second-highest point total in WNBA
history in the regular-season finale for both teams here
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Andrea Stinson scored 25 points, Rhonda Mapp added 18 and
Tracy Reid has six of her seven points in a game-breaking first
half run for the Sting.
</P>
<P>
Charlotte became the third team to clinch a playoff berth when
the New York Liberty lost to the Detriot Shock. The Sting made
the playoffs last season and lost to eventual champion Houston
Comets in the first round.
</P>
<P>
Nikki McCray netted 20 points and Murriel Page added 15 for
the Mystics, who wound up their debut season with a 3-27 record
and a five-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
The Comets have home-court advantage throughout the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
The semifinals begin Saturday with the WNBA Finals starting on
August 27.

<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Customs officers in Guangzhou,
the capital of China's Guangdong Province, has cracked down on
trademark and copyright violations in recent years to protect the
intellectual property rights of famous brands.
</P>
<P>
They began increasing protection of intellectual property
rights in September 1994 and have received 26 applications for
trademark protection and stopped 51 cases of trademark violation,
involving fake products worth 10 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the second half of last year, Guangzhou customs officers
launched a special campaign to protect domestic band-name battery
products, leading to a remarkable increase in exports.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predict that exports of batteries from Guangdong will
amount to 170 million U.S. dollars this year, up more than 50
percent from the 1997 figure.

<HEADLINE> Labor Board Opens Hearing on WNBA Union Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) opened proceedings in New York Wednesday on the
petition of the NBA Players Association (NBPA) to represent the
players of the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement released by the NBPA, the WNBA, which
is sponsored by the NBA, asked to delay the election for a full
year until May 1999. The NLRB did not rule on the matter and
adjourned proceedings until August 27.
</P>
<P>
"We are disappointed that the league has asked to delay these
proceedings and the vote," said NBPA executive director Billy
Hunter. "The players are eager to obtain the rights to union
representation by the Players Association."
</P>
<P>
A majority of WNBA players agreed to form a union and filed a
petition for the NBPA to represent them earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Hunter said previously that the NBPA had received signed union
cards from close to 100 of the 120 WNBA players. "The players
have indicted their desire to unionize to exercise their rights
under the labor law, and the league cannot deny that or those
rights by legal maneuvers," said Ronald Shechtman, an attorney
representing the WNBA players.
</P>
<P>
"It's been the intention to organize this union for close to a
year now," said NBPA director of communications Dan Wasserman.
</P>
<P>
Hunter and the NBPA have done little negotiating with the NBA
since the league imposed a lockout on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Wasserman added the NBPA expects the women's collective
barganning agreement to be "a lot different than the men based on
the negotiations of the women's telling us what they want."

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Urged to Stimulate Retail Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's largest department
store Central Group has urged the government to prepare stimulus
measures as the retailing business is suffering from a drastic
decline this year, the Nation reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive of the Central Department Store Suthikiat
Chirathivat suggested that one possible measure the government
should consider is cutting Value Added Tax from 10 percent to 7
percent for consumers purchasing Thai goods.
</P>
<P>
This could help boost consumer spending and also support the
"Buy Thai" campaign, he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the recent comprehensive financial reform
package, which has won overwhelming public support, Suthikiat said
the government should also consider the drastic decline in
domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the government speed up the duty free shop
policies that allow foreign visitors to apply for tax refunds when
purchasing goods in Thailand as is the case in many other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Thai department store sales last year fell by 20 percent from
1996 to 327.75 billion baht (8.19 billion U.S. dollars) and the
Thai Farmers Research Center predicted a further 10 to 20 percent
drop this year.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that sales in the country's leading department
stores will remain depressed in the second half of 1998 due to
consumer and corporate belt-tightening to cope with rising
unemployment and the decline in business opportunities.

<HEADLINE> Thai Small Firms to Receive Supporting Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Small Industry Finance
Corporation of Thailand will extend three billion baht (75 million
U.S. dollars) in loans to help revive thousands of small and
medium-sized enterprises facing severe problems in getting cash,
the Bangkok Post said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But the loans are far from enough as about 200 businesses have
already applied for loans totaling four billion baht (100 million
dollars), according to corporation president Vichien Opasvadhana.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Industry Minister Anurak Chureemas said Wednesday that
each loan would not exceed 50 million baht (1.25 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Small Industry Finance Corporation was established by the
Thai government in a bid to help businesses that could not get
loans from banks.
</P>
<P>
The corporation, which has four branches across the country,
would increase its number of branches and boost staff from 140 to
215 to fill new positions.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that some posts might be filled by staff of
financial institutions who were laid off following the
government's latest financial reform package.
</P>
<P>
Vichien said as part of its business plan for next year, the
corporation would seek a 229 million dollar loan from foreign
financial institutions to help small manufacturers improve the
quality of their products.
</P>
<P>
The corporation was negotiating with some customers to
restructure debt in a bid to reduce non-performing loans that
currently totaled 2.2 billion baht (55 million dollars) or 36
percent of its total lending.

<HEADLINE> Kazakh Finance Stable Despite Outside Disturbances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh financial market remains
stable despite some negative effects cast upon by the economic
crisis in southeast Asia and Russia, the Kazakh government and its
state bank said in a joint statement Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakh Telegraph Agency reported that one of the most
important factors underlying the stability of the financial market
is that the market has unpegged its linkage with its Russian
counterpart and only seven percent of its international
settlements is done in Russian roubles.
</P>
<P>
Another important factor, as the statement said, is that the
gold and foreign exchange reserves in Kazakh state bank, which
total two billion U.S. dollars, well match its currency volume,
making it possible for its currency Tenge to remain stable.
</P>
<P>
A third factor, said the statement, is that Kazakhstan is quite
independent from its creditors, as the country's expenditures
related to its domestic and foreign debts account for only nine
percent of its national budget.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, to head off possible negative impact that the
ongoing economic crisis would incur, the Kazakh government and its
state bank have taken a series of measures aimed at consolidating
the country's financial system and maintaining a steady economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
To spur its domestic production, Kazakhstan has lowered its
transportation fees for mineral products, adjusted its tax rates
and cancelled its levying of double value-added taxes on goods
imported from members of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, to ensure a stable Tenge, the state bank has
introduced a floating exchange rate system which sets the exchange
rate on the basis of its macroeconomic targets and the
international financial situation.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the state bank will continue its strict control
over banking liabilities and further improve its monitoring
mechanism to ensure the stability of the banking system.
</P>
<P>
The above measures, the statement said, have well protected the
Kazakh economy from being disturbed by external factors so that a
stable domestic financial market is guaranteed.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus Jumps in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Japan's merchandise trade surplus
in July surged 56.8 percent from a year earlier to 1,316.1 billion
yen (about 9.4 billion dollars) due to a decline in imports and
the Japanese yen's weakness against the U.S. dollar, the Finance
Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Japan's global imports in July fell 5.7 percent from a year ago
to 3,246.8 billion yen (about 23.1 billion dollars), while exports
rose 6.6 percent to 4,562.9 billion yen (about 32.5 billion
dollars), the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Trade surplus with the United States soared 59.7 percent from a
year earlier to 669.7 billion yen (about 4.8 billion dollars), up
for the 22nd consecutive month.
</P>
<P>
Japan's surplus with Asian countries fell 36.2 percent to 358.6
billion yen (about 2.6 billion dollars), while that with the
European Union (EU) jumped 174.5 percent to 377.1 billion yen
(about 2.6 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The average foreign exchange rate used for the July report was
140.42 yen to one U.S. dollar, compared with 114.09 yen a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the July trade report, an economist at a private
financial institution said the Japanese government's comprehensive
economic stimulus measures are likely to prevent a sharp decline
in imports but unlikely to reduce the overall trade surplus.
</P>
<P>
Japan's surplus will continue expanding for the time being but
its growth rate is likely to slow down gradually as the positive
effects of the government's stimulus measures are expected to be
seen soon, a ministry official said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Spain's investment in
Argentina will reach 12 billion U.S. dollars by 2001,
representatives of 12 major Spanish enterprises in Argentina said
at their meeting with Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem.
</P>
<P>

communication and construction.
</P>
<P>
Now the biggest Spanish investors in Argentina are the Spanish
Telephone Company, ENDES group, DICASA construction company, and

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
During the meeting with Menem, aimed at increasing the trade

<HEADLINE> Clinton Imposes Sanctions on Angola's UNITA Movement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton has
issued an executive order to impose economic sanctions on
Angola's UNITA movement for non-compliance with its obligations
for peace process, the White House said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The measures taken in the order will immediately demonstrate
to UNITA the seriousness of our concern over its delays in
implementing the peace process," Clinton said in a letter to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Under the executive order, Washington will freeze UNITA assets
in the United States, ban the import of any diamonds not certified
by the government of Angola, and ban the sale of mining equipment.
</P>
<P>
"The blocking of UNITA's property and the other prohibitions
imposed under this executive order will further limit UNITA's
capacity to pay for its military build-up and to undermine the
peace process," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions will not be lifted until UNITA "fully complies
with its obligations and completes its transition from an armed
movement to an unarmed political party," Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
The government of Angola and UNITA signed a peace accord in
Lusaka in 1994, but the trust between the two parties has
recently broken down. And a government spokesman said the peace
process is in "profound crisis."

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Re-fixes Export Target at 5.8 Bln Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has re-fixed its export
target for the July 1998-June 1999 fiscal year at 5.8 billion U.S.
dollars, about 170 million dollars more than the original target,
to maintain the present annual growth rate of 12.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
This decision was made Wednesday at a meeting of the Task Force
on Export presided over by Commerce and Industries Minister Tofael
Ahmed, press reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The export target for the previous fiscal year was fixed at 8.1
billion dollars with an average growth rate of 12.15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh achieved an export growth of 16.81 percent during
the last fiscal year and 13.8 percent in the 1996-97 fiscal year,
the minister told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Despite economic recession in South Asia, Bangladesh performed
well in export and maintained a high growth rate, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government is committed to continuing support to all
genuine exporters, he said. "We are contemplating to provide more
incentives to the exporters for diversifying the export basket and
expanding the volume of export."
</P>
<P>
The minister called upon the exporters and business leaders to
fully utilize the opportunities generated in and outside the
country for bolstering export, saying the government "is very much
sincere in solving the problems which are hindering export
expansion."

<HEADLINE> Hungary to Stop Selling Land To Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, Aguest 19 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Minister for
Agriculture and Rural Development Torgyan Jozsef announced
Wednesday that his country will stop selling land to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
He told a rally in the small southern city of Opusztaszer that
many foreigners wanted to buy a piece of land in Hungary on the
excuse of European integration.
</P>
<P>
He said that allowing foreigners to own Hungary's land was not
a necessary condition for the country to join the integration
process.
</P>
<P>
The government would take all measures to protect Hungary's
land from falling into the hands of foreigners as it was the
resources of famers based on which they could improve their life,
he said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, about 80 percent of Hungary's state
enterprises have been sold to foreigners in the process of
privatization, together with large pieces of land in the western
areas.
</P>
<P>
The former government had planed to legalize the land selling,
but met strong opposition from the farmers, who raised the slogan
that "selling land means betraying the country."
</P>
<P>
The new government supports the farmers by revising the stance
of its predecessor.
</P>
<P>
The minister pledged that the government would make all efforts
to promote the development in under-developed areas, including
support to small and medium-sized enterprises, the agricultural
products processing industry and animal husbandry.

</P>
<P>
The sources said the legislation will be presented in

<HEADLINE> Low Real Estate Prices in Thailand Attract Foreign Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Several multinational companies
have set up a regional trade and investment office in Thailand due
to the currency depreciation and lower real estate prices here, a
Board of Investment (BoI) press release available Thursday said.
</P>
<P>
BoI has approved 30 companies' requests to establish trade and
investment offices during the first half of the year. These firms
included major corporations such as Isuzu Motor, Waste Management,
NEC, and Nova Gas, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
To compete with Singapore and Malaysia in luring multinational
firms to establish regional offices, the BoI has been providing
non-tax incentives since January 1996 and has already had about 90
projects under this category.
</P>
<P>
In July alone, four companies, namely Makro Asia Management,
Art Chemical (Thailand), EEC Lincoln Scott and Yaskawa Engineering
Asia Pacific, received approval under this category.
</P>
<P>
BoI said the depreciation of the baht and the cheaper real
estate and rental prices, which have helped reduce the cost of
doing business in Thailand, are the main reasons for the
increasing interest of foreign firms in locating their regional
offices in the country.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Air France moved its regional headquarters from
Hong Kong to Bangkok, while the Pacific Asia Travel Association
announced it would move its head office to Bangkok from San
Francisco this September.

<HEADLINE> Deer Saved From Rising Flood Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The central government has
decided to allocate a special fund of 800,000 yuan (96,000 US
dollars) to protect deer threatened by rising flood waters in
Shishou Pere David's Nature Reserve in Hubei Province, according
to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
This has been confirmed yesterday by sources with the State
Environmental Protection Administration.
</P>
<P>
The reserve, which will soon be raised to the level of a
national nature reserve, is now home to 130 Pere David's deer, a
rare breed imported from Britain.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to prompt protective action, all the deer have survived
the floods and are now living safely on an isolated island.
</P>
<P>
The provincial environmental protection bureau opened a special
hotline to the nature reserve to be used in case of
emergency. Every day, local farmers cut grass and transport it to
the island to feed the deer.
</P>
<P>
The battle to preserve the conservation farm for white-fin
dolphin in Tongling, Anhui Province, has also been crowned with
success.
</P>
<P>
The farm, built in 1994 with an investment of over 10 million
yuan, aims to protect the 100 dolphins -- a species unique to the
Yangtze River -- and help increase number.
</P>
<P>
To better protect nature reserves and preserve rare animals and
plants, the State Council released a notice this week asking local
governments to tighten management of nature reserves.
</P>
<P>
The notice stipulates that tourism and production activities
will be banned in the buffer-zone areas of nature reserves
nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Suffers Losses Due to World Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Brazil has lost more than
2.5 billion U.S. dollars so far this month in the wake of the
international financial crisis and the latest ruble devaluation, the
Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper based its report on figures released by the
Central Bank of Brazil and non-official data on the currency
exchange transactions in Brazil up to last Monday.
</P>
<P>
Head of the bank's International Reserves Department Maria Do
Socorro Carvalho attributed the loss to frozen credits and the
outflow of foreign money from Brazilian banks because of lower
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
She noted that investors now hesitated about putting their
money on risky projects.
</P>
<P>
However, Central Bank President Gustavo Franco affirmed that
the government is not worried about repaying foreign debts as it
has enough foreign reserves, which, according to the bank, stand
at 71 billion dollars.

BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- China has issued regulations to
restricting the removal of human genome resources from China and
encouraging Sino-overseas cooperation in genetics under a
principle of shared intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
Human organs, tissues, cells, blood and related materials
should not be transported outside China without permission from
the Ministry of Science and Technology. The Ministry's human
genome management office is responsible for this and will look
into the technical and financial power of Chinese and foreign
research groups and the ownership and sharing of the intellectual
property rights.
</P>
<P>
The office requires a certificate of informed consent from
providers of human genetic materials and their family members to
guarantee the quality of international cooperation and to protect
both sides, according to a Ministry official who participated in
drafting the regulation, but asked not to be identified.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Riot Probe Team to Query Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's government-created
Combined Fact-Finding Team plans to question a number of security
commanders about the riots in Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, and
other cities in mid-May, a statement issued by the team said.
</P>
<P>
"The team will soon interview officials who were in charge of
security during the riots to obtain clarification," the 19-member
team which was established on July 23 said in the statement
available Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The team's chairman Marzuki Darusman said details about the
security commanders or when they would be questioned would be
finalized on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A source close to the investigation said that former Jakarta
military commander Maj. Gen. Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin and former city
police chief Maj. Gen. Hamami Nata were among those to be
questioned, Jakarta Post daily reported.
</P>
<P>
At least 1,200 died in the May 13-15 riots in Jakarta and other
cities and thousands of buildings were looted or burned.
</P>
<P>
It was also reported later that women, primarily of Chinese
descent, became victims of rape and sexual abuse during the riots.
</P>
<P>
Activists, including members of the Volunteers for Humanity led
by Catholic priest Sandyawan Sumardi, have reported that 168 women
were raped or sexually assaulted between May 13 and July 3.
</P>
<P>
The fact-finding team, which comprises representatives from the
Armed Forces, government agencies, the National Commission on
Human Rights and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), is charged
with the task of investigating and, if possible, unveiling the
perpetrators of the riots, which some say were organized.
</P>
<P>
The joint team is expected to complete its task in three
months.
</P>
<P>
The team criticized officials Wednesday for voicing doubts
about reports of rapes and sexual assaults during the riots.
</P>
<P>
National Police Chief Lt. Gen. Roesmanhadi said Monday that
some NGOs had exaggerated such reports. He warned that if the NGOs
failed to come up with evidence and continued alleging that sexual
assaults occurred, they could be charged for spreading
unsubstantiated rumors.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki said Roesmanhadi's remarks "only hamper the team's
work," He said. "With certainty, I confirm that there are facts
(about the rapes)."
</P>
<P>
He said the team had completed collecting information and was
now in its "verification" stage.
</P>
<P>
"Government officials should not make intimidating and
contradicting statements before the task force finishes its job,"
said team member Saparinah Sadli.
</P>
<P>
The National Commission on Human Rights argued last month that
the reported sexual assaults during the riots were perpetrated
systematically by an unidentified group.

Before the regulations appeared, some foreigners and
enterprises took genetic disease materials out of China without
permission and many Chinese scientists have been worried about the
drain on human genetic resources and have written letters to
national leaders.
</P>
<P>
They say that China should protect human genome resources,
which are essential to future developments in the pharmaceutical
and health care industries and that the protective methods will
not affect cooperation with foreign scientists.
</P>
<P>
Scientists are looking for more opportunities for international
cooperation, and the regulations are not going to be a barrier,
according to Qiang Boqin, vice-president of the Chinese Academy of
Medical Sciences and director of the Beijing Human Genome Research
Center.
</P>
<P>
China has a large population and many ethnic groups and some
genetic diseases have developed that have long been separated from
the outside world but the increasing transient population has
reduced the amount of genetic resources.
</P>
<P>
Genetic research in China is still undeveloped and should be
open to international cooperation based on equality of
responsibility, Professor Chen Zhu, director of the Shanghai Human
Genome Research Center, says.
</P>
<P>
There are now 30 laboratories in China involved in human genome
research, and two gene sequencing centers will be set up in
Beijing and Shanghai as part of the global Human Genome Project,
and genetic research on leukemia and liver, stomach, and esophagus
cancers, high blood pressure, and other major diseases has already
reached a high level.

JAKARTA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government plans
to purchase 1.2 million tons of rice through international tenders
in August and September, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia will tender for 600,000 tons of rice on August 26

State Minister for Food A.M. Saefuddin said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has already imported 1 million tons of
rice on a commercial basis in the financial year. It also signed
bilateral deals and received grants for an additional 1 million
tons, Antara News Agency Thursday quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Officials said rice production has fallen due to last year's
prolonged drought and a decrease in land under rice cultivation.
Unhusked rice production is estimated to fall 6.25 percent to 46.3
million tons in 1998.

FUZHOU, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The number of attempts to cross
the border in China's coastal province of Fujian illegally for
purposes of emigration are down this year because of a crackdown
by border police.

According to local sources, police successfully stopped 60
illegal border crossings in the first seven months of the year,
involving some 660 people.
</P>

A number of coastal cities and counties in Fujian have been
used by a "snakehead", an organizer of illegal border crossings,
as a departure point for illegal emigration to Japan, the United
States and other countries. To stop the illegal border crossings,
border police have worked out an information network and reporting
system, which helped them arrest 59 snakeheads in the January-July
period.

They have also increased inspections and checks in a dozen of
counties and towns that are notorious for illegal border crossing

SOFIA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian police have detained
eight Dutchmen and two Britons for an alleged attempt to smuggle
1.6 million U.S. dollars out of the country.

Five of the Dutchmen and one Briton were arrested with the

Cornelis is believed to have withdrawn the sum and distributed
it to the six people who were apprehended Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Another three Dutchmen and one Briton who were also connected
to the case were apprehended outside Sofia, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
Police were following various leads including connections to
money laundering, said Yashev.

<P>
Under the Bulgarian Criminal Code, the detainees will be
charged for violations of regulations on transactions in currency
assets and the obligation to declare such assets to customs. They
could be sentenced to up to six years' imprisonment or be fined
double the sum they tried to traffic illegally.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rican Patrols with U.S. Need Authorization. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Costa Rican
Attorney-General stressed on Wednesday that joint patrols with the
United States on Costa Rican waters will only be possible with
legislative authorization.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been insisting since 1997 on establishing
a joint patrol surveillance program, in order to combat drug
trafficking in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, the Costa Rican constitution prohibits the entrance of
foreign armed vessels into its territories, without a previous
authorization by the Congress.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the U.S. requests can not be accepted until a
resolution is passed by the Congress.
</P>
<P>
The Attorney-General is advising the government to work on a
long term permission for joint patrols for approval of the
Congress.
</P>
<P>
The measure has been looked on favorably in the assembly, where
different opposition sectors have nodded their agreement, as long
as certain conditions are met, like putting a Costa Rican in
command of the patrols.
</P>
<P>
However there are people who disagree with the plan, and they
think that it would not help the fight against drugs.
</P>
<P>
Central America and the Caribbean are believed to be transit
zones for the drugs produced in Colombia, which are destined for
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Other sectors are saying that it would be better if Costa Rica
patrols the area by itself.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United's hope of
signing Aston Villa striker Dwight Yorke before Thursday's
Champions' League deadline is fading.
</P>
<P>
Old Trafford manager Alex Ferguson admitted on Wednesday:"It
looks like it's all at a dead end."
</P>
<P>
United's bid of 10 million pounds (16.1 million U.S. dollars)
has already been turned down by Villa, who want 16 million for
the Trinidad and Tobago international.
</P>
<P>
Unless United sign a striker by midnight on Thursday they will
have to make do with their current squad until the last eight of
the Champions' League.
</P>
<P>
Villa chairman Doug Ellis has told Yorke he can achieve his
dream of playing in the Champions' League by staying at Villa
Park.
</P>
<P>
"Aston Villa are as good as Manchester United," Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
"Okay, they are in the Champions' League, but we are in the
UEFA Cup and the cream of Europe are in that competition."
</P>
<P>
Ellis is convinced that the 26-year-old could well get his
chance to play in the Champions' League next season if he stays
at Villa.
</P>
<P>
"It is our intention to win the Premiership this season. He is
with a big club," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As far as we are concerned, he is under contract for another
two years."

<P>
LONDON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- European soccer governing body
UEFA is set to discuss changes to the format of their three
European club competitions in a bid to challenge the threat of a
breakaway Super League.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago Manchester United and Arsenal confirmed they had
been involved in talks about joining a new 32-team league to
kick-off in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Such proposals have aroused serious concern at both the
Football Association and Premier League, while FIFA president,
Sepp Blatter, has urged clubs to halt all Super League
discussions.
</P>
<P>
Apparent plans, which are still in the consultative stage,
include increasing the number of teams in the Champions' League
from 24 to 32 and merging the Cup Winners' Cup and UEFA Cup.
</P>
<P>
A UEFA spokesman said: "We are still talking with clubs and
associations with regards to any new proposals."
</P>
<P>
"But the executive committee meets on August 29 in Monaco and
of course the Super League will be one of the topics under
discussion. A press conference is planned for after the meeting,
" the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> Canada Supports Goods-for-Guns Program in El Salvador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced Wednesday that
It will contribute 130,000 Canadian dollars (85,800 U.S. dollars)
to support a "Goods for Guns" program in El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
The project sets out to tackle the problem of the proliferation
of small arms and contribute to building an enduring peace in this
post-conflict country.
</P>
<P>
Funded through the Peacebuilding Fund, the program is designed
to offer viable alternatives to former combatants by supporting an
exchange of weapons for coupons redeemable for consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy made the
announcement in Orillia, Canada, where he was participating in an
international meeting of non-governmental organizations (NGOS) on
the proliferation of small arms.
</P>
<P>
"The most pressing need is humanitarian action to help
societies that are emerging from conflict and are awash with small
arms," said the Canadian minister at the meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"There is no single solution. Instead, the issue needs to be
tackled by concurrently taking global, regional and national
approaches. We must consider action to stop the accumulation of
these weapons, which contribute to regional instability and
domestic conflicts while also causing considerable human
suffering," added Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
This initiative is the result of cooperation between Salvadoran
businessmen and members of the Rotary Club of El Salvador and
Rotary International who joined forces to fight the rise of armed
crime in El Salvador over the past years.

<HEADLINE> Pedersen Expects Long Term in Blackburn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Norwegian international defender
Tore Pedersen said on Wednesday he expected to sign a long term
contract with Blackburn if he can finally earn a regular first
team place.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports Wedndesday, the 28-year-old
said:"If Colin Hendry had stayed I was expecting to leave the
club, but now I can see an opportunity to play every week.
</P>
<P>
"If I could get a first team place I would be happy to stay
here, extend my contract and stay for the rest of my career.
</P>
<P>
"I had hopes of playing in the World Cup for Norway but it is
right that if you are not playing first team football you should
not be in the national team."
</P>
<P>
Pederson, who has 46 Norwegian caps, came to Blackburn from
Germany's St Pauli for 500,000 pounds (808,500 U.S. dollars) last
September but has played in only three premier league matches.
</P>
<P>
Blackburn sold fellow central defender Hendry to Rangers of
Scotland earlier this month, opening the way for Pederson to
stake a claim.

<HEADLINE> UN Takes Steps to Speed Up Iraq's Oil Equipment Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations had
recruited two oil experts from Dutch Saybolt firm to help speed up
Iraq's order, receiving and installation of oil equipment, U.N.
spokesman said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council of the United Nations last May authorized
Iraq to sell 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil during the
subsequent six months, the so-called new U.N. oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq complained that it did not have the capacity to export
such an amount of oil due to its shabby oil equipment. The Council
last June agreed to allow Iraq to import 300 million U.S. dollars
worth of spare parts to ungrade its dilapidated oil industry.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the two experts would provide
information on the contracts to the Security Council's Sanctions
Committee on Iraq in an effort to speed up the processing of
contracts for spare parts for Iraq's oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said the Council's sanctions committee had received 55
contracts it needed to approve as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
Saybolt, an oil industry consulting firm in the Netherlands,
has advised the United Nations to endorse Iraq's request for a
minimum of 300 million U.S. dollars worth of oil equipment to meet
the oil export targets under the new U.N. oil-for-food program.

<HEADLINE> IMF Foresees 1 Percent GNP Growth for Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has forecast the Philippines would be fortunate if its gross
national product (GNP) grows 1 percent this year, considering the
poor results of the agriculture sector and the barrage of external
shocks.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines "will be lucky if we still have positive (GNP)
growth of up to 1 percent this year," the Business World on
Thursday quoted IMF representative to Manila Henri Lorie as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government has adjusted its GNP growth target to
2-3 percent from the original 3-4 percent; gross domestic product
(GDP) growth to 1.5-2.5 percent from 2.5-3 percent; and inflation
to 9.25-9.75 percent from the previous 7.5-8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
GNP represents the value of the country's output of goods and
services, including income from abroad. GDP does not include the
income from abroad.
</P>
<P>
The IMF had prescribed a 3-4 percent 1998 GNP growth when it
sealed a two-year precautionary agreement with Manila last March,
giving the country access to a 1.37 billion-dollar emergency fund
facility.
</P>
<P>
Lorie said the macro-economic and fiscal targets have to be
revised down considering the disappointing performance of the
agriculture sector and the lingering regional financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, the country's agricultural
output dropped by a substantial 7.15 percent, the worst record in
the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lorie said the IMF can tolerate a deficit in the
fiscal position of the Philippine government in the light of the
economic slowdown hovering in the region.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said earlier that the IMF
has conceded to a 40-billion-peso (930 million U.S. dollars)
budget deficit this year, a turnaround from the earlier commitment
of a 5-billion-peso (116 million dollars) surplus.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is now preparing for the upcoming review of the
economy by an IMF mission beginning August 26.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the ongoing financial crisis and the El Nino,
the country's GNP grew 2.5 percent in the first quarter this year
while GDP increased by 1.7 percent.

SANTIAGO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen to 20 refugee families
from the former Yugoslavia will arrive in Chile over the next few
months, Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said.
</P>
<P>
Insulza said he had written to the Chile office of the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), offering assistance
to those people.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR is expected to help those families find jobs in Chile
so that they do not have to be under the guardianship of the
Chilean government and the United Nations, said Insulza.

<HEADLINE> Bank Loans Shrink Sharply in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' bank loans
growth rate slowed down to only 10.4 percent at end-June this year
compared to the year-ago 36.3 percent, Journal reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report, quoting data from the central bank, said the drop
in loans reflects the prevailing pessimism of banks on the economy
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"This confirms the view point that banks still see much risk in
lending activities despite our efforts to mitigate the impact of
the financial crisis," a high-ranking central bank official was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the loans growth rate has been declining since the
regional financial crisis first started in Thailand in July last
year.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, the growth rate hit the bottom at 10.1
percent, going hand in hand with the slowdown of the economy
battered by the El Nino weather phenomenon and the surge of
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The rate of 10.4 percent only reflected an insignificant
increase from end-May, which the official attributed to attempts
by authorities to put some confidence back in the market.
</P>
<P>
The official said that in the first half this year, 30 percent
of the total loans were extended to the manufacturing sector, 26
percent to financial institutions, real estate and business
services sector, 15 percent to the wholesale and retail trade
business, and the rest to agriculture, mining, construction,
transportation and other sectors.

<HEADLINE> Sir Bobby Charlton Highly Praises Cantona </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United legend Sir
Bobby Charlton highly praised French soccer star Eric Cantona,
saying the club would never again see the like of the player.
</P>
<P>
The French star spent four and half years in the English
premiership club and brought a series success to the team, which
won four league titles, including two league and cup doubles.
</P>
<P>
After Cantona returned to Old Trafford, a year on from
quitting the game, to finally say his goodbyes in a match
organised to raise money for the Munich Memorial fund on Tuesday,
Sir Bobby gave his measured views on the maverick Frenchman.
</P>
<P>
"Eric Cantona was very special to this club and one wonders if
there will be another like him here," he said.
</P>
<P>
"He has a fantastic gift of tidying everything up. Before an
attack on goal he tidies everything up. He waits for every thing
to be in place before he releases the ball and it's a gift very
few people have.
</P>
<P>
"He's never afraid to be adventurous and never afraid to take
chances, and he very rarely got tackled because he has this
tremendous radar and a great awareness of what was going on
around him.
</P>
<P>
Sir Bobby was happy to put Cantona on a level with the many
great players to have graced Old Trafford, including himself.
</P>
<P>
"Without question he is up there with the Laws, Charltons and
Bests. At this club at the time he was here he was unsurpassed.
</P>
<P>
Current United manager Alex Ferguson, the man who signed
Cantona from Leeds for 1.2 million pounds (1.94 million U.S.
dollars)in 1992, believes the Frenchman was his best ever signing.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson points to the way Cantona was able to handle the
pressure of being the man the fans believed would take them to
the title.
</P>
<P>
"He's had the biggest affect a player has had in any of my
teams, and the greatest thing about him was that he came onto the
stage at Old Trafford as if he was born to play here," he
said.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Two U.S.-made Iridium Satellites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A China-made Long March 2C
carrier rocket successfully sent two U.S.-made iridium satellites
early this morning into pre-set orbit from the Taiyuan Satellite
Launching Center in north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The rocket lifted off from the center at 7:01 a.m. today
(Beijing time).
</P>
<P>
China has fulfilled all contracted launching tasks of the
iridium satellites into orbits. The current launch of the iridiums,
made by the Motorola Corp. of the United States, aims to make up
the communication satellite network.
</P>
<P>
Initial data from the Xi'an Satellite Monitoring and Control
Center indicated that the distributor of the satellites separated
the second stage of the rocket and entered its parking orbit 11
minutes after launch.
</P>
<P>
Sliding for 40 minutes, the distributor successfully altered
course, and boosted the two satellites into their predetermined
orbit at a perigee of 612.35 km, an apogee of 635.48 km, and a
bank angle of 86.4 degrees.
</P>
<P>
The launch had been originally arranged in mid-July and was put
off upon the request of the United States firm due to technical
factors of the satellites.
</P>
<P>
The three-stage Long March 2C carrier rocket, designed
especially to launch iridium satellites, is 40 meters long, 3.35
meters in diameter and weighes 213 tons when launched. The rocket
has been used in five successful launches.
</P>
<P>
The iridium satellite system developed by Motorola is a global
wireless communications network that will combine the worldwide
reach of 66 low-earth-orbit satellites with land-based wireless
systems. The 66 satellites are supposed to be placed in orbit 780
kilometers above the earth at six levels and to be sent into space
by carrier rockets manufactured in the United States, Russia and
China.
</P>
<P>
With the cooperation of the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center and
the Chinese Academy of Carrier Rocket Technology, the China Great
Wall Industry Corp. fulfilled the launching contract of six
iridium satellites from December of 1997 to May of this year. It
will carry out a number of launches to make up the satellite
network in the future.
</P>
<P>
Today's launch was the 54th flight of the Long March family of
rockets.

<HEADLINE> Italian Government Reorganization Needed for Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Further re-organization of the
government system towards a single decision center is the only way
to encourage economic growth in Italy, the Audit Court said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Industry Ministry, for example, should be entrusted with
the power of coordinating policies designed to promote the
"enterprise system", said the court in its annual report to the
Industry Ministry.
</P>
<P>
That would mean putting industrial policies under the same roof
as some responsibilities currently held by the Foreign Trade
Ministry, the Ministry for Agricultural Resources and the
Treasury, the court said.
</P>
<P>
However, the government has already taken measures to
streamline its frameworks and the Treasury had been merged with
the Budget Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a plan was unveiled to group a whole range
of scattered cultural responsibilities in a single ministry, and
another proposal recommended merging the Industry and Labour
ministries as the only way of combating the soaring unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The Audit Court also said that a single agency was needed to
coordinate various agreements designed to trigger growth in
specific zones, and to strike a balance between the regulatory and
policy making functions of the government.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts believed economic development policies were
rarely effective if they were fragmented between a number of
ministries and, the court noted, fragmentation of government
powers meant scattered and wasted resources.

<HEADLINE> Clippers to Make Offer to Lakes Assistant Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Los Angeles Clippers are
reportely prepared to offer their head coach position to Los
Angeles Lakers assistant Kurt Rambis, according to a press report
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times said that the Clippers will make a
formal offer to Rambis, who has been a Lakers assistant the last
four years.
</P>
<P>
However, the Sacramento Kings may also be interested in Rambis
after they fired coach Eddie Jordan on Tuesday. The Clippers
refuse to comment on any report regarding their coaching search.
</P>
<P>
The Clippers have been searching for a coach since April 20

reached the playoffs the previous season under Fitch.
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old Rambis is best known for his hard-nosed style
of playing in a 14-year NBA career, including nine with the
Lakers. After helping the Lakers win back-to-back titles in 1987
and 1988, Rambis signed as an unrestricted free agent with the
Charlotte Hornets. He also played with the Phoenix Suns and the
Kings.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras of the United
States ousted Australian teenager Lleyton Hewitt 6-1, 7-6 (7-4)
in the second round of the 745,000 U.S. dollars Pilot Pen tennis
tournament in Connecticut of the United States Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, the top seed, could have ended Marcelo Rios' one-week
reign as the top-ranked player by winning Sunday's ATP
championship final, but squandered the opportunity when he lost
in three sets to Patrick Rafter of Australian in a match that
still rankles him.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously with what happened on Sunday, I'm still thinking
about it," said Sampras, who believed that Rafter's serve on
match point was out.
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough way to lose that match. I lost the second set
and had some chances in the third but the chair umpire overruled
that match point. I was very upset."
</P>
<P>
This week's rankings have Sampras 41 points behind Chile's
Rios, who is playing in the RCA championships at Indianapolis.
The rankings, released next Monday, most likely will be the basis
for seedings for the U.S. Open later this month. Both this event
and the Indianapolis tournament offer a base of 260 points.
</P>
<P>
Rafter is also in the hunt for the top spot. He needs to win
and collect enough bonus points while Sampras and Rios fail to
reach the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's other matches, Australian Open champion and
third seed Petr Korda of the Czech Republic beat Ukrainian Andrei
Medvedev 6-3,2-6, 6-1. Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov defeated
Australian Todd Woodbridge 6-0, 6-2. Sixth seed Tim Henman of
Britain dismissed Italian Vincenzo Santopadre 6-2, 6-3. Seventh
seed Karol Kucera of Slovakia downed Argentina's Hernan Gumy 6-3,
6-3, and eighth seed Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia got past
American Geoff Grant 6-3, 3-6,6-3.

<HEADLINE> British Scientists Win World's Top Maths Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Two British professors from the
University of Cambridge have received prestigious Feilds Awards,
the mathematical equivalent of Nobel Prizes.
</P>
<P>
Richard Borcherds, 38, and Tim Gowers, 34, are among four
winners announced at the International Congress of Mathematicians
in Berlin, local newspapers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that Britain has won two of the medals,
which are named after Canadian mathematician Joseph Fields and
awarded every four years since 1936 only to academics under the
age of 40.
</P>
<P>
Another British mathematician, Professor Andrew Wiles, 45, who
solved the mathematical mystery of Fermat's Last Theorem but was
too old to qualify for a medal, was also given a special award at
the Berlin Congress.
</P>
<P>
Peter Mandelson, the British cabinet minister with special
responsibility for science and technology, said in a statement
that he was "delighted" that British scientists have been awarded
the world's top maths prize.
</P>
<P>
"These awards speak for the continuing vigor of British
mathematics, and I hope they will inspire more of our young people
to pursue the subject at school and university," he said.

<HEADLINE> Number of Non-U.S. Web Users to Skyrocket by2002: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 19 (Xinhua) -- There will be approximately
100 million Web users in the world by the end of this year and 320
million by 2002, according to a new study of the U.S. research
firm International Data Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
In the new report on the global market forecast for Internet
usage and commerce, IDC said that the number of non-U.S. users of
the World Wide Web will increase more quickly over the next four
years than the number of their U.S. counterparts.
</P>
<P>
While the growth of Web users and Internet access devices will
remain steady in the U.S., the real explosion in numbers will
occur in the Asia-Pacific region between 1997 and 2002. Other
areas outside the U.S. will also experience high growth, IDC said.
</P>
<P>
IDC said that there were 78.1 million devices used to access
the Web in 1997 worldwide. This number will jump to 515 million by
2002.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, there were 18 million people using the Internet for
shopping worldwide, the IDC report said, and the number will
increase dramatically to reach 128 million by 2002.
</P>
<P>
Due to the huge increase in the number of Web shoppers, IDC
predicted that more than 400 billion U.S. dollars worth of goods
and services will change hands over the Internet by 2002, a
compound annual growth rate of 103 percent between 1997 and 2002.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the percentage of worldwide users buying good on the
Internet will increase from 26 percent in December 1997 to 40
percent in December 2002, IDC said.

<HEADLINE> Canada Provides More Assistance to China's Flood Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced Wednesday that
it will provide 200,000 Canadian dollars (132,000 U.S. dollars) in
additional emergency relief aid to flood victims in China.
</P>
<P>
"An estimated 240 million people in north, central and south
east China -- one fifth of China's population -- are affected by
what is being described as the worst floods in living memory,"
said International Cooperation Minister Diane Marleau in a
release.
</P>
<P>
"Canadians are deeply moved by the suffering caused by this
devastating natural disaster," added the minister.
</P>
<P>
The aid package provided by the Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA) will support the International
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in their
efforts to help the people most affected by the floods.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Red Cross is providing an additional 160,000
Canadian dollars of public contributions. This brings its total
contribution to 310,000 Canadian dollars (204,600 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The CIDA's additional contribution, along with that of the
Canadian Red Cross, brings Canada's total humanitarian assistance
for China's flood victims to 560,000 Canadian dollars (369,600
U.S. dollars). The CIDA contributed 50,000 Canadian dollars in
July following an appeal to the international community by the
federation.

<HEADLINE> Polls Show Americans Still Support Clinton as President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Americans continue to approve
of the job President Bill Clinton is doing and want the Monica
Lewinsky probe to end but may become less lenient if more damaging
information comes out, polls showed on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A CBS News/New York Times poll showed 71 percent of those asked
approved of the job Clinton is doing as president, up four
percentage points from a week ago. Twenty-seven percent
disapproved.
</P>
<P>
By three-to-one, the public think the Lewinsky investigation
should be dropped now that Clinton admitted the affair, but half
said resignation or impeachment would be the answer if it comes
out that Clinton asked Lewinsky to lie about it. Forty-eight
percent believe he did just that.
</P>
<P>
But CBS said, "For the first time since this question was asked
in late January, people are more likely to blame Clinton himself
for creating the current situation than to blame his political
enemies."
</P>
<P>
A poll conducted by Zogby International showed Clinton with a
personal approval rating of 54.4 percent against unfavorable of
43.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
That was different from the 61.2 percent approval rate in July
compared to 35.9 percent unfavorable.
</P>
<P>
But 47 percent said they did not believe Clinton when he denied
encouraging anyone to lie and 65 percent said if he did he should
consider leaving office.
</P>
<P>
"The president is not out of the woods. Americans do not appear
to be satisfied with his speech," pollster John Zogby said. "While
his ability to govern has not been damaged too severely, for the
first time we are seeing majorities favoring the possibility of
his leaving office."
</P>
<P>
A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll had Clinton's job approval rating
at 66 percent, versus 29 percent who disapproved, about the same
as a week ago, but his personal approval rating stood more than 20
percentage points below his job rating.
</P>
<P>
Only 29 percent said they thought Clinton was completely open
and honest in his Monday speech while 61 percent said he tried to
mislead the public on some matters. Ten percent said they used to
support Clinton but no longer do.
</P>
<P>
But in some good news for the White House, when asked by the
Gallup poll as to whom they blamed for events getting to where
they are now, 39 percent said Clinton and 44 percent said
independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen percent in the Gallup poll said events of the past few
days made it more likely they would vote for Republican candidates
this fall but 12 percent said they were more likely to vote for
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
The CBS and CNN polls had margins of error of four percentage
points and Zogby had one of 4.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Polls conducted immediately after an event are not always a
reliable gauge of what will happen later, said Andrew Kohut,
director of the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes delayed reactions are substantially different from
initial reactions," he said.

<HEADLINE> China, India Stand Out in Declining Asian PC Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Personal computer shipments
in China and India gained strong growth during the first quarter,
although the Asia-pacific region continued to falter.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. research firm International Data Corporation (IDC)
said Wednesday that PC shipments in the region, which exclude
Japan, dropped 5 percent, below its initial forecast of a 1.4
percent decrease. But China and India stood out with 28 percent
and 39 percent growth respectively.
</P>
<P>
Also in the second quarter, IDC said, revenue for PC makers
fell 35 percent in the region. The sharp decline in revenue was
caused by many of the same factors as experienced in the first
quarter: the popularity of PCs priced around 1,000 U.S. dollars,
price sensitivity due to Asia's economic crisis and the increasing
market share taken by India and China, where systems were priced
lower than in the more developed markets.
</P>
<P>
IDC said that U.S. PC makers Compaq, IBM and Hewlett-Packard
maintained the region's top three vendors during the second
quarter. China's Lengend climbed to the fourth rank in the
regional market for the first time due to healthy growth in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The worst market conditions remained in Southeast Asia and
South Korea in the second quarter, IDC said. Indonesia, Thailand
and South Korea recorded the steepest shipment declines from the
previous year with decreases of 90 percent, 40 percent and 58
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
China remained the region's largest market, accounting for 39
percent of total unit shipments during the period, IDC said. PC
shipments in China increased 28 percent from a year ago to reach
nearly 1 million units.
</P>
<P>
India's growth was strong in the second quarter and it produced
the greatest annual growth rate in the region with shipments up 39
percent from a year ago. Australia, with a 12 percent growth,
continued to be the second largest market in the region after
surpassing South Korea for the position in the first quarter.

LONDON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The British government announced
Wednesday it would send more troops to Brazzaville, capital of the
Congo Republic, in case British nationals have to be evacuated
from the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
Last week, British Foreign Office advised British nationals to
leave the Democratic Republic of the Congo following a worsening
civil war in the country.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for British Ministry of Defense was quoted by
Reuters as saying early Wednesday it had sent 75 marine commandos
from Ascension Island to Brazzaville to join 45 British soldiers
who have been there since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that the British government was "keeping
a close eye on the situation. There is obviously a possibility of
an evacuation being required."
</P>
<P>
Another 120 personnel would be sent from Britain to the
Gabonese capital Libreville to provide logistical support and
reinforcements, the spokesman added.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council Wednesday were considering a draft statement on
Kosovo, the council president, Danilo Turk, said.
</P>
<P>
Turk told reporters that "the consultations are continuing" so
that different ideas could "be reflected further."
</P>
<P>
The consultations came as efforts were being made to bring the
two sides of Kosovo back to the negotiating table to end six
months of conflicts, which have caused more than 500 deaths and
created about 200,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
On August 11, the 15-member Security Council called for an
immediate cease-fire between the security force of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia and the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Turk said that the issue of Kosovo "can
have no military solution."
</P>
<P>
Kosovo, Serbia's southernmost province, has an area of some
10,000 square kilometers and a population of more than 2 million,
of whom 90 percent are ethnic Albanians.

<HEADLINE> 1stld Jordan's King Reshuffles Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's official Petra news
agency Wednesday said Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali is to
present his resignation and Chief of Royal Court Fayez Tarawneh is
expected to be entrusted to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Petra retracted its earlier urgent dispatch, saying
the king, who has been in the U.S. for treatment for cancer, has
accepted Majali's resignation and named Tarawneh to for a new
administration.
</P>
<P>
In fact this did not make much difference. Analysts here said
Petra's dramatic change of tone only reflected the delicate
political situation in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh has a strong link with the royal family. His father,
Ahmad Tarawneh, who died on August 8, once served as deputy prime
minister, parliament member and chief of Royal Court.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh was ambassador to the United States, and he negotiated
the peace treaty with Israel in 1994.
</P>
<P>
A new government is expected to be announced within days.
</P>
<P>
Majali's government has been under fire for negligence in
handling the polluted drinking water incident and mismanagement of
the economy.
</P>
<P>
Local papers Tuesday quoted government officials as saying
that a cabinet reshuffle might come next week, when seven to 12
ministers will be purged but Majali will not step down until the
king comes back.
</P>
<P>
The ministers to be sacked were said to bear the responsibility
for water pollution in west Amman, a recent collision of two jumbo
jets in Jordan's airspace and an explosion at the Aqaba power
plant near the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Majali government also fell short of expectations in
pushing through reforms, such as privatizing state-own companies,
combating poverty and unemployment, supervising parliamentary
elections, and improving the economy.
