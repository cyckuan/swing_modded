<HEADLINE> Iranian Minister Says Ready to Face Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Hours after the conservative
Majlis (parliament) raised a motion against him, Iran's Minister
of Culture and Islamic Guidance, Ataollah Mohajerani, announced
Wednesday that he was ready to face an impeachment hearing.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Majlis Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri, Mohajerani
said he was ready to be present at the impeachment hearing at the
Majlis on Sunday, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A group of 31 conservative parliamentarians Wednesday morning
called for the impeachment of Mohajerani, who is also spokesman of
the government of President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The impeachment motion accused Mohajerani of failing to uphold
Islamic and revolutionary values by adopting a liberal policy on
the press, book publishing and arts. It also charged him of
misappropriating public funds for minor Hajj rituals.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani is the second moderate minister of Khatami's cabinet
to be targeted by the powerful conservatives who still dominate
the country's legislature, judiciary and armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The minister, a close ally of the reformist president and a
strong supporter of his open-minded policies, came under fire of
the conservatives after his close friend, former Interior Minister
Abdollah Nouri, was impeached by the Majlis last June.
</P>
<P>
According to the Majlis regulations, Mohajerani should appear
before the Majlis to give his explanations within 10 days after
the impeachment motion was submitted to the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
Many moderate figures have warned that the conservatives have
planned a series of offensives to elbow the moderates out of the
Iranian political arena.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats and political analysts here said that the minister
might face the same fate of Nouri since the conservatives still
hold the majority in the 270-seat Majlis.

<HEADLINE> Six Apache Helicopters Arrive in Tirana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RINAS AIRPORT, Tirana, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Six Apache attack
helicopters of the U.S. Army arrived at 18:25 local time (1625
GMT) at the Rinas Airport, Tirana, capital of Albania.
</P>
<P>
This was the first batch of the 24 tank-killer helicopters
which the United States has announced it would move in for
attacking Serb tanks in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The other Apaches are expected to come soon.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon has said that the Apache helicopters will be
operational in a week.
</P>
<P>
Along with the six Apaches, seven Blackhawk helicopters and two
Chinooks also landed at the airport.
</P>
<P>
The Apache helicopters will carry out what is called the Task
Force Hawk Operation.
</P>
<P>
An Albania Television report, which said that the U.S. AH 64s
arrived Tuesday, turned out to be wrong.
</P>
<P>
The heavily-armed helicopters are said to be one of the world's
effective weapons against armor.
</P>
<P>
The low-flying aircraft was deployed to increase NATO's ability
to attack Serb tanks in Kosovo, which, along with other parts of
Yugoslavia, has been under massive NATO bombing since March 24.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said Monday that the helicopters, which are
vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire, would be operational in a week.
</P>
<P>
NATO originally planned to base the Apache helicopters in the
Rinas Airport in Tirana but heavy rains in recent days had caused
very muddy conditions, a U.S. military officer said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few weeks, the small airport in Tirana has been
equipped by the U.S. Army with lighting and an air traffic control
system for 24-hour operations.
</P>
<P>
A package of 2,500 U.S. troops, armored personnel carriers and
protective M39 ground-to-ground guided missiles and radars have
been installed at the air base.
</P>
<P>
NATO Supreme Commander Wesley Clark asked for the helicopters
three weeks ago to attack Serb soldiers, tanks and armored
personnel carriers in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Each Apache helicopter is armed with a 30 mm cannon, 70 mm
rockets and 16 Hellfire missiles.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the Apache helicopters would mean the first
direct involvement of U.S. army forces in the Allied Force
operation and a step many see closer to sending ground forces into
Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Sub-Saharan Food Security Threatened by War: FAO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) warned Wednesday that war and civil
strife are still threatening food supply in a number of
Sub-Saharan countries.
</P>
<P>
The Rome-based U.N. agency listed 17 Sub-Saharan nations as
facing exceptional food emergencies. They are Angola, Burundi,
the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo, Eritrea,
Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Liberia, Mauritania, Rwanda,
Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
In Angola, the food outlook this year is "extremely bleak" as
civil fighting and adverse weather conditions are expected to
sharply reduce food production and the country needs massive food
assistance, the FAO said in a special report.
</P>
<P>
It said the food situation will deteriorate further in Somalia
with its current crop estimated to be 25 percent below the
pre-civil war averages following six consecutive poor harvests.
</P>
<P>
In Sudan, some 2.36 million people are in need of emergency
food assistance due to the long-running civil conflict.
</P>
<P>
In Uganda, the food situation also remains precarious, the FAO
said.
</P>
<P>
The number of countries in need of food assistance is an
increase of four in this region since December 1998, the FAO said.

<HEADLINE> Huge Investment Needed to Meet Arab Power Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Arab countries will have to invest
25 billion U.S. dollars every year in the electricity sector
during the coming 20 years to meet the increasing power demand in
their countries.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the opening session of a one-day meeting of Arab
electricity ministers, the Arab League Secretary-General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid underlined the necessity of a project aimed at
linking electricity grids in the Arab world and called on all Arab
countries to join the project, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The speech was read by the AL chief's assistant for economic
affairs, Abdel-Rahman al-Suheibani. The AL groups 22 Arab
countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan linked their power grids last month in a first
step toward a regional electricity network that may eventually be
joined with networks in North Africa, Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Jordan-Egypt line is capable of carrying 130 megawatts and
will be expanded to 350 megawatts after Syria, Turkey and Lebanon
join the grid by the end of 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of left-wing European
parties Wednesday called for a concerted effort by the
progressive powers in Europe to put an end to the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) offensive against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed firm opposition to any change in the
borders in Europe and the deployment of ground forces to
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 12 European countries gathered here for a
two-day meeting, which opened Wednesday, at the invitation of
Cyprus' Progressive Party of Working People (AKEL).
</P>
<P>
NATO began air strikes against Yugoslav Serb targets on March
24 after the Serb-led government refused to accept a peace
agreement to grant autonomy to the independence-seeking ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
Nicos Constantopoulos, president of the Greek Synaspismos
party, said the conflicts in Yugoslavia pose risks to the
environment, the economy and infrastructure of the entire Balkan
region.
</P>
<P>
President of German Democratic Socialism Party Lothar Bidsky
said the air strikes placed the U.N. and Russia on a "lower
level," criticizing the government's decision to allow German
participation in the war.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing NATO's position that its objective is to protect
human rights, Armanto Cossutta, president of Italian Communist
Party expressed fears about the spread of war.
</P>
<P>
Orestis Kolozov, the representative of Greek Communist Party,
deplored the fact that NATO seems to be the only international
organization left and it operates on the premise that it can
intervene militarily when its interests are at stake.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian representative of the Socialist Party Ivan
Kaidandjiev said military involvement in Yugoslavia will not stop
the bloodshed in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his party will not back any participation of
Bulgarian soldiers in a war against a neighboring country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Regrets Russia Not to Attend NATO Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States Wednesday
regretted Russia's decision that it will not attend NATO's summit
scheduled to convene this weekend in Washington, a senior U.S.
official said.
</P>
<P>
However, Stephen Sestanovich, a special advisor to Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, told a press conference that Russia has
a key role to play in creating stability in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly regret this announcement. We regard Russia's
place in the creation of a stable and just European security order
as an important one," Sestanovich said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
announced in Moscow that Russia will not attend the events in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
The NATO summit is expected to be attended by leaders and
officials from 19 member countries and NATO's 25 partnership
countries. Russia was also invited.
</P>
<P>
Russia's refusal is a new protest over NATO's decision to bomb
Yugoslavia. Sestanovich expressed his hope that setbacks in the
U.S.-Russian relationship would not be permanent.
</P>
<P>
"I think common interests will draw NATO and Russia together
again because both have a large role to play in European
security," he said.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Russia have warned that there could be new
confrontation between Russia and the United States if NATO
continues to bomb Yugoslavia, which is Moscow's traditional ally.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Urges Support for DRC Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) called Wednesday on the international community
to support peace mediation efforts to put an end to the
eight-month war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
A senior official from UNHCR made the call here after his
delegation conducted an assessment mission on refugee situation in
Kaputa and Mporokoso in northern Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Albert Peters, Director of the Africa Bureau of UNHCR, said
that " lasting peace in the DRC is the only viable solution to the
current refugee problem as it will allow Congolese refugees to
return to their homes."
</P>
<P>
Peters and Nicolas Bwakira, Regional Director for Southern
Africa, expressed their satisfaction with the response to the
refugee influx to the area, where 28,000 refugees have flocked to
since early last month.
</P>
<P>
"We have to remain vigilant about the prospects for further
displacements, particularly from Pweto, which reportedly
accommodates a large population of internally displaced
Congolese," said Bwakira.
</P>
<P>
During their on-going visit the two UNHCR official made a call
to Zambian President Frederick Chiluba here Tuesday, who has been
mandated by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to
mediate a peaceful solution to the war in DRC.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba told them that Zambia's resources to handle the influx
of Congolese refugees have been depleted.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba called on the international community to help his
country not only by word of encouragement but practical means.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Welcomes Peace Pact in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said Wednesday that he welcomes the announcement of the
signing of an peace agreement by warring factions in East Timor
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Annan "is confident that the implementation of such an
agreement, both in spirit and on the ground, will be of paramount
importance to the negotiations under his auspices and the overall
peace process in which he is engaged," his spokesman told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The agreement signed by pro-independence guerrilla leader
Xanana Gusmao and the other faction's official Domingos Soares
calls for an end to the violence and the establishment of peace
and stability in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The island has seen dozens of people killed this year because
of civil violence.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached before talks between the foreign
ministers of Indonesia and Portugal due to take place Thursday and
Friday here on the territory's status.
</P>
<P>
Rounds of U.N.-brokered talks have been held since last year.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming tripartite talks between Indonesian Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas, his Portuguese counterpart, Jaime Gama, and
Annan's Personal Representative for East Timor Jamsheed Marker is
expected to focus on Indonesia's amended autonomy package for East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with a population of some 800,000 and an area of
14,874 square kilometers, had been Portugal's colony. In 1975,
Indonesia occupied the territory and annexed it the following
year. The United Nations has since tried to seek a solution to the
territory's status.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia said in January that it would let East Timor part
with the Republic if the East Timorese reject the autonomy
formula.

ADDIS ABABA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program has
signed a food aid agreement with Ethiopia's Disaster Prevention
and Preparedness Commission and the Relief Society of Tigray to
provide a nine-month ration to 272,000 war-displaced people.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency Wednesday quoted Tekle-Woyni Assefa,
director of the relief society of Tigray State, as saying that
272,000 out of the 330,000 war-displaced people, who are now
sheltered in the northern state, will get food assistance worth
some 24.2 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tekle-Woyni said that the 45,351-ton consignment of grain,
lentils, edible oil, sugar and salt was donated in response to
appeals made by the Ethiopian side and through the concerted
effort of the World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
Over 60,000 displaced people who are taking temporary shelters
in caves are also in dire need of blankets, tents and immediate
assistance, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Tigray relief society has distributed 20,000
tons of food, 100,000 pieces of blanket and 15,000 kerosene lamps

<HEADLINE> Iranian President to Visit Saudi Arabia Late May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A Saudi official source
confirmed Wednesday that Iranian President Mohammad Khatami will
pay his first official visit to Saudi Arabia in late May.
</P>
<P>
The source denied that the visit, which was previously planned
in last March, was put off because of Riyahd's position regarding
the dispute between Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over
the three Gulf islands of Abu Mussa, Greater and Lesser Tunbs.
</P>
<P>
The visit was adjourned due to Iran's internal matters, the
source was quoted by Kuwait News Agency as speaking to local
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The source reiterated the kingdom's support to the UAE's
efforts aimed at solving the dispute over the islands either
through direct negotiations or by referring it to the
international court of justice in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia was not meditating between Abu Dhabi and Tehran
but might raise this issue during Khatami's visit, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia was in mistrust and discord with Iran for nearly
two decades because of Tehran's policy of exporting its Islamic
revolution ideology. The 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran toppled
the late shah's regime and brought about the clergymen's rule.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two states began to improve since
Khatami, a political moderate, took office in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
Khatami expressed desire of easing tension and establishing
mutual trust between Iran and the Gulf Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Saudi-Iranian ties saw a big boost in February 1998 when former
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani made a 14-day visit to Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, still an influential advisor to Iran's supreme
leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, held talks with Saudi leaders on a
broad range of issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, the two countries exchanged a lot of
other high-level visits aimed at coordinating positions on ways of
lifting oil prices as well as strengthening bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Economic relations were also bolstered following a number of
exhibitions and trade fairs held in both countries.
</P>
<P>
Riyadh and Tehran also agreed last February to resume regular
flights between the two countries after a suspension of 20 years.

<HEADLINE> NATO Briefing Moves to Washington for Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) said here Wednesday that NATO will not hold
its daily news briefing at its headquarters until next Tuesday
since all of Solana's men will go to Washington to take part in
the alliance's 50th anniversary summit meeting this weekend.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana and his top officials are
heading for Washington to attend the summit meeting of 44 heads
of state and government as well as foreign and defense ministers
from NATO allies and their partners.
</P>
<P>
a NATO civilian spokesman, Jamie Shea, told reporters that
Wednesday's briefing was the last one here for a couple of days
because "tomorrow we will all be heading off for the Washington
summit and briefings will be held in Washington Friday, Saturday,
Sunday and Monday about hopefully if it works out for coincidence
more or less with 3 p.m. Brussels time."
</P>
<P>
"So therefore there will be as much regularity in our
activities as we can achieve," Shea told a news briefing at NATO
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Asked if NATO modified summit agenda and what kind of impact
would be on the general atmosphere, Shea said, "This is probably
the finest way we could celebrate the 50th anniversary of NATO to
be actually doing things to our pole of the principles in which we
believe. I think it's much better to be defending those principles
rather than simply proclaiming them."
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you that the mood in Washington will be one of
determination of our resolve, but not one of despondency, not at
all. Because if you come, if this organization is not managing
crisis, what's it for? What would that be to celebrate? This
organization is the creature of one of the worst crises in modern
European history from 1946 to 1949, that was set up to deal with
tough situations in international politics," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have modified the agenda significantly in order to focus on
Kosovo policy-making. I think that we fill it at the end of the
day that it is just a good-to-demonstrate note of relevant through
action as it is through fine declarations," Shea said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also told reporters that the commemorative
aspects Friday has been tuned down as it's appropriate to the
situation. "There will still be a ceremony to mark 50 years of
NATO..., but more sober ceremony without, if you like, some of the
outside celebrations that we were originally thinking of," Shea
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The leader of Cyprus' Progressive
Party of Working People (AKEL) Demetris Christofias Wednesday
attacked the U.S.-NATO aggression against Yugoslavia in order to
strengthen American hegemony.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the European Union (EU) for being
subservient to U.S. whimsies and said that the U.N. should not be
allowed to be reduced to operate as a lackey of the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The general secretary Cyprus' second largest party said at the
opening of the meeting of left-wing parties from Europe that the
ethnic Albanians are themselves also victims of U.S.-NATO
aggression.
</P>
<P>
The crisis in Yugoslavia has proved that the EU as an
organization of regional integration is politically spineless and
is overpowered by the U.S., Christofias told delegates from 17
delegations representing 12 countries.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that NATO designs aim at changing the borders in
the Balkans to serve its geo-strategic interests.
</P>
<P>
Christofias said the AKEL favors a peaceful solution granting
autonomy to Kosovo and political rights to ethnic Albanians with
full respect of the independence, sovereignty and territorial
integrity and present borders of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Workers Protest Against Price Hikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Lebanese workers
Wednesday held a demonstration in Beirut to protest the new taxes
the government has levied in the 1999 fiscal budget.
</P>
<P>
The protest was organized by the General Labor Confederation
(GLC), Lebanon's largest trade union which groups the country's
350,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators marched across a street to the cabinet
headquarters in downtown Beirut where the weekly cabinet session
was being held under President Emile Lahoud.
</P>
<P>
They asked the government to revoke the price hikes, especially
for the car gasoline, which they said couldn't be endured by the
hard-pressing working class.
</P>
<P>
The government announced this month sweeping tax and customs
increases to generate revenue and stem a chronic budget deficit
set at 40.2 percent of spending this year.
</P>
<P>
The new taxes include a 20-percent price hike on gasoline, a
five percentage point rise in income and corporate taxes from a
maximum of 10 percent and customs duties of up to 55 percent on
imported goods such as alcohol and cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
Except the gasoline price hike, other new taxes don't need to
be approved by the Parliament and have gone into effect since
they were announced on April 7.
</P>
<P>
The protestors decided to hold another demonstration when the
parliament begins its first session to debate on the bill planned
in May.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Starts to Repay Internal Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's treasury has
started to repay its internal debt, the first time in five years.
</P>
<P>
The treasury issued this week hundreds of checks worth about
two billion shillings (about 2.84 million U.S. dollars) to private
companies and businessmen who supplied goods and rendered services
to three government ministries in a move to clear their
accumulated debts.
</P>
<P>
The two billion shillings were part of the 27 billion shillings
dished by the European Union to assist the government to settle
internal debts, the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of
Finance, Raphael Mollel, told reporters in Dar es Salaam
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Those which have received assistance in paying debt this week
include the Ministry of Education and Culture, The Ministry of
Science, Technology and Higher Education, and the Ministry of
Health, Mollel said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, Tanzania's internal debt stood at 902
billion Shillings, according to the central Bank of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The permanent secretary said the central payment office at his
ministry will continue writing checks for other suppliers of goods
and services to the government as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He said internal debts had not been paid since 1993/94 fiscal
year for lack of funds and other reasons.
</P>
<P>
A source at the ministry said that the money from the European
Union is targeted at helping the Tanzanian government repay debts
owed to private firms, which would revamp the economy, increase
gross domestic product and restore the government credibility.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Stock Market Ends Week Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Positive remarks made by
Kuwaiti officials on oil prices and the national economy have
sent the Kuwait Stock Exchange (KSE) index 3.4 percent higher
this week.
</P>
<P>
The KSE index closed at 1,499.5 points Wednesday, up 5.1
points from last week's finish on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The average daily turnover reached 6.12 million Kuwaiti dinars
(20.2 million U.S. dollars), compared with 4.58 million dinars
(15.11 million dollars) in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
A total of 132.95 million shares changed hands in 3,217 deals
in the four trading days this week as against 131.81 million
shares in 3,609 deals traded in five days last week.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts here said that the statement made by Kuwaiti
Oil Minister Sheikh Saud earlier this week on oil prices might
have contributed to the light improvement in the KSE index.
</P>
<P>
Saud expressed satisfaction with the recent oil price hikes
following a daily output cut of about 1.7 million barrels agreed
by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) last month.
</P>
<P>
He said crude prices "are firming up as they are always wanted
and demanded."
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti official also stressed the need to expand the role
of private sector in order to diversify the country's oil-economy.
</P>
<P>
But since the KSE index is remaining below the 1,500-point
margin, experts said while the market is at present going through
a short period of self-adjustment, some big investors are still
waiting for the government to translate its reform pledges into
action.

<HEADLINE> Kaklamanis: Situation in Yugoslavia Can Lead to Balkan's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Greek Parliament President
Apostolos Kaklamanis warned Wednesday that the situation in
Yugoslavia could lead to the destabilization of the entire Balkan
region and even beyond.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Yugoslav ambassador in Athens Dragomir
Vucicovic, Kaklamanis said that a precondition for peace in the
region was the simultaneous withdrawal of Yugoslav troops from
Kosovo and the cessation of NATO bombing and the guaranteed return
of refugees to their homes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greece's Justice Minister Evangelos Yiannopoulos has
invited his European Union (EU) counterparts to hold talks in
Athens and take decisions concerning the ongoing NATO airstrikes
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to EU justice ministers, Yiannopoulos slammed
NATO for its bombing raids on Yugoslavia, saying that the NATO
bombing was "a war crime, a crime against humanity and a crime
against peace."
</P>
<P>
Judicial associations throughout Greece Wednesday also adopted
a resolution calling for the immediate cessation of NATO bombing
and efforts to find a peaceful solution to the Kosovo crisis.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Political Group Studying Desertification in Northwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Zhao Nanqi, Vice-chairman of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference's National
Committee, said here today that desertification is a major threat
to northwestern China and a greater effort needs to be made to
deal with it.
</P>
<P>
Zhao, the head of a CPPCC study group, said that the arid
weather and ecological degradation are the biggest strategic
threat to the region. Unless a proper solution is found, he said,
they will adversely affect the region's social and economic
developments.
</P>
<P>
There are both natural and human factors involved in the
desertification in the region and while the nature may be hard to
deal with, a greater effort must be made to control the excessive
farming, logging, grazing, and the use of water, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
China has one of the world's worst desertification problems.
Deserts account for about 34 percent of its land, with most of the
desertification taking place in the economically underdeveloped
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
Members of the group say that the country needs an overall
plan to deal with the problem and to increase capital imput and
provide incentives to those engaged in the fight against
desertification.

<HEADLINE> Southern Somalia Armed Clash Kills 11 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting resumed
Wednesday between the rival sides of the Marehan Somali National
Front (SNF) faction in Bur Dhubo town of Gedo region,some 370
kilometers southwest of the capital.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, heavily armed militiamen
with several battle wagons supporting Mohamed Sheikh Ali Buralch
have attacked the stronghold of General Omar Hajji Masalle,
chairman of the SNF faction, in Bur Dhubo town before dawn
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
At least 11 people were killed and more than 20 others were
wounded when the opposing militiamen from both sides have
exchanged heavy gunfire in the town.
</P>
<P>
According to radio reports the deceased are mainly combatant
militiamen from both sides since most of the civilians were still
in bed at the time when the attack began.
</P>
<P>
The fighting which continued for several hours died down after
the attacking militiamen of Buraleh were forced to withdraw back
towards their base in Bulo Hawo town now controlled by Ethiopian
forces who crossed the border early in the month.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian forces are supporting Buraleh whom they have
nominated as the new chairman of Bulo Hawo Town following the
serious ambush in which senior politicians within the Marehan clan
 including Ali Nur were killed at the Somali-Kenyan border 13 days
ago.
</P>
<P>
Ali Nur had opposed to General Omar Hajji Masalle who is now a
close ally of Mogadishu's main faction leaders including Ali Mahdi
Mohamed and Hussein Mohamed Aidid ever since the Cairo peace deal
was signed in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
The reason for this major attack on Bur Dhubo town is said to
be related to a revenge operation by the sub-clansmen of late Dr
Ali Nur against General Omar Masalle fighters who are being
accused for masterminding the killing of Ali Nur on April 8.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Political Solution Should Be Found to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The on-going NATO bombing
has entered the fourth week Wednesday, but the military alliance
has so far failed to force Yugoslavia to give in.
</P>
<P>
As NATO stepped up air strikes on Yugoslavia, the international
community is intensifying diplomacy on the crisis of Kosovo, a
Serbian province where conflicts broke up in February after ethnic
Albanians had been fighting Serbs for independence.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a series of initiatives have been put forward
by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Russia, Germany, Ukraine and
the European Union. All of them have said a political solution
should be found to the Kosovo crisis. However, currently at issue
is in which direction efforts should be made?
</P>
<P>
NATO, without the authorization of the U.N. Security Council,
unilaterally launched air strikes on Yugoslavia, a sovereign and
independent member of the U.N. family, on March 24, thus violating
the U.N. Charter and international law. The illegal military
action has cost the lives of many civilians in the Balkan country.
The 15-nation Security Council, under the U.N. Charter, has the
primary responsibility for maintaining peace and security in the
world at large.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, an immediate end to the NATO bombardment is the
pre-condition of a political solution.
</P>
<P>
It is nice for the world to see one initiative after another,
but any solution should first seek the consent of Belgrade, the
legitimate government of the party involved in the year-long
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Not only should the international community guard against
imposition of any peace plan on Yugoslavia, but the world should
bear in mind two fundamental principles: any initiative should
fully respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Yugoslavia, and faithfully guarantee the equality and legitimate
rights of all ethnic communities in the Serbian province, with a
population of 2 million.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been in the dilemma after it took
military action against Iraq. Air strikes do not help in finding a
proper solution to the Iraqi crisis. The logic can be also applied
in the case of the Kosovo crisis: the military attacks can surely
lead the U.S.-led NATO to nowhere.
</P>
<P>
"We are not a country opposing a political settlement. Just
opposite, we are a country endorsing the political settlement,"
Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission to
the United Nations, said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua
Tuesday. "We are open to the political settlement."
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has been endorsing a political solution, and its
government has been in direct talks with Dr. Ibrahim Rugova,
leader of the Kosovar ethnic Albanians. "The talks began to
produce good results," Jovanovic said, referring to the agreements
between the two sides on the appeal for an immediate end to the
NATO bombing, a political solution, and the substantial autonomy
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
However, NATO, which has the world's most powerful military
machine, is stepping up military pressure on Yugoslavia as the
Atlantic alliance is poised to mark the 50th anniversary of the
military group. Its logic: military strikes can lead to the
surrender of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The NATO allegation that it has destroyed the most part of our
military forces is nothing but a wishful thinking," Jovanovic
said. "The fact is it has not destroyed the capabilities and
potentials of our military forces."
</P>
<P>
NATO is threatening to stage ground operations. It is highly
possible if the bombing fails to make Belgrade comply. But, no one
can guarantee the ground war will not spread to neighboring
countries in the Balkan, long considered "a powder kettle of
Europe."
</P>
<P>
Such being the case, more serious humanitarian crisis will be
created by NATO, which waged missile attacks on Yugoslavia under
the pretext of stopping the humanitarian crisis.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Backs Palestinian Decision on Statehood: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Whether the Palestinians will
declare an independent state on May 4 or at a later date, Egypt
will support their decision, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The world consensus in support of the Palestinian right to
self-determination, including the establishment of a state,
represents a significant progress for the Palestinian cause,
Moussa told reporters after a meeting between Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who frequently visits Egypt for talks with Mubarak on
the Mideast peace process, arrived in Cairo Tuesday evening as
part of a tour of North African Arab countries. He left for Gaza
later in the day.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process will "never be complete or
acceptable" unless a Palestinian state is established "in the real
sense," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
The timing for the declaration of a Palestinian state is a
tactical issue, he added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat insisted that he would declare an independent
Palestinian state on May 4 when the five-year interim period for
Palestinian autonomy under the 1993 Oslo Accord expires.
</P>
<P>
He has been consulting with world leaders on the issue in
recent weeks and trying to win their support for his plan and
their recognition of the future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Many countries have voiced support for the Palestinian right to
self-determination but advised Arafat to postpone the declaration
pending Israel's general elections on May 17. They fear any hasty
move by the Palestinians might strength the position of Israeli
hardline right-wingers in the sensitive competition.
</P>
<P>
The 125-member Palestinian Central Council will meet next
Tuesday to decide whether to declare independence on May 4.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Hails Chinese Premier's U.S., Canada Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper, the
People's Daily, in an editorial published Thursday, hailed Chinese
Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to the United States and Canada as
having achieved many positive and desired results.
</P>
<P>
Zhu paid an official visit to the United States from April 6-14
and then proceeded to Canada from April 15-20. During the visit,
Zhu held separate talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien on bilateral relations and
vital international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Zhu's two-nation tour was aimed at substantiating consensus
reached earlier on a series of issues separately between Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and President Clinton and President Chretien,
while deepening understanding and cooperation between China and
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In the editorial, the paper said the tour achieved the desired
results, which was to give impetus to the establishment of a
constructive strategic partnership between China and the United
States, and to enhance a comprehensive and cooperative partnership
between China and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Although differences still exist between China and the United
States, the editorial said, the two countries share vital
responsibilities for global peace and development. It is in the
basic interests of the two countries to maintain and improve their
friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu reiterated to his hosts China's principled stand
over the Taiwan issue, stressing it is an important and sensitive
political issue. Both the U.S. and Canadian governments
reaffirmed their policy of "One China." The U.S. also pledged to
continue observing the principles of the three Chinese-U.S. joint
communiques and the "three no's" policy, which is related to the
Taiwan issue, said the editorial.
</P>
<P>
China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) is an eye-
catching issue on which Premier Zhu issued joint statements
separately with the U.S. president and the Canadian prime minister,
the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government is committed to firmly supporting China's
bid to enter the WTO in 1999, and both sides have agreed to
negotiate unresolved questions concerning China's accession into
the organization by the end of April in order to ensure China's
early entry into the WTO, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government expressed support for China in its bid
to become a WTO member by the end of 1999 and hopes to reach an
agreement with China in a relatively short time, according to the
editorial.
</P>
<P>
The reports on major progress in this respect were welcomed
throughout the world, it said.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen exchanges and cooperation on trade, environmental
protection and energy as well as in other fields confirms to the
interests and will of the Chinese, the U.S. and Canadian peoples,
the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the U.S., Premier Zhu and the U.S. side
signed a series of agreements on cooperation between the two
countries in areas including agriculture, environmental protection,
energy, customs and civil aviation.
</P>
<P>
With Canada, China signed agreements such as the "Environmental
Cooperation Action Plan" and the "Memorandum of Understanding on
Cooperation in Combating Crime."
</P>
<P>
China has also signed many economic cooperation agreements and
business contracts with the U.S. and Canada.
</P>
<P>
All these achievements are certain to widen prospects for
China's mutual benefit and cooperation with the U.S. and Canada in
the fields of economy and trade, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Premier Zhu clarified the position of the
Chinese government on the Kosovo issue and other major regional
and international matters.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that military intervention in Yugoslavia's internal
situation should be halted immediately to put the Kosovo issue
back on the track of a political solution as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The world is experiencing significant and profound changes at
the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
The general international situation is tending to ease, but the
world is still far from every obtaining peace, said the editorial.
</P>
<P>
"We should observe the principles and pursue the purposes of
the U.N. charter and insist that all countries, big or small,
strong or weak, poor or rich, should be equal on the basis of the
five principles of peaceful coexistence," it said.
</P>
<P>
The editorial also urged respect for the wish of various
peoples to choose their own way of development according to their
respective situations.
</P>
<P>
It opposed resorting to force or the threat of force in solving
conflicts between countries.
</P>
<P>
"Only this conforms to the current trend of historical
development and the common aspiration of the peoples of various
countries," said the editorial.
</P>
<P>
"Although there are still various difficulties on the road to
forging ahead, we firmly believe the friendly cooperation between
China and the United States and between China and Canada is in
accordance with the feelings of the three peoples and the general
trend of our times," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
It said Zhu's visit to the United States and Canada has won
universal attention and high praise from the international
community. It quoted international media reports as saying that
the visit is another major achievement in China's diplomacy, which
succeeded in restraining the anti-China clamor, maintaining and
promoting Sino-U.S. relations, and further strengthening Sino-
Canadian relations.
</P>
<P>
"Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core, we will pursue the
independent foreign policy of peace, continue strengthening
friendly cooperation with the United States, Canada and other
countries, and endeavor to turn the 21st century into a new era of
peace, stability and prosperity," the editorial concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
RINAS AIRPORT, Tirana, April 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Apache
helicopters arrived at Tirana's Rinas Airport at around 1600 GMT
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The heavily-armed helicopters are said to be one of the world's
effective weapons against armor.
</P>
<P>
The low-flying aircraft is being deployed to increase NATO's
ability to attack Yugoslav tanks in Kosovo which, along with other
parts of Yugoslavia, have been under attack by NATO since March 24.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said Monday that the helicopters, which are
vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire, would be operational in a week.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few weeks, the small airport in Tirana has been
equipped by the U.S. Army with lighting and an air traffic control
system for 24-hour operations.
</P>
<P>
A package of 2,500 U.S. troops, armored personnel carriers and
protective M39 ground-to-ground guided missiles and radar have
been installed at the air base.
</P>
<P>
Each Apache helicopter is armed with a 30 mm cannon, 70 mm
rockets and 16 Hellfire missiles.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the Apache helicopters would mean the first
direct involvement of U.S. Army forces in the Allied Force
operation and a step many see moving closer to sending ground
forces into Kosovo.

MOSCOW, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Federation Council, or
the upper house of parliament, voted Wednesday to reject President
Boris Yeltsin's demand to fire Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov.
</P>
<P>
The Federation Council, the only body authorized to fire a

It is the second time the Federation Council has rejected

Yeltsin asked the Federation Council to fire Skuratov on moral

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- There is a "heavy agenda" for
the annual spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the World Bank held here on April 20-28, IMF Managing
Director Michel Kamdessus said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Interim Committee, known officially as the Interim
Committee of the Boards of Governors on the International Monetary
System, will meet on April 27 to review the world economic
outlook, recent development and particularly the policy response
to the recent crisis in Asia, Russia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Issues of strengthening the architecture of the IMF and the
financial system will be discussed, Kamdessus said at a press
conference at the IMF headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The Interim Committee, consisting of 24 countries, was
established in 1974 to advise the Board of Governors of the IMF
on supervising the management and adaptation of the international
system as well as dealing with disturbances that might threaten
the system.
</P>
<P>
They will consider specific actions taken to strengthen
initiatives in favor of the heavily indebted poor countries, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"That is heavy agenda with crucial questions at the important
moment of history," Kamdessus said.
</P>
<P>
Strengthening of actions for countries in a situation of
conflicts will also be discussed, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will certainly devote to the discussion of the Kosovo
issue, how the international community can evaluate its regional
impact and coordinate their efforts to alleviate the human
sufferings, and start preparation for reconstruction," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Wednesday called on the Central African Republic to finalize
preparations for the forthcoming presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press, the president of the
15-member Security Council, Alain Dejammet of France, said,
"member of the Security Council call on the Central African
Republic authorities and all parties to finalize preparations for
the forthcoming presidential elections."
</P>
<P>
The Council members "encourage the Government and all political
parties to resume the dialogue in order to find an acceptable
compromise by all, concerning the organization and functioning of
the mixed and independent electoral commission," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Security Council urge the Central African
Republic government to continue the restructuring of the armed
forces and they strongly support the appeal made by the
Secretary-General to donor countries to contribute to this
important process," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the security Council strongly reaffirm that the
implementation of the Bangui Agreements and the National
Reconciliation Pact is essential for peace and national
reconciliation in the Central African Republic," the statement
said.

<HEADLINE> Camdessus: World Economic Climate Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Managing Director of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) said here Wednesday that the
world's economic climate is better.
</P>
<P>
"We have come a long way since I last appeared in October,"
Camdessus said at a press conference in advance of the annual
spring meetings of the IMF and the World Bank. "The climate is
distinctly better."
</P>
<P>
The last IMF meetings six months ago were dominated by massive
financial problems in Brazil and pessimism over the financial
crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The IMF Head said capital flows were starting to recover and
the IMF had probably been too pessimistic in its latest forecasts
for Brazil -- a projection that output would contract by 3.8
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
However, Camdessus also warned policy makers against
complacency as an economic recovery gets slowly under way.
</P>
<P>
Japan's outlook was uncertain and big borrower Russia remained
the fund's biggest problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on Europe to make efforts to contribute to the
recovery of world economy.
</P>
<P>
"The United States, which has acted as the locomotive for the
world for so long, needs to cool down and at this time Japan is
weak and the Asian economies are just beginning their recoveries,
so the role of Europe is central," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said a new lending deal with Russia was possible soon, but
that Russia -- the fund's biggest borrower -- was also its biggest
problem.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that it is still possible for us to agree with them
soon," he said. "The next few days will probably bring good
news."

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Accelerate Pace of Oil Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Rafiq Tarar
said Wednesday that his country is determined to accelerate the
pace of petroleum development activities to strengthen the
national economy through sustained energy supplies and reduced oil
import bill.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the closing session of the third Oil and Gas Summit
here, Tarar said that the government has made development of oil
and gas sector a priority area where consistent policies are being
pursued.
</P>
<P>
"Energy is the engine of economic growth. The energy deficient
developing countries like Pakistan are thus very sensitive to
global energy market trends. It is, therefore, important that we
focus our efforts on optimum utilization of our indigenous energy
resources in a sustainable manner," said the president.
</P>
<P>
He said that at present the oil import bill worth 2 billion
U.S. dollars is a heavy drain on the country's economy. "This has
to be reduced," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president added that Pakistan provides remarkable
investment opportunities and there is a tremendous scope for the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
In addition to investment in petroleum exploration, the private
sector can also invest in oil and gas processing, transportation
and marketing, said Tarar.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Minister for Petroleum and Natural Resources Chaudhry
Nisar Ali Khan said that transparency, least cost and quickest
completion of projects for economic benefits remain their guiding
principles in the oil development sector.
</P>
<P>
He said the Pakistani government's policy of encouraging the
participation of the private sector in oil and gas development
activities has been successful.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan is rich in human and natural resources and what is
needed is the technology and the financial resources to harness
this potential," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurated on Tuesday, the two-day summit was attended by
representatives from the oil and gas sector in Pakistan and
abroad.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Up in UK, But Record Number in Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON April 21 (Xinhua) - Unemployment in Britain rose in
March despite a record number of people now being in work,
according to official figures release Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of people claiming benefit and the government's
preferred measure - the International Labor Organisation (ILO)
jobless rate - both showed an increase for the second month in a
row.
</P>
<P>
The claimant count rose by 2,000 last month to 1,314,400, while
the ILO figure, which includes people not on benefit, jumped by
32,000 between December and February to 1,833,000.
</P>
<P>
The biggest increases in claimant count unemployment were in
Scotland and the West Midlands, offset by a fall in London.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> GFMS:Gold Price Remains in $265-$305 Range in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- World gold price would probably be
locked within a range of $265-$305 for the rest of the year owing
to the weak world economic outlook, according to Gold Fields
Mineral Services (GFMS).
</P>
<P>
In its latest edition of the authoritative annual survey on the
world gold market, Gold Survey 1999, GFMS said world GDP growth
and inflation were expected to remain at very low levels during
1999, both of which could be unfavorable to the gold price.
</P>
<P>
Apart from that, there are also a number of other clouds on the
horizon, said, Philip Klapwijk, Managing Director of GFMS at the
launching of the Survey Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned the danger of a weak recovery in East Asia being
more than offset by lower demand in other parts of the world, some
of which were booming last year.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that it was unlikely that India would post a
similar gain in demand to that in 1998 of almost 100 tonnes.
</P>
<P>
On the supply side, GFMS predicted that lower scrap flows in
1999 would be offset to a degree by increased producer hedging.
</P>
<P>
Some of the major producing countries are still relatively
underhedged on average, and mining costs have plummeted, making
selling into any rally all the more likely, according to the
Survey.
</P>
<P>
GFMS believes that it is quite possible that net central bank
sales this year could decline, especially given the new situation
in Europe following the introduction of the euro.

<HEADLINE> European Markets End Firmer, But Still Fidgety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON April 21 (Xinhua) - Overall sentiment in European
markets was good Wednesday after a nervous end to trading Tuesday,
with a positive start on Wall Street supporting gains.
</P>
<P>
The electronically-traded Xetra Dax ended 1.45 percent higher
at 5175.57 in Frankfurt, while French shares rose 0.9 percent to
4291.60 on the CAC 40 index of leading components.
</P>
<P>
German software maker SAP blazed the hottest trail on the DAX,
rocketing 17.8 percent after the company reported first-quarter
earnings above expectations.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, two of Tuesday's leading decliners were among the
gainers Wednesday. Chip maker STMicroelectronics closed up 3.52
percent at 98.50 euros, while Cap Gemini advanced 4.91 percent to
132.4 euros.
</P>
<P>
The UK's FTSE 100 index closed broadly unchanged on the day, as
investors' nerves remained frayed a day after its biggest tumble
since December last year.
</P>
<P>
The index fell 0.14 percent, or 8 points, to end at 6311,
weighed down by a 3.3 percent slide in BP Amoco, which built on
its previous session losses as crude oil prices languished below
the 16 US dollars-a-barrel level.
</P>
<P>
"People are a bit worried that yesterday's fall was the start
of a bear market, if that's not putting it too strongly," said a
senior sales trader at a British brokerage.
</P>
<P>
"They are looking nervously at Wall Street but as long as the
Dow stays above 10,000, we should be okay," he added.

<HEADLINE> Albright Asks Congress to Support NATO Campaign in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Wednesday urged Congress to support NATO's
campaign in Kosovo and expressed concern that the Kosovo conflict
might be spreading.
</P>
<P>
"We think declaration of war would have a number of negative
effects, such as NATO cohesion, regional stability and our
relations with Russia," Albright told the House International
Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
The committee will talk about several measures related to the
War Powers Act, including resolutions to either declare war
formally on Yugoslavia or withdraw U.S. participation in the NATO
campaign. Neither was favored by the administration.
</P>
<P>
Albright urged Congress to support the current bombing
campaign, which is aimed at pressuring Belgrade to give in.
</P>
<P>
Albright also said that under discussion was a British proposal
to create some kind of international protected area within Kosovo
that would allow there to be self-government with an international
protective force.
</P>
<P>
Congress also was considering the administration's emergency
spending request for six billion U.S. dollars to help continue the
air war through September, if necessary, and to pay
refugee-related costs.

<HEADLINE> WFP Renders Emergency Food Aid to Displaced Eritreans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program
(WFP) Wednesday announced that it will begin providing emergency
food aid to Eritreans affected by the new war between Eritrea and
Ethiopia, U.N. Spokesman Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard told a press conference that the WFP decision came at
the request from the Eritrean Government.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. agency will launch a 15.4-million-U.S. dollar
operation in April to feed about 268,000 displaced Eritreans in
three southern provinces.
</P>
<P>
According to the WFP, the border conflict between the two
neighboring countries in May 1998 escalated in February this year
and forced thousands of Eritreans living along the border to flee
further north into the country. The majority of them are now
living out in the open or under makeshift tents in three dry
mountainous regions.
</P>
<P>
WFP is already providing food to 900,000 Ethiopians for
development activities and is providing food to 2.1 million
Ethiopians who have been affected by war or drought.
</P>
<P>
The 11-month war in the Horn of Africa has left 450,000
Eritreans homeless or unable to tend to their farms and business,
according to the Eritrean Relief and Refugee Commission. Eritrea
has a population of 3.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea and Ethiopian have been at war since May over area of
their barren 1,000-kilometer border, which were not clearly
demarcated when Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The two Horn of Africa countries have accepted an OAU-sponsored
peace plan but are in disagreement over the terms of a ceasefire.

<P>
CAIRO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Investment Bank (EIP),
an affiliation to the European Union, agreed Thursday to offer a
loan to Egypt for the construction of a sewage drainage system,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal signed by Egyptian Housing Minister Ibrahim
Soleiman and EIP Deputy Director Adrien Lubenswki, the bank will
provide 30 million euro (32.35 million U.S. dollars) for a sewage
drainage project in the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria, 220
kilometers northwest of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The loan, with an interest of 5 percent, has a maturity of 16
years plus a five-year grace, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, Soleiman said that the project,
estimated to cost 1.8 billion Egyptian pounds (about 530 million
dollars), will be completed in 10 years and serve 750,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Lubenswki, who arrived in Egypt last Saturday on a five-day
visit, told MENA earlier in the day that EIP has financed a number
of Egyptian industrial projects, including one for the elimination
of pollution in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
She estimated at 1 billion euro (1.1 billion dollars) the loans
that EIP has extended to Egypt's industrial projects, saying that
a number of European companies are gearing towards investment in
Egypt because of its robust investment climate.

NICOSIA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- A NATO ground operation against

Stanik said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with Cyprus' Justice and Public Order
Minister Nicos Koshis, Stanik, who is here on a five-day visit,

She said all European states must do whatever possible towards
settling this matter peacefully.

NATO launched massive air strikes against Yugoslavia on March
24 to punish Belgrade's refusal to sign a deal with separatist
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and allow NATO troops be deployed in
the Serbian province.

<HEADLINE> KCRC Launches Note Issuance Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Kowloon-Canton
Railway Corporation (KCRC) Thursday launched a 10 billion-HK
dollar (1.28 billion U.S. dollar) note issuance program to finance
its new railway projects.
</P>
<P>
One of the important objectives that the program serves is to
promote the continuing development of Hong Kong's debt market
through the introduction of high quality borrowers, said Joseph
Yam, chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),
the arranger of the program.
</P>
<P>
Another objective of the program is to assist the public sector
entities in borrowing HK dollar funds cost-effectively, and in a
way that correctly reflects their credit-worthiness, said Yam at
the signing ceremony of the note issuance program.
</P>
<P>
Yam said that HKMA is working closely with the Stock Exchange
of Hong Kong on the listing of Exchange Fund Notes with a view to
promoting wider access by investors.
</P>
<P>
The Stock Exchange provides a marketplace where retail
investors can more readily participate in the market for Exchange
Fund Notes.
</P>
<P>
"The high savings rate of Hong Kong people suggests that there
may be money seeking a home in a secure, medium to long term
listed investment of this nature," Yam said.
</P>
<P>
More generally, the imminent launch of the Mandatory Provident
Fund (MPF) should further stimulate the demand for high quality HK
dollar products.
</P>
<P>
"These various developments -- today's KCRC program, the
Listing of EF Notes and the advent of the MPF -- should all
contribute positively to the development of the HKD debt market,"
Yam said.

JERUSALEM, April 22 (Xinhua) -- A Russian senior official said
here Thursday that Moscow opposes possible use of ground troops by
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Kosovo, stressing
that the conflict must be resolved by diplomatic solutions.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov made the remarks
after meeting with his Israeli counterpart Ariel Sharon.

Ivanov told reporters that any step like the use of ground

<P>
He said Russia is trying to do everything it can to find a

<P>
NATO began air strikes against Yugoslav Serb targets on March 24
after the Serb-led government refused to accept a peace agreement
to grant autonomy to the independence-seeking ethnic Albanians in
the Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov's remarks came amid reports that NATO leaders will make
decisions at their upcoming summit in Washington Friday on whether
to use ground troops to intensify their strike against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Russia remained opposed to the NATO bombing campaign against
Yugoslavia, which has entered its fourth week, and has been trying

</P>
<P>
Last month, he organized a same meeting in the house and

</P>
<P>
The Israeli government was not happy about those activities in

Closing down the Orient House is a big political issue

<HEADLINE> Blood Donations Make Progress in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Blood donations in China have
reached acceptable levels since the country's new Blood Donation
Law came into effect last October.
</P>
<P>
 In most parts of the country, free blood donations have
replaced paid for blood, which is the usual method for supplying
hospitals in the past, it was revealed at a conference here.
</P>
<P>
 The latest statistics from the Ministry of Health showed that
Liaoning, Heilongjiang and Shanxi provinces and Chongqing
municipality have realized targets that all blood used in
hospitals should come from free donors.
</P>
<P>
 In the coastal city of Qingdao, donated blood has not only
met the needs of local hospitals but also helped those in
surrounding cities.
</P>
<P>
 Cao Ronggui, Chinese vice minister of health, said that in
the past several months, people throughout the country have a
clearer understanding about the methods and need for blood donors,
previously a controversial issue in China.
</P>
<P>
 Government officials, servicemen and students took a leading
role in promoting free blood donations.
</P>
<P>
 It is estimated that some 50,000 servicemen and 200,000
students have donated their blood in the past five months.
</P>
<P>
 Medical personnel have also contributed to the good cause,
setting up mobile blood banks in quite a number of cities.
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the clinical use of blood has dropped from
10 percent to 30 percent in most of China's provinces and
municipalities as a result of better management.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Close Down Palestinian Offices in Orient </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli security cabinet
decided Thursday to issue orders to close down offices run by
Palestinians in the Orient House in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli security cabinet discussed the Palestinian
activities in the Orient House in East Jerusalem and instructed
Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani to issue orders to close
down those offices, a statement issued by the Prime Minister's
Office said.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's security cabinet meeting was called by Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to especially discuss what measures
the Israeli government could take against the Orient House.
</P>
<P>
The Orient House is actually a representative office of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) in East Jerusalem run by PNA
Minister in Charge of Jerusalem Affairs Faisal Husseini. Several
other PNA organizations also have their offices inside the
building.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side alleged that the Palestinians inside the
building were engaged in organizing political and diplomatic
activities.
</P>
<P>
Despite warnings from the Israeli government, Husseini called
about 30 foreign diplomats based in Jerusalem Wednesday evening to
the Orient House and briefed them on the Israel's policies of
revoking residency permits of the Palestinians and confiscating
identity cards.
</P>
<P>
Last month, he organized a same meeting in the house and
briefed foreign diplomats on the development of the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government was not happy about those activities in
the city, saying Jerusalem is Israel's sovereign capital
forbidding the Palestinians to have any kind of political and
diplomatic activities there.
</P>
<P>
Closing down the Orient House is a big political issue
concerning the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have been insisting that Jerusalem is their
city and their leader Yasser Arafat has pledged to declare an
independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
In fact, over 200,000 Palestinians are now living in the
traditionally Arab East Jerusalem and the world renowed Aqsa
Mosque is inside the Old City.
</P>
<P>
The Oslo Accords signed between Israel and the Palestinians in
1993 also stipulated that the Jerusalem will be decided during the
final-status peace talks between Israel and PNA.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side could not be reached at this moment for
comments on the Israeli move.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Games Cut Budget </HEADLINE>

<P>
CANBERRA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Sydney Olympic organisers
decided to cut the operating budget by 48 million U.S dollars
Thursday after potential sponsors were frightened away by the
International Olympic Committee bribery scandal, reports from
Sydney said.
</P>
<P>
Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG)
president Michael Knight said the sponsorship target had been cut.
</P>
<P>
"Over the last few months the focus that has been, in the media
and elsewhere, on the IOC has left us with a period where it was
incredibly difficult to get out and pitch for sponsors," Knight
said after a SOCOG board meeting.
</P>
<P>
The IOC was forced to expel 10 members in a million dollar cash-
for-votes scandal over Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002
Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
Knight said the cuts were a fraction of the 1.6 billion U.S.
dollars overall budget and he still believed they could leave a 19
million U.S dollars surplus to the New South Wales State which is
underwriting the Games.

<HEADLINE> Private Businesses to Receive Better Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Private businesses in China are
to enjoy better service from the government as the country strives
to increase employment and restructure state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month the State Economic and Trade Commission (
SETC) completed an investigation about the development, policy
environment and difficulties of private and household businesses.
</P>
<P>
It is working on a set of policies for creating a platform of
fair competition for private businesses.
</P>
<P>
Ma Jiantang, director of the Department of General Economic
Affairs of SETC, said that though enterprises of various ownership
are treated as equals in law, private companies cannot enjoy the
same treatment as state-owned enterprises in such practical fields
as fund raising, taxation, imports and exports, land use and
overseas traveling.
</P>
<P>
He noted that local private companies are restricted from
entering certain trades that are open to foreign companies,
including finance, insurance, real estate and wholesale medicines.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he pointed out that private companies are
yet to improve in many aspects, such as accounting and employment
systems, management, capital management, technology, specialized
talents, product quality and tax payments.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government will update or promulgate laws and
regulations governing the development of private businesses. It
will also smooth fund raising channels and adopt uniform
administrative mechanisms for them.
</P>
<P>
Private companies now account for all the net increase of job
opportunities in urban areas in the country. In 1998, employees in
private companies in urban areas increased by more than 5.6
million over 1997, while the total number of employees in state-
owned enterprises decreased nearly 3.9 million over the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Private companies have become the biggest re-employer of laid
off workers of state-owned enterprises, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Non-state-owned businesses accounted for nearly one-fourth of
the gross domestic product (GDP) of the country in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that the prosperity of private businesses is crucial
for re-invigorating state-owned enterprises, maintaining stability
and securing sustainable economic growth throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> France Says NATO Summit Should Move Toward European Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- France is of the view that the NATO
Washington summit on Friday should mark a new step toward a
European defense, said French presidential spokeswoman Catherine
Colonna on Thursday at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Due to the new geopolitical situation, NATO should take into
account the important role of the United Nations in its new
strategic concept, she said.
</P>
<P>
France is opposed to the idea of transforming NATO into a "holy
alliance" entitled to act any where in the world. Instead, France
wants the alliance to respect the fundamental principles of
international law by stressing the prerogatives of the U.N.
Security Council, said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
On a strengthened European defense, the spokeswoman of
President Jacques Chirac said that a European identity in NATO
will be "a contribution to the security and stability of all."
</P>
<P>
"The movement toward a Europe of defense will be one of the
themes (of the Washington summit). It should be a new step
allowing Europeans to shoulder more of their responsibilities in
the field of defense," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Washington summit should confirm the orientation of the
NATO-Berlin conference in 1996 and the NATO-Madrid summit in 1997;
both have increased the role of the Europeans in the trans-
Atlantic alliance, she said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the summit should "pursue the work of renovating the
trans-Atlantic link in the light of NATO's new strategic concept,"
she added.
</P>
<P>
President Chirac, who will attend the Washington summit, said
in a radio-television speech Wednesday that because of the war in
Yugoslavia, it is necessary for Europe to accelerate the movement
toward the establishment of a European defense system.

<HEADLINE> China's Steel Industry Conference Held in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The future development of small
and medium-sized steelworks was the main topic at the China Steel
Industry Conference 1999 held here on April 21-22.
</P>
<P>
Around 100 metallurgical experts from China, the Republic of
Korea, Japan, the United States, the UK and some Arabian countries
attended the conference, sponsored by the Metallurgical Council of
the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and IBC
Asia Limited.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of steelworks in China are small and
medium-sized and they produce 50 percent of the country's steel
production. These plants have advantages over their bigger
counterparts in meeting regional demands, especially in areas
located far away from large steel making centers.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xiaoqi, a planning official with the State Bureau of
Metallurgical Industry, said that these steelworks should
specialize in certain products and seek to form enterprise groups
when conditions are ripe.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, there were more than 1,600 iron and steel
producers in China. Only four of them report annual production of
more than five million tons.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Deputy
Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
Sun Guangxiang held talks Thursday with Cambodian Prime Minister
Hun Sen and National Assembly President Prince Norodom Ranariddh
separately.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, both sides addressed the traditional and
friendly Sino-Cambodian ties that were started by King Norodom
Sihanouk and the old generation of Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed the hope to further strengthen the trade
and economic cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen and Sun Guangxiang discussed the use of loans provided
by China. Hun Sen agreed in principle to the proposals put forward
by China that China will use a low interest loan of about 18
million U.S. dollars to help four Chinese companies to invest in
building enterprises in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
China will also use the commercial loans of 200 million U.S.
dollars to construct two large irrigation projects and revamp some
roads and a railway from Phnom Penh to the Thai border.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday afternoon, Sun Guangxiang, head of the Chinese
government trade and economic delegation visiting Cambodia,
delivered 300 shallow water wells for civil use to Cambodia. Since
1995, China has drilled 500 water wells for Cambodia, which
greatly improved Cambodia's drinking water conditions in rural
area.
</P>
<P>
Besides the delivered 500 water wells, China has already
decided to drill 500 more shallow water wells for Cambodia with
the grant of 40 million Yuan Renminbi (4.8 million U.S. dollars).
The Exchange of Notes of the project was signed on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At the delivery ceremony, Sun Guangxiang said there is a great
potential in trade and economic cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government trade and economic delegation arrived
here Sunday for a seven-day official visit to enhance bilateral
trade and economic ties with Cambodia. The delegation also
included 14 representatives of Chinese companies involved in
agriculture, industry, water and railways.
</P>
<P>
China agreed in February, during a visit to Beijing by Prime
Minister Hun Sen, to provide Cambodia with a low interest loan of
150 million yuan (18 million dollars) and a grant aid of 40
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
China also agreed in principle to grant Cambodia commercial
loans of 200 million dollars for agriculture and infrastructure
projects.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Israeli Economic Cooperation Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Big potential exists in further
strengthening the economic and trade relationship between China and
Israel and the two sides also have a bright future in enhancing
scientific and technological cooperations.
</P>
<P>
Those remarks were made by Israeli President Ezer Weizman in an
interview with Xinhua and other Chinese reporters here held before
his trip to China.
</P>
<P>
Invited by his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin, Weizman is
scheduled to fly to Beijing on Saturday for a week-long state
visit. During his stay in China, Weizman will also visit Shanghai,
Kunming and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, he will hold talks with Jiang and other Chinese
leaders on bilateral, regional and international issues of mutual
concern, as well as the current development of the Mideast peace
process. This is Weizman's first visit to China in the capacity of
Israeli President since he assumed office six years ago.
</P>
<P>
"For Israel, China is a very important country and this trip
will provide me with a very good opportunity to find out what's
happening in China, to discuss with the Chinese leaders the future
that we are facing, the Mideast situation and issues of how to
further our mutual cooperations," Weizman said.
</P>
<P>
While expressing his satisfaction over the current development
of Sino-Israeli relationship, Weizman said Israel and China
established diplomatic ties only for seven years, but during this
period big progress has been made in trade, science and
technology, agriculture and other sectors of cooperation due to
joint efforts and the Israeli side was satisfied with what has
been achieved so far.
</P>
<P>
"Looking at the future, our two countries have a bright
prospect in expanding cooperation in the above mentioned fields
and over 30 Israeli business leaders will come to China with
me to sign ten agreements with concerned Chinese departments, so
that this visit will help open a new chapter of mutual cooperation
between our two countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Weizman also spoke highly that China has played an important
role in the world affairs, adding that promoting Sino-Israeli
relations are in the interests of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
This world has been changed a great deal since the World War
II, and such a big country like China has been playing a very
important and decisive role in solving international issues, he
said, adding that China will also be an important part of the
future world as China's future influence will be stronger and
bigger.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the Mideast peace process, he said the process could
only be moved forward after Israel's May elections and a new
Israeli government was formed.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks has entered into another
stalemate and under this circumstances, it is better for the
Palestinians to postpone the declaration of the statehood on May
4, the final date of the five-year transitional period set by the
Oslo Accords, he said, adding that it will be better for the two
sides to solve this issue through talks and consultations.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Israel's peace talks with Syria and Lebanon, he
said those talks could not be separated.
</P>
<P>
"Israel's peace talks with both Syria and Lebanon have not been
restarted, and Israel's bilateral partial troop pullout from south
Lebanon could help solve the problem, and I prefer all those
complicated problems in the Mideast process be solved once for all
after the new Israeli government was formed after May elections,"
he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Russian Speaker Urges Government to Send Military Aid to Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Russia must make it clear now on
whether or not it can provide military aid to Belgrade, since NATO
is evidently preparing a ground operation to enter Yugoslavia,
Speaker of the State Duma Gennady Seleznyov, said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
There is mounting pressure for Russia to provide military aid
to Yugoslavia, the speaker said, adding that just one advanced
Russian anti-aircraft missile system would help the Yugoslav army
shoot down dozens of NATO planes.
</P>
<P>
The Russian people will ask the government to supply military
aid to Yugoslavia if the Kosovo conflict continues, the speaker
said. The Russian government has repeatedly denounced NATO's
attacks against Yugoslavia and called for a political solution to
the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been trying to mediate a political settlement and
President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy on the Kosovo crisis,
former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, headed for Belgrade
Thursday for talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on
finding a way out of the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Report: Israel Willing to Talk over Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 22 (Xinhua) - Israel has sent a new message
to Syria, saying it is willing to resume talks with Damascus from
the point where they broke off three years ago, a local daily
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz said the Syrian government has called upon the United
States to "evaluate" the offer made by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu through a third party, the name of which was not
revealed.
</P>
<P>
The latest offer, if true, would be a revision of an earlier
proposal also revealed by Haaretz.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported early last week that Foreign Minister
Ariel Sharon had asked Russia to mediate between Israel and Syria
to reach a deal in which Israel would pull out from Lebanon first
and open talks with Syria later.
</P>
<P>
According to that proposal, Israel would complete a withdrawal
from south Lebanon before the May 17 elections and Damascus should
prevent any cross-border attacks on Israel by Hezbollah or other
resistance groups.
</P>
<P>
Then, if Netanyahu is re-elected, the new Israeli government
would immediately begin negotiations with Syria over the Golan
Heights, the Syrian territory seized by Israel in 1967.
</P>
<P>
The latest offer, however, did not ask Russia to intermediate,
Haaretz said. Also, the new overture expressed Israel's readiness
to pick up the talks from where they were left off in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz said Damascus is fearing that the latest Israeli
proposal was only an election ploy which only aimed at securing an
Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, where Syria is the main power
broker, before the May 17 elections in order to boost Netanyahu's
chances of re-election.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Sharon have denied both reports by Haaretz.
</P>
<P>
Since Netanyahu came to power in May 1996, his government has
been disputing with Damascus over how the negotiations should be
resumed.
</P>
<P>
Syria has insisted that the talks be restarted from where they
left off, saying that late prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and his
successor Shimon Peres had promised in the talks that Israel would
hand over the whole Golan.
</P>
<P>
But the Netanyahu government claims that the promises do not
exist, insisting that the talks should be resumed without any
pre-conditions.

<HEADLINE> Organizers Recommend Australia Open 2000 Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Sydney Organizing Committee
of the Olympic Games (SOCOG) announced on Thursday it had
recommended to the International Olympics Committee (IOC) that an
Australian, not Britain's queen, should open the 2000 Sydney
Olympics in September.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the job will go to an Australian, almost
certainly Prime Minister John Howard _ who is a staunch monarchist.
</P>
<P>
IOC chief Juan Antonio Samaranch has indicated he is likely to
accept SOCOG's recommendation, reports added.
</P>
<P>
Some monarchists, however, argue that Australia is still part
of the British Empire and that its monarch should open the Games.
</P>
<P>
Australia has been independent since 1901, but still recognizes
Elizabeth II as its head of state.
</P>
<P>
Australians will vote in a referendum in November on whether to
dump the queen and become a republic. If the referendum is passed,
the monarchy would be replaced by an Australian presidency in
January 2001, well after the Games.
</P>
<P>
SOCOG president Michael Knight said the board's decision was
unanimous.
</P>
<P>
It recommended that "should Australia have a president in place
by 15 September, 2000, he or she should open the Sydney 2000
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"However, if no such office is in place, that the elected Prime
Minister of Australia perform this role of national and
international significance."
</P>
<P>
In London, a spokesman for the queen said from Buckingham
Palace that "the question of who opens the Olympic Games is one
for the Australian government."

<HEADLINE> China Sets up New Panda Habitat in Sichuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Pandas roaming in the wild may
suddenly find themselves in a nice habitat with abundant bamboo
and a favorable living environment if they accidentally wander
into a special reserve in the mountainous region of southwest
China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Known as the home of giant pandas Sichuan has established the
new nature reserve for the rare species in the northern area in a
bid to connect other panda habitats.
</P>
<P>
Jiudingshan Nature Reserve covers 17,000 hectares with five
types of bamboo, all of which pandas find edible.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 China launched a ten year project to protect the panda
and its habitat, with plans to establish 14 nature reserves at the
junctions of Sichuan, Gansu, and Shaanxi Provinces, which is a 5,
000 square kilometer habitat with about 80 percent of the last
remaining 1,000 pandas living in the wild.
</P>
<P>
Experts hoped that 17 "panda corridors", with enough bamboo and
other kinds of plants that the panda use for food, would be built
to connect the reserves, giving 80 percent of the pandas better
protection.
</P>
<P>
The Jiudingshan area adjoining the famous Wolong Panda Reserve
is also home to more than 300 kinds of wild animals, including
snub-nosed monkeys, leopards and green-tailed pheasants.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for More Efforts to Reform Public Sector (part one) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
CHENGDU, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin has
called for more efforts to promote the reform and development of
state enterprises, saying this will has great bearings on the
success of the public sector and the economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called on party and government officials at all levels
of government to have a full understanding of the economic and
political significance of the public sector reform and to shoulder
their responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee, made the remarks here today at a forum on the
reform and development of the public sector in Sichuan, Yunnan,
Guizhou provinces and Chongqing Municipality in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
At the forum, party and government leaders from Yunnan,
Guizhou, Sichuan and Chongqing briefed the meeting and exchanged
views on their state enterprises' situations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also the top leader of China's armed forces, noted that
the world trend of multi-polarization and economic globalization
is continuing, that scientific advances and adjustment of
industrial structure are speeding up and economic competition
intensifying on a world scale.
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, the Chinese people must enhance their
sense of urgency and go all out to strengthen the national economy
and scientific and technological development, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader stressed that it is a top priority for
China's economic work this year to do a good job in the reform and
development of state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the central government set a three-year target for
helping the majority of the country's large state enterprises get
out of their difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Now that task has entered the second and the most important
year. "We must seize the opportunity, and make greater efforts to
solve the deep-rooted problems facing state enterprises, and
strengthen their vitality," Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President on Public Sector Reform (part two) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
Over the past 20 years, China has adopted a step-by-step
method to promote the public sector reform in a vigorous and
steady manner.
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the state enterprises have demonstrated new life
and vitality. This suggests that the direction and policies of the
public sector reforms are right, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
 Jiang also pointed out that China must have its own
independent, integrated industrial and economic systems in order
to consolidate and develop the socialist system, and ensure the
nation's overall social progress and stability.
</P>
<P>
 "We can speed up the process of industrialization and
modernization only when we handle properly the state enterprises
and further strengthen the public economy through reform and
development," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in pushing through the reform and development of
state enterprises, China must uphold the goal of establishing a
socialist market economy, further deepen reforms and opening up to
the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the current situation in the public sector,
Jiang said that there are various reasons for the difficulties
facing state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"However, they are all problems in the process of progress and
development. Some other countries have also encountered similar
difficulties when restructuring their economies on a large scale,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that over the past two decades China has formed and
practiced a series of important policies in the public sector
reform and development, which must be carried out in the light of
specific conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader also noted that deepening public sector
reforms and strengthening their vitality are in the best interests
of the country's working people.
</P>
<P>
"We must rely on the working people and form a strong force in
pushing through the reform and development of state enterprises,"
Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
 He called on leaders at all levels of government to immerse
themselves among the masses, make their own investigations and
work out proper and forceful measures so as to promote the reform
and development of the public sector.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Parliament Okays NATO Access to Airspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian parliament on
Thursday adopted a resolution of the Supreme Defense Council to
grant NATO unlimited access to its airspace.
</P>
<P>
After a heated debate during a special session of both chambers,
the parliament passed the resolution by a vote of 225-21, with 99
abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The Party of Social Democracy, the largest opposition party,
initially said it would vote against the resolution, but decided
to abstain to avoid giving the impression that it opposed
Romania's integration into NATO, a key foreign policy priority for
the country.
</P>
<P>
The defense council, the country's highest institution in
charge of national security, decided to grant the recent request
by NATO on Tuesday, despite objections from opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Until now, NATO aircraft only had access to Romania's air space
in "emergency or unforeseen situations," under a ruling the
Romanian Parliament made in October last year following a NATO
request.
</P>
<P>
Support for NATO has been a tough decision for Romania's
leadership, since the people largely resent involvement in the war.
</P>
<P>
A recent opinion poll showed that 84 percent of the respondents
were opposed to NATO's campaign against Yugoslavia and preferred a
peaceful settlement to the conflict.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Elephant Population Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The population of elephants
in the Selous Game Reserve ecosystem in south Tanzania has
surpassed 50,000, up from 31,700 in 1994, thanks to concerted
efforts in fighting poaching.
</P>
<P>
More than 42,500 elephants are living in the Selous Game
Reserve, the world's largest, and 15,000 are roaming in its
bordering areas like Mikumi National Park, the Kilombero Valley,
Daily Mail reported Thursday, citing figures released by the
Wildlife Division in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The Selous Game Reserve, which covers an area larger than
Swaziland, is home to half of Tanzania's elephant population.
Hippos, buffalos, crocodiles and lions also abound in the area.
</P>
<P>
In 1980s, the elephant population had decreased sharply due to
rampant ivory poaching activities. In 1986 the elephant population
stood at 42,000 in the reserve, while in 1989 it dropped to 24,500
and thousands of carcasses of poached elephants were counted.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Wildlife Division, with the help of
military units, people in 45 villages, as well funds of the German
government, have made joint efforts to combat poaching.
</P>
<P>
The efforts have paid off. The Tanzania National Parks, the
Wildlife Division and the Frankfurt Zoological Society, found in
an aerial survey last October that the population of Selous
ecosystem had arrived at 57,500. No carcasses were spotted, a sign
marking the success of the conservation drive.

<HEADLINE> Massage Parlors May Cater To Exposition Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- City officials in Kunming, where
the International Horticulture Exposition will be held, have asked
owners of massage parlors to give a report on the number of beds
they have - but, not as a new round of inspections.
</P>
<P>
To their surprise, the owners found that this was a way to cope
with the unexpected surge in the number of visitors. Of course, in
the words of one official who is a member of the organizing group,
sleeping on a massage bed isn't comfortable, but it beats letting
visitors sleep on the roadside.
</P>
<P>
Kunming, which is the capital of Yunnan Province, has more than
250 hotels, holiday resorts, and guesthouses under the City
Government control that can cater to 70,000 visitors a day, but
the government thinks it best to make the nearly 100 local massage
parlors and their 1,700 beds available as temporary hotels.
</P>
<P>
But local officials still fear that the number of beds under
their control is insufficient. About 10 million people are
expected to visit the exposition, with arrivals likely to peak in
the first few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Over 20 universities and middle schools have been persuaded to
lease out their classrooms to provide more than 10,000 beds during
the summer vacation and local people have also been asked to take
in guests.
</P>
<P>
But, even with the limited supply of hotel beds, local
officials are still taking a "more the merrier" attitude towards
to number of tourists. "We have applied to the central authorities
to increase the number of Kunming flights to let in all potential
visitors," says Hu Zhigang, the director of the City Tourism
Administration.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Israeli Economic Cooperation Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Big potential exists in further
strengthening the economic and trade relationship between China and
Israel and the two sides also have a bright future in enhancing
scientific and technological cooperations.
</P>
<P>
Those remarks were made by Israeli President Ezer Weizman in an
interview with Xinhua and other Chinese reporters here held before
his trip to China.
</P>
<P>
Invited by his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin, Weizman is
scheduled to fly to Beijing on Saturday for a week-long state
visit. During his stay in China, Weizman will also visit Shanghai,
Kunming and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, he will hold talks with Jiang and other Chinese
leaders on bilateral, regional and international issues of mutual
concern, as well as the current development of the Mideast peace
process. This is Weizman's first visit to China in the capacity of
Israeli President since he assumed office six years ago.
</P>
<P>
"For Israel, China is a very important country and this trip
will provide me with a very good opportunity to find out what's
happening in China, to discuss with the Chinese leaders the future
that we are facing, the Mideast situation and issues of how to
further our mutual cooperations," Weizman said.
</P>
<P>
While expressing his satisfaction over the current development
of Sino-Israeli relationship, Weizman said Israel and China
established diplomatic ties only for seven years, but during this
period big progress has been made in trade, science and
technology, agriculture and other sectors of cooperation due to
joint efforts and the Israeli side was satisfied with what has
been achieved so far.
</P>
<P>
"Looking at the future, our two countries have a bright
prospect in expanding cooperation in the above mentioned fields
and over 30 Israeli business leaders will come to China with
me to sign ten agreements with concerned Chinese departments, so
that this visit will help open a new chapter of mutual cooperation
between our two countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Weizman also spoke highly that China has played an important
role in the world affairs, adding that promoting Sino-Israeli
relations are in the interests of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
This world has been changed a great deal since the World War
II, and such a big country like China has been playing a very
important and decisive role in solving international issues, he
said, adding that China will also be an important part of the
future world as China's future influence will be stronger and
bigger.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the Mideast peace process, he said the process could
only be moved forward after Israel's May elections and a new
Israeli government was formed.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks has entered into another
stalemate and under this circumstances, it is better for the
Palestinians to postpone the declaration of the statehood on May
4, the final date of the five-year transitional period set by the
Oslo Accords, he said, adding that it will be better for the two
sides to solve this issue through talks and consultations.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Israel's peace talks with Syria and Lebanon, he
said those talks could not be separated.
</P>
<P>
"Israel's peace talks with both Syria and Lebanon have not been
restarted, and Israel's bilateral partial troop pullout from south
Lebanon could help solve the problem, and I prefer all those
complicated problems in the Mideast process be solved once for all
after the new Israeli government was formed after May elections,"
he stressed.

<HEADLINE> May 4th Movement Causes Marxism Prevalence in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scholars say that the
spread of Marxist theory and combining it with China's reality
have been the main force of the democratic and scientific spirit
since the May 4th Movement in 1919.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar on the "May 4th Movement and Combining Marxist
Theory with China's Reality" today, Professor Huang Nanshen of the
Philosophy Department at Beijing University said that the May 4th
patriotic movement stimulated the spread of Marxism in China and
that one of its achievements was that the Chinese people chose
Marxism.
</P>
<P>
One of the significant things of the May 4th Movement was the
combination of Marxist theory with China's social reality, which
produced two things: Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory,
Professor Huang explained.
</P>
<P>
Professor Wan Dong, also of the Philosophy Department, pointed
out that, of many theories around during the May 4th Movement,
only Marxist theory held its position and became a part of the
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
Scholars at the seminar also discussed the May 4th spirit and
its relation to Beijing University, which is considered the
birthplace of the May 4th Movement. The university has a tradition
of patriotism, progress, democracy, and science, all of which were
goals of the May 4th Movement.
</P>
<P>
Attending the seminar were scholars from Beijing University,
the CPC Central Committee Publicity Department, and the Ministry
of Education. The seminar was a prelude of a series of activities
commemorating the May 4th Movement to be held by Beijing
University.

<HEADLINE> Report: Israel Willing to Talk Over Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 22 (Xinhua) - Israel has sent a new message
to Syria, saying it is willing to resume talks with Damascus from
the point where they broke off three years ago, a local daily
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz said the Syrian government has called upon the United
States to "evaluate" the offer made by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu through a third party, the name of which was not
revealed.
</P>
<P>
The latest offer, if true, would be a revision of an earlier
proposal also revealed by Haaretz.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported early last week that Foreign Minister
Ariel Sharon had asked Russia to mediate between Israel and Syria
to reach a deal in which Israel would pull out from Lebanon first
and open talks with Syria later.
</P>
<P>
According to that proposal, Israel would complete a withdrawal
from south Lebanon before the May 17 elections and Damascus should
prevent any cross-border attacks on Israel by Hezbollah or other
resistance groups.
</P>
<P>
Then, if Netanyahu is re-elected, the new Israeli government
would immediately begin negotiations with Syria over the Golan
Heights, the Syrian territory seized by Israel in 1967.
</P>
<P>
The latest offer, however, did not ask Russia to intermediate,
Haaretz said. Also, the new overture expressed Israel's readiness
to pick up the talks from where they were left off in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz said Damascus is fearing that the latest Israeli
proposal was only an election ploy which only aimed at securing an
Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, where Syria is the main power
broker, before the May 17 elections in order to boost Netanyahu's
chances of re-election.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Sharon have denied both reports by Haaretz.
</P>
<P>
Since Netanyahu came to power in May 1996, his government has
been disputing with Damascus over how the negotiations should be
resumed.
</P>
<P>
Syria has insisted that the talks be restarted from where they
left off, saying that late prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and his
successor Shimon Peres had promised in the talks that Israel would
hand over the whole Golan.
</P>
<P>
But the Netanyahu government claims that the promises do not
exist, insisting that the talks should be resumed without any
pre-conditions.

Pat Rafter, had turned militant after his unsuccessful attempt to
have the tie switched to Australia.
</P>
<P>
Australia would normally have hosted the July 16-18 tie under
the competition's rotating home and away system but the
International Tennis Federation has ordered it to be played in
Boston to mark the centenary of the first Cup match, reports said.

The net is mainly designed to connect campus computers for
teaching and research, Wang said. It provides more educational
opportunities for people at 300 universities, colleges and high
schools nationwide and opens up various education websites to
Internet users in Hong Kong, the United States, Germany and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
More than 500,000 Internet users have visited the CER net, she
says, but it can not meet the needs of the growing number of
visitors who find it slow and limited.
</P>
<P>
For an advanced educational internet covering all of China's
urban and rural areas, government departments are developing a new
modern long-distance education computer platform to upgrade the
old CER net.
</P>
<P>
More Chinese are putting their e-mail addresses on business
cards and many commercial advertisements have e-mail addresses,
one American expert says, adding that the Internet has made the
world smaller for some Chinese, but it is still far from
widespread among the 1.2 billion people.
</P>
<P>
According Ministry of Education statistics, China had 1.06
million Internet users by the end of last year, or only about one
user per thousand. Rates in the rest of the world run as high as 1
in 40.
</P>
<P>
If the Internet is combined with education, people all over
China, including enterprise managers and technicians will have a
greater chance to continue their education after school.

<HEADLINE> Australia Popular Destination For Chinese Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Australia will become a major
destination for Chinese tourists, thanks to an agreement signed
by the tourism departments of both countries here today.
</P>
<P>
He Guangwei, director of the Chinese National Tourism
Administration, said at the signing ceremony that the agreement
shows the cooperative relationship of the tourism sectors of the
two countries has entered a new phase.
</P>
<P>
Australia's Ambassador to China Richard Smith said that today's
ratification of Australia's Approved Destination Status (ADS) by
the Chinese government opens the door to the world's largest
single source of potential visitors.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 2.5 million Chinese will visit
Australia over the next nine years, putting some 6.5 billion
Australian dollars into that country's economy and creating
thousands of jobs in tourism and related industries.
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than 76,000 Chinese visited Australia and the
number is expected to increase to 150,000 in 2001 and to more than
half a million by 2008.
</P>
<P>
Tourism has become part of the lives of ordinary Chinese after
20 years of reforms and opening up. Statistics show that 8.4
million people traveled abroad in 1998, with 3.5 million
travelling at their own expense.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has granted Approved Destination Status
(ADS) to Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, New
Zealand, and the Republic of Korea.

<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- While the Internet gets tens of
thousands of new users, a group of Chinese and foreign experts are
working on setting up a national long-distance education system in
China to provide educational opportunities via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Tan Songhua, of the State Educational Development Research
Center, told a seminar on education and the Internet that opened
here today that the system could help speed up the country's
development from an agricultural-industrial economy to a knowledge-
based economy and from a producing society to an information
society in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"The social and economic development in the next century
depends more on the creation, spread, and application of knowledge
and information," he said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the education-via-the-Internet plan has been
taking shape, Tan said, and a number of universities like Hunan
University and Zhejiang University have got engaged in regional
long-distance education, catching the attention of many educators
and computer experts worldwide.
</P>
<P>
He said that the final goal of the plan is to provide
educational opportunities to anyone with access to the Internet no
matter where they are or whatever they need.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhuzhu, a Ministry of Education official, says that China
set up an education and research network (CER net) in 1995,
linking all major Chinese cities with Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Khatami to Reshuffle Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
rted
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
An informed source told the daily that the move would cover
four minister portfolios of economy, roads and transport,
construction Jihad and industries as well as the governor of the
Central Bank of Iran (CBI).
</P>
<P>
The current CBI Governor Mohsen Nourbakhsh will be replaced by
Rajabali Mazrooi, an economic advisor to President Khatami, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
But the replacements for the four ministers are yet to be
determined by Khatami.
</P>
<P>
However, she did not give any reason for the changes, mainly
relating to the country's economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
The report on cabinet reshuffle came just one day after
Iranian conservative Majlis (Parliament) demanded to impeach the
moderate Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah
Mohajerani.
</P>
<P>
President Khatami won a landslide victory on May 23, 1997 by
defeating the conservatives with the support of a coalition
formed by the left-wing and pragmatist reformist factions.
</P>
<P>
After one year in office, Khatami was accused by his
conservative rivals of failing to improve the country's ailing
economic performance.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts believed that the reshuffle, if true, would
indicate changes in Khatami's policies on the country's economic
affairs, as the Iranian president has promised to build a better
economy for the Iranian nation.

MANILA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and a
mission of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Thursday agreed
that the external challenges continue to face the economy.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued following two weeks of review on
the economy by the IMF mission, the two sides said that the
country's external environment remains challenging despite the
notable improvement in the regional outlook.
</P>
<P>
To meet the challenges, "economic policies will be focused on
nurturing a recovery without undermining stabilization gains, and
protecting the poor from the worst effects of the crisis," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
On the country's economic performance, the statement said that
"the (currency) peso has stabilized and strengthened in recent
months, inflation has been successfully contained, and growth is
expected to recover in 1999."
</P>
<P>
On Monetary policy, both sides agreed it would continue to
focus on stabilizing prices and the exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that the review discussions are expected to

<HEADLINE> China to Build World's Largest Radio Telescope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- China is to build the world's
largest radio telescope, according to Nan Rendong, a researcher
with the Beijing Astronomical Observatory.
</P>
<P>
The ambitious project incorporates a 500 meter diameter
spherical radio telescope located in the Karst Valley in southwest
China's Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
Nan said that a number of small spherical glass sections, which
can be adjusted by computers, will be assembled in the valley to
form a 300 meter effective aperture for the telescope.
</P>
<P>
"The sensitive and high resolution telescope will help in
China's deep-space exploration project and will make up for the
gap in longitude between the current three deep-space exploration
and sensing stations, which are located in the US, Spain and
Australia, thus providing global, round-the-clock remote control
and communication services," added Nan.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from ten countries including Australia, Canada,
China, US and France suggested building a radio telescope with a
receiving area of one square kilometer to explore deep space at an
international conference held by the Union of Radio Science
International in 1993.
</P>
<P>
China now plans to build this huge telescope in Guizhou and the
500-meter aperture telescope is only part of the project, Nan
revealed.

<HEADLINE> Gold Price to Remain Depressed This Year: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Gold Fields Mineral Services (GFMS), a commodity research
consultancy, said in its survey available Wednesday that the gold
price in world market should stay between 265 and 305 U.S. dollars
this year, five dollars beneath its January forecast.
</P>
<P>
It said expectations of low economic growth and inflation
presented an unfavorable environment for gold.
</P>
<P>
The Services said gold has largely lost its former role as a
financial hedge in Europe and North America, noting during the
financial market turmoil, investors moved their capital into the
U.S. government bonds, not gold.
</P>
<P>
Philip Klapwijk, managing director of the consultancy, said
demand was weakening in many of last year's best gold markets.
India would probably not repeat its performance of last year, when
it increased gold consumption by 100 tons.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the GFMS survey, the International Monetary Fund
also forecast further contraction in Japan, a big gold consumer in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Japan is a large consumer of commodities and it would be hard
for gold prices to rise without Japanese growth, IMF said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese economy suffered greatly in the Asian economic crisis
last year.

<HEADLINE> Wrap-up: China, U.S. Reopen WTO Talks in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and U.S. negotiators
reopened their talks on China's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO) here Thursday, shortly after Premier Zhu
Rongji's return from a two-week official visit to the United
States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday morning, Long Yongtu, chief representative
for trade negotiation of MOFTEC, and Assistant U.S. Trade
Representative Robert Cassidy held small group and closed door
talks in the MOFTEC's office building.
</P>
<P>
Within 30 minutes, they reached consensus on the procedure and
contents of the current round of talks which are expected to last
for a few days.
</P>
<P>
Topics scheduled for discussion in the current round of talks
include the legal terms for China's entry into the WTO, tariffs on
manufactured goods and the opening of China's service sector wider,
mainly within the finance, insurance and telecommunications
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The two sides began in two technical group discussions, one on
service trade and the other on details of China's WTO entry
protocol. Twelve members of the U.S. delegation including those
from the U.S. embassy and the U.S. Department of Commerce,
attended the group discussions. There were eight U.S. members for
the service trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
After three hours of closed door negotiations, both Chinese and
U.S. negotiators declined to make comment on questions raised by
reporters. However, they confirmed that talks will go on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The current round of talks is to implement what Premier Zhu
Rongji and U.S. President Bill Clinton agreed earlier on China's
entry into WTO. They have decided to intensify the negotiations
for resolving remaining issues in talks on China's accession to
the multi-lateral trade body by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that both China and the United States have
been exceptionally cautious for the first day of this new round of
negotiations, indicating that there still exist certain
differences.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. side may be too demanding," one analyst said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government voiced firm support for China's entry into
the WTO in 1999 during Zhu's visit to the United States earlier
this month, and great progress has been made for Sino-U.S.
negotiations on China's 13-year bid to join the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Cassidy arrived here Wednesday night, just a few hours after
Premier Zhu returned from his visit to the United States and
Canada.

Meanwhile, Maca stated that he would not allow NATO planes to
take off at the airports in his precinct to slay innocent
civilians of Yugoslavia, said the report.
</P>
<P>
However, the Czech parliament on Wednesday passed the bill to
allow NATO to use the country's airports for planes to take off
and land, as well as territory for ground attacks on Yugoslavia.

On the same day, hundreds of Czech citizens held a protest
outside the parliament building, chanting slogans such as "we

BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Statistics released today by
China's Ministry of Health (MOH) show a drop in the number of
medical institutes, slow growth in the ranks of medical personnel
and imbalanced development for urban and rural health care
services.
</P>
<P>
China had 314,100 hospitals, clinics, disease prevention
agencies, health care centers, research institutes and medical
schools and colleges by the end of 1998, a drop of 936 on 1997.
Some 5.53 million people worked for related institutions.
</P>
<P>
The MOH report shows that some 240 hospital beds, 100 nurses
and 165 doctors were available for every 100,000 Chinese citizens.
However, the development of health care services for cities and
rural areas remains imbalanced due to investment gaps.
</P>
<P>
"Approximately 80 percent of the health care budget has been
earmarked for, with some 80 of funding going to major urban
hospitals. The development of basic health care for rural
residents, or approximately 66 percent of the total population,
remained slow due to inadequate investment," according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals and clinics nationwide accepted 2.1 billion patient
visits last year, with some about 50 million people hospitalized
for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Patients paid an average of close to 70 yuan (8 US dollars) for
out-patient services and emergency care, with average per patient
hospitalization costs standing at 2,600 yuan. The report indicated
the health care sector curbed the rapid growth of medical
expenditures during the year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's trade deficit fell by 1 4
percent to 1.38 billion U.S. dollars in the first quarter of this year,
compared with 1.59 billion dollars in 1998, the Daily Star reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The drop was due largely to a reduction in imports in the first
three months fo this year, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The value of goods imported fell from 1.76 billion dollars in the
first quarter of 1998 to 1.54 billion dollars this year, a decrease of
12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Exports showed a tiny increase from 159 million dollars in 1998
to 161 million dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Machinery and appliances remained the country's main import,
totaling 231 million dollars or 15 percent of the total first quarter
imports. Cars and motorized vehicles followed with 152 million
dollars, or 9.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chemical products accounted for 144 million dollars, 9.3 percent of
the total, followed by processed food at 128 million dollars, or 8.3
percent, and fresh vegetables at 118 million dollars, or 7.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter of this year, fuel imports totaled 88
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Precious stones and jewelry shared the top spot for exports with
machinery and appliances, each representing 23 million dollars and
14.2 percent of the total. Base metals was in third place at 17
million dollars while transport equipment followed at 14 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Despite the decline in imports, customs revenues jumped from
303 million dollars in the first quarter of 1998 to 337 million
dollars as a result of higher rates imposed in the second half of
last year.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Calls on MPs to Support Culture Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
called on Majlis (Parliament) deputies to throw their support behind his
government and the Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah
Mohajerani, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Khatami made the call in a cabinet meeting Wednesday afternoon after
31 Iranian conservative parliamentarians submitted an impeachment motion to
the Majlis against Mohajerani.
</P>
<P>
"We do not consider impeachment as a first step towards resolving the
problems of the nation," he said, "however, we believe there are better
ways of consultation and arriving at a consensus."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president expressed hope that with the trend of
discussion, the majority of Majlis deputies would be behind the
government and throw their support for Mohajerani so that he could
continue cooperating as a minister with the current government
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
He praised Mohajerani as "a man of culture, wisdom and potentiality
in the area," and termed the achievements of the culture ministry in the
area of literature, art, culture and information dissemination as
"valuable and extensive.''
</P>
<P>
However, the conservative Majlis deputies accused Mohajerani of
failing to uphold Islamic and revolutionary values by adopting a liberal
policy on the press, book publishing and the arts. They also charged him
of misappropriating public funds for minor hajj rituals.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani, a close ally of President Khatami and a strong supporter
of his open-minded policies, has announced his readiness to be present
at the Majlis on Sunday, April 25 to defend his policy.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani is the second minister of Khatami's cabinet targeted by
the powerful conservatives, who still dominate the country's most
important organs, such as the judiciary, the Majlis and armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The minister came under fire of the conservatives since his close
friend, former Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri was impeached by the
Majlis last June.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, President Khatami also said that it is the right of
the Majlis to impeach, investigate and pass suitable legislation in
the interest of people and society.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, it should be observed that the cultural, art and
information dissemination spheres have a very diverse spectrum and it
should also be noted that a society, which is undergoing stability and
development process, has its own special characteristics.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Minister: Impeachment A Political Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran's moderate Minister of Culture
and Islamic Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani said that the impeachment
motion against him was politically motivated, local daily Iran News
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I consider the motion to impeach me to be a totally political move,"
Mohajerani said in an interview with the daily on Wednesday soon after a
group of 31 Iranian conservative parliamentarians submitted the motion to
the Majlis (Parliament).
</P>
<P>
The impeachment motion accused Mohajerani of failing to uphold
Islamic and revolutionary values by adopting a liberal policy on the
press, book publishing and arts. They also charged him of
misappropriating public funds for minor Hajj rituals.
</P>
<P>
"Experience has shown that such moves will backfire and only add to
the popularity of the person put under pressure," Mohajerani said,
adding that he would continue his political activities" with better
planning" if the impeachment would succeed in removing him from office.
</P>
<P>
"I may run as a candidate in the sixth Majlis elections (next
year). I am not the type of person to buckle under pressure and I will
continue to fulfill my political and social duties," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister, also spokesman of the government of President Mohammad
Khatami, noted that the news of his impeachment motion came as no
surprise to him.
</P>
<P>
Following the news of the impeachment motion, President Khatami on
Wednesday called on Majlis deputies to support his government and
Mohajerani, his close ally and a strong supporter of his open-minded
policies.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a cabinet meeting, Khatami said that impeachment is not
a step towards solving the problems of the nation, even though he
respects the right of Majlis to impeach, investigate and pass suitable
legislation in the interests of the people and society.
</P>
<P>
He praised Mohajerani as "a man of culture, wisdom and potentiality
in the area," and termed the achievements of the culture ministry in the
areas of literature, arts, culture and information dissemination as
"valuable and extensive."
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani is the second minister of Khatami's cabinet targeted by
the powerful conservatives, who still dominate the country's most
important organs, such as the judiciary, the Majlis and the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
After his close friend, former Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri was
impeached by the Majlis last June, Mohajerani became the main target
of the Iranian conservatives, who vowed to elbow the moderates or
Khatami's supporters out of the Iranian political arena.
</P>
<P>
Many Iranian political analysts believed that the conservatives
wanted to remove some key figures of moderate factions in order to
pave the way for the sixth Majlis elections to be held early next
year.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives want to consolidate their positions in the country
after they suffered a serious political setback in the local elections
held in February, they said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Protest Against Israel's Residency Revoking Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Meanwhile, the demonstrators also voiced their strong indignation
at Israel's policy of confiscating identity cards from the
Jerusalemite Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu go home...Jerusalem is
our city," the demonstrators are shouting.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority Minister in Charge of Jerusalem
Affairs Faisal Husseini told Xinhua at the scene that Jerusalem is the
capital of the Palestinian people and the Palestinian side will do all
it can to protect it.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he urged the Israeli High Court of Justice to adopt a
justified judgement about the fate of the Palestinians whose residency
permits were revoked and their identity cards were confiscated by the
Israeli authorities.
</P>
<P>
The High Court of Justice started Thursday morning to hear the
petitions filed by some Israeli and Palestinian peace groups on this
matter. Those groups said that since 1996, 2,083 Palestinian
Jerusalemite families have lost their rights to live in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Until 1995, Israel allowed Palestinians to retain their permanent
resident status in Jerusalem as long as they did not live abroad for
more than seven years and returned periodically to the city.
</P>
<P>
But in 1995, Israel abruptly changed course, and many Palestinians
had their identity cards revoked and were forced to leave the city.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Israeli warning that Palestinian officials can not hold
political and diplomatic activities in East Jerusalem, Hussseini held
a meeting with 30 foreign consuls at the Oreient House there Wednesday
evening and briefed them about the Israel's policy of revoking
Palestinian residency permits and confiscating their identity cards.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Israeli authorities imposed travel restrictions on
Husseini and two other senior Palestinian officials after they hosted
a similar meeting at the Orient House, which serves as a
representative office of the PNA.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Israeli Interior Ministry has denied permanent
status to Palestinians who have been forced to move to the city's
suburbs because of lack of housing in Jerusalem. The ministry, as well
as the National Insurance Institute, denied these Palestinians rights
on grounds that their "center of life" had changed to another town,
even if members of their family still live in Jerusalem and their
children study there.
</P>
<P>
Husseini and other Palestinian officials have sharply criticized
this Israeli policy, saying this policy is aimed at tormenting
Palestinians with uncertainty over their status.

<HEADLINE> Crisis over Senate Presidency Deepens in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- A controversy in the People's
Democratic Party (PDP) over senate presidency has deepened when
PDP top leaders made conflicting remarks Wednesday on the
contentious issue.
</P>
<P>
PDP National Publicity Secretary Senator Aniete Okon told
reporters in capital Abuja that the position had been zoned to
Southeast while PDP National Vice-Chairman Alhaji Dan Musa said in
Kaduna, northern Nigeria, that the party did not take that
decision at any time.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued after a meeting in Kaduna Wednesday,
party leaders from Northwest zone stressed that the posts of
Senate president and speaker of the House of Representative be
given to the zone.
</P>
<P>
They have given the National Executive Committee of the party
which won the February 27 presidential election a two-week
ultimatum to come out with a position on the issue regarding the
post of Senate president and other top offices.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing Wednesday, Senator Okon said PDP national
leaders had offered the number three position of Senate president
to former Vice-President Alex Ekwueme or his nominee from the
Southeast zone.
</P>
<P>
This, according to the PDP spokesman, automatically meant that
the Southeast has officially be recognized by the party as the
zone to produce the presidency of the in-coming senate.
</P>
<P>
Meantime, members-elect of the Federal House of Representatives
on the PDP platform who met in Abuja Tuesday, had, however,
expressed their support for a Senate president from the Southeast,
saying the Northwest should produce the speaker of the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
After losing the presidential ticket, Ekwueme had been offered
the Senate president as a palliative measure, but he rejected the
offer which has led to a struggle for the position between the
Southeast and Northwest zones of the PDP party.

SEOUL, April 22 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's jobless number
dropped 4.5 percent, or 1.704 million people, in March from the
previous month's 1.785 million, the National Statistical Office
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The office attributed the drop of unemployment to the start of
the rice plantation season and expansion in the public sector to
create jobs.
</P>
<P>
However, the office said the unemployment rate could rise again
in the wake of business mergers among the family-owned
conglomerates, or chaebols, and downsizing in the public and
corporate sectors.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's jobless rate surged to 8.7 percent last February
since the financial crisis caused by corporate bankruptcies and

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-President Speaks About Sino-Japanese Relations (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Vice-president Hu Jintao said
today that understanding history in a correct way and abiding by
the principles of the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement, the Sino-
Japanese Peace and Friendship Treaty, and the Sino-Japanese Joint
Declaration is extremely important for the healthy, stable, and
permanent development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Hu told a Japanese Trade Union Confederation (RENGO)
delegation, led by its president, Washio Etsuya, that the two
countries should cherish and maintain their hard-won friendship
with a long-term view toward fostering a bilateral friendly
relationship that lasts for generations.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan should remove all obstacles to bilateral
friendly ties, he said, pointing to President Jiang Zemin's visit
to Japan last year, which, he said, brought Sino-Japanese
relations to a new phase.
</P>
<P>
He said he appreciates the remarkable contributions RENGO has
made to normalizing Sino-Japanese ties and bilateral friendly
exchanges and cooperation in the past several years and that he
hopes the two countries' trade unions will expand bilateral
cooperation to contribute more to a Sino-Japanese partnership
committed to peace and development and oriented toward the next
century.

unfortunate" for Japan-China ties and that they should have a
proper understanding of the history and examine the past to create
a bright future in the new century.
</P>
<P>
 He went on to say that it is very important that non-

that RENGO is ready to work with the All-China Federation of Trade
Unions (ACTFU) to build long-term and friendly ties geared to the
21st century.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Thursday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States seems to be more and more receptive to the
idea of a ground intervention in Kosovo. For U.S. Secretary of
Defense William Cohen, a re-examination of a resort to force can
be made quickly, echoing an intention expressed by the NATO
Supreme Commander in Europe, Wesley Clark, to review a vast plan
of ground intervention.
</P>
<P>
-- The influx of Kosovo refugees is threatening the stability
of Yugoslavia's neighboring countries of Macedonia and Albania, as
well as the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro. Albania is
suffocating under the pressure of refugees, Macedonia's cohesion
is being split apart by ethnic hatred, and Montenegro is under the
threat of a civil war.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- A month after the start of NATO air campaign against
Yugoslavia, the result is rather disappointing for the allies, who
will meet on Friday in Washington to discuss other options. French
President Jacques Chirac said in a radio-televized speech on
Wednesday that the allied countries are determined to wage the war
until the end.
</P>
<P>
-- The two teenager killers of a high school near Denver, the
United States, have not left any index explaining their crimes,
while the number of dead in their shooting rampage stood at 15 on
Wednesday. The date of the shooting coincided with those of the
1995 bombing attack in Oklahoma City, and the 1993 cult group
suicide in Waco, Texas, both of them on April 19, one day from the
birthday of Adolf Hitler.

<HEADLINE> Khatami to Reshuffle Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
will reshuffle his cabinet on the second anniversary of his election
victory, the conservative daily Tehran Times reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
An informed source told the daily that the move would touch on four
minister portfolios of economy, roads and transport, construction and
Jihad as well as the governor of the Central Bank of Iran (CBI).
</P>
<P>
The current CIB Governor Mohsen Nourbakhsh will be replaced by
Rajabali Mazrooi, the economic advisor to President Khatami, the
source said. But the replacements for the four ministers are yet to be
determined by Khatami.
</P>
<P>
However, she did not give reasons for the changes, mainly relating
to the country's economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
The report on cabinet reshuffle came just one day after some Iranian
conservative Majlis (Parliament) members demanded impeachment of the moderate
Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani.
</P>
<P>
President Khatami won a landslide victory on May 23, 1997 by
defeating the conservatives with the support of a coalition formed by
the left-wing and pragmatist reformist factions.
</P>
<P>
After one year in office, Khatami was accused by his conservative
rivals of failing to improve the country's ailing economic
performance.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts believed the reshuffle, if true, would indicate
changes in Khatami's policies on the country's economy, as the Iranian
president has promised to build a better economy for the Iranian
nation.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Says His Asia Tour Results Taking Shape in Steps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has
said the results of his recent Asia tour have started to take shape in
serious steps to implement a host of pacts sealed during the trip, a
national newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Official and non-official delegations have started to come to us
from the three countries (of China, South Korea and Japan) to discuss
the implementation steps," Mubarak told the Arabic-language Al
Gumhuria daily in an exclusive interview.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president traveled to the three Asian countries on
April 5-13 and discussed with their leaders various ways of promoting
bilateral cooperation both at the political and economic levels.
During the visit, Egypt signed with each of the three countries
several agreements on economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the facilities offered by the Egyptian government to
set in motion the accords, Mubarak said he has asked Prime Minister
Kamal El-Ganzouri to leave no room for snags, adding he is also
personally following the implementation process to be sure that
everything is going on the right track.
</P>
<P>
"The projects we agreed upon (during the three-leg trip) will
produce export-oriented items to compete in the world markets. This
undoubtedly will reflect favorably on the Egyptians, whose welfare is
the focus of our attention," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The president said the thorough preparations for his Asia tour has
paid off, citing a free industrial zone, planned with China, to be
launched in the northwest of the Gulf of Suez, and a number of
projects reached with South Korea, covering electronics and
auto-making.
</P>
<P>
Discussions in Japan ensured the country's transfer of technology
to Egypt and entailed projects to construct power stations operated by
wind and solar energy, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Owing to such visits and meetings, during which I am keen on
enhancing friendly ties, the name of Egypt is now soaring worldwide,"
Mubarak concluded.

<HEADLINE> China, U.S. Conclude First-Day WTO Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and U.S. negotiators
concluded their first-day talks of technical issues related to
China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), with no
obvious results Thursday afternoon, but will continue the talks on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The new round of talks aims to resolve remaining issues
concerning China's entry into WTO, which was agreed by US
President Bill Clinton and Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
Topics of negotiation for Thursday's working conference were
service trade and the details of China's accession to the WTO
protocol. Fourteen members of the U.S. delegation, including those
from the U.S. embassy and the U.S. Department of Commerce,
attended the group discussions.
</P>
<P>
The group discussions about service trade lasted one hour and
45 minutes while talks on details of the protocol, three hours.
Both sides declined to make comment.
</P>
<P>
Long Yongtu, chief negotiator of the Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), told Xinhua that the two sides
were expected to further discuss market access, remaining issues
of the protocol, and details of understanding in negotiations in
the coming few days.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of negotiations is part of the effort to carry
out what Premier Zhu Rongji and U.S. President Bill Clinton agreed
on China's accession to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government voiced firm support for China's entry into
the WTO in 1999 during Zhu's visit, and the two sides have agreed
to "intensify" negotiations for resolving remaining issues in
talks on China's accession to the WTO by the end of April.
</P>
<P>
Important progress was made in Sino-U.S. negotiations on
China's 13-year bid to join the WTO during Zhu's visit to the U.S.
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Robert Cassidy, assistant trade representative of the U.S.,
arrived here Wednesday night, just a few hours after Premier Zhu
Rongji's return from a two-week official visit to the United
States and Canada.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Minister: Impeachment A Political Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran's moderate Minister of Culture
and Islamic Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani said that the impeachment
motion against him was politically motivated, local daily Iran News
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I consider the motion to impeach me to be a totally political move,"
Mohajerani said in an interview with the daily on Wednesday soon after a
group of 31 Iranian conservative parliamentarians submitted the motion to
the Majlis (Parliament).
</P>
<P>
The impeachment motion accused Mohajerani of failing to uphold
Islamic and revolutionary values by adopting a liberal policy on the
press, book publishing and arts. They also charged him of
misappropriating public funds for minor Hajj rituals.
</P>
<P>
"Experience has shown that such moves will backfire and only add to
the popularity of the person put under pressure," Mohajerani said,
adding that he would continue his political activities" with better
planning" if the impeachment would succeed in removing him from office.
</P>
<P>
"I may run as a candidate in the sixth Majlis elections (next
year). I am not the type of person to buckle under pressure and I will
continue to fulfill my political and social duties," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister, also spokesman of the government of President Mohammad
Khatami, noted that the news of his impeachment motion came as no
surprise to him.
</P>
<P>
Following the news of the impeachment motion, President Khatami on
Wednesday called on Majlis deputies to support his government and
Mohajerani, his close ally and a strong supporter of his open-minded
policies.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a cabinet meeting, Khatami said that impeachment is not
a step towards solving the problems of the nation, even though he
respects the right of Majlis to impeach, investigate and pass suitable
legislation in the interests of the people and society.
</P>
<P>
He praised Mohajerani as "a man of culture, wisdom and potentiality
in the area," and termed the achievements of the culture ministry in the
areas of literature, arts, culture and information dissemination as
"valuable and extensive."
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani is the second minister of Khatami's cabinet targeted by
the powerful conservatives, who still dominate the country's most
important organs, such as the judiciary, the Majlis and the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
After his close friend, former Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri was
impeached by the Majlis last June, Mohajerani became the main target
of the Iranian conservatives, who vowed to elbow the moderates or
Khatami's supporters out of the Iranian political arena.
</P>
<P>
Many Iranian political analysts believed that the conservatives
wanted to remove some key figures of moderate factions in order to
pave the way for the sixth Majlis elections to be held early next
year.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives want to consolidate their positions in the country
after they suffered a serious political setback in the local elections
held in February, they said.

BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Revenues from newspaper
advertisements last year in China amounted to almost 11 billion
yuan, a 145-fold increase from 1983, when newspaper ads re-
appeared.
</P>
<P>
From 1990 to 1995, the newspaper ad business grew 60.9 percent
on an annual basis, with earnings increasing 5.7-fold. In recent
years, the annual growth rate has stayed around 15 to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
China has 2,000 registered newspapers, compared with 186 kinds
in 1978, but 2 percent of them have 73 percent of the ad business.
</P>
<P>
A China Newspaper Association official says that large
newspaper groups are expected to emerge in three to five years,
purchasing small newspapers that will either have to be acquired
or go bankrupt, but monopolies are still unlikely.
</P>
<P>
He says that the association is preparing regulations on the
newspaper business to stop unfair competition.

<HEADLINE> Rescue of Trapped Miners Going On in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
ordered full-blast rescue operations for miners and their families
believed trapped in two landslides that occurred separately
Wednesday in Mt. Diwalwal in Compostela Valley of southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said in a radio
program Thursday that he has also advised residents near the area
to guard against the possibility of more landslides occurring in
and around Mt. Diwalwal and denuded forest areas following days of
continuous rains in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"Residents living near the bottom of these mountains should
brace for more landslides, particularly where loggers have denuded
the mountains," he said.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports by the Philippine News Agency on the incidents
said that at least 11 miners died in the two separate tragedies.
</P>
<P>
The reports also said that the landslides buried about 20
houses, including 15 in Balite and five in the Buwenas town.
</P>
<P>
Mercado, who also heads the National Disaster Coordinating
Council, said the council is still gathering information on the
cause of the landslides. Initial reports indicated that the
landslides were caused by massive soil erosion in the area.
</P>
<P>
"The continuous rains are among the effects of the La Nina
phenomenon," he said.

ANKARA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's central-left Republican
Peoples' Party (CHP) leader Deniz Baykal resigned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Baykal took the step after his party only gained 8.7 percent of the

Many CHP supporters threw their backing behind the central-left
Democratic Left party led by Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, which won

The CHP won 10.75 percent of the votes in the general elections in

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Protest Against Israel's Residency Revoking Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Meanwhile, the demonstrators also voiced their strong indignation
at Israel's policy of confiscating identity cards from the
Jerusalemite Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu go home...Jerusalem is
our city," the demonstrators are shouting.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority Minister in Charge of Jerusalem
Affairs Faisal Husseini told Xinhua at the scene that Jerusalem is the
capital of the Palestinian people and the Palestinian side will do all
it can to protect it.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he urged the Israeli High Court of Justice to adopt a
justified judgement about the fate of the Palestinians whose residency
permits were revoked and their identity cards were confiscated by the
Israeli authorities.
</P>
<P>
The High Court of Justice started Thursday morning to hear the
petitions filed by some Israeli and Palestinian peace groups on this
matter. Those groups said that since 1996, 2,083 Palestinian
Jerusalemite families have lost their rights to live in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Until 1995, Israel allowed Palestinians to retain their permanent
resident status in Jerusalem as long as they did not live abroad for
more than seven years and returned periodically to the city.
</P>
<P>
But in 1995, Israel abruptly changed course, and many Palestinians
had their identity cards revoked and were forced to leave the city.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Israeli warning that Palestinian officials can not hold
political and diplomatic activities in East Jerusalem, Hussseini held
a meeting with 30 foreign consuls at the Oreient House there Wednesday
evening and briefed them about the Israel's policy of revoking
Palestinian residency permits and confiscating their identity cards.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Israeli authorities imposed travel restrictions on
Husseini and two other senior Palestinian officials after they hosted
a similar meeting at the Orient House, which serves as a
representative office of the PNA.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Israeli Interior Ministry has denied permanent
status to Palestinians who have been forced to move to the city's
suburbs because of lack of housing in Jerusalem. The ministry, as well
as the National Insurance Institute, denied these Palestinians rights
on grounds that their "center of life" had changed to another town,
even if members of their family still live in Jerusalem and their
children study there.
</P>
<P>
Husseini and other Palestinian officials have sharply criticized
this Israeli policy, saying this policy is aimed at tormenting
Palestinians with uncertainty over their status.

<HEADLINE> Ground Intervention in Kosovo Not Topical Question: France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- France said on Thursday that a
ground intervention by NATO in Kosovo is not "a topical question"
for the time being.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman of French President Jacques Chirac, Catherine
Colonna, said that NATO should move until the end the strategy of
air strikes, which is bringing effects.
</P>
<P>
"An effective deployment of ground troops is not a topical
question," she said.
</P>
<P>
But she said that France does not oppose an "updating" of the
NATO strategy.
</P>
<P>
The United States said on Wednesday that a re-examination of a
ground intervention could be made very quickly by NATO.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post said that NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana has authorized the military command of NATO to study the
option of a ground intervention.
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech on Wednesday, Chirac did not mention the
possibility of a ground intervention, only saying that NATO should
intensify air strikes and hit "more and more diversified targets"
in Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Partially Privatize Its Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
has given the green light for the partial privatization of Denel,
South Africa' s state-owned arms manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
Top cabinet ministers have agreed to the appointment of a
negotiating team to finalize the sale of stakes in Denel Aviation
to British Aerospace and a black empowerment group, Business Day
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Joe Modise, Trade and Industry Minister Alec
Erwin and Public Enterprises Minister Stella Sigcau agreed this
week on the need for a negotiating team, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the team is the first move in Denel's
partial privatization after the restructuring of the arms
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
Public Enterprises Ministry spokesman Andile Nkhulu said
Wednesday that each of the ministers would now submit names of
people to sit on the team.
</P>
<P>
"They are still working out the finer details but the team will
be established with some urgency," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nkhulu said the team would negotiate the formation of a new
aerospace company which Sigcau said earlier should be established
by June or July this year.
</P>
<P>
British Aerospace and the empowerment group will each acquire a
20- percent stake in the new company.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Nkhulu said the unbundling and restructuring
of Denel and its divisions was moving ahead. The inter-ministerial
cabinet committee recently decided to fast-track the privatization
of divisions Vektor, Swartklip an Eloptro.
</P>
<P>
The committee has also given the green light for the merger of
Denel's information technology division with the infotech
divisions of power- generating giant Eskom and transport company
Transnet.

<HEADLINE> Article Refutes Dalai's Lies on Tibet "Autonomy" (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
-- A preparatory committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was
set up in Lhasa in April 1956 and it did a lot to train government
workers and build schools and hospitals;
</P>
<P>
-- For fear of reform and autonomy, aristocrat rebels
instigated a large-scale military revolt in March 1959 against the
Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region. After being
suppressed, they fled with the Dalai Lama to India and formed a "
government in exile;"
</P>
<P>
-- The central government disbanded the former Tibet local
government on March 28, 1959, and appointed the Panchen Lama to
replace the Dalai Lama as chairman of the Preparatory Committee of
the Tibet Autonomous Region;
</P>
<P>
-- In June and September that year, the Preparatory Committee
adopted resolutions on implementing democratic reforms and
abolishing feudal serfdom, thus emancipating millions of Tibetan
serfs and slaves, who accounted for 95 percent of the total
population. They all became land owners in Autumn 1960;
</P>
<P>
-- In September 1965, the Tibet Autonomous Region was created
by 301 representatives of Tibet from various ethnic groups,
including former serfs and slaves, patriotic upper circles and
religious believers;
</P>
<P>
-- Economic development and progress in self-governing in Tibet
was adversely affected during the "Cultural Revolution" (1966-1976)
, but after the reform and opening up, Tibet, like other
autonomous regions in China, was on the right track again.
</P>
<P>
The article also details many facts and figures regarding
today's Tibet to illustrate that local governments and deputies to
the local People's Congresses are all chosen through elections.
</P>
<P>
The article concludes that the ethnic regional autonomy in
place today is the most ideal choice for Tibet, and the Dalai
Lama's fantasy of returning to the old days will never be realized.

<P>
HANGZHOU, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The cause of a passenger train
derailment in Jinyun County, east China's Zhejiang Province, at
around 22:30 (Beijing time) on Wednesday has been attributed to a
landslide caused by recent heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
Local sources report that six passengers have been hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
The No.603 passenger train accident occurred while the train
was en route from the provincial capital of Hangzhou, to Wenzhou,
a coastal city in Zhejiang. The train rolled some 200 meters after
engineers took emergency measures and hit a large mound of rock
and dirt resulting from the landslide.
</P>
<P>
The train, including a locomotive and five passengers cars, and
a section of rail were heavily damaged.
</P>
<P>
All passengers have been evacuated from the scene and railway
crews are clearing the debris.
</P>
<P>

a group of experts rushed to the site early this morning to
organize rescue efforts.

<HEADLINE> China's Mother's Day Focusing On Poor Women This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- China's State Family Planning
Commission and other offices will sponsor a series of programs for
Mother's Day on May 9, with the theme of helping poor women say
good-bye to poverty and enter the new century in happiness.
</P>
<P>
This year's Mother Day is the third "Helping Poor Mothers Day"
that the Project Happy Committee has set up. It includes a sale of
charity gift boxes and greeting cards, a photo competition, and TV
documentaries.
</P>
<P>
The Family Planning Commission has told local family planning
departments to assist mothers living in poverty and their families.
</P>
<P>
Project Happy was set up by the China Population Welfare
Foundation, The State Family Planning Commission, and China
Population News in February of 1995 to help women in poor areas
get away from poverty by providing them with credit and other
forms of aid to start small businesses. By the end of 1998, it had
spent more than 60 million yuan helping at least 40,000
impoverished women in various parts of the country.

<HEADLINE> 8,000 Women Die in Mozambique Annually While </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- A senior Mozambican health
official has revealed that a total of 8,000 women die of giving
birth every year in the southern African country, and that a woman
dies every hour in Mozambique due to pregnancy or while giving
birth.
</P>
<P>
The Noticias newspaper Thursday quoted Alexandre Manguela, head
of the National Health Bureau of Mozambique, as disclosing this at
a seminar on safe childbirth here in the capital.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the high death rate during childbirth to delay or
 difficulty caused by poor transportation and poor medical
facilities, among others.
</P>
<P>
The official also called for urgent measures to reduce the
death rate including increasing medical personnel, training of
nursing staff and more facilities for medical institutions.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to national media to launch nationwide
awareness campaign in this regard.

LONDON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading British newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO may be prepared to send ground forces into Kosovo by
the end of next month, if Yugoslav President Milosevic fails to
sign a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- America was in mourning Wednesday night for the 15 people
killed in the Denver school massacre carried out by two teenagers
obsessed with satanism and the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO's theater of operations was widened Wednesday from the
tiny province of Kosovo when Czech and Slovak governments approved
military movements across their territory, a development which
could open the way for an eventual invasion of Yugoslavia from the
north.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- As British Prime Minister Tony Blair began crucial talks
with U.S. President Bill Clinton Wednesday night, NATO began to
move towards acknowledgment that it will have to send in ground
troops to force a settlement of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The UK's labor market is roaring ahead, according to figures

<P>
TOKYO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices moved higher in Tokyo
on Thursday, boosted by Wednesday's surge on Wall Street and the U.
S. dollar's strength against the yen.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose by 170.86 points, or 1.04
percent, from Wednesday's close to end at 16,665.88.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, added 2.68 points or 0.20 percent to 1,314.
44.
</P>
<P>
Turnover fell to 474.02 million shares from Wednesday's 492.44
million shares.
</P>
<P>
Nisseki House was Thursday's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
The gains in the New York stock market Wednesday and the
dollar's rise helped export-oriented issues in Tokyo move up,
traders said.
</P>
<P>
However, buying orders by nonresident investors, the major
driving force in the Tokyo stock market, have shrunk recently, and
this kept share prices from rising further, they said.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers outnumbered
gainers 645 to 537 despite the overall rise in Nikkei index, with
134 issues ending unchanged.

<HEADLINE> New Era Ushered in Jordanian-Syrian Ties: Press </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The semi-official Jordan Times said Thursday that a new era was
ushered in following Abdullah's two-and-half hours talks with Assad on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the two leaders discussed all bilateral
issues and stressed the need to maintain close cooperation between
the two countries in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Analysts in Amman believed that Abdullah would discuss the
deadlocked Israeli-Syrian peace talks during his visit as part of his
efforts to coordinate Arab stands in the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah's trip would help stabilize and cement Jordan's ties
with Syria, which had been strained after Amman signed the 1994
peace treaty with Israel, said Jordan's weekly newspaper Star.
</P>
<P>
Syria is still at war with the Jewish state and the two sides
sporadically exchanged fire over the strategically located Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian-Syrian ties reached a turning point when President
Assad declared a three-day mourning for late Jordanian King Hussein,
who died of cancer on February 7.
</P>
<P>
He also paid a visit in years to Amman on February 8 to attend
Hussein's funeral.
</P>
<P>
Assad's good-will gestures met with positive responses from the
Jordanian government, which has expressed support for Syria's stands
to resume peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Damascus insisted that its peace talks with Israel, suspended
since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to power in 1996,
should be resumed from where it was suspended prior to 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu government said the peace talks should be
restarted on new grounds, a stance blamed by Syria as unwilling to
carry out the land-for-peace arrangements by the former Israeli
Labor government.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah's Syrian visit was part of his regional tour in April to
rally support for the stagnant economy of his desert kingdom and to
coordinate Arab stands on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The tour had already taken him to Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United
Arab Emirates and Libya.

<HEADLINE> Hungarian Parliament Sticks to Allowing NATO to Use Sky, Airports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Prime Minister Orban
Viktor said Wednesday that all parties in the National Assembly,
or parliament, stuck to the decision made last month to allow NATO
to use the country's air territory and airports.
</P>
<P>
But besides this, NATO has so far made no new demand to Hungary
in regard to its military actions on Yugoslavia, Orban told
reporters after meeting with leaders of parties in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Martonyi Janos said on Wednesday
that the government does not plan to put forward any new
recommendation to parliament over NATO's attack on Hungary's
southern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
So far, NATO has not asked Hungary to send ground troops in its
military actions, Martonyi said.
</P>
<P>
Martonyi, who will accompany Orban to Washington for the NATO
summit, said that even if NATO decides to launch its ground attack
against Yugoslavia from north, it is totally impossible for the
military alliance to change Hungary's current stand on this matter
at the Washington meeting.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Air Transportation Free From Y2K By Late 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's air transportation,
which mainly depends on electronic gadgets such as computers, will
be free from the millennium bug or Y2K after the second quarter of
1999, Communications Minister Giri Suseno Hadihardjono said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Giri made the remarks after a seminar on the electricity
sector's preparation for the Y2K, which was held here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government and flight operators have given top priority to
the management of the Y2K problem, Giri said, adding that the
clearance program is being financed by flight operators and the
airport management body.
</P>
<P>
Flight operators are financing the Y2K clearance program for
electronic devices in on-line reservation system and computerized
equipment aboard concerned airlines, while the airport management
body is funding the Y2K clearance program in air traffic control.
</P>
<P>
In carrying out the Y2K clearance program, top priority has
been given to major airports, such as the Soekarno-Hatta
international airport in Jakarta, the Polonia airport in Medan,
the Juanda airport in Surabaya and the Ngurah Rai airport in
Denpasar, Bali.
</P>
<P>
"Other airports in the country use equipment which will not be
disrupted by the millennium bug," Giri said.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged travel agents using on-line systems to pay
attention to the Y2K problem as well.
</P>
<P>
On sea transportation, Giri said, the computerized financial
system of the Customs and Excise Office is prone to the millennium
bug problem.
</P>
<P>
Giri, who also heads a working group on computer problems in
2000, said the group has drawn up a contingency plan in case the
Y2K clearance program fails.

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Chairman Calls for Military Tech Aid to Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian State Duma (lower house of
parliament) Chairman Gennady Seleznyov said Thursday that Russia
should announce military technology aid to Yugoslavia under
threats of NATO's ground operations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Interfax reporters, he said NATO is now carrying
out its plan of ground offensives against Yugoslavia, which
virtually aims to dismember the federal republic.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov noted that the U.S.-led NATO is demonstrating to the
world who is today's global master while acting in the interests
of the United States and NATO is obviously NATO's rule of conduct
in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, it is certain for Russia to continue
diplomatic efforts to solve the Yugoslavia crisis, he said,
admitting at the same time that such efforts might achieve little

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Trade Deficit Falls in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's trade deficit fell by 1 4
percent to 1.38 billion U.S. dollars in the first quarter of this year,
compared with 1.59 billion dollars in 1998, the Daily Star reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The drop was due largely to a reduction in imports in the first
three months fo this year, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The value of goods imported fell from 1.76 billion dollars in the
first quarter of 1998 to 1.54 billion dollars this year, a decrease of
12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Exports showed a tiny increase from 159 million dollars in 1998
to 161 million dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Machinery and appliances remained the country's main import,
totaling 231 million dollars or 15 percent of the total first quarter
imports. Cars and motorized vehicles followed with 152 million
dollars, or 9.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chemical products accounted for 144 million dollars, 9.3 percent of
the total, followed by processed food at 128 million dollars, or 8.3
percent, and fresh vegetables at 118 million dollars, or 7.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter of this year, fuel imports totaled 88
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Precious stones and jewelry shared the top spot for exports with
machinery and appliances, each representing 23 million dollars and
14.2 percent of the total. Base metals was in third place at 17
million dollars while transport equipment followed at 14 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Despite the decline in imports, customs revenues jumped from
303 million dollars in the first quarter of 1998 to 337 million
dollars as a result of higher rates imposed in the second half of
last year.

BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The allegations on China's theft

<HEADLINE> ANC Leader on Struggle In Africa (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The National Chairman of South
Africa's African National Congress (ANC) Patrick Lekota told
Xinhua in an exclusive interview today that the struggle for the
rights of the black in South Africa will never end.
</P>
<P>
Lekota was in prison with Nelson Mandela and led underground
student movements fighting against racial segregation for a long
time. But, in spite of that, he impresses people with his optimism,
breaking into laughter from time to time.
</P>
<P>
"We have been fighting for democracy and freedom in the past,"
he says, and "now we are reconstructing a prosperous home to heal
the wounds of the past. In this way, he concludes, the ANC and the
Communist Party of China face the same historic task.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, the ANC emerged from its past as an illegal
liberation movement to a ruling party in the newly-elected South
African government, marking an end to more than 3 centuries of
white minority rule and 40 years of racism. The ANC and the CPC
have always supported each other in their struggles, he says, and
now that they have become ruling parties they have the task of
developing the economy and improving the standard of living of
their people.

The two countries have encountered similar problems, he says,
and what is being dealt with in China right now may confront South
Africa sometime in the future, which is why it is important that
there be exchanges of experiences and cooperation in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Vice-president Hu Jintao said that he agreed with Lekota's
ideas in a meeting yesterday, and that these ruling parties of the
two most important countries in Asia and Africa are responsible
for developing the economy and contributing to world peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
Further consolidating the friendship and cooperative ties and
exchanges of views on running the parties and the countries are
conducive to progress, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
In the post-cold war period, countries need to pursue a goal of
peace and development together, Lekota says, emphasizing the
importance of developing countries interacting in the
international forum to create conditions for global stability, on
the basis of which a single country can develop.

<HEADLINE> HK People Confident in Economy, Says Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The longitudinal survey conducted by the Hong Kong Policy
Research Institute Ltd. on Economic Confidence Index on April 19
and 20 shows that average public confidence towards Hong Kong's
economic situation or "Prospects of Hong Kong" rose 8.1 points,
compared with the same survey conducted in March, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The confidence index of "Improvement on Unemployment Situation"
was 98.7 points, or 29.9 points higher than the 68.8 points in
March. The April index was a new high since the return of Hong
Kong to China. Compared with its lowest 31.7 points in August 1998,
a sharp increase of 211 percent was recorded, the survey says.
</P>
<P>
Despite the unemployment rate announced recently as 6.2 percent,
public confidence towards the improvement of the unemployment
situation has risen amidst the optimistic psychology towards the
economic prospects of Hong Kong brought about by the successful
land auction and, especially the visit of Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji to the United States and the negotiation over China's entry
into WTO.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that the confidence towards "Property Market"
was 166.7 points, or 34.3 points over the record 132.4 points of
the last survey in March, giving a rise of 26.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
A significant increase was also found in the "Major Consumption
Decision". It stood at 93.2 points, a new record since January
1998 compared with the last record of 81.9 points in March,
showing an increase of 13.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji's U.S. visit will speed up China's entry
into the WTO and this has a stimulating effect on public
confidence towards the economic prospects of China, the prospects
of Hong Kong's relationship with the Chinese mainland, the survey
says.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted among people aged between 18 and 64
and a total of 979 cases have been completely interviewed.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Policy Research Institute, established in 1995 by
17 people from various business, professional and academic
backgrounds, has now grown to 63 full members and 14 associate
members. It has been operating as an independent public think-tank
for providing the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)
government with a wide range of opinions and analyses on issues of
public concern.

<HEADLINE> David's Deer Fawn Returned to the Wild </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- A David's Deer fawn born on April
5 was returned to the wild after spending its first five days in a
care center.
</P>
<P>
The David's Deer Nature Reserve, the largest facility of its
kind in the world, is located in Dafeng County, east China's
Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The nature reserve released eight David's deer, including one
male, five does and two fawns, in November. The aforementioned
fawn was the first of its species born in the wild.
</P>
<P>
The existing herd at the reserve consists of the offspring of
39 David's Deer which arrived at the reserve some 10 years ago
from Britain. The usual life span for the endangered species is
around 20 years.
</P>
<P>
David's Deer originated in China. Research proves that the
Dafeng area was the original habitat of the species. The area
offers the world's best habitat for breeding and ensuring the
survival rate needed to increase the herd size.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Calls on MPs to Support Culture Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
called on Majlis (Parliament) deputies to throw their support behind his
government and the Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah
Mohajerani, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Khatami made the call in a cabinet meeting Wednesday afternoon after
31 Iranian conservative parliamentarians submitted an impeachment motion to
the Majlis against Mohajerani.
</P>
<P>
"We do not consider impeachment as a first step towards resolving the
problems of the nation," he said, "however, we believe there are better
ways of consultation and arriving at a consensus."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president expressed hope that with the trend of
discussion, the majority of Majlis deputies would be behind the
government and throw their support for Mohajerani so that he could
continue cooperating as a minister with the current government
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
He praised Mohajerani as "a man of culture, wisdom and potentiality
in the area," and termed the achievements of the culture ministry in the
area of literature, art, culture and information dissemination as
"valuable and extensive.''
</P>
<P>
However, the conservative Majlis deputies accused Mohajerani of
failing to uphold Islamic and revolutionary values by adopting a liberal
policy on the press, book publishing and the arts. They also charged him
of misappropriating public funds for minor hajj rituals.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani, a close ally of President Khatami and a strong supporter
of his open-minded policies, has announced his readiness to be present
at the Majlis on Sunday, April 25 to defend his policy.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani is the second minister of Khatami's cabinet targeted by
the powerful conservatives, who still dominate the country's most
important organs, such as the judiciary, the Majlis and armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The minister came under fire of the conservatives since his close
friend, former Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri was impeached by the
Majlis last June.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, President Khatami also said that it is the right of
the Majlis to impeach, investigate and pass suitable legislation in
the interest of people and society.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, it should be observed that the cultural, art and
information dissemination spheres have a very diverse spectrum and it
should also be noted that a society, which is undergoing stability and
development process, has its own special characteristics.

<P>
NAIROBI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has
declined to recognized the peace accord signed Sunday in Sirte,
Libya between the heads of state of Uganda, Chad, Eritrea, Congo
(k) and Libya as indicated by a government statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Taking note of the contents of the said agreement at no stage
of the proceeding to the conclusion of the said agreement was the
Rwandan government consulted on the organization of the contents
of the agreement," stated the communique.
</P>
<P>
"The said agreement contains very serious implications which
the signatories describe as 'decision' on the Rwandan involvement
in the present crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo; the
government of Rwanda, without prejudice to the vision of the
signatories to said agreement, wishes to make it categorically
clear that inferences on Rwanda in the said agreement are non
binding on Rwanda," the communique emphasized.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the Rwandan government has all
along very genuinely been participating in all initiatives seeking
a peaceful

resolution to the problems in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
As highlighted by the communique, Rwanda will continue to
associate itself with all efforts that are aimed at finding a
solution to the current crisis in the DRC as long as "the already
expressed concerns of Rwanda are being properly addressed", the
official Rwanda News Agency (RNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government will always be found cooperative in all
attempts to bring about long-term peace and security in the Great
Lakes region, the statement underscored.

Efforts to broker the peace proceedings to end the 9-month war
in the DRC have been hindered by President Laurent Kabila's denial

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Focus Efforts on Economic Growth: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Thursday pledged to ensure that economic growth
continue to be promoted in his country.
</P>
<P>
Tabling a motion on the Mid-Term Review of the Seventh Malaysia
Plan (1996-2000) in Parliament here, Mahathir said his government
would focus on efforts to facilitate growth, contain inflationary
pressures, improve further the external position, eliminate
resource gaps and sustain prudence fiscal balance.
</P>
<P>
When projecting Malaysia's gross domestic product (GDP),
Mahathir said it is expected to grow by 1 percent this year and 5
percent next year.
</P>
<P>
"This optimistic scenario is based on positive developments
shown in the aggregate demand, expected growth in the sectoral
output, surplus in the balance of payment and sufficient aggregate
savings to meet investment requirements," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of effective implementation of
policies for economic recovery, and said the government would
strengthen the capacity, efficiency and effectiveness of
government agencies to prevent delays that would invariably affect
the recovery process.
</P>
<P>
According to the Mid-Term Review of the plan, Malaysia's
development allocation under the plan was revised upward by 32.5
percent to 89.5 billion ringgit (23.552 billion U.S. dollars) from
the original 67.5 billion ringgit (17.763 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said of the total allocation, 48.2 percent will be
distributed to the economic sector, 30.9 percent to the social
sector, 12.8 percent to security and 8.1 percent to the general
administration.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would heighten industrial expansion and
diversification to make up for the negative GDP growth and low
domestic capital formation in 1998 and more importantly, to make
it a source of new wealth creation through new growth industries
and advanced technologies.
</P>
<P>
Resource-based export-oriented industries will be accorded
greater importance, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that special focus would be given to increasing
productivity and intensifying downstream activities with attention
to production of new and improved products in the resource-based
industries.
</P>
<P>
New and existing industries would be encouraged to be more
efficient in upgrading their technologies and processes to
manufacture higher-end products, quality parts and components as
well as improving their supply reliability, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the small- and medium-sized industries (SMI)
sector would be encouraged to merge or integrate activities to
attain economies of scale, diversify their market base and
penetrate global market.
</P>
<P>
He said monetary and fiscal policies for the remaining period
of the plan -- for this year and the next -- will be tailored to
prevent the resurgence of price pressures.
</P>
<P>
The bond market would be developed to provide an additional
source of investment financing while reducing the concentration of
risks in the banking system, he said.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of Macao SAR Basic Law (45) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Following is part 45 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Will the MSAR impose tariffs on its imports and exports? Will
the MSAR become a separate customs territory?
</P>
<P>
Macao is a small city and its production and consumption
capacity is limited. Its economy is heavily dependent on imports
and exports.
</P>
<P>
The mid-1970s saw a rapid increase in its imports and exports.
Macao now has economic relations and trade with more than 120
countries or regions. Furthermore, it is a full member or
associate member of many international economic organizations.
</P>
<P>
In order to increase its imports and exports, Macao has
implemented a free port policy for a long time. To maintain
government revenue, protect residents health and control traffic,
it levies low excise duties on a small number of consumer goods
such as cigarettes, liquor, vehicles, cement and fuel.
</P>
<P>
All the other imports are exempt from duties. All exports are
exempted from export duties. Only nominal fees should be paid for
the issuance by the Government of the certificates concerning the
place of origin for the export products.
</P>
<P>
According to the provisions of the Basic Law, the MSAR shall
maintain the status of a free port and shall not impose any
tariffs unless otherwise prescribed by law after the return of
Macao.
</P>
<P>
It shall pursue the policy of free trade and ensure a free flow
of goods, intangible assets and capital. It is clear that the
MSAR shall enjoy full and complete autonomy in conducting imports
and exports and Macao's current practice of exempting tariffs for
most imports and all exports shall remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
A separate customs territory and an independent sovereign state
are two different concepts. Generally speaking, if a region has a
customs system different from other parts of the country with
regard to imports and exports, it can become a separate customs
territory.
</P>
<P>
However, if any region of a country wishes to become a separate
customs territory, it must obtain approval of the sovereign
country concerned.
</P>
<P>
It is a historical fact that Macao is now under the rule of
Portugal, and it has formed a separate customs territory system.
Portugal made it clear in 1962 when it acceded to GATT (which has
now evolved into the World Trade Organization) that it would
accept the binding force of the GATT on behalf of all its separate
customs territories, including Macao.
</P>
<P>
At the time, Macao was not officially a party to the GATT and
therefore it was Portugal that exercised all the rights and
obligations as defined in the GATT on behalf of Macao.
</P>
<P>
It was not until Jan. 1991 that Macao formally became a party
to the GATT as a separate customs territory after the Portuguese
Government completed the necessary procedures for it following the
agreement reached between the Chinese and Portuguese sides.
</P>
<P>
To maintain Macao's status in the World Trade Organization and
ensure the growth of its imports and exports after its return,
Article 112 of the Basic Law stipulates the following:
</P>
<P>
-- The MSAR shall be a separate customs territory;
</P>
<P>
-- It may, using the name of "Macao, China", participate in
relevant international organizations and international trade
agreements (including preferential trade arrangements), such as
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and arrangements
regarding international trade in textiles; and
</P>
<P>
-- Export quotas, tariff preferences and other similar
arrangements, which are obtained or made by the MSAR or which were
obtained or made but remain valid, shall be enjoyed exclusively by
the Region.

<HEADLINE> Manager of Uganda's Closed Bank Hid $40M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Former Managing Director of the
closed Greenland Bank Limited (GBL) Sulaiman Kiggundu hid 57
billion shillings (40 million U.S. dollars) from the bank's books
and kept them from his board of directors, a press release from
the Bank of Uganda said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The press release said at the time of handing over the bank to
care- takers in late March, Kiggundu admitted having made huge
investments totalling 37 billion shillings (26.5 million dollars)
in related companies without disclosing them in the bank's books.
</P>
<P>
He also secretly solicited for deposits worth 20 billion
shillings (13.5 million dollars) which were kept out of the
financial statements of the bank, the press release added.
</P>
<P>
The release shed light on losses suffered by the GBL under
Kiggundu's management. Sources from the Bank of Uganda, the
central bank, said deposits at GBL declined by 20 billion
shillings (13.5 million dollars) in the last four months before it
was closed on April 1.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed this decline to Kiggundu's style of
 management and internal in-fighting among share-holders.
</P>
<P>
The release refuted the recent allegation by Kiggundu that his
bank was a sound and well-run bank before the central bank's
intervention, which led to its closure.
</P>
<P>
After the central bank closed the GBL, the 120,000 depositors
of the bank demanded to have their money back. President Yoweri
Museveni and Bank of Uganda Governor Charles Kigonyogo assured
them that the money will be paid back in full. But this cannot be
done before the bank audit is completed in June.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of Macao SAR Basic Law (46) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Following is part 46 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Will the tourism and recreational activities featuring gambling
in nature continue to be allowed in Macao after its return to
China?
</P>
<P>
Macao, which is a picturesque island city, receives more than
eight million tourists a year. The revenue from the tourism
industry and recreation accounts for one fourth of its GDP. Hence
tourism is its largest industry.
</P>
<P>
Apart from hotels, restaurants and eateries, Macao is known for
its gambling industry, which includes Gambling of Fortune or
Misfortune, horse-racing, dog racing, Pagaio and lottery, among
others. The Macao Society of Tourism and Entertainment (STDM) is
franchised to manage the gambling industry.
</P>
<P>
In 1961, Portugal enacted a law to make Macao a tourist area
and allow it to have gambling as a special form of recreation.
Since then, gambling has rapidly developed into a pillar industry
in Macao's economy.
</P>
<P>
Together with Las Vegas of the United States and Monte-Carlo of
Monaco, Macao is now one of the three world-famous gambling cities.
At present, about 40 percent of its fiscal revenue comes from the
taxes on gambling and over 20 thousand people are employed in the
industry and its related activities.
</P>
<P>
To implement the policy of "one country, two systems" and in
accordance with the principle of keeping the current capitalist
system and way of life in Macao unchanged, Article 118 of the
Basic Law stipulates that the MSAR shall, on its own, formulate
policies on tourism and recreation in the light of its overall
interests.
</P>
<P>
It is clear from this provision that after Macao's return, its
gambling industry will continue to exist lawfully, people there
may go to dancing parties, dog racing and casinos as usual.
</P>
<P>
The Central Government will not intervene in these activities,
still less will it force Macao to implement the policies practiced
on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Of course, the MSAR shall give full consideration to all social
factors in formulating policies on tourism and recreation in the
interest of both ensuring social stability and promoting economic
development.

<HEADLINE> Business Confidence in New Zealand Soars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Business confidence in New
Zealand
has soared to its highest level in almost five years, according to
a
quarterly survey released by the New Zealand Institute of Economic

Research Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that firms in the country are now "the most
optimistic" they have been since the second quarter of 1994.
</P>
<P>
"New Zealand will undoubtedly experience a recovery over the
next
year. However, it seems unlikely that growth will reach the
heights it
did in the early 1990s," it said.
</P>
<P>
The number of firms expecting the general business situation to

improve during the next six months jumped to 47 percent, from 19
percent
three months ago, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Though several factors were behind the mounting optimism, with
exports
continuing to play an important role, the most significant
influence
seemed to be the strengthening in domestic activity, the survey
said.
</P>
<P>
Also contributing to the turnaround in confidence are low
interest
rates, strengthening consumer confidence, firming in residential
building activity and an upturn in tourist numbers.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The government of Guangzhou,
capital of Guangdong Province, plans to recapitalize the Guangzhou
City Commercial Bank by 500 million to one billion yuan over the

<HEADLINE> Article Refutes Dalai's Lies on Tibet "Autonomy" (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Overseas Edition of the
People's Daily published a signed article today exposing the lies
of the 14th Dalai Lama on the "autonomy" of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama in exile has recently changed to drum up a call
for a "high-level autonomy," "real self-governing" for Tibet, and
"the autonomy of the Greater Tibet", the article by Yang Cheng
noted, stressing that his real intention is to ignore the fact
that "regional autonomy" has already been successfully realized in
the land formerly governed by serfdom.
</P>
<P>
It is just under the system of ethnic regional autonomy that
Tibet has witnessed ethnic unity, stable society, prosperous
economy and earth-shaking changes in people's lives.
</P>
<P>
Since regional autonomy was first introduced more than 30 years
ago, tremendous achievements have been made in Tibet, with average
life expectancy greatly extended, people's health improved,
cultural levels enhanced, the economy progressing, and society
peaceful and stable, the article said.
</P>
<P>
"People with the least good conscience have to acknowledge that
this is the best time in the history of Tibet," it claimed.
</P>
<P>
The article detailed how autonomy was implemented and what
changes it has brought about.
</P>
<P>
-- The policy of ethnic equality, reciprocal help, and ethnic
regional autonomy was established when New China was founded in
1949, and was later enshrined in its first Constitution in 1954;
</P>
<P>
-- Ethnic regional autonomy was provided for in the 1951 17-
article treaty between the Central Government and the Tibet local
government on the "peaceful liberation of Tibet;"
</P>
<P>
-- The 14th Dalai Lama was elected vice-chairman of the
National People's Congress Standing Committee, while the 10th
Panchen Lama was made vice-chairman of National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in July 1954,
marking the beginning of Tibet religious leaders assuming posts of
state leadership in China;

complied with the international qualification standards for
seafarers.
</P>
<P>
The executive order mandates that Marina shall communicate to
IMO and other concerned agencies or parties any supplemental
information necessary for the Philippines' compliance and
implementation of the STCW convention.

BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese navy is being
equipped with a second-generation of arms and equipment including
new destroyers, submarines, missiles, torpedoes, and naval
ordnance.
</P>
<P>
A senior navy official said in an interview with Xinhua that
the building of the Chinese navy has mainly depended on its own

He said the navy has created a number of training bases and has
greatly increased training with real weapons and equipment. Now,
the 13 naval colleges offer over 200 specialties, and commanding
officers receive training in technical command, tactical command,
and operational command.
</P>
<P>
The commanding officers also receive comprehensive training in
navigation and naval ordnance to improve their overall command
ability.

<HEADLINE> FAO Forecasts Mixed Food Outlook for Sub-Saharan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) has warned that although much of
sub-Saharan Africa continues to see improved food and crop
prospects, war and civil strife remain a threat to food security
in several countries of the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Wednesday in Accra, capital of Ghana,
the organization said adverse weather conditions are further
aggravating the situation in some areas.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps hardest hit by civil strife is Angola, where the food
outlook this year is 'extremely bleak,'" it said in a report
quoted by the Ghana News Agency (GNA).
</P>
<P>
This, said FAO, is because of fighting between government
forces and the rebels of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, which resumed in December, just after the
beginning of the current cropping season.
</P>
<P>
"Large-scale population displacement in rural areas is
reported, with families abandoning their farms and homes to take
refuge in government-held towns and cities or in neighboring
countries."
</P>
<P>
Some reports say the Angolan countryside is being
systematically depopulated.
</P>
<P>
According to FAO, food production in Angola in 1999 is expected
to be sharply reduced and the country will need massive food
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Distribution of relief assistance will have to be carried out
mainly by expensive air transport, because of widespread
insecurity and land mines.
</P>
<P>
FAO said the food outlook for 1999 in west Africa is generally
favorable, particularly in the Sahelian countries following
above-average to record harvests, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"Several countries have cereal surpluses available for donor
purchases for transfer to deficit areas within the countries
themselves, or for assistance to other countries in the
sub-region," said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report estimated the aggregate 1998 cereal output for
Burkina Faso,

Chad, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal
and Gambia "at a record 10.4 million tons which is 35 percent
higher than in 1997 and 20 percent above the average of the last
five years."
</P>
<P>
FAO said continuing violence and widespread insecurity threaten
the 1999 food outlook in Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau, adding
that the capital, Freetown, is still suffering from severe food
and fuel shortages.
</P>
<P>
However, it noted that economic activities are picking up with
the return of traders and the re-opening of banks.
</P>
<P>
But it warned that because most staff of international
humanitarian agencies have not yet returned to the country, some
agricultural rehabilitation activities, including the distribution
of seeds and tools, will be very limited.
</P>
<P>
The report said food production during the coming growing
season which began this month is projected to be seriously
reduced.
</P>
<P>
"In neighboring Liberia, although the country is still
suffering from food shortages, a recovery of agricultural
production and food supply is expected to continue in 1999 as a
result of improved security conditions."
</P>
<P>
The FAO report listed 17 sub-Saharan countries as facing
exceptional food emergencies, that is an increase of four since
December last year.
</P>
<P>
They are Angola, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo,
Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya,
Liberia, Mauritania, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan,
Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Women's Cooperation: Important Part of Sino-U.S. Ties (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During their 20-day visit, the group, headed by Feng Cui,
toured Washington D. C., New York, and San Francisco. The
delegation met with Mrs. Clinton and many female senior U.S.
officials and various women's associations, and held talks at
several research institutes on women issues. The Chinese
delegation also visited social service centers, hospitals, and
schools.
</P>
<P>
"The visit helped us to understand American women more deeply,
and vice versa," Feng said.
</P>
<P>
In Feng's view, although the two countries have different
social systems, they have many common grounds for realizing
equality between men and women and safeguarding the rights and
interests of women.
</P>
<P>
The two countries can learn from each other to train talented
women and enhance their ability to participate in political life,
create employment opportunities, promote women's ability in
business, support research on women issues, and eliminate violence
towards women, Feng said.
</P>
<P>
"We can draw the conclusion that the spectrum of cooperation
and exchanges between the women of the two countries is very
extensive," Feng said. "Therefore, the invitation by the first
lady was very positive and far-sighted."
</P>
<P>
The United States is expected to invite more such Chinese women
delegations to visit the United States, and the ACWF would like to
invite more American women to China.

<HEADLINE> Dictionary of Contemporary Chinese Dialects Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- All 41 volumes of the Dictionary
of Contemporary Chinese Dialects, the first of its kind in China,
have now been published.
</P>
<P>
The dictionary contains more than 300,000 words and phrases,
and about 200,000 illustrative sentences, including many that have
never appeared in dictionaries before.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese linguists, China can be roughly divided
into ten dialect regions, each of which contains a number of sub-
dialect areas.
</P>
<P>
The dictionary is a joint project of the Institute of
Linguistics under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the
Jiangsu Education Press, and took over 60 linguists nearly 10
years to compile.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the dictionary is of great importance for the study
of folklore, ethnology, anthropology and sociology, with rich
entries on areas such as folk customs, the migration of people,
and contact among the various ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
They also believe it will help keep alive the many dialects
that have tended to be assimilated into Putonghua (Mandarin),
standard Chinese, due to increasing exchanges among the different
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
A source with the Jiangsu Education Press said that a one-
volume edition of the dictionary will be available in about two
years.

<P>
NAIROBI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- American Airlines intends to use
Ghana as a gateway to expand its operations in west Africa, the
Airlines' regional sales manager Ish Jalal said in Accra, the
capital, Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking to reporters on arrival at the Accra Airport as
the head of a delegation of the airline. The delegation is on a
two-day working visit to Ghana to explore opportunities for the
airline in west Africa, according to Ghana News Agency (GNA).
</P>
<P>
Jalal said American Airlines has no immediate plan to start a
direct flight to the country. It will however use its ''Global
Alliance'' involving British Airways, Canadian Airlines, Cathay
Pacific Airlines and Qantas Airways to connect passengers to
their various destinations.
</P>
<P>
He explained that this arrangement is very cost effective,
gives better services to passengers through a wider network and
enables the participating airlines to meet the keen competition in
the airline business.
</P>
<P>
Jalal attributed the expansion of the airline in west Africa to
the hard work of its Ghanaian team.

HARARE, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Grain Marketing Board
(GMB) has increased the price of the country's staple maize from
3,000 Zimbabwean dollars (79 U.S. dollars) a ton to 4,900
Zimbabwean dollars (129 U.S. dollar), a rise of 63 percent.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's GMB price rises followed the 75 percent increase in

The price paid to farmers was raised to ensure farm viability and
continued supplies of grain, the daily Herald reported Thursday.

Association of Zimbabwe, representing small-scale and big millers
respectively, said Wednesday their members were not prepared to
buy maize at the new price.

<HEADLINE> China, U.S. Start Technical Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and U.S. negotiators
started talking technical issues in two groups at 2:30 p.m. here
Thursday in a bid to resolve remaining issues on China's entry
into the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Topics of negotiation for Thursday's working conference are
service trade and the details of China's accession to WTO protocol,
according to reliable sources with the Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
An official from the U.S. embassy told reporters before the
talks began that 14 members of the U.S. delegation, including
those from the U.S. embassy and the Commerce Department of the U.S.
, would attend the group discussions. There would be eight U.S.
members for the service trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The group discussions will last around one and half to two
hours, she said.
</P>
<P>
Long Yongtu, chief negotiator of the Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), and Assistant U.S. Trade
Representative Robert Cassidy held a 30-minute closed door meeting
earlier on Thursday to set the procedure and contents of the new
round of talks on China's entry into WTO.
</P>
<P>
Long told Xinhua after the morning meeting that the two sides
will further discuss market access, remaining issues of protocol,
and details of understanding in negotiations in the coming few
days.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of negotiations is part of the efforts to carry
out what Premier Zhu Rongji and U.S. President Bill Clinton agreed
on China's accession to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government voiced firm support for China's entry into
the WTO in 1999 during Zhu's visit, and the two sides have agreed
to "intensify" negotiations for resolving remaining issues in
talks on China's accession to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
China's leading newspaper, the People's Daily, said Thursday in
an editorial hailing Zhu's visit to the U.S. and Canada that
China's entry into the WTO is an "eye-catching" issue.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. government is committed to firmly supporting China's
bid to enter the WTO in 1999, and both sides have agreed to
negotiate unresolved questions concerning China's accession into
the organization by the end of April in order to ensure China's
early entry into the WTO," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Important progress has been made for Sino-U.S. negotiations on
China's 13-year bid to enter into the WTO during Zhu's visit to
the U.S. earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Cassidy arrived here Wednesday night, just a few hours after
Premier Zhu Rongji's return from a two-week whirlwind official
visit to the United States and Canada.

<HEADLINE> 1.4 Million Kenyans Affected by AIDS Virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The number of people in Kenya
infected with the dreaded AIDS virus has now topped 1.4 million,
according to Kenya's National AIDS Committee (NAC).
</P>
<P>
Dr Sobbie Mulindi, the committee's vice-chairman, said
Wednesday in Nyeri District of Central Province that because of
the long incubation period of the disease, the number of
HIV-positive Kenyans could be much higher.
</P>
<P>
"The full economic impact of existing level of infection will
be felt in 10 or more years to come," Mulindi said, quoted by
Thursday's East African Standard newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Medical records at the central provincial hospital indicate
that 30 percent of women seeking ante-natal services are
HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
Mulindi noted that AIDs prevalence among high-income, urban and
 relatively well educated Kenyans was as high as among low-income,
slum and rural dwellers, saying that for the last 10 years, deaths
from AIDS have doubled.
</P>
<P>
According to NAC, the majority of Kenyans infected with
HIV/AIDS are from Western, Nyanza and Coast provinces.
</P>
<P>
The vice-chairman said deaths are progressively affecting
national productivity, turnover, training costs and resources
allocation in both public and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
Mulindi commended the Ministry of Health for sensitizing Kenyans
on the implications of HIV/AIDs and urged other ministries to be
involved in combating the disease.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Economy to Recover Mildly in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya has
predicted that the Kenyan economy would achieve a gross domestic
product (GDP) growth of 2.5 percent in 1999, a mild recovery
compared to the 1.6 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, the central bank said this will depend on improvement
in the country's infrastructure, especially the dilapidated road
network, security and increased efficiency of public services.
</P>
<P>
The bank's Monthly Economic Review for April said the 12 month
to January 1999 showed an expanded GDP of 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
This expanded growth has been achieved from improved
agricultural production that has benefited from good weather
conditions in the past six months compared to early 1998 when the
El Nino rains destroyed crops, the East African Standard
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the bank indicate that the agricultural sector
recorded a 1.7 percent growth from the end of last year to early
this year compared to 1.2 percent achieved in the same period last
year, mainly owing to good weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
The bank also noted that the manufacturing sector and tourism
industry experienced no much progress in the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund Tuesday predicted in a report
that Kenya is highly likely to achieve a 3.5 percent growth rate
in 1999.

BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese military has begun
reforming logistics as a major way to streamline the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Military Command started trial runs in early 1999
at four hospitals and five units where local social services are
being used for more diversified food supplies, cleaning, tree-
planting, family care, and in other areas.
</P>
<P>
It has cut logistics staff by more than 400 people, saving more
than 500,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, chairman of the Central Military Commission,
pointed out at a meeting at the end of last year that military
logistics, and especially daily supplies, should be a part of
social services and reforms in this area should be accelerated.
</P>
<P>
The move of military logistics to the public or civilian sector
will start with units and institutes in major cities and gradually
expand to the whole system, according to the General Logistics
Department of the People's Liberation Army.

BELGRADE, April 22 (Xinhua) -- NATO bombings hit Belgrade and

This is partially the result of local effort to crack down on
illegal tax dodging, evasion and resistance, as more than 1,000
such cases were investigated involving the payment of as much as
80 million yuan in taxes.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to enhanced anti-smuggling campaigns, output as well as
sales of local manufactured goods such as cigarettes, oil, rolled
steel, autos, and color TVs are rising sharply. This has allowed
value-added and consumer taxes from these goods to grow by more
than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Xuhui District in downtown Shanghai led local districts
with a 31 percent growth rate in tax revenues during the first
quarter this year.

<HEADLINE> APEC Officials Meeting for Solution of Y2K Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 22 (Xinhua) -- APEC officials from its members
are gathering here Thursday to start a two-day discussion on ways
to solve Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 delegates, including officials from APEC members,
representatives from international organizations as well as
private business community participated in the seminar designed to
strengthen cooperation and exchange experiences in overcoming the
Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will focus their discussions on Y2K's cross-border
impact in the fields of finance, telecommunications, transport,
customs and energy and lay emphasis on small and medium
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Participants will also exchange views and experiences in
formulating contingency plans and settling legal conflicts between
different economies.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at the opening session, Singapore Minister
for Trade and Industry Lee Yock Suan said the Y2K problem is no
longer merely a computer bug to be eradicated with a technical
solution.
</P>
<P>
"Initially, Y2K compliance efforts have been focused on
individual mainframes and desktop systems," he said, "However, it
did not take long before it became obvious that embedded systems,
ranging from automobiles and elevators to telephone switches and
life support systems are also at risk."
</P>
<P>
"More importantly, a system that has been certified to be
Y2K-compliant no longer guarantees that it will be immune to the
problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In this highly interconnected world, computer systems do not
exist as isolated entities, but are highly dependent on other
systems that they are linked to," he elaborated.
</P>
<P>
Noting that at the global level financial and other economic
activities rely on the widespread interconnections between
economies, Lee emphasized that "no individual institution, sector,
or economy can claim to be immune to the Y2K problem by just
verifying and testing all its internal systems and application."
</P>
<P>
Lee also stressed that the Y2k problem has to be specially
looked upon from a cross-border angle and APEC economies must come
together to overcome this global problem even amid the current
economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Lee proposed delegates to give emphasis to their deliberation
on the strategic and management responses to resolve problems
should the technical solutions be inadequate or incomplete, noting
"it may already be too late for organizations to look for a
technical solution at this stage."

<HEADLINE> Shandong's First-Quarter Foreign Trade Rises 5.1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province
reported a 5.1 percent rise in foreign trade year-on-year to 3.78
billion U.S. dollars during the first quarter this year, compared
with the national average of 4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The increase was attributed to brisk local general trade and to
growing local exports, especially to Japan and the Republic of
Korea, which are both gradually throwing off the ill-effects of
the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 percent of the provincial exports went to Asian
countries and regions, while exports to Japan during the period
rose 12.8 percent on a yearly basis, with those to the Republic of
Korea rising by 12.6 percent. Exports to the United States grew
by 15.5 percent, and those to the European Union remained at a
growth rate of 4.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Shandong is the country's third-leading economic power in terms
of GDP.

<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Work on a recovery center for eye
patients is now underway in Changping County on Beijing's northern
outskirts, thanks to donations from the Macao Tourism
Entertainment Co. and the Hong Kong Shun Tak Group.
</P>
<P>
The one-million-yuan (120,000 U.S. dollars) project will help
solve treatment and daily care problems of a large number of eye-
disease patients in the county. It will have 50 beds when it is
finished by coming October, and will benefit about 100,000
patients.
</P>
<P>
The 1,200-sq-m building resembles two hands holding a ball,
symbolizing the regaining of eyesight and the return of Macao to
the motherland on December 20 this year, as well.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, members of the Hong Kong and Macao
origin of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Conference (CPPCC) and Hong Kong and Macao members of
the International Lion Club have provided 8 million yuan worth of
medical equipment to deal with eye diseases for a special eye
hospital, and have set up four town or township hospitals and a
village primary school with more than 15 million yuan in districts
or counties around the capital.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Romania, IMF Sign Letter of Intent on New Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Romania will get 500 million U.
S. dollars in loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in
1999 and 2000 to help restore its credibility in the international
financial market.
</P>
<P>
Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile and IMF chief negotiator
Emanuel Zervoudakis signed a letter of intent on the loan after
lengthy negotiations here.
</P>
<P>
Under the document which is expected to be approved by IMF
Board of Directors in early June, Romania will receive the money
within a period of between 10 and 11 months, Zervoudakis said.
</P>
<P>
He said Romania should comply with the agreement so as to
obtain the entire loan.
</P>
<P>
Romania had signed four loan accords with the IMF since 1990,
but none of them was fully implemented after the IMF suspended
them on the grounds that Romania violated them.
</P>
<P>
To gain the new loan, the Romanian government promised to take
tight monetary policy, curb this year's financial deficit within 2.
5 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) and cut
inflation rate to 32 percent from 40.6 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it also promised to step up reforms of enterprises
and the banking sector and significantly reduce losses incurred by
state-run enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The loan agreement was seen by many as a major achievement for
the Vasile government which took office in April 1998. Observers
here believe the new loan will help heighten Romania's image in
the global financial market.
</P>
<P>
Economic slump in recent years and huge foreign debt services
this year have seriously weakened Romania's credibility in the
world financial market and affected the country's fund-raising
ability.

<HEADLINE> Nanjing Daily Lashes Out at Tokyo Governor for Remarks on War Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Newly-elected Tokyo governor
Shintaro Ishihara's repeated denial of Japanese aggressors'
slaughtering of 300,000 Chinese during the Rape of Nanjing in the
1930s has been strongly refuted by the city's leading newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the Sankei Shimbun on April 20, Ishihara claimed
that the Japanese troops killed only between 10,000 or 20,000
Chinese civilians and armymen during the six weeks of Nanjing's
fall since December 13, 1937.
</P>
<P>
Refuting Ishihara, a signed article in Thursday's Nanjing Daily
pointed out that the death toll of 300,000 in the massacre was
verified and judged as a historical fact by the post-war Far
Eastern international military tribunal and China's military
tribunal on Japanese war criminals.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Chengshan, curator of the city's memorial for the victims
of the Nanjing massacre, said in the article that "Ishihara's
fallacy distorting the history is both unacceptable to the Nanjing
people and contravening the fundamental interests and wishes of
the Japanese people."
</P>
<P>
Ishihara's fallacy was "based on his stubborn adherence to
ultra-nationalism with a feigned ignorance of the Chinese people's
indignation (over his repeated anti-China remarks) and the
condemnation in the world media," Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Tobacco Sales Slow  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's tobacco selling season
got off Wednesday to a slow start in Harare, capital of the
southern African country, with prices described by growers as
disappointing.
</P>
<P>
The prices at the two tobacco auction floors, the Tobacco Sales
Floor Limited (TSF) and the Burley Marketing Zimbabwe (BMZ), were
below anticipation of growers in U.S. dollar terms.
</P>
<P>
At TSF, the average price at the close of trading was 123.05
U.S. cents per kilogram compared with last year's 123.62 U.S.
cents per kg.
</P>
<P>
The average price at BMZ was 121 U.S. cents per kg as compared
to last year's 165 U.S. cents per kg.
</P>
<P>
TSF Managing Director Pat Deventish said the prices were better
than most farmers had predicted using the value of the Zimbabwean
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is one of the main tobacco sale markets in the world.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco is the biggest foreign currency earner for the southern
African country. The crop for the 1999 season was about 186,000
tons with a value of about 550 million U.S. dollars.

HARARE, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Director-General of the
World Health Organization (WHO) Gro Harlem Brundtland Wednesday
said Africa is a key priority for WHO and her organization will
make most efforts to support health development in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The efforts include reducing and preventing malaria, HIV/AIDS
and maternal mortality, she said.
</P>
<P>
She told reporters after meeting Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe that people should change their sexual behavior which was
the main cause of the spread of HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"The fight against the diseases ravaging Africa can succeed
when we build partnerships, strengthen health sectors and
concentrate resources on early action where people live," she
said.
</P>
<P>
She arrived here this morning for a one-day visit to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, she said during this African visit she has
chosen to focus on three major issues including malaria, AIDS and
maternal health.
</P>
<P>
"Malaria takes a daunting human toll and represents a roadblock
to development. Africa carries 80 percent of the malaria burden,"
she said, adding, "Roll Back Malaria has the ambition to cut by
half the number of deaths from malaria within a decade through
better access of all people in malaria-affected areas to a range
of effective interventions."
</P>
<P>
"The HIV/AIDS epidemic represents an unprecedented crisis for
the continent. More than 20 million Africans are infected with
HIV today. Over two million died of AIDS in 1998, including
nearly half a million children. Four million new HIV infection
occurred in Africa last year," she said.
</P>
<P>
If the U.N. organizations, governments, NGO communities, and
donors act now, together, and effectively divide the tasks
according to WHO comparative advantages then by the year 2005 we
may see in Africa that several millions of HIV infections will
have been averted and that incidence in 15-24 age group can be
reduced by 25 percent in the 25 most affected countries, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said every few minutes an African woman dies unnecessarily
from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth. The lifetime
risk of suffering a maternal death is as high as one in 16 in some
African countries compared with one in 4,000 in developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
WHO's aim is to reduce pregnancy-related mortality and
morbidity by 50 percent of 1990 levels by 2005, she said.
</P>
<P>
She appealed to rich countries to make a significant
contribution to meeting the crucial challenges to health
development in the African region.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Starts to Repay Internal Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's treasury has
started to repay its internal debt, the first time in five years.
</P>
<P>
The treasury issued this week hundreds of checks worth about
two billion shillings (about 2.84 million U.S. dollars) to private
companies and businessmen who supplied goods and rendered services
to three government ministries in a move to clear their
accumulated debts.
</P>
<P>
The two billion shillings were part of the 27 billion shillings
dished by the European Union to assist the government to settle
internal debts, the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of
Finance, Raphael Mollel, told reporters in Dar es Salaam
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Those which have received assistance in paying debt this week
include the Ministry of Education and Culture, The Ministry of
Science, Technology and Higher Education, and the Ministry of
Health, Mollel said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, Tanzania's internal debt stood at 902
billion Shillings, according to the central Bank of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The permanent secretary said the central payment office at his
ministry will continue writing checks for other suppliers of goods
and services to the government as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He said internal debts had not been paid since 1993/94 fiscal
year for lack of funds and other reasons.
</P>
<P>
A source at the ministry said that the money from the European
Union is targeted at helping the Tanzanian government repay debts
owed to private firms, which would revamp the economy, increase
gross domestic product and restore the government credibility.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Formation of India's Government Impeded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Formation of an alternative
government in India was impeded Wednesday with the Congress
insisting on a minority one while other non-Congress opposition
parties proposing a coalition with veteran communist leader Jyoti
Basu as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Congress leader Sonia Gandhi told President Kocheril Raman
Narayanan Wednesday that she was willing to form a minority
government with outside support of 272 parliament members out of
543 in Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian parliament.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of non-Congress opposition parties including Samajwadi
Party (SP) and the All-India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam
(AIADMK) made a last-ditch attempt Wednesday night to stall the
formation of a Sonia-led minority government by proposing veteran
communist leader Jyoti Basu as prime minister in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
They informed Sonia Gandhi of their decision made in a two-hour
meeting which discussed the leadership issue and the shape and
structure of an alternative to the coalition led by the Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP).
</P>
<P>
But both Congress and Basu, a political bureau member of the
Communist Party of India (Marxism) and West Bengal chief minister,
reportedly rejected the idea outright.
</P>
<P>
The decision was in fact a rejection to the option of a
Congress minority government and, instead, proposing either a
coalition including all like-minded opposition parties or a
so-called "third- frond" government.
</P>
<P>
The Congress appears in no mood to relent from its declared
stand, nor has it taken kindly to the attempt of some of the
"secular allies" to question the suitability of Sonia Gandhi to
take on the BJP as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, there was no let-up in the counter-pressure
from the BJP and its allies, who have been persisting with their
demand that the president should not invite someone to form an
alternative government without asking for credible proof of
support in written of more than 270 Lok Sabha members.
</P>
<P>
Though the Congress refused to say anything on the
contradictions among the opposition, senior party leaders said
unofficially that the party would prefer to go to polls as the
idea of a coalition government was too late to be considered.
</P>
<P>
Congress sources said the party's assertion stemmed from the
fact that they had come to know that the president had turned down
the BJP's demand for the reinstatement of the Vajpayee government
as being "unconstitutional."
</P>
<P>
Other party sources said, however, consultations would continue
on Thursday to evolve a consensus on the nature of an alternative
government.
</P>
<P>
The 13-month-old BJP-led coalition government was defeated in a
confidence motion last Saturday by 269:270, the narrowest margin
of one vote, in Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian
parliament.
</P>
<P>
As there has been no visible shape of a new government, there
has been a lot of speculations in political circle as to who will
win the "war of nerves" in the current political crisis in the
country.

<HEADLINE> International Commercial Arbitration Center Set up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- An International Commercial
Arbitration Center to promote international commercial
arbitration in Africa has been established in Lagos, Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The center, known as "Lagos Center", was set up under the
auspices of the Asian-African Legal Consultative Committee
(AALCC), the Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A draft law relating to the establishment and existence of the
Lagos Center will be promulgated before May, this year.
</P>
<P>
These were made known Wednesday when Eunice R. Oddiri, acting
director of the center, presented her report at the on-going
five-day 38th annual session of the AALCC in Accra, capital of
Ghana.
</P>
<P>
She said the Nigerian government has given its blessing to the
siting of the center in Lagos and that an agreement to that effect
is expected to be signed between the AALCC and the government
Monday on April 26.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the objectives of the Center, Oddiri said it would
coordinate and assist in the activities of existing arbitral
institutions, particularly those in Africa.
</P>
<P>
It would also render assistance to other national arbitral
bodies, enforcement of arbitral awards and get involved in an
advisory role in the drafting of arbitration laws.
</P>
<P>
She said in order to popularize the center, workshops, seminars
and conferences have been held in the past year, and that another
seminar has been slated for the coming April 28.
</P>
<P>
According to Oddiri, the Lagos Center would be a force to
reckon with in Africa in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
Deliberations at the session are being presided over by Martin
Amidu, deputy attorney-general who was elected AALCC president on
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Zeal for Chinese Language Booming Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- An international symposium on
teaching the Chinese language overseas held recently in Beijing
demonstrated that zeal for learning Chinese is booming worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Experts agree that the number of Chinese learners around the
world is increasing rapidly, as for example the number of
Americans learning Chinese in 1995 was 36 percent more than in
1990, the most rapidly growing group of any country.
</P>
<P>
Chinese ranks only after English in the teaching of foreign
languages at the Republic of Korea's universities. Last year there
were now 27 French universities offering Chinese, and those taking
the HSK test, specially designed for foreign students, numbered
more than 41,000 in France, 60 percent more than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The motivation for learning Chinese has also changed, from
exclusively out of appreciation for Chinese culture to mainly job-
related reasons in many countries.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, many governments are now paying attention to the
teaching of Chinese. The French government now has senior
instructors teaching Chinese in middle schools, and added the
position of supervisor in its education ministry for the teaching
of Chinese in 1996. The Thai government has decided to offer
Chinese in primary and secondary schools beginning this year.
</P>
<P>
Japan ranks first outside China in the number of Chinese
learners and that of those taking part in the HSK test, and many
Japanese come to China to further their studies.

<HEADLINE> hke042230 - Manila Allocates More Money for Agriculture Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to modernize agriculture
and bring about self-sufficiency in food and minimize poverty in
the country, the Philippine government has allotted some 800
million pesos (about 20 million U.S. dollars) for agriculture
research this year.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Acting Secretary William D. Dar said Thursday that
the fund will be used to upgrade the capabilities of research and
development (R&AMP;D) institutions and grants for actual researches to
be conducted.
</P>
<P>
Dar said the amount is a quantum jump for the meager DA R&AMP;D
budget the Bureau of Agricultural Research (BAR) receives.
</P>
<P>
Last year, for instance, BAR's budget was a measly 70 million
pesos (about 1.75 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
As programmed, half of the 1999 R&AMP;D budget will be used to
upgrade and rehabilitate outmoded facilities and equipment,
including human resource development program for DA personnel and
other interested individuals.
</P>
<P>
The other half is set aside for direct research and networking
activities, R&AMP;D projects of state universities and colleges, and
assistance to agriculture and fishery R&AMP;D initiatives for
agriculture-fishery professional entities and nongovernment
organizations.
</P>
<P>
DA is strongly advocating for government to increase
investments in agriculture and fisheries R&AMP;D to at least one
percent of GVA annually, which is roughly 4.5 billion pesos (about
112.5 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Increases Development Allocation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has revised upward
its development allocation under the Seventh Malaysia Plan
(1996-2000) by 32.5 percent, according to the Mid-Term Review of
the plan released here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The allocation under the plan was increased to 89.5 billion
ringgit (23.552 billion U.S. dollars) from its original ceiling of
67.5 billion ringgit (17.763 billion dollars), the Mid-Term Review
prepared by the Economic Planning Unit of the Prime Minister's
Department said.
</P>
<P>
It said overall, the development allocation recommended is
sustainable at 16.3 percent of Gross National Product (GNP) in
current terms and 17.6 percent in real terms, which is lower than
in some of the earlier five-year development plans.
</P>
<P>
It said with the increased expenditure and reduction in
revenue, both the federal government and the overall public sector
accounts are expected to record a deficit of 2,894 million ringgit
(761.578 million dollars) or 1 percent of the Gross National
Product by the end of the plan period.
</P>
<P>
Economic and social programs would continue to receive the bulk
of the revised allocations, it said, adding that allocations in
the economic sector would be mainly channeled for infrastructure
and utility development while social programs will focus on human
resource development and improvement of social amenities.
</P>
<P>
The government has allocated some 3,822 million ringgit (1,006
million dollars) for the remaining period of the plan for
agriculture and rural development.
</P>
<P>
A sum of 4,165 million ringgit (1,096 million dollars) has been
allocated for the commerce and industry sub-sector.
</P>
<P>
The transport and communications sub-sector has been allocated
6,268 million ringgit (1,649 million dollars) to ensure the
completion of critical projects and improvement in the quality of
services and the energy and water resources sub-sectors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 2,049 million ringgit (539.21 million dollars) has
been allocated for housing development, 1,813 million ringgit
(477.105 million dollars) for the health sub-sector, 5,384 million
ringgit (1,416.842 million dollars) for security sector and 4,238
million ringgit (1,115.263 million dollars) for the general
administration sector.
</P>
<P>
The current expenditure of the federal government is expected
to increase by 4.8 percent per annum during the remaining period
with emoluments to account for the largest portion of the current
expenditure which are projected to increase by 1.7 percent per
annum against 5.4 percent per annum during the review period.
</P>
<P>
The total federal government revenue is expected to increase
moderately by 4.3 percent per annum to 62,906 million ringgit
(16,554.21 million dollars) in the year 2000 due to improvement in
the collection of indirect taxes and non-tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
The review said that privatization will continue to play an
important role in facilitating the economic recovery and
contributing towards further growth of the economy during the
remaining period.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Losses Reported in Bangladeshi Power Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The overall system loss in
Bangladesh's state-run power sector stands at about 30 percent at
present, incurring an estimated annual revenue loss of 3.5 billion
taka (about 72.9 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The high percentage of system loss was a result of corrupt
practices, such as electricity pilferage though illegal
connections, meter tampering and under-billing, The New Nation
daily newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Technical loss (generation, transmission and distribution) was
around 16 percent while the corrupt practices contributed to the
remaining system loss of 14 percent, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The power sector normally sustained system losses of 5 percent,
4 percent and 7 percent on account of generation, transmission,
and distribution respectively. But the other 14-percent loss was
irrational leading not only to chronic revenue losses, but also
deepening power crisis in the country, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Load-shedding would be eased if the system loss came down, they
said. Load-shedding is a common phenomenon in this South Asian
nation, particularly in the hot summer between March and June.
</P>
<P>
To deal with illegal connections, the country has set up 65
mobile courts. Some 1,771 illegal connections were snapped in
December last year, and 77 unauthorized consumers have been sent
to jail.
</P>
<P>
The installed capacity for power generation in Bangladesh is
3,091 megawatt, but the available power generation capacity is
only 1,900-2,000 megawatt while the peak hour requirement is 2,300
megawatt.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Revises GDP Growth Targets Under 7th 5-Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has revised the
average gross domestic product (GDP) targets to 3.0 percent under
the Seventh Malaysia Plan (7MP) (1996-2000) from 8.0 percent
projected earlier due to the regional economic slowdown, according
to the Mid-Term Review of the 7MP released here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Although the targets were revised and the 3.0 percent growth
target was the lowest for any plan, the good news is that after
last year's recession when the economy contracted by 6.7 percent,
signs of a recovery are imminent, the Mid-Term Review prepared by
the Economic Planning Unit (EPU) in the Prime Minister's
Department said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's GDP is expected to grow positively during the 7MP's
remaining period (1999-2000) with a 1.0 percent growth in 1999 and
5.0 percent in 2000, it said, the recovery momentum will help
efforts to further reduce poverty by 5.5 percent by the end of the
century.
</P>
<P>
Thanks largely to the recovery measures implemented to tackle
financial woes which hit the country midway through the plan
period, Malaysia can sustain growth and pursue the aim of becoming
a developed nation by the year 2020, it said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysians will continue enjoying good living standards under
the 7MP despite the growth targets revision.
</P>
<P>
The government aims at expediting the process of recovery and
setting in motion a steady and continuous rate of economic growth
to ultimately ensure continued prosperity and improving the
quality of life for the population.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting this commitment, the total federal government
development allocation was revised from the original 67,500
million ringgit (about 17.763 billion U.S. dollars) to 89,500
million ringgit (about 23.552 billion U.S. dollars) for the
five-year plan period, it said.
</P>
<P>
A crucial factor in determining recovery would be the pace and
urgency at which the recovery measures are implemented to restore
public and investor confidence, the Mid-Term Review said without
cautioning against external developments.
</P>
<P>
Besides this, boosting private investment will be crucial to
the recovery towards sustainable growth, it said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Doubles Allocation for IT Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has doubled the
development allocation for information technology (IT) related
programs and projects under the Seventh Malaysian Plan (7MP)
(1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
The IT development allocation has been revised upwards to
4,010.5 million ringgit (about 1,055.394 million U.S. dollars)
from its original allocation of 2,013.1 million ringgit (about
529.763 million U.S. dollars), according to the Mid-Term Review
(MTR) of the 7MP released here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This includes increased allocation of 1,182.1 million ringgit
(about 311.078 million U.S. dollars) from the original allocation
of 273.1 million ringgit (about 71.868 million U.S. dollars) for
the implementation of the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) flagship
applications for electronic government projects, smart schools,
telemedicine and multipurpose card.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a sum of 600 million ringgit (about 157.894
million U.S. dollars) is allocated to resolving the Y2K problem or
the Millennium Bug, according to the MTR.
</P>
<P>
Under the 7MP period of 1996-2000, the estimated expenditure
for IT between 1996 and 1998 was 976.6 million ringgit (about 257
million U.S. dollars), leaving a balance of 3,033.9 million
ringgit (about 798.394 million U.S. dollars) for the remaining
period of the Plan, it said.
</P>
<P>
The MTR said efforts during the review period were focused on
expanding and upgrading telecommunications, infrastructure and
human resource skill as well as reviewing IT-related legislation
to provide the enabling environment for the development of IT and
multimedia.
</P>
<P>
For the remaining 7MP period, the government will continue to
play a pro-active role in providing a conducive environment for
the development of IT and multimedia while the private sector is
expected to increase the usage of IT as an enabling tool to
enhance productivity, efficiency and competitiveness, it said.
</P>
<P>
It said that during the remaining period, high priority will be
accorded to the development of the MSC as a catalyst for IT
development in the country and as such, efforts will focus on
creating a conducive environment for IT and multimedia companies
to operate and expand their businesses.
</P>
<P>
A total of 195 companies had been granted MSC status by the end
of December 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
As future competitiveness in the electronic economy will be
very much dependent on the availability and quality of human
resources, computer education and training programs will be
further intensified and expanded to create more IT workers, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Initially, this will involve providing 222 primary schools and
110 secondary schools with computers to enable them to conduct
computer literacy programs, it said.
</P>
<P>
The number of IT workers in Malaysia at the end of 1998 was
estimated to be about 87,000.
</P>
<P>
To promote investment in IT and multimedia education
infrastructure, MSC status will be granted to the multimedia
faculties of universities and colleges located outside the MSC to
enable these institutions to enjoy competitive telecommunications
tariff rates available in the designated area, the MTR said.
</P>
<P>
It said that to develop a conducive legal environment,
IT-related laws and regulations will be reviewed regularly to keep
pace with the rapid development in IT and multimedia technology,
and enforcement capabilities of the relevant ministries and
agencies will be strengthened to ensure the effective
implementation of IT-related laws such as the Digital Signature
Act 1997 and the Computer Crimes Act 1997.
</P>
<P>
Measures will be taken to improve the business environment,
attract new investments, accelerate the transfer of technology and
promote greater participation of local entrepreneurs in the IT
industry.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be intensified to ensure the security of on-line
transactions which include, among others, the development of
encryption tools for authentication, protection of data against
illegitimate use and development of standards for interoperability
and reliability of the network.

<HEADLINE> EDS-More Details China, U.S. Resume WTO Talks (More Details) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and U.S. negotiators
started a new round of technical talks at 10:30 a.m. here today to
resolve remaining issues on China's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Long Yongtu, chief negotiator of the Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), and Assistant U.S. Trade
Representative Robert Cassidy began small group and closed door
talks at Long's office inside the MOFTEC's office building.
</P>
<P>
Cassidy arrived here Wednesday night, just a few hours after
Premier Zhu Rongji's return from a two-week whirlwind official
visit to the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with MOFTEC, this morning's talks will
be focused on the procedural issues concerning the negotiations
which will likely last for several days.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of negotiations is part of the efforts to carry
out what Premier Zhu and U.S. President Bill Clinton agreed on
China's accession to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government voiced firm support for China's entry into
the WTO in 1999 during Zhu's visit, and the two sides have agreed
to negotiate unresolved questions concerning China's entry into
the multi-lateral trade body by the end of April in order to
ensure China's early entry.
</P>
<P>
Topics scheduled for discussion include the legal terms for
China's entry into the WTO, tariffs on industrial goods and
further opening of the nation's service sector, mainly within
finance, insurance and telecommunications sectors, Xinhua has
learned from a reliable source with MOFTEC.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that both sides are willing to resume negotiations is
a good sign," a MOFTEC spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
China's leading newspaper, the People's Daily, said in an
editorial hailing Zhu's visit to the U.S. and Canada on Thursday
that China's entry into the WTO is an "eye-catching" issue.
</P>
<P>
Important progress has been made for Sino-U.S. negotiations on
China's 13-year bid to entering into the WTO during Zhu's visit to
the U.S. earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Premier Zhu agreed that the two
sides should "intensify" negotiations for resolving remaining
issues in talks on China's accession to the WTO.

<HEADLINE> IMF Ends Review of Philippines' Economic Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- A visiting team from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded Wednesday its review
of the Philippines' economic performance for the first quarter and
agreed to keep most of the monetary and fiscal targets unchanged
until the next review, the Manila Times said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF team decided to revise the targets on the
balance of payments surplus, the current account surplus, the base
money growth and the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR),
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Other macroeconomic targets such as the gross national product
(GNP), gross domestic product (GDP), inflation rate and budget
deficit were unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The two panels agreed to keep the GNP growth rate at 1.5
percent to 3.5 percent and the GDP growth at 1 percent to 3
percent as earlier agreed with the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The average inflation rate was also kept at 8.5 percent for the
whole year.
</P>
<P>
Under a revised Letter of Intent drafted after the two-week
review, the base money would grow by 10.7 percent instead of 10.2
percent as agreed in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
Another performance criteria, the PSBR, was adjusted to 114.37
billion pesos (2.86 billion U.S. dollars) from 106.42 billion
pesos (2.66 billion dollars) due to higher deficits of the
government-owned-and-controlled corporations.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Gets NATO's Security Guarantees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan
Kostov received NATO chief's assurances for Bulgaria's security in
connection with NATO's request for access to Bulgaria's airspace.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, on a one-day visit to Brussels, is seeking
NATO's security guarantees no less than those given to Macedonia
and Albania, the Government Information Service said in a press
release on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, Prime
Minister Kostov gained NATO's agreement on a regulated NATO
aircraft access to the country's airspace, transit passage and
emergency landing, the release said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, necessary measures will be taken for the
security and protection of Bulgarian citizens, civilian and
military sites.
</P>
<P>
During Kostov's meeting with the 19 allied ambassadors, Solana
confirmed that Bulgaria's security is a direct and major concern
of the Alliance and that any challenge to Bulgaria's security will
be viewed with utmost seriousness.
</P>
<P>
Kostov voiced his country's solidarity with NATO in the
Alliance's operations against Yugoslavia and NATO's efforts to
help displaced Kosovo Albanians return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria expressed readiness to grant NATO warplanes access to
its airspace in compliance with the country's Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister explained to the allied ambassadors that
Bulgaria's road and river transport depends on Yugoslavia and that
the country will probably sustain the biggest economic loss from
the present conflict.
</P>
<P>
"We expect strong encouragement from the European Union in
overcoming the economic consequences and we view our present step
as one towards integration into NATO," Prime Minister Kostov said.
</P>
<P>
Support for NATO has been a tough decision for Bulgaria's
leadership, as the people largely resent involvement in the war.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Upset With Poor Preparation For SEA Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The National Sports Council (KONI)
of Indonesia has expressed concern over the poor training
preparation of some sports organizations competing in the coming
20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Brunei Darussalam in August.
</P>
<P>
Moch. Hindarto, an official in charge of athletes' development,
said the hockey, rowing and sepak takraw sports bodies had not yet
sent their key players to start the centralized training program
for the games.
</P>
<P>
He also said the All Indonesian Soccer Federation (PSSI) had
failed to respond to his request for consultation on its
preparation for the SEA Games.
</P>
<P>
"I regret PSSI's absence. We have sent an invitation to them
and even called up the federation's office. Why are they busy for
pre-Olympic training while ignoring the preparations for the (SEA)
games?" he was quoted by The Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hindarto did not give any further details, but called on the
sports organization to withdraw if it was not prepared to compete
in the games.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that each sports organization must start its
training program by May 7 at the latest to allow a three-month
effective training period.
</P>
<P>
The SEA Games, to be hosted by Brunei Darussalam for the first
time, will be held from August 7 to August 12 and will offer 235
gold medals in 21 sports. Indonesia will compete in 20 sports.
</P>
<P>
KONI said earlier that some 534 athletes from these sports have
been groomed for the Games. Only the top athletes are invited to
join the centralized training program here, which was originally
scheduled for early June.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Sets up Coal Industry Monitor organization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN countries will set up a
regional organization, called the ASEAN Forum on Coal (AFOC), to
protect the interests of the region's coal industry.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came from the Fourth Meeting of the Coal
Sub-Sector Network of the ASEAN Energy Cooperation (CSN-AEC) which
opened here Wednesday, according to a report of Vietnam's English
daily Vietnam News Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The AFOC is designed to strengthen bilateral and multi-lateral
cooperation on coal mining and trading among all member countries.
</P>
<P>
The AFOC aimed to strengthen institutional and policy
framework, promote clean coal technology, enhance private sector
investment, promote intra-ASEAN trade on coal and put up
environmental impact mitigation measures.
</P>
<P>
These goals were agreed by participants from Indonesia, the
Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam in a
charter on the establishment of the AFOC.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam News quoted General director of the Vietnam Coal
Corporation and Chairman of the 4th of CSN-AEC Doan Van Kien as
saying that AFOC would first help ASEAN countries understand more
about each other's conditions for tapping and selling coal.
</P>
<P>
Kien said the need to focus on and give priority to the energy
cooperation within ASEAN is based on the fact that the region
would have no oil and gas in the coming 13 years while coal would
be mined for hundreds of years later.
</P>
<P>
The AFOC also elected its permanent secretariat. The two-day
meeting will end on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Not to Close Chernobyl Without G7's Aid: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 21 (Xinhua) -- President Leonid Kuchma said here
Wednesday that Ukraine would not shut down the Chernobyl nuclear
power plant by the year 2000 if the industrialized countries
failed to grant it multi-billion-U.S.-dollar aid as promised.
</P>
<P>
Chernoybl should be closed down by 2000 in accordance with an
agreement reached in 1995 between Ukraine on the one hand and the
Council of Europe and the group of seven industrialized nations (G
7) on the other, Kuchma told reporters.
</P>
<P>
In return, the G7 promised to give Ukraine some 3.1 billion U.S.
dollars in aid for the construction of two new nuclear power
plants which will operate after the closure of Chernobyl, he said.
</P>
<P>
But the G7, which also promised to help Ukraine build a nuclear
waste storage, has so far provided the country with a mere 500
million dollars in aid.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine has repeatedly threatened to continue operating
Chernobyl beyond the year 2000 if the G7 would not keep up its
promise.
</P>
<P>
Chernobyl, 140 kilometers north of Kiev, is the site of the
world's worst nuclear power plant accident. On April 26, 1986,
explosions and a protracted fire occurred at the fourth reactor at
the nuclear power plant, leading to a widespread release of
radioactivity and the immediate deaths of dozens of people.
</P>
<P>
Authorities in Ukraine say the disaster had caused some 8,000
deaths over time and widespread contamination also occurred in
neighboring Belarus.
</P>
<P>
The fourth reactor, fully destroyed in the accident, was
covered by a concrete tomb. Among the other three reactors, the
first and second had already been closed and only the third one is
still working.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony marking the 13th anniversary of the disaster
Wednesday, Ukrainian experts said nuclear fuel inside the concrete
tomb has been under monitor and conditions there are stable.
</P>
<P>
People can not inhabit at the areas 30 kilometers around the
nuclear station within at least 100 years although "levels of
radioactivity there did not turn for better nor for worse," they
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Colombian Foreign
Minister Guillermo Fernandez de Soto rejected on Wednesday U.S.
criticism over President Pastrani's meeting with Cuban leader
Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez's remarks came after the U.S. congressman of Cuban
origin, Llena Ross-Lethinen, asked the Colombian Ambassador in
Washington Luis Alberto Moreno to explain the continuous contact
between Pastrani and Castro.
</P>
<P>
"This is an autonomous country which has no need to give
explanations over its international policies, and in addition, it
is a country completely free to meet with any foreign president in
any part of the world," said Fernandez de Soto.
</P>
<P>
The presidents from Colombia and Cuba held a meeting in Santo
Domingo last weekend, during the summit of the Association of
Caribbean States (ACS).
</P>
<P>
Pastrani visited Cuba in January and on that occasion Castro
expressed that his administration would help with the peace
dialogue between the Colombian government and the two principal
rebel groups in the country.

<HEADLINE> South China Autonomous Region Betting on Tourist Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The development of the tourist
industry in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has
brought notable changes to the lives of various ethnic minority
groups.
</P>
<P>
"Since we have been earning Hong Kong and American dollars, we
live a better life," an ethnic Zhuang sings in one of her folk
songs in the region's Baimian Village.
</P>
<P>
Long Xiulian, honored as the "Queen of Folk Songs" in the
village, now runs a restaurant where she features local flavors
and tourist souvenirs. Her business can bring her 10,000 yuan a
year.
</P>
<P>
She is not the only to become affluent by betting on offering
tourist services. People in the land-locked village, where per-
capita income averaged only 100 yuan six years ago, have all said
farewell to poverty, as the figure rose to 2,700 yuan last year.
TV sets are no longer household luxuries, and every family can
drink the tap water.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi has one tenth of all China's population living under
the poverty line, which has dropped to 42 million people,
according to the latest national figures. Tourism has become the
backbone underpinning the elimination of poverty.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, locals have developed a better sense of using
their tourist resources. For example, in Longsheng County, a
picturesque place densely populated by people of five ethnic
minority groups, villagers have begun to develop their hot spring
resources, building vacation resorts and opening tourist routes to
villages, most of which are impoverished but feature
characteristic ethnic custom.
</P>
<P>
After a few years of experience, the focus of tourism
development has been shifted from natural resources to developing
tourist products. Jingzhai Village in Longsheng earned 150,000
yuan last year from selling a special kind of souvenir -- balls
made of colored silk, which increased per-capita income by 960
yuan for the year.
</P>
<P>
The county's tourism earnings reached 23.2 million yuan last
year, doubled the figure for 1992.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region's booming beach-front attractions are
responsible for much of the increase in tourism, as three coastal
cities in Guangxi, including Beihai, Qinzhou, and Fangcheng,
received more than 3.5 million tourists from home and abroad last
year and earned a combined 800 million yuan, a year-on-year rise
of 15 percent and 10 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Beihai has spent one billion yuan to improve its tourist
facilities since 1992, half of which came from overseas investors.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Takes Measures to Maintain Stable Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has taken
a range of measures to maintain price stability and keep inflation
between 6 percent and 7 percent in the rest part of this year,
Vietnam News English daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The measures devised by the Pricing Committee include freezing
the prices of certain goods in the second quarter; more
coordination with the Finance Ministry in issuing guidelines on
principles and production cost accounting; minimizing the impact
of world market prices upon the domestic price system; and the
prevention of unpredictable price increases for a number of
essential goods.
</P>
<P>
The Pricing Committee has been coordinating with concerned
agencies to crack down on price violators and pay more attention
to land price and natural resource evaluation.
</P>
<P>
The committee said that it would also propose measures to
control exchange and interest rates for relevant ministries and
government bodies and would supervise the implementation of policy
on market price management and stability.
</P>
<P>
According to the General Department of Statistics, the price
index in the first quarter of this year increased by 2.9 percent
compared with last December.
</P>
<P>
It increased by 1.7 percent and 1.9 percent in January and
February respectively, but dropped by 0.7 percent in March.

KUALA LUMPUR, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Former Inspector-

Court here Thursday with attempting to cause injury to former
deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim while in police custody last
September.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Rahim, 56, who was brought to the courthouse here this
morning and produced before judge Hamdan Indah, was charged under
section 325 of the Penal Code, read together with section 511 of
the same code, which provides a maximum sentence of three and a
half years on conviction.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Rahim pleaded not guilty and was released without bail
pending mention of the case on May 21.
</P>
<P>
However, Abdul Rahim, who resigned as the inspector-general of
police on January 7, admitted at the Royal Commission of Inquiry
on February 28 to beating Anwar in a police lock-up when he was
provoked.
</P>
<P>
The Royal commission of Inquiry was specially set up to
investigate on Anwar's injuries while in police custody after
Attorney-General Mohtar Abdullah confirmed on January 5 that Anwar
was beaten by police after his arrest.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Commission of Inquiry earlier this month presented to
the country's Supreme Head of State Tuanku Ja'afar its report on
the inquiry, submitting the injuries sustained by Anwar resulted
from a calculated assault by Abdul Rahim and recommending action
to be taken against the police officer. The Commission's report
was made available to the public Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who was charged with corruption and sodomy, appeared in
court for the first time on September 29 last year with a black
eye and told a Sessions Court judge that the police beat him
unconscious and denied him medical attention.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was sacked from the Cabinet on September 2 last year and
was detained at the police headquarters lock-up here after he was
arrested on September 20 for allegedly leading an illegal assembly
in the federal capital.

COLOMBO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Six people were killed and over

and to grant relief.
</P>
<P>
Many roads in the capital and provinces were made impassable

In the three months ended March 31, the New York-based computer
company said, its revenue jumped 15 percent to 20.3 billion
dollars, up from 17.6 billion dollars a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Chairman and chief executive Louis Gerstner said the results
reflected the power of the IBM strategy, making business services
a key portion of the information technology industry and extending
its leadership position in each quarter.
</P>
<P>
Revenues from business services rose 19 percent to 7.6 billion
dollars while software sales rose 10 percent to 2.9 billion
dollars and hardware sales rose 17 percent to 8.6 billion dollars,
the company said.
</P>
<P>
The report was released after the New York stock market closed.
But IBM's shares ended up as investors got confirmation of its
strong earnings during the session that helped push the Down Jones
industrial average to the record close high of 10,581.42.
</P>
<P>
Among the high-profile computer companies, Microsoft also
reported Wednesday its encouraging earnings in the first quarter.
But the company warned that computer bug concerns could slow its
growth later in the year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Compaq disclosed its earnings for the first
quarter would be less than half Wall Street's estimates, leading
to the ousting of Chief Executive Eckhard Pfeiffer.

<HEADLINE> Cancer, Respiratory Illness Still China's Biggest Health Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Some 139 out of every 100,000
Chinese urbanities died of cancer, and 142 out of every 100,000
rural people died of respiratory illnesses last year, according to
a report released by the Ministry of Health (MOH) today, making
these the major causes of death in China.
</P>
<P>
Cancer has been the number one killer in cities and towns since
1996, and last year was responsible for more deaths than in 1997.
Males seem to be more susceptible to this deadly diseases than
females.
</P>
<P>
Respiratory illnesses caused fewer deaths last year than in
1997, but still remained the biggest threat to the health of rural
people.
</P>
<P>
Ten major diseases and medical problems accounted for more than
91 percent of all deaths last year. These include cerebral
hemorrhage, heart attacks, fatal injuries, poisoning, and
digestive tract problems.
</P>
<P>
More urbanites are experiencing difficulties with endocrine,
neurological, and mental disorders, while rural people still must
contend with infant illnesses, tuberculosis, and some infectious
diseases. The rural dwellers often have little or no access to
medical services, and some infectious diseases are still not under
control, posing a major health problem, according to Liu Aimin of
the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, many city dwellers with better access to
medical care are coming down with some new problems such as
nervous disorders caused by the pressures of excessive work and
competition, he says.
</P>
<P>
The MOH report said the mortality rate for Chinese urban
residents was 6.17 per thousand last year, slightly lower than
that in rural areas, and this rate among males was higher than
among females. More than 60 percent of all deaths in China last
year occurred among people aged 65 and older.

<HEADLINE> Russian FM Calls For Political Solution to Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The foreign minister made the remark here during separate
telephone conversations with British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook,
Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes Y Juan, Italian Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini and a senior official of Vatican's Foreign
Affairs department.
</P>
<P>
According to the Russian foreign ministry, Ivanov opposed all
forms of military operations in Yugoslavia, saying that NATO
should halt its air strikes against the sovereign state of
Yugoslavia as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov earlier told Spanish reporters that "Belgrade will not
accept a foreign military presence, not even a Russian one" in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In the telephone calls, the foreign minister said that any "
international military presence" in Kosovo should seek permission
from Belgrade, and urged the United Nations to play an active role
in seeking a peaceful solution to the ongoing Balkan crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian President Boris Yeltsin's envoy Viktor
Chernomyrdin has said that Russia would only act as a mediator in
solving the ongoing Yugoslavia crisis.
</P>
<P>
The current Balkan conflict has great bearing on not only
Russia but also the entire world since it is a dangerous precedent
to all countries, said the envoy.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslavia crisis has already entered a "dead-end" and
NATO's intensive bombardment could only worsen the situation
rather than provide a settlement, he said.
</P>
<P>
NATO's destructive military attacks in the region, according to
Chernomyrdin, must be halted and the safe return of Kosovo
refugees be facilitated.

<HEADLINE> Manchester United Enters European Champions Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United and Bayern
Munich advanced to the finals of the European Champions Cup on
Wednesday, with the United chasing an unprecedented English treble
of league, F.A. Cup and European Cup.
</P>
<P>
Juventus, who held Manchester United to a 1-1 draw at Old
Trafford two weeks ago, raced into a 2-0 lead after only 11
minutes with two goals from striker Filippo Inzaghi.
</P>
<P>
But United equalised with headed goals from Roy Keane (24) and
Dwight Yorke (34). The winner came six minutes from time when an
Andy Cole goal tapped in to put United into their first European
Cup final in 31 years.
</P>
<P>
After recovering from their poor start, United dominated much
of the match, hit the post twice through Yorke and Dennis Irwin,
and thoroughly deserved their first competitive win in Italy after
42 years in Europe.
</P>
<P>
In Munich a superb long-range curling shot from midfielder
Mario Basler gave Bayern their victory over Kiev.
</P>
<P>
Basler struck from just outside the penalty area in the 35th
minute with a shot that went in off the post with goalkeeper
Olexander Shovkovski powerless to stop it.
</P>
<P>
Bayern, who sealed the last of three consecutive triumphs in
the competition in 1976, were well on top for most of the match,
managing to keep Kiev's dangerous strike-force of Andriy
Shevchenko and Sergi Rebrov under control.
</P>
<P>
It will be the fourth clash between English and German clubs in
European soccer's prestige event.
</P>
<P>
United reached the final for the first time since their only
previous appearance in 1968 when they beat Benfica 4-1 at Wembley,
while Bayern are back in the final for the first time since losing
to Porto in Vienna in 1987.
</P>
<P>
The previous finals between English and teams from the then-
West Germany were in 1975 when Bayern beat Leeds United 2-0, in
1977 when Liverpool beat Borussia Moenchengladbach 3-1 and in 1982
when Aston Villa beat Bayern 1-0.
</P>
<P>
United are the first English club to reach the final since
Liverpool lost 1-0 to Juventus in 1985 in a match marred by the
Heysel Stadium disaster.
</P>
<P>
The two teams have already clashed in the European Champions
League this season drawing 2-2 in Munich on September 30 and 1-1
at Old Trafford in December.
</P>
<P>
United skipper Keane and midfielder Paul Scholes will both miss
the final after picking up their second yellow card of the
competition.

MANILA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- "Pacquiao's defeat is inevitable,"
said MiraGabriel Mira, the Mexican mandatory challenger to
Filipino champion Manny Pacquiao who will stake his World Boxing
Council flyweight crown on Saturday, April 24 at the Araneta
Coliseum of Manila.
</P>
<P>
"The only reason Pacquiao was picked to fight Thailander
Charchai Sasakul for the crown was because the promoters wanted to
keep the title in Asia. Now, I am here to get the crown and bring
it to Latin America and the Mexican people," Mira was quoted as
saying by Philippines News Agency on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sasakul was the former champion from whom Pacquiao, then ranked
No. 6, wrested the world 112-lb crown over top-rated Mira who got
the first option to fight Pacquiao in 140 days.
</P>
<P>
But Pacquiao, who attend a forum of the country's top sports
editors Tuesday together with Mira, merely shrugged off the
Mexican's diatribes which he said "has no bearing in the real
fight come this Saturday."
</P>
<P>
Efren Peralta, Mira's manager-trainer, said, "The dethronement
of the Filipino champion is inevitable. Pacquiao has been fighting
obscure opponents. Now, he is fighting a real one. Let's just wait
and see."

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Major Street Undergoing Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's Nanjing Road, one of
China's most famous shopping street, will take on a new look in
six months, with four shopping malls replacing dozens of
department stores.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guangsheng, director of the Shanghai Municipal Commercial
Commission, said here today that the restructuring is part of the
city's effort to upgrade this central downtown retail hot-spot
into a multi-purpose pedestrian street featuring cultural,
recreational, and commercial facilities.
</P>
<P>
There are too many department stores along the road, Zhang
noted, and few cultural and recreational facilities.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, only four of the top retail malls will
remain, the No.1 Department Store, Hualian, the New World and
Donghai, and the rest will become specialty shops with their own
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 teahouses, dance halls, bars and other
recreational and cultural facilities will be built along the
street.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts have paid much attention to the transformation
of Nanjing Road, and some say this is a positive response made by
China's largest commercial city to market challenges, and may
produce a chain reaction in other Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
Most commercial streets in China have long concentrated only on
shopping, and no longer satisfy the new and varied consumer needs,
analysts say.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Regrets Russia's Postponement of FM's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Foreign Ministry
Wednesday expressed regret over Russia's decision to postpone
Hungarian Foreign Minister Martonyi Janos' visit to Moscow
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
Ministry Spokesman Horvath Gabor told a press conference that
the decision was unreasonable and regrettable, adding that Hungary
would not take counter measures.
</P>
<P>
Russia Tuesday informed Hungary of its decision on the visit
originally slated for May and recalled its ambassador to Budapest
for consultation.
</P>
<P>
Although Russia explained the decision had nothing to do with
Hungary's blockage of its humanitarian aid trucks to Yugoslavia,
Hungary believed the incident was the very reason.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the incident, Horvath said Hungary was just
examining the aid according to international and national
regulations and would continue to do so in the future.
</P>
<P>
"It had nothing to do with bilateral relations," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
On April 10, Hungary refused to allow a Russian convoy of
trucks to Yugoslavia through its territory, citing some were
carrying diesel fuel and others were armored.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the convoy was held up on the border for over 40
hours. The problem was solved after emergency consultations, but
the event was believed to have shadowed the relations between
Russia and Hungary.

her false teeth, which were installed when she was only in her 30s.
</P>
<P>
The false teeth still work well and faithfully after more than
70 years in service. In turn, the centenarian takes care of her
oldest, closest and dearest friend as she cleans her false teeth
after every meal.
</P>
<P>
Eat everything and do everything at your own will and ability,
is the only "secret" you will acquire from the centenarian. Want
to know something more about her longevity? Be broadminded and
optimistic, she says.
</P>
<P>
Hu Guiqing, born in 1890, is the oldest person living in
coastal Zhejiang Province in east China. In her 20s, she left her
home on Daxie Island and crossed the sea to marry a man named
Ding, in Ningbo, the second largest city in Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
She has given birth to five daughters and three sons, and so
far she has lost two sons. The oldest of her children, a daughter,
is now 82. Currently, the 109-year-old lives with the family of
her youngest son, 66.
</P>
<P>
According to her family members, the old lady quit her decades-
long habit of drinking wine only a few years ago, for fear of a
possible hypertension.
</P>
<P>
However, she has never bothered to go on a diet, and eats
everything ranging from rice, corn, vegetables and meat to modern
health food. But fruit is her favorite food, even including the
sour, month-watering bayberry.
</P>
<P>
She love watching operas, films and TV programs. Her small,
bound feet have long made it impossible for her to walk very far,
and the old woman used to be carried to places to watch operas and
films. Now, she has to stay at home and only watch TV.
</P>
<P>
Hu has never been isolated from the outside, and local
government leaders have often visited her, especially during
festival days. Recently, a ballot box was sent to her house so
that she could exercise her legal rights and vote in the town's
elections for the local People's Congress deputies.
</P>
<P>
The 109-year-old woman has amazed many local doctors with her
good health.
</P>
<P>
During a recent medical check-ups, doctors were surprised to
see that her vital capacity is even greater than the average. "
Except for minor problems with her aging ears and eyes, the old
lady is quite healthy," the doctors say.
</P>
<P>
It seems that many of Hu's family members have shared her
longevity: her younger sister is now 99 years old.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Lingling, a month-old snub-nosed
monkey from the Diqing Plateau in southwest China's Yunnan
Province, has been receiving round-the-clock care from six doctors
in Kunming, the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
Because the mascot of the World Horticulture Exposition is a
snub-nosed monkey with the same name, veterinarians from the
Kunming Zoo have been making every effort possible to save the
rare monkey, which was brought to the hospital with serious
injuries.
</P>
<P>
One of the veterinarians, Yang Yunfei, said that it's much more
difficult to take care of the monkey than a baby not only because
it needs to be fed powdered milk regularly and played with.
</P>
<P>
It takes powered milk once every two hours and prefers boiled
water neither too hot nor too cold that is filled in an injector
without a needle. It often grabs the injector and sips water
directly.
</P>
<P>
Snub-nosed monkeys are under the highest form of state
protection. There are fewer than 1,000 of them in China.

RIO DE JENAIRO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's champions
Corinthians breezed into the quarterfinals of the Libertadores Cup
on Wednesday, beating Wilsterman of Bolivia 5-2 in Sao Paolo.
</P>
<P>
Dinei and Nene each scored two goals for the Corinthians while
Wilsterman only managed to net in two goals at the Pacaembu
stadium.
</P>
<P>
Edilson opened the scoring after the first 30 minutes, then
exchanged passes atop the box, allowing Dinei to score with ease
for a comfortable 2-0 advantage.
</P>
<P>
Nene swung in the third goal in the 73rd minute, leaving the
two-game tie virtually out of reach as the first leg was drawn 1-1.
</P>
<P>
Although Villaroel pulled a goal back when he capitalized on
goalie Nei's parry, Dinei scored his second with a simple header
in the 82nd minute.
</P>
<P>
After Cardenas slammed home the second for Wilsterman with a
swirling shot, Nene netted in his second from close range with
four minutes to go.

Lei Wenhong, head of the hospital, says that doctors have
prepared a special room equipped with a humidifier for the little
monkey to avoid further infection.
</P>
<P>
"The special treatment will last another two or three months,"
Lei said.
</P>
<P>
Lingling now weighs 930 grams compared with 630 grams when it
was brought to the hospital, and has increased its length by six
cm to 24 cm.
</P>
<P>
Monkeys like to comb each other's hair and when doctors comb
her hair, Lingling becomes quiet and makes a sound of contentment.
It sleeps for as long as 18 hours a day, but wakes up immediately
when a doctor puts it in its bed and clings to the doctors clothes.
</P>
<P>
She sleeps in a blanket decorated with pictures of Dalmatian
dogs.
</P>
<P>
The double eye-lid and grey-red lip monkey is of grey color and
there is a tuft of black hair at the tip of its human fist-large
head.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, it seems to be curious about its tail, which is as
long as its body, looking back and even putting it into the mouth
biting as if to have a taste. Feeling pain, the panic-stricken
monkey would drop the hairy tail in a flurry before it makes
another try.

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Wild animals and plants in north
China's Shanxi Province are on the increase after a few years of
local efforts to protect wildlife.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that rhesus monkeys have increased from 290 to
500 and the crossoptilon mantchuricums (wild bird), form 2,400 to
4,500. At the same time, the total forest area in the province's
four nature reserves, the Pangquangou, Luyashan, Lishan, and
Manghe, has grown by nearly 500 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi has instituted a number of nature-protection regulations
and laws, including severe punishment for illegal hunting or
selling of wild animals.
</P>
<P>
 The province has also held seminars on wildlife protection
for the past few years, with many calligraphers and painters,
contributing to the publicity campaign.
</P>
<P>
And wildlife protection has been instilled in the minds of the
local residents. Since last year people have saved nearly 5,000
sparrows (????), and 18 wild animals including the golden eagle,
owls, sika deer, vultures, and crossoptilon mantchruicums.
</P>
<P>
There are now over 2,600 species of plants and 418 species of
wild animals in the province, among which 70 are under state
protection. Moreover, three national and nine provincial nature
reserves have also been created in Shanxi.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the provincial government have announced that
they plan to expand the nature reserves to an amount equaling to
two percent of the land space of the province by the year 2010.

<HEADLINE> Half of Eligible Voters Register for Indonesia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's General Election
Commission (KPU) has registered 50 percent of the 130 million
eligible voters as the third week of voter registration began
Tuesday, KPU Chairman Rudini said.
</P>
<P>
Nine provinces had registered at least 70 percent of voters in
each of the region, the Jakarta Post Thursday quoted Rudini as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesians started registering for the June 7 general election
on April 5. The registration will end on May 4.
</P>
<P>
Rudini said at his office here Wednesday that the commission
had yet to receive data from the country's remote provinces.
</P>
<P>
There is also a delay in the West and East Sumatra provinces, as
many people there were not informed about the location of
registration offices and the registration forms were sent to wrong
destinations.
</P>
<P>
The KPU and government officials have repeatedly said the
forthcoming poll would be held on schedule despite there are some
rumors that the poll could be delayed because of the bad
preparation and the outbreak of violence in several areas in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government and the People's Consultative
Assembly decided in November last year to hold a multi-party
general election on June 7, 1999. Forty-eight political parties
out of 140 parties in the country have the qualifications to
attend the election.
</P>
<P>
In the past 32 years when former president Soeharto was in
power, only three parties -- the ruling Golkar, the United
Development Party (PPP) and the Indonesian Democratic party (PDI)
-- were allowed to contest the general election.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto stepped down on May 21 last year amid the worst
political and economic crisis in the country.

<HEADLINE> NATO Allowed to Use Czech, Slovak Airports, Land Routes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic and Slovakia on
Wednesday allowed NATO to use their airports and land routes to
intensify the ongoing air campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
After a heated debate, the Czech parliament approved
resolutions giving the green light to NATO's use of Czech airports
and roads for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic, a new member of NATO, has been supporting
the U.S.-led military alliance's air raids against Yugoslavia from
the very beginning, although it has not been directly involved in
it.
</P>
<P>
The Slovak government decided at a special meeting to allow
NATO to use its railways, roads, waterways and airports to move
troops for the military action aimed at forcing Belgrade to back
down on the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
Some ministers, however, expressed reservation on the decision.
</P>
<P>
The Slovak government decided to open its air space to NATO on
March 24 soon after  NATO started airstrikes against Yugoslavia,
triggering strong protests from opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Both Czech and Slovak public are opposed to NATO's relentless
bombing of Yugoslavia. When Czech parliamentarians were debating
on Wednesday, protesters staged a demonstration outside the
parliament building, shouting "Stop Invasion of Yugoslavia" and "
We don't want war."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a recent opinion poll showed that 65.2 percent of
the respondents were opposed to NATO's campaign against Yugoslavia
and only 8.2 percent supported it.

<HEADLINE> Manchester United Enters European Champions Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United and Bayern
Munich advanced to the finals of the European Champions Cup on
Wednesday, with the United chasing an unprecedented English treble
of league, F.A. Cup and European Cup.
</P>
<P>
Juventus, who held Manchester United to a 1-1 draw at Old
Trafford two weeks ago, raced into a 2-0 lead after only 11
minutes with two goals from striker Filippo Inzaghi.
</P>
<P>
But United equalised with headed goals from Roy Keane (24) and
Dwight Yorke (34). The winner came six minutes from time when an
Andy Cole goal tapped in to put United into their first European
Cup final in 31 years.
</P>
<P>
After recovering from their poor start, United dominated much
of the match, hit the post twice through Yorke and Dennis Irwin,
and thoroughly deserved their first competitive win in Italy after
42 years in Europe.
</P>
<P>
In Munich a superb long-range curling shot from midfielder
Mario Basler gave Bayern their victory over Kiev.
</P>
<P>
Basler struck from just outside the penalty area in the 35th
minute with a shot that went in off the post with goalkeeper
Olexander Shovkovski powerless to stop it.
</P>
<P>
Bayern, who sealed the last of three consecutive triumphs in
the competition in 1976, were well on top for most of the match,
managing to keep Kiev's dangerous strike-force of Andriy
Shevchenko and Sergi Rebrov under control.
</P>
<P>
It will be the fourth clash between English and German clubs in
European soccer's prestige event.
</P>
<P>
United reached the final for the first time since their only
previous appearance in 1968 when they beat Benfica 4-1 at Wembley,
while Bayern are back in the final for the first time since losing
to Porto in Vienna in 1987.
</P>
<P>
The previous finals between English and teams from the then-
West Germany were in 1975 when Bayern beat Leeds United 2-0, in
1977 when Liverpool beat Borussia Moenchengladbach 3-1 and in 1982
when Aston Villa beat Bayern 1-0.
</P>
<P>
United are the first English club to reach the final since
Liverpool lost 1-0 to Juventus in 1985 in a match marred by the
Heysel Stadium disaster.
</P>
<P>
The two teams have already clashed in the European Champions
League this season drawing 2-2 in Munich on September 30 and 1-1
at Old Trafford in December.
</P>
<P>
United skipper Keane and midfielder Paul Scholes will both miss
the final after picking up their second yellow card of the
competition.

<HEADLINE> Two People Arrested For Tibetan Antelope Poaching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese police uncovered two major
cases of poaching Tibetan antelope in the Hoh Xil Nature Reserve
and confiscated 190 fur pelts, 2,000 rounds of ammunition, and a
rifle in a large anti-poaching action last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The action was organized by the State Forestry Administration
and sponsored by Qinghai Province and the Xinjiang Uygur and Tibet
autonomous regions to crack down on the growing problem of
poaching and smuggling Tibetan antelopes, according to a Zhido
County official in Qinghai's Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
The reserve, which is located on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, is
home to more than 20 rare animal species like the Yak and Tibetan
antelope that are under state protection.
</P>
<P>
In the first 20 days of April, an anti-poaching group in Zhido
County arrested 7 people and confiscated 108 furs and 3,000 rounds
of ammunition. The group has entered the interior of Hoh Xil to
try to find more poachers in an action that is expected to last
until the end of April.

LONDON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Liverpool continued their falling
from grace when they lost to Leicester City 0-1 at the English
Premier League on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool, European champions in 1977, 1978, 1981 and 1984 and
until Wednesday the last English club to reach the European Cup
Final in 1985, were beaten by a 20-meter shot from one-time
Everton striker Ian Marshall in the last minute.
</P>
<P>
It was his first goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
The defeat left Gerard Houllier's side stranded in 10th place
in the premier league on 44 points after just two league wins in
their last 11 matches. All hope of a place in European soccer is
long gone.
</P>
<P>
Leicester, who completed the double over Liverpool after
beating them 1-0 at home in October, moved up from 13th to 12th.
</P>
<P>
In other action, Sheffield Wednesday drew 1-1 with F.A. Cup
finalists Newcastle United who took the lead through an Alan
Shearer penalty after 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Substitute Philip Scott, a recent 75,000 pounds (120,500 U.S.
dollars) buy from St Johnstone, scored Wednesday's equaliser seven
minutes into the second half.

with foreign counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The museum and Zhongshan University in Guangdong Province
initiated a special program in 1990 to study rare plants found in
limestone areas throughout south and southwest China. The program
has since received financial aid from the Smithsonian Institution
in the United States and the World Wildlife Foundation .
</P>
<P>
Chinese and foreign experts have completed initial
investigations and research related to vegetation and species
protection in limestone areas scattered throughout south China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and both Yunnan and Guizhou in
southwest China.

<HEADLINE> Coventry Manager Fined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Coventry manager Gordon Strachan
was fined 1,000 pounds plus costs and censured by a Football
Association disciplinary commission on Wednesday for his part in a
touchline bust-up at Stamford Bridge in January.
</P>
<P>
Strachan, together with officials and players from the Sky
Blues and Chelsea, were involved in a fracas which erupted in
front of the two dug-outs during the Premiership encounter on
January 16.
</P>
<P>
Strachan, who has a reputation for his fiery temper on the
touchline, sought a personal hearing to answer a misconduct charge
in front of the commission which was chaired by FA acting chairman
Geoff Thompson.
</P>
<P>
The former Manchester United and Leeds star was also told he
must submit a written undertaking regarding his future conduct.
</P>
<P>
Coventry striker Noel Whelan was fined 750 pounds plus costs
and warned regarding his conduct for his part in the incident.
</P>
<P>
To complete an unhappy day for Coventry, Whelan was also given
a one-match suspension plus a 1,000 pounds fine by the commission
after reaching the 11-bookings mark for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
But it was decided that Coventry's goalkeeping coach Jim Blyth
had no case to answer regarding his part in the Stamford Bridge
flare-up.
</P>
<P>
The Chelsea contingent involved in the fracas had their
misconduct charges dealt with via correspondence by the commission.
</P>
<P>
Player Mark Nicholls was fined 750 pounds and warned about his
future conduct while Chelsea kit manager Aaron Lincoln and masseur
Terry Byrne were fined 200 and 250 respectively and warned
regarding their future behaviour.
</P>
<P>
Match referee Jeff Winter also attended the two-hour hearing
and the commission studied video evidence of the incident prior to
the hearing.

<P>
LONDON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Alex Ferguson watched Manchester
United blow away Juventus to clinch a place in the Champions' Cup
final - and then hailed the victory as the best moment in his
career on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports Wednesday evening, Ferguson, who
also described the bookings to captain Roy Keane and Paul Scholes
which rule them out of the final as "tragic" for the players
involved, was a proud man as his team came back from 2-0 down to
win 3-2 in Turin.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very proud moment for me. This is the level we want to
play at," said Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
"My players were absolutely fantastic, absolutely magnificent.
</P>
<P>
"I thought the first 45 minutes was the best in my career as a
manager. It was absolutely terrific.
</P>
<P>
"We gave them a start. But I am proud of the way they recovered
and kept their composure, and I think they deserve to be there."
</P>
<P>
Keane and Scholes will be suspended for the final in Barcelona -
the one cloud for Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
The United manager added: "It's a tragedy. I don't know whether
we can appeal. But it's absolutely tragic for them to miss the
final, and I feel for them."

<HEADLINE> Italian Bank: War to Cost NATO 21 Billion U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Balkan war could cost NATO
countries 21 billion U.S. dollars if it continues until July, a
study by an Italian bank said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), one of Italy's largest banks,
said that three to four months of NATO air combat would cost at
least 6 billion dollars, the equivalent of 0.03 percent of the
combined gross domestic product (GDP) of the 19 NATO nations.
</P>
<P>
On the humanitarian side, BNL estimated that the cost of
helping a potential 2 million refugees over a 12-month period
would come to 15 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The BNL study came a day after a similar one released by the U.
S. securities firm Merrill Lynch, which put NATO's war cost at 200
million dollars a day, and an equivalent of 0.12 percent of NATO
countries' total GDP for a 100-day campaign.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Government Issues Sovereign Bond Internationally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean government on
Wednesday successfully launched into the international market its
first Sovereign Bond for 500 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
It received a quote of 175 base points on the U.S. treasury
bonds, a level much lower than that estimated by the analysts.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat said that the 175 base-point
quote, which is the lowest range that one could have hoped for,
leaves Chile in a privileged position, being lower than the bond's
interest rates from the other countries in the region and other
emerging countries with the same risk qualification as Chile.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the yield is lower than that of the
bonds of important Chilean companies, such as Endesa and Enersis.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the demand from foreign investors for the
bond was greater than the total amount on offer.

<HEADLINE> Fowler Warned by Houllier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League soccer club
Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier has dropped a huge hint to
troubled striker Robbie Fowler about his Anfield future.
</P>
<P>
The striker has been ruled out of England's friendly with
Hungary next week after having his nose broken during a fracas in
the early hours of Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
He is also banned for the remainder of Liverpool's domestic
season after his clash with Chelsea's Graeme Le Saux and his
controversial goal celebration against Everton.
</P>
<P>
"The coming weeks will be important for him and his career,"
warned Houllier, who wants Fowler to "draw lessons" from the
series of problems.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman said Fowler will start next season "with a clean
sheet", but he made clear that further controversy will not endear
the Liverpool-born player to him.
</P>
<P>
"Being a top player comes with some duties and responsibilities,
and he has to live with that.
</P>
<P>
"He's a Liverpool player, he's a Liverpool boy. He's a good lad
but he's made some mistakes. He's acknowledged that and he's been
punished for that."
</P>
<P>
The news that Fowler will not be able to play for England next
week is another setback for the striker, who has scored 18 goals
since coming back from a serious knee injury in September.
</P>
<P>
He could have started in Budapest in the absence of injured
team-mate Michael Owen and Blackburn's Chris Sutton.
</P>
<P>
But Houllier said this was out of the question: "He will go for
an operation this Friday to have his nose re-set.
</P>
<P>
"It will take another two or three days before he can start
running, which rules him out of the national team game.
</P>
<P>
"It's a blow for everybody. It's a blow for him, it's a blow
for the club, it's a blow for the national team."
</P>
<P>
England coach Kevin Keegan confirmed: "Robbie would have been
selected on Thursday. But he has an operation on Friday and he
won't be fit. It would have given him a boost just when he needed
it.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes in life you get a blow, and then something else
happens - and just when you think it can't get any worse something
else happens again.
</P>
<P>
"When you pick the 22 best players in England you should have
him in, and I would have him in but for the fact that he's injured
and he's not even an option.
</P>
<P>
"But Robbie is young and he has got plenty more opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't rule him out of other internationals and it is an
incentive for Robbie to keep himself fit. It's a fantastic
motivation for him," he added.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Develop Township Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Developing township enterprises
is an important strategy and a long-term, fundamental policy of
China, said one senior official with the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Yongtao, director of the ministry's Township Enterprises
Management Bureau, said at a symposium in Beijing on Wednesday
that the good performance of township firms has fueled rural
economic growth and boosted growth of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Added value output of China's township enterprises in the first
quarter hit 511.9 billion yuan (61.67 billion U.S. dollars),
surging 14.7 percent year on year, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Township firms grew by 17.3 percent last year, contributing
about three percentage points to the country's 7.8 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
However, the reform and development of China's township
enterprises have entered a critical stage, Jiang was quoted by
China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
Exports by township firms only edged up by 2.5 percent in 1998
and more than 15 percent of business were running at a loss as a
result of the sluggish market and the impact of the Asian
financial crisis, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
In the face of the difficulties, township firms should develop
more in high-tech and environmental friendly industries to find
their way out, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also urged the firms to upgrade substandard equipment and
train or employ more qualified people.

the eyes and sent her to the hospital with a broken nose.
</P>
<P>
Postlethwait said she still has headaches and problems with her
concentration, and hasn't worked since the accident. She was a

<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Guilin, a popular tourism city in
south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, attracted some 89,
600 overseas tourists during the first three months of the year,
up 39.13 percent on last year's period.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the Guilin Tourism Bureau show the city
hosted 1.667 million domestic and overseas tourists during the
period, up 8.57 percent, with tourism earnings rising 12.78
percent to 620 million yuan (74.7 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The bulk of foreign tourists came from Indonesia, the Republic

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- China is determined to reduce the
damage caused by geological disasters by 50 percent by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Li Lierong, a senior official in charge of the geological
environment with the Ministry of Land Resources said that
comprehensive legal and supervisory systems on geological
disaster prevention and control should be set up to curb the man-
induced geological disasters.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily reported that the danger of geological
disasters in major economic development zones will also be
assessed for adoption of disaster prevention measures.
</P>
<P>
A nationwide survey will be completed in the next two years to
determine areas susceptible to geological disasters.
</P>
<P>
The official said a risk assessment mechanism will be
implemented nationwide between 2001 and 2005 to prevent
construction projects causing geological disasters as landslides.
He added that local officials and residents in more than 1,000
counties and cities susceptible to geological disasters will
receive training in handling geological disasters so that a public
monitoring and prevention system can be set up.
</P>
<P>
Comprehensive monitoring systems will be set up in major cities,
economic zones and construction projects areas.

<HEADLINE> Japan Beats Uruguay to Enter WYC Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Japan, a big surprise in the
Nigeria World Youth Championship, made yet another surprise
Wednesday after booking its first ticket to the WYC final with a 2-
1 win over Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
Lagos saw the Japanese reach their first-ever FIFA Final with
class and composure.
</P>
<P>
In a fascinating contrast between the Japanese cultivated close-
passing style and the Urguayans' more rigorously physical approach,
the Asians' first lead lasted barely a minute but they restored it
by half time.
</P>
<P>
With captain Ono prompting things intelligently in midfield,
Japan resisted the Uruguayan fight back after the interval in a
match that grew in intensity as the minutes ticked away. Uruguay
came close - but so did Japan - and the South Americans failed to
reach a second consecutive World Youth Final.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese entered into the 10th world youth football
tournament with a high expectation after their senior team gained
their first qualification for the senior world cup in France last
year.
</P>
<P>
The Asian team seams to have come to Nigeria to bring the world
a message of a success story in a continent long regarded as "
marginalized" in the galloping football development in the world.
</P>
<P>
The two-time champions Portugal were the first to taste a shock
from Japanese boys.
</P>
<P>
The Mexicans, who had ousted Argentina, the defending champions,
followed Portugal's footsteps with a 0-2 failure. While the
Uruguayans, with a 1-2 loss, helped send the Japanese to their
first WYC final.

<HEADLINE> Davis Ousted in Snooker Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Steve Davis' dream of a record-
breaking seventh World Snooker Championship title was shattered
after he was beaten 10-9 by Joe Perry after fighting back from 7-2
behind in a sensational match in Sheffield, England on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 41-year-old, the oldest competitor at The Crucible this
year, had staged a miraculous recovery against his Cambridgeshire
rival after looking dead and buried.
</P>
<P>
The veteran began the morning seemingly with little hope as he
faced a 7-2 deficit following Tuesday's disastrous first session.
</P>
<P>
But Davis was soon in command of the penultimate session as 23-
year-old Perry suddenly suffered an attack of stage fright.
</P>
<P>
Davis, 400-1 with bookmakers William Hill for the title prior
to the start of play, began his comeback with breaks of 35 and 43
to make it 7-3.
</P>
<P>
A run of 51 enabled him to reduce the arrears to three and
Perry scored only four points in frame 12 as Davis made further in-
roads into the deficit.
</P>
<P>
Perry, one of eight newcomers to The Crucible this year, had a
chance to stop the rot but it proved an unlucky 13th frame as
Davis's break of 64 - his highest of the contest so far - made it
7-6 with six frames to play.
</P>
<P>
Davis clawed his way back to 9-9 and led the final frame by 52
points only to miss a relatively easy blue.
</P>
<P>
The youngster, who had missed a succession of easy pots
throughout the day, then staged a remarkable recovery by clearing
up the remaining.
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old Londoner lost the opening frame without scoring
a point but won the next three with breaks of 42, 35 and 94 to put
himself in the driving seat in the match against Alan MacManus.
</P>
<P>
White, also fighting for top 16 status after two years outside
the elite group of professionals, was left needing five of the
final 10 frames to reach round two in a match which concludes
tonight.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Stephen Hendry is through to the second round after
defeating Paul Hunter 10-8.
</P>
<P>
The Scot made hard work of his victory against the Yorkshireman
who led 8-7 as Hendry struggled to break into his stride - his
highest break being just 44.
</P>
<P>
But just as Hunter began to sense victory, Hendry found his
form and clinched a 10-8 victory with a break of 93 in the final
frame.

<HEADLINE> Munich Move into Champions League Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Mario Basler, who was declared out
of form and left behind for the first leg, lifted Bayern Munich
Wednesday night into their first European Champions League final
in 12 years and their sixth overall in the competition.
</P>
<P>
Basler netted Munich's 1-0 winner over Dynamo Kiev 35 minutes
into the first half with a sensational curling effort, which gave
the Germans an aggregate 4-3 victory after a 3-3 draw in Ukraine a
fortnight ago.
</P>
<P>
Kiev dominated in the early stages, but paid dearly for wasting
some first-rate chances en route to the eventual defeat in front
of a sellout 59,000-strong Olympic stadium crowd.
</P>
<P>
In the May 26 final in Barcelona, Bayern will run into
Manchester United for the third time in the competition after the
English advanced on away-goals over three-times finalists Juventus
in the other semifinal. Their meetings in the round robin stage
last fall ended in two stalements, 2-2 and 1-1.
</P>
<P>
Manchester have never lost a European final, winning the
Champions Cup in 1968 and Cup Winners' Cup in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Munich, by contrast are in their eighth continental decider and
have a Champions League hat trick from 1974-1976 before losing in
1982 and 1987 to Aston Villa and Porto respectively.
</P>
<P>
By making it to Barcelona, Munich remain in the hunt for a
title treble. They are also in the German Cup final and have a
runaway 10-point Bundesliga lead. Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld
will be in his second Champions' final after leading Borussia
Dortmund to the 1997 title - in Munich and over Juventus.
</P>
<P>
However, at first it seemed as if the Germans would be
overpowered like for most parts of the first meeting April 7 in
Ukraine, where Bayern barely fought back from 3-1 down with two
late goals.
</P>
<P>
Luckily Oliver Kahn was back in goal after a one-week break due
to a toe injury, as the German international heroically saved
first-rate chances from Alexander Khatskevich long-range blast (1
st), Valentin Bielkevich's solo (6th) and another header from
Khatskevich (12th).
</P>
<P>
Munich finally improved after 20 minutes and Basler fired
inches wide from 18m in the 25th.
</P>
<P>
However, the controversial Basler, who has been subject of
transfer rumours especially after not being nominated for the
first leg by coach Ottmar Hitzfeld, then had his moment of glory
10 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Basler received a pass on the right wing, slalomed past two
defenders, and then sent a pinpoint left-footed curler from just
inside the right edge of the area high into the goal, off the far
left post as goalkeeper Alexander Shovkovski leaped in vian.
</P>
<P>
Munich were seemingly still celebrating their goal when
Bielkevich found Sergei Rebrov, but Kahn was on his guard a fourth
time.
</P>
<P>
It turned out to be Kiev's last serious challenge, although
Champions League top scorer Andrei Shevchenko had his only chance
in the 81st, because led by the inspired Basler, Bayern were in
full command in the second half.
</P>
<P>
They could have easily increased the lead had not Alexander
Zickler failed in the 52nd and 57th and Carsten Jancker aimed high
in the 66th on an artistic shot with his back towards the goal.

<HEADLINE> NTL Drops Bid for Newcastle United </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 21 (xinhua) -- The cable television group NTL has
abandoned its plans to buy Newcastle United Football Club after
the British government blocked BSkyB's takeover deal of the
Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
The group said on Wednesday it reached the decision after the
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, Stephen Byers, blocked
BSkyB's bid for Manchester United and referred the proposed NTL-
Newcastle deal to the Competition Commission.
</P>
<P>
NTL chief executive Barclay Knapp said: "We are clearly
disappointed by the circumstances that have led us to this
decision. We will assess other opportunities in football as and
when they arise," he added.
</P>
<P>
NTL raised the prospect of a takeover bid for Newcastle Utd
last December when it bought a 6.3% stake in the club.
</P>
<P>
At the time it said it was considering a full takeover but
would wait until the inquiry into BSkyB's bid for Manchester
United as it plans to the same competition authorities for an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Shares in Newcastle fell 7.5p to 71p on NTL's castle at 111.7p
a share, which valued the company at 160m.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman said there were no immediate plans to selling
subscribers to its Premium network.
</P>
<P>
At the start of this month, Newcastle reported interim results
showing that falling revenues from television deals had helped
reduce profits.
</P>
<P>
Pre-tax profits for the six months to 31 January were 5.6
million pounds, compared with 7.2 million pounds the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle Utd's television income fell to 4.6 million pounds -
down from 7 million pounds - after the club failed to progress in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Profits were also hit by poor sales of merchandise, notably its
replica shirts.

LONDON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Stephen Hendry kept alive his
hopes for a record seventh world snooker title while fellow-six
time winner Steve Davis and Jimmy White both were ousted in the
first round at the World Snooker Championships in Sheffield,
England on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hendry saw off a determined challenge from Paul Hunter.
</P>
<P>
The Scot led 5-4 at the resumption of play but Hunter, last
year's Regal Welsh champion, battled back to lead 7-6 and 8-7.
</P>
<P>
However, Hunter's giant-killing bid was brought to an end when
Hendry produced breaks of 68 and 93 to seal a 10-8 victory.
</P>
<P>
Alan McManus ended White's title dream for another year with a
10-7 victory over the popular Londoner.
</P>
<P>
White led 3-1 and 5-4 in the first session, but McManus
levelled the scores in the first frame of the second and never
looked back, taking six out of eight frames to book his place in
the second round.
</P>
<P>
The shock of the day came when six-times world champion Davis
suffered a first round exit at the hands of Joe Perry.
</P>
<P>
Perry, with a 7-2 overnight lead, saw Davis mount a stirring
comeback in the final session, levelling the match at 9-9 to set
up a tense finish.
</P>
<P>
But after trailing 52-0 in the deciding frame, Perry produced a
55 clearance to seal a memorable victory on his Crucible debut.
</P>
<P>
Number three seed Ronnie O'Sullivan is firmly in control in his
opening round match against Ireland's Leo Fernandez, establishing
a comfortable 7-2 overnight lead, and England's Stephen Lee leads
Scot John Lardner by the same score.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar Chief Justice
Wednesday urged the business community to take appropriate steps
to solve the Y2K problem so as to avoid legal accusations, a
report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a group of executives at a Y2K workshop, Hamid
Mahamoud Hamid, said that businessmen could be personally liable
for any losses caused by failure in taking actions against the
millennium bug within their organizations.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying that one is legally responsible if the
computer system of another organization fails to work due to
linkage with his system or if one sells computers which are not
Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
Hamid asked the executives from both public and private sectors
to keep an accurate record of how their enterprises fight the Y2K
bug in case of future investigations.
</P>
<P>
The chief justice said as the millenium bug is a foreseeable
event, one cannot avoid taking up obligations and should be aware
of government requirements that apply to goods supplies and
services.
</P>
<P>
Hamid also asked the buyers of new electronic systems to
procure those with explicitly guaranteed Y2K date rollover,
including the leap year date change.
</P>
<P>
For customers who have bought computer systems and are fearing
for their Y2K compliance, he suggested that they seek solutions
through both business and legal approaches.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is the second one in Zanzibar on Y2K problem,
following the first one on Tuesday which was attended by ministers
and principal secretaries and was chaired by the Speaker of the
Zanzibar House of Representatives, Pandu Ameir Kificho.
</P>
<P>
Both workshops were organized by the Zanzibar government in
collaboration with the Tanzanian National Y2K Central
Co-ordination Office.

<P>
LUANDA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- An Angolan government official has
urged the international community to help the 150,000 refugees in
Angola's central city of Kuito.
</P>
<P>
Residential representative of the Ministry of Social Assistance
and Reintegration, Isabel Afonso said in Kuito Wednesday that the
refugees, who have been besieged there by the rebel troops of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), are
in dire conditions.
</P>
<P>
Access to the outside world has been cut and Kuito has almost
run out of food stocks, Afonso said, adding that some of the
refugees are dying from hunger or diseases.
</P>
<P>
Malnutrition is spreading among the refugees because even one
meal could not be guaranteed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there are not enough tents for them and some refugees
have to shelter themselves in the ruins of the destroyed houses.
</P>
<P>
Afonso noted that temperature has dropped markedly because of
rains in the central plateau and the refugees with scanty clothes
would have to live in a cold winter.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that four or five refugees die each day in the
camps.
</P>
<P>
Besides hunger, the bad sanitation in the refugee camps also
contributed to the spread of various diseases.

<HEADLINE> WHO To Support Health Development In Africa: WHO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Director-General of the
World Health Organization (WHO) Gro Harlem Brundtland Wednesday
said Africa is a key priority for WHO and her organization will
make most efforts to support health development in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The efforts include reducing and preventing malaria, HIV/AIDS
and maternal mortality, she said.
</P>
<P>
She told reporters after meeting Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe that people should change their sexual behavior which was
the main cause of the spread of HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"The fight against the diseases ravaging Africa can succeed
when we build partnerships, strengthen health sectors and
concentrate resources on early action where people live," she
said.
</P>
<P>
She arrived here this morning for a one-day visit to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, she said during this African visit she has
chosen to focus on three major issues including malaria, AIDS and
maternal health.
</P>
<P>
"Malaria takes a daunting human toll and represents a roadblock
to development. Africa carries 80 percent of the malaria burden,"
she said, adding, "Roll Back Malaria has the ambition to cut by
half the number of deaths from malaria within a decade through
better access of all people in malaria-affected areas to a range
of effective interventions."
</P>
<P>
"The HIV/AIDS epidemic represents an unprecedented crisis for
the continent. More than 20 million Africans are infected with
HIV today. Over two million died of AIDS in 1998, including
nearly half a million children. Four million new HIV infection
occurred in Africa last year," she said.
</P>
<P>
If the U.N. organizations, governments, NGO communities, and
donors act now, together, and effectively divide the tasks
according to WHO comparative advantages then by the year 2005 we
may see in Africa that several millions of HIV infections will
have been averted and that incidence in 15-24 age group can be
reduced by 25 percent in the 25 most affected countries, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said every few minutes an African woman dies unnecessarily
from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth. The lifetime
risk of suffering a maternal death is as high as one in 16 in some
African countries compared with one in 4,000 in developed
countries.
</P>

dollars for health care projects to be carried out in the state
between 1988 and 2002.

HARARE, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's tobacco selling season
got off Wednesday to a slow start in Harare, capital of the
southern African country, with prices described by growers as
disappointing.

The prices at the two tobacco auction floors, the Tobacco Sales

TSF Managing Director Pat Deventish said the prices were better
than most farmers had predicted using the value of the Zimbabwean
dollar.

Zimbabwe is one of the main tobacco sale markets in the world.

<HEADLINE> WHO To Support Health Development In Africa: WHO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Director-General of the
World Health Organization (WHO) Gro Harlem Brundtland Wednesday
said Africa is a key priority for WHO and her organization will
make most efforts to support health development in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The efforts include reducing and preventing malaria, HIV/AIDS
and maternal mortality, she said.
</P>
<P>
She told reporters after meeting Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe that people should change their sexual behavior which was
the main cause of the spread of HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"The fight against the diseases ravaging Africa can succeed
when we build partnerships, strengthen health sectors and
concentrate resources on early action where people live," she
said.
</P>
<P>
She arrived here this morning for a one-day visit to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, she said during this African visit she has
chosen to focus on three major issues including malaria, AIDS and
maternal health.
</P>
<P>
"Malaria takes a daunting human toll and represents a roadblock
to development. Africa carries 80 percent of the malaria burden,"
she said, adding, "Roll Back Malaria has the ambition to cut by
half the number of deaths from malaria within a decade through
better access of all people in malaria-affected areas to a range
of effective interventions."
</P>
<P>
"The HIV/AIDS epidemic represents an unprecedented crisis for
the continent. More than 20 million Africans are infected with
HIV today. Over two million died of AIDS in 1998, including
nearly half a million children. Four million new HIV infection
occurred in Africa last year," she said.
</P>
<P>
If the U.N. organizations, governments, NGO communities, and
donors act now, together, and effectively divide the tasks
according to WHO comparative advantages then by the year 2005 we
may see in Africa that several millions of HIV infections will
have been averted and that incidence in 15-24 age group can be
reduced by 25 percent in the 25 most affected countries, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said every few minutes an African woman dies unnecessarily
from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth. The lifetime
risk of suffering a maternal death is as high as one in 16 in some
African countries compared with one in 4,000 in developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
WHO's aim is to reduce pregnancy-related mortality and
morbidity by 50 percent of 1990 levels by 2005, she said.
</P>
<P>
She appealed to rich countries to make a significant
contribution to meeting the crucial challenges to health
development in the African region.

<P>
LUANDA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- An Angolan government official has
urged the international community to help the 150,000 refugees in
Angola's central city of Kuito.
</P>
<P>
Residential representative of the Ministry of Social Assistance
and Reintegration, Isabel Afonso said in Kuito Wednesday that the
refugees, who have been besieged there by the rebel troops of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), are
in dire conditions.
</P>
<P>
Access to the outside world has been cut and Kuito has almost
run out of food stocks, Afonso said, adding that some of the
refugees are dying from hunger or diseases.
</P>
<P>
Malnutrition is spreading among the refugees because even one
meal could not be guaranteed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there are not enough tents for them and some refugees
have to shelter themselves in the ruins of the destroyed houses.
</P>
<P>
Afonso noted that temperature has dropped markedly because of
rains in the central plateau and the refugees with scanty clothes
would have to live in a cold winter.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that four or five refugees die each day in the
camps.
</P>
<P>
Besides hunger, the bad sanitation in the refugee camps also
contributed to the spread of various diseases.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar Chief Justice
Wednesday urged the business community to take appropriate steps
to solve the Y2K problem so as to avoid legal accusations, a
report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a group of executives at a Y2K workshop, Hamid
Mahamoud Hamid, said that businessmen could be personally liable
for any losses caused by failure in taking actions against the
millennium bug within their organizations.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying that one is legally responsible if the
computer system of another organization fails to work due to
linkage with his system or if one sells computers which are not
Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
Hamid asked the executives from both public and private sectors
to keep an accurate record of how their enterprises fight the Y2K
bug in case of future investigations.
</P>
<P>
The chief justice said as the millenium bug is a foreseeable
event, one cannot avoid taking up obligations and should be aware
of government requirements that apply to goods supplies and
services.
</P>
<P>
Hamid also asked the buyers of new electronic systems to
procure those with explicitly guaranteed Y2K date rollover,
including the leap year date change.
</P>
<P>
For customers who have bought computer systems and are fearing
for their Y2K compliance, he suggested that they seek solutions
through both business and legal approaches.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is the second one in Zanzibar on Y2K problem,
following the first one on Tuesday which was attended by ministers
and principal secretaries and was chaired by the Speaker of the
Zanzibar House of Representatives, Pandu Ameir Kificho.
</P>
<P>
Both workshops were organized by the Zanzibar government in
collaboration with the Tanzanian National Y2K Central
Co-ordination Office.

BONN April 21 (Xinhua)--The German government, which holds 72
per cent shares of the Deutsche Telekom, will not intervene the
company's plan to merge with Telecom Italia, Bonn officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, Bonn is not willing to renounce its voting rights in
the telecommunications giant, and is not considering selling its
stake in the company in this year, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The German Finance Ministry has sent the information to this
effect to Telecom Italia's supervisory board, which issued a
statement on Tuesday saying the merger would hinge on whether the
German government would renounce its controlling stake in Deutsche
Telekom.
</P>
<P>
The disputes inside the supervisory board had forced the
Italian side to cancell a joint press conference on the fusion,
which had been scheduled for Tuesday in London.
</P>
<P>
It comes at a moment when the supervisory board of Telecom
Italia was meeting to consider next moves in the merger, which
would create the world's second largest telecommunications group
with a yearly turnover of about 64 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> EU Stresses Economic Ties With Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)'s
executive body said here Wednesday that it has reviewed recent
developments of EU-Japan relations, advocating intensified
discussions for a new round of multilateral trade talks in WTO, an
annual ministerial meeting on deregulation and a strengthened
bilateral business dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission emphasized the ideas by adopting a
working paper "which argues for deeper and broader relations
between the EU and Japan". Commenting on the working paper, which
requested by the 15 EU member states, acting vice president of the
commission Sir Leon Brittan said EU has settled a number of
disputes and has been able to build a wider partnership.
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of the euro, and its economic and political
impact on Japan, presents opportunities to build an even stronger
relationship. To do this we will need to develop our political
relations, strengthen bilateral trade and investment ties, and
work together in the WTO to launch the New Round," Mr. Brittan
said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to multilateral trade issues, the working paper
said EU-Japan cooperation will become increasingly important in
the run up to the WTO ministeral meeting in Seattle in November
this year.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive arm has proposed the establishment of an
annual ministeral review on deregulation to assess progress over
the previous year, monitor implementation of measures already
adopted, and set out an agenda of new measures.
</P>
<P>
The paper also supports the "reinvigoration of the EU-Japan
business dialogue to encourage high value business input on trade
and investment issues into the EU-Japan policy process", the
European Commission said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The working paper sets out a focused agenda of actions in the
political, economic and cooperation spheres, the commission said.

<HEADLINE> Camdessus: World Economic Climate Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Managing Director of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) Michel Camdessus said here
Wednesday that the world's economic climate is better.
</P>
<P>
"We have come a long way since I last appeared in October,"
Camdessus said at a press conference in advance of the annual
spring meetings of the IMF and the World Bank. "The climate is
distinctly better."
</P>
<P>
The last IMF meetings six months ago were dominated by massive
financial problems in Brazil and pessimism over the financial
crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The IMF Head said capital flows were starting to recover and
the IMF had probably been too pessimistic in its latest forecasts
for Brazil -- a projection that output would contract by 3.8
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
However, Camdessus also warned policy makers against
complacency as an economic recovery gets slowly under way.
</P>
<P>
Japan's outlook was uncertain and big borrower Russia remained
the fund's biggest problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on Europe to make efforts to contribute to the
recovery of world economy.
</P>
<P>
"The United States, which has acted as the locomotive for the
world for so long, needs to cool down and at this time Japan is
weak and the Asian economies are just beginning their recoveries,
so the role of Europe is central," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said a new lending deal with Russia was possible soon, but
that Russia -- the fund's biggest borrower -- was also its biggest
problem.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that it is still possible for us to agree with them
soon," he said. "The next few days will probably bring good
news."

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday called for American people to consider what they might
do to avoid future tragedies following a bloody campus shooting.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is important that we remember that we must come
together and pray together but also commit to act together," said
Clinton, who prayed for the victims of the massacre.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who canceled a political trip to Texas Wednesday, led
a moment of silent prayer for "those who lost their lives, for
those who were wounded, for their families and those who love them
and care for their community."
</P>
<P>
Authorities said 15 people, including the two teenage gunmen,
were killed in the shooting at Comubine High School in the suburb
of Denver, Capital of Colorado State. At least 20 others were
critically injured.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that while "all of us are struggling to understand
exactly what happened and why," "it is important to "focus on what
we are going to do."
</P>
<P>
Mobilizing support for the victims and their families, Clinton
said,"perhaps the most important thing all of us can do right now
is to reach out to each other and to families and their young
children."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Actions against Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday called for American people to consider what they might
do to avoid future tragedies following a bloody campus shooting.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is important that we remember that we must come
together and pray together but also commit to act together," said
Clinton, who prayed for the victims of the massacre.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who canceled a political trip to Texas Wednesday, led
a moment of silent prayer for "those who lost their lives, for
those who were wounded, for their families and those who love them
and care for their community."
</P>
<P>
Authorities said 15 people, including the two teenage gunmen,
were killed in the shooting at Comubine High School in the suburb
of Denver, Capital of Colorado State. At least 20 others were
critically injured.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that while "all of us are struggling to understand
exactly what happened and why," "it is important to "focus on what
we are going to do."
</P>
<P>
Mobilizing support for the victims and their families, Clinton
said,"perhaps the most important thing all of us can do right now
is to reach out to each other and to families and their young
children."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, addressing the tragedy for the second time, said
children all over America need to be reassured of their safety.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Firms Warned Against Non-Y2k Compliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar Chief Justice
Wednesday urged the business community to take appropriate steps
to solve the Y2K problem so as to avoid legal accusations, a
report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a group of executives at a Y2K workshop, Hamid
Mahamoud Hamid, said that businessmen could be personally liable
for any losses caused by failure in taking actions against the
millennium bug within their organizations.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying that one is legally responsible if the
computer system of another organization fails to work due to
linkage with his system or if one sells computers which are not
Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
Hamid asked the executives from both public and private sectors
to keep an accurate record of how their enterprises fight the Y2K
bug in case of future investigations.
</P>
<P>
The chief justice said as the millenium bug is a foreseeable
event, one cannot avoid taking up obligations and should be aware
of government requirements that apply to goods supplies and
services.
</P>
<P>
Hamid also asked the buyers of new electronic systems to
procure those with explicitly guaranteed Y2K date rollover,
including the leap year date change.
</P>
<P>
For customers who have bought computer systems and are fearing
for their Y2K compliance, he suggested that they seek solutions
through both business and legal approaches.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is the second one in Zanzibar on Y2K problem,
following the first one on Tuesday which was attended by ministers
and principal secretaries and was chaired by the Speaker of the
Zanzibar House of Representatives, Pandu Ameir Kificho.
</P>
<P>
Both workshops were organized by the Zanzibar government in
collaboration with the Tanzanian National Y2K Central
Co-ordination Office.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Community Urged to Help Refugees in Central </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- An Angolan government official has
urged the international community to help the 150,000 refugees in
Angola's central city of Kuito.
</P>
<P>
Residential representative of the Ministry of Social Assistance
and Reintegration, Isabel Afonso said in Kuito Wednesday that the
refugees, who have been besieged there by the rebel troops of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), are
in dire conditions.
</P>
<P>
Access to the outside world has been cut and Kuito has almost
run out of food stocks, Afonso said, adding that some of the
refugees are dying from hunger or diseases.
</P>
<P>
Malnutrition is spreading among the refugees because even one
meal could not be guaranteed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there are not enough tents for them and some refugees
have to shelter themselves in the ruins of the destroyed houses.
</P>
<P>
Afonso noted that temperature has dropped markedly because of
rains in the central plateau and the refugees with scanty clothes
would have to live in a cold winter.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that four or five refugees die each day in the
camps.
</P>
<P>
Besides hunger, the bad sanitation in the refugee camps also
contributed to the spread of various diseases.

<HEADLINE> WHO To Support Health Development In Africa: WHO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Director-General of the
World Health Organization (WHO) Gro Harlem Brundtland Wednesday
said Africa is a key priority for WHO and her organization will
make most efforts to support health development in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The efforts include reducing and preventing malaria, HIV/AIDS
and maternal mortality, she said.
</P>
<P>
She told reporters after meeting Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe that people should change their sexual behavior which was
the main cause of the spread of HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"The fight against the diseases ravaging Africa can succeed
when we build partnerships, strengthen health sectors and
concentrate resources on early action where people live," she
said.
</P>
<P>
She arrived here this morning for a one-day visit to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, she said during this African visit she has
chosen to focus on three major issues including malaria, AIDS and
maternal health.
</P>
<P>
"Malaria takes a daunting human toll and represents a roadblock
to development. Africa carries 80 percent of the malaria burden,"
she said, adding, "Roll Back Malaria has the ambition to cut by
half the number of deaths from malaria within a decade through
better access of all people in malaria-affected areas to a range
of effective interventions."
</P>
<P>
"The HIV/AIDS epidemic represents an unprecedented crisis for
the continent. More than 20 million Africans are infected with
HIV today. Over two million died of AIDS in 1998, including
nearly half a million children. Four million new HIV infection
occurred in Africa last year," she said.
</P>
<P>
If the U.N. organizations, governments, NGO communities, and
donors act now, together, and effectively divide the tasks
according to WHO comparative advantages then by the year 2005 we
may see in Africa that several millions of HIV infections will
have been averted and that incidence in 15-24 age group can be
reduced by 25 percent in the 25 most affected countries, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said every few minutes an African woman dies unnecessarily
from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth. The lifetime
risk of suffering a maternal death is as high as one in 16 in some
African countries compared with one in 4,000 in developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
WHO's aim is to reduce pregnancy-related mortality and
morbidity by 50 percent of 1990 levels by 2005, she said.
</P>
<P>
She appealed to rich countries to make a significant
contribution to meeting the crucial challenges to health
development in the African region.

<HEADLINE> Health Projects Help Raise Service Coverage in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's Harari State
announced Wednesday that health service coverage in the eastern
state has almost doubled over the last four years.
</P>
<P>
The health bureau of the Harari state said that the health
service coverage has now increased to 60 percent from 37 percent
four years ago, the Ethiopian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The bureau attributed the rise in the coverage to the
construction of various health facilities during the past four
years.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the World Bank has granted 12.6 million U.S.
dollars for health care projects to be carried out in the state
between 1988 and 2002.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian Ministry of Health, various health
projects worth 633 million dollars are being carried out across
the Horn of Africa country this year in order to increase health
service coverages in various states of the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Amhara state said Wednesday that various health
institutions are being built in the northern state at a cost of
4.8 million dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
About 400,000 of the 15 million people in the state will
benefit from the health projects.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Tobacco Sales Slow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's tobacco selling season
got off Wednesday to a slow start in Harare, capital of the
southern African country, with prices described by growers as
disappointing.
</P>
<P>
The prices at the two tobacco auction floors, the Tobacco Sales
Floor Limited (TSF) and the Burley Marketing Zimbabwe (BMZ), were
below anticipation of growers in U.S. dollar terms.
</P>
<P>
At TSF, the average price at the close of trading was 123.05
U.S. cents per kilogram compared with last year's 123.62 U.S.
cents per kg.
</P>
<P>
The average price at BMZ was 121 U.S. cents per kg as compared
to last year's 165 U.S. cents per kg.
</P>
<P>
TSF Managing Director Pat Deventish said the prices were better
than most farmers had predicted using the value of the Zimbabwean
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is one of the main tobacco sale markets in the world.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco is the biggest foreign currency earner for the southern
African country. The crop for the 1999 season was about 186,000
tons with a value of about 550 million U.S. dollars.

JOHANNESBURG, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Swaziland Electricity
Board is planning to cut ties with South African power supplier,
ESCOM, and to import electricity from Mozambique instead, Southern
African Broadcasting Association reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The move is scheduled to be taken once Swaziland's 400-kilovolt
power line to Mozambique is ready.
</P>
<P>
An action plan of the Swaziland Environmental Authority showed
that the Swazi electricity board is arranging to buy electricity
from Mozambique where the price is lower.
</P>
<P>
However, the scheme also showed there is really nothing
Swaziland can do until the 400-kilovolt line has been completed.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified Swazi official was quoted as saying that at the
moment the tiny kingdom is buying power at 12 U.S. cents per kwh
from ESCOM.

<HEADLINE> 9 Ugandan Ministers Sworn in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
swore in nine recently-appointed ministers at State House Nakasero
Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will go to ministries of agriculture, foreign
affairs, finance, works and housing, education and sports, and
etc., a press release issued by the President's Office said.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial post for internal affairs, one of the most
important posts in the government, still remains vacant.
</P>
<P>
Former Minister of Internal Affairs Tom Butime was transferred
to be in charge of the Ministry of Disaster Preparedness and
Refugees in the latest cabinet reshuffle on April 5.
</P>
<P>
His transference is allegedly linked with the surfacing of
chronic corruption and pervasive abuse of office among police top
brass.
</P>
<P>
In the reshuffle widely believed to be a result of mounting
pressure from the Parliament for the president to check rampant
corruption among the high-level officials, President Museveni
dropped nine ministers and nominated 12 new ones.
</P>
<P>
If all the nominees are appointed, the total number of
ministers will be 62, one more than the constitutional number of
61.
</P>
<P>
After the list was rejected by the Appointments Committee,
Museveni remove one name from the list to honor the constitution.

<HEADLINE> Rubin on Aims of Global Financial Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States and other
major economies have put together a "powerful program of reform"
to deal with the worst economic crisis in half a century and help
to prevent future Asian-style currency crises, Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Our overall goal is to build the international system that
best promotes global growth, that best contributes to broadly
sharing that growth, that is less prone to crisis and better able
to manage crisis when it occurs," Rubin said in an address to
Johns Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
"We want to equip all countries to be able to participate
effectively in the global financial system," said Rubin, who in
his speech talked about the details of the U.S. agenda for the
global financial architecture of the future.
</P>
<P>
Rubin's speech was expected to set the tone for much of the
discussion at the upcoming International Monetary Fund and World
Bank spring meeting.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Treasury chief said the past two years showed the
world community's ability to muster huge official resources to
deal with a global crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said that while the U.S. economy has remained strong
throughout the past two years, it is also true that American
workers, businesses, and farmers have been impacted by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"That is why our country and so many nations have been
intensely focused on international financial reform and must
continue to be intensely focused on reform for a long time to
come," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin stressed that there are no magic wands. "But over time,
the steps we have taken and those we propose constitute a very
powerful program of reform... The result should be a more robust
global economy -- one less susceptible to crises, one better
equipped to deal with crisis and one with greater growth, more
broadly shared," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, President Bill Clinton has told a gathering at the
White House that "we will never be able to banish" financial
crises altogether. He added that "acting on the lessons we have
learned from this experience, we can find a way to harness the
benefits of an open global economy while taming the global cycles
of boom and bust."
</P>
<P>
The United States hopes to receive approval for its new ideas
at a meeting Monday of finance officials of the world's seven
richest industrial countries -- the United States, Japan, Germany,
France, Britain, Italy and Canada.

<HEADLINE> Lawrence Family Launch Civil Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The parents of the murdered black
teenager Stephen Lawrence began legal action on Wednesday against
the men suspected of his killing.
</P>
<P>
They are also taking action against the Metropolitan Police
over the failed investigation into the murder. No one has been
convicted of the killing, according to BBC report.
</P>
<P>
The move comes the day before the sixth anniversary of
Stephen's death and narrowly beats the six-year deadline for
launching civil actions.
</P>
<P>
If the case goes ahead, the five key suspects may be
cross-examined in a court for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Three of the suspects -- Neil Acourt, Luke Knight and Gary
Dobson -- were formally acquited of the murder of Stephen three
years ago when a private prosecution brought by the Lawrences
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
This meant they could not face further criminal charges for the
murder.
</P>
<P>
The action against the police comes amid ongoing negotiations
with Scotland Yard over compensation.
</P>
<P>
The police have offered Lawrence's parents 50,000 pounds
(78,000 U.S. dollars) each for mishandling the investigation into
their son's murder in Eltham, south London in 1993.

WASHINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Airstrikes in Yugoslavia
have brought down the support rate of President Bill Clinton to 56
percent, its lowest in nearly two years, a poll released Wednesday
said.

percent, according to the survey by the Pew Research Center.
</P>

It was Clinton's lowest approval rating since June 1997. The
Monica Lewinsky scandal never made his support rate slip below 62
percent.
</P>

"This doesn't represent a sea change in public opinion about

military operation in Yugoslavia) significantly grow, it could
have political implications," Reuters quoted Pew director Andrew
