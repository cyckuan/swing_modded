Western countries and Russia, known as the Group of Eight.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan Army has launched
attack on the rebel UNITA troops in a town near Malanje City,
capital of the central Malanje Province, a military source said
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified source disclosed that the government army
occupied the town of Cambondo, killing some 100 troops of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The source added that two UNITA soldiers, three TMT-2 tanks and
50 light weapons were captured.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Angolan Army took the action in response to
the increased operation of the UNITA forces in the areas
neighboring Malanje recently.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the UNITA forces resumed bombardment on
the provincial city last Sunday. They used long-range artillery,
killing nine civilians, wounding 10 others and destroying six
houses.
</P>
<P>
The scared residents were forced to flee the city.
</P>
<P>
Since the civil war renewed in the southern African country
last December, the city of Malanje has been the main target of the
UNITA fire.

<HEADLINE> UK Official Admits Terrorism Law Blunder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- British Home Secretary Jack Straw
admitted Wednesday that sections of Britain's Prevention of
Terrorism Act have not been in force for more than a year due to a
drafting blunder.
</P>
<P>
He told the parliament that technical flaws in the drafting of
orders continuing the act last year meant that certain parts of
the act effectively had been dropped and had not been in force
since March 1998.
</P>
<P>
"I therefore come before the House (of Commons) today to
apologize for this regrettable error, for which I take full
responsibility," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The blunder means it is not currently an offense to hold
articles relate to terrorist activity and to collect information
for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
New laws would be introduced to make these offense again as
quickly as possible, the Home Secretary said, adding that there
was plenty of other legislation on the statute book under which
terrorists could be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
Straw said no-one had been arrested since March 1998 under the
faulty provisions.

<HEADLINE> 3 Lebanese Civilians Wounded in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Three Lebanese civilians were
wounded Wednesday in Israeli attacks on villages in south
Lebanon, the Voice of the People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Abdelhadi Fahs, 70, and Ali Zahweh, 12, were wounded when
their house in the village of Kabrikha on the north of the
Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon, was hit by an
Israeli shell.
</P>
<P>
Badia Khiamy, 60, was wounded when Israeli warplanes fired
eight rockets at suspected Lebanese guerrillas' positions in a
valley near the Yater inside the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli attack came as a response to previous operations
launched by guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party
of God, on its positions inside the border enclave.
</P>
<P>
Late Tuesday night, a member of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon
Army (SLA) and a Lebanese civilian were killed in roadside bombs
by unidentified Lebanese guerrillas. An Israeli soldier was
wounded in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to dislodge Israeli occupation forces
and its ally SLA out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Civil Servants Can Retire at 60 with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will pay all
benefits to civil and public servants who retire at the compulsory
age of 60 in accordance with a new law, a senior official said
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Secretary of the Finance Ministry Raphael Mollel said
that the Public Service Retirement Benefits Act of 1999 also
guarantees all the benefits to servants who retire at voluntary
age of 55.
</P>
<P>
Mollel said that the new law, which is to become effective on
July 1 this year, raises the compulsory and voluntary retirement
ages from 55 to 60 and from 50 to 55 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The permanent secretary said that all relevant authorities have
been urged to submit files of compulsory or voluntary retirees to
his ministry for checking procedures for their benefits.
</P>
<P>
Mollel also disclosed that under the new system, public
servants shall be allowed to retire by using an affidavit.
</P>
<P>
"Any one who will use an affidavit and later proved otherwise
will be met with legal measures," he warned. "All the salaries
earned through presenting such an affidavit will be deducted from
the retirement benefits."
</P>
<P>
Tanzania reduced its civil service from 355,000 to 271,000 last
year, a 24 percent cut over a five-year period to make it more
effective and efficient.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Parties Still Disagree on Election Model </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Lesotho Congress
for Democracy and three other leading parties are still in
disagreement over the appropriate electoral model to be used in
elections scheduled for early next year, according to reports
reaching here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This emerged after talks in Lesotho capital Maseru Wednesday
between the ruling party and the opposition alliance -- consisting
of the Basotho National Party, the Basotholand Congress Party and
the Marematlou Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
The participants issued a joint statement after the meeting,
saying that there were differences during the talks.
</P>
<P>
It was felt this could be ironed out within the Interim
Political Authority (IPA) set up to facilitate the election.
</P>
<P>
The statement said all the parties, except the ruling party,
were in favor of a 100 percent proportional representation model.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Congress for Democracy was in favor of a dual model,
 comprising the "first past the post" method currently in use and
proportional representation. It felt any drastic change should be
referred to a national referendum.
</P>
<P>
But the other parties felt a referendum was outside the
Interim Political Authority mandate, and that it would be
expensive. The parties further felt there was a limited period
before the holding of the election.
</P>
<P>
The parties decided that the review of the structure of the
Independent Electoral Commission, as well as the issue of
security, should be further addressed by the Interim Political
Authority.
</P>
<P>
However, an understanding was reached by the parties concerning
the subject of "consensus".
</P>
<P>
They agreed on a definition to be adopted by the Interim
Political Authority that consensus was defined in terms of the IPA
Act, which meant agreement by a substantial majority after
lobbying of opinions and without a vote.
</P>
<P>
The issue of consensus had posed a serious problem for the IPA.
</P>
<P>
Political observers hailed the agreement among the political
leaders on a common understanding of the word.
</P>
<P>
They said this would pave the way for the continuation of
preparations for the election.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Minorities, Drug Users Less likely to Get AIDS Treatments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A study showed that minorities,
the poor and people who contracted AIDS through drug use are less
likely to get needed care in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The disparities were particularly acute in 1996, and have
improved somewhat over two years, according to the country's first
national study of AIDS treatment.
</P>
<P>
The gap persisted for many groups, including women, who are
most likely to get HIV through sex with a drug user and are also
less likely to be in treatment, the study said.
</P>
<P>
"At least on an unconscious level, some providers may have more
aggressively tried to provide these treatments to certain
patients," said Dr. Martin F. Shapiro of the University of
California, lead author of the study being published Wednesday in
the Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
Shapiro also noted that the differences in care based on
insurance type and race persisted, even when researchers took into
account such factors as how the person contracted the virus.
</P>
<P>
"The voices of the poor are not heard well in this country,"
Shapiro said. "In the case of HIV, the consequences of that can be
quite profound."
</P>
<P>
Blacks are the fasting growing group of AIDS victims,
accounting for nearly half of all new infections, making the
disparities in care even more alarming to public health
officials.
</P>
<P>
Between 650,000 and 900,000 Americans are infected with HIV,
though about 275,000 are unaware of their infection.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) on Wednesday approved 300 million U.S. dollars in
financing to support the 1998-2001 investment program of Aguas
Argentina S.A., the sole provider of potable water and sewerage
services for the city of Buenos Aires and 13 surrounding
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
As of December 1998, Aguas Argentinas supplied potable water
and sewerage service to approximately 7.5 million people and
provided sewerage service to almost six million people.
</P>
<P>
The project will expand and improve the services and
rehabilitate the systems in the concession area.
</P>
<P>
Aguas Argentinas has been operating under an exclusive 30-year
concession contract since 1993. The concession stipulates the
eventual expansion of the water system to serve 100 percent of the
population with 100 percent of the collected sewerage treated.
</P>
<P>
The IDB financing consists of a 75-million-dollar "A" loan from
the bank's ordinary capital and a syndicated loan of up to 225
million dollars. Participation in the "B" loan will be sold to
institutional investors or other lenders.
</P>
<P>
ING Barings is acting as the arranger for the first tranche
of the "B" loan, expected to be 120 million dollars, the IDB
said.

HARARE, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean civil servants Wednesday
 continued with their strike over 20 percent cost of living
adjustment, rejecting the government's offer of 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government has warned that those who continue with the
strike would be severely dealt with, the Zimbabwe News Agency

<P>
Thousands of civil servants marched through the center of
capital Harare forcing other workers who had turned up for work at
government buildings to join them in the strike.

The government Tuesday awarded the civil servants a 12 percent
cost of living adjustment dated back to January 1 this year, and
threatened to take appropriate action against the workers who
would not turn up for work.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean civil servants went on strike last Wednesday to
press the government to award them the 20 percent which has been
paid out in the private sector.

Staff associations representing civil servants have since last

HARARE, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
and visiting President of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
Laurent Kabila Wednesday discussed the forthcoming Lusaka summit
on cease-fire in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
After their talks in Zimbabwean capital Harare, Mugabe told
reporters that he has received information reflecting the views of
Rwanda on cease- fire in the DRC, but he was waiting for results
of consultations going on in Zambian capital Lusaka ahead of the
regional summit.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said that the forthcoming summit to prepare the
cease-fire agreement was likely to take place, but chairman of the
summit, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba and others involved
clearly would only go there when ministers had put in place the
arrangements which all parties would have agreed on.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean president said that he and Kabila were studying
a document from Rwanda reflecting their views on the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
"President Chiluba has his own document that reflects our views
which we want to become the basis of the cease-fire," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa had come up with another document on the
cease-fire package which they think would become a complement of
the one prepared by the other allies.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka cease-fire agreement was being drafted to end the
10-month- old war raging in the vast central African country.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire agreement contains inputs from the Southern
African Development Community (SADC), the Organization of African
Unity and the United Nations, as well as from Libya.
</P>
<P>
Kabila arrived in Harare Tuesday and returned home on Wednesday
evening.

<HEADLINE> Namibian Intelligence Chief Asks for Help in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Namibia's intelligence chief
Wednesday called for public's help in tracing the origins of 57
skeletons which were found in a mass burial site and are believed
to be almost a century old, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The remains were found outside the desert town of Luderitz,
located along southern Namibia's arid Atlantic coastline, said
Peter Sheehama, Director-General of the Namibian Central
Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
Sheehama said there were 30 more such sites in the same area,
all located within huge tracts of land which have been declared
off-limits to the public to safeguard possible diamond deposits.
</P>
<P>
The intelligence chief declined to discuss the possible origins
of the skeletons found in the area or say why he was put in charge
of what may be an archaeological find.
</P>
<P>
It was unclear when the remains were found.
</P>
<P>
Luderitz was the site of a German colonial concentration camp
during the indigenous Herero and Nama rebellions of 1904, during
which an estimated 10, 000 Namas and as many as 65,000 Hereros
were wiped out.
</P>
<P>
German academic Horst Drechsler, citing colonial records, said
that as many as 1,032 out of 1,795 Nama men, women and children in
the concentration camp called Shark Island died between 1906 and
1907, mostly from malnutrition and typhoid.
</P>
<P>
"It's the most likely explanation, that the bodies came from
Shark Island's concentration camp," said Dr. Jeremy Sylvestre of
the University of Namibia's history department.
</P>
<P>
"But... it could also be that these bodies were buried there in
the aftermath of the 1918 flu epidemic, in fear of contamination,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
After Germany was defeated in World War I, South Africa
occupied the territory for more than 70 years. Namibia became
independent in 1990.

He added that he would discuss with Iraqi officials on the
possibility for the Jordanian Petroleum Company to develop an
Iraqi oil field.
</P>
<P>
Under a joint Iraqi-Jordanian oil protocol signed last
December, Iraq will provide Jordan with 4.8 million tons of crude
oil in 1999 at preferential prices.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq has provided all
Jordan's needs for crude oil and derivatives under U.N. permission.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced earlier that Iraq and Jordan were preparing for
the final stage to start the construction of an Iraqi-Jordanian
oil pipeline which will be executed on stages.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the oil pipeline will start by laying a
pipeline from Jordan's Zarkaa refinery to the Jordanian-Iraqi
borderline. And Iraq will deliver its crude oil to the borderline
by tankers and pump the oil into the new pipeline.
</P>
<P>
After the pipeline inside Jordan has been laid, the
construction of the pipeline inside Iraq will start soon.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's National Fertilizer
Agency announced Wednesday that over 400,000 tons of fertilizer in
its warehouse are more than sufficient for the coming crop season
starting from June this year.
</P>
<P>
Tibebu Haile, marketing department head of the agency, told the
press that the Ethiopian government allocates 100 million U.S.
dollars for purchasing fertilizer annually.
</P>
<P>
Tibebu said current fertilizer stock would reach well over
490,000 tons when an already ordered fertilizer reaches the
country soon.
</P>
<P>
At present, fertilizer is being distributed to farmers through
seven fertilizer importing companies in the Horn of Africa
country, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that each state of the country should take measures to
 facilitate conditions for a speedy distribution of fertilizer
among farmers so that they can produce crop in the big rainy
season.
</P>
<P>
The crop in the big rainy season from June to September
accounts for almost 90 percent of the total output of the whole
year, according to the official.

<P>
MOSCOW, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Air Force Commander Anatoly
Kornukov said Wednesday that NATO member-countries stepped up
their intelligence activity in Russia about the ongoing West '99
strategic command headquarters maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
NATO espionage became particularly active in the Barents Sea
area and from Polish territory, the Interfax news agency quoted
Kornukov as saying.
</P>
<P>
The current air force maneuvers involve units from the Moscow
military district, Rostov, St. Petersburg and the military
transport aviation division deployed in the Urals, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kornukov called for "rapidly modernizing Russian aviation by
installing the latest weaponry and more efficient anti-aircraft
systems."
</P>
<P>
Russia said the West '99 exercise, the biggest since 1985, was
planned last December well before the NATO air strikes against
Yugoslavia but that events in the Balkans "were certainly taken
into account in planning, Colonel General Yuri Baluyevsky, head of
the Department for Operational Command of the Russian Armed Forces
General Staff, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The North, Baltic and Black Sea fleets and about 20 commands of
formations of armed services and three formations of the Air Borne
Troops are also involved in the week-long exercise that is
scheduled to end next Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Speedwing to Manage Olympic Airways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Greece's Transport and
Communications Minister Tassos Mandelis on Wednesday announced
that Speedwing, a subsidiary of British Airways, would take over
management of Greece's national carrier Olympic Airways.
</P>
<P>
Announcing this in the Greek Parliament, Mandelis said that
Speedwing would manage Olympic Airways for a period of 30 months
and would have the obligation to make the national carrier viable
and reliable at an international level.
</P>
<P>
British Airways would be given the option to acquire 20 percent
of the Olympic Airways' capital share.
</P>
<P>
The new management will prepare Olympic Airways for a
"strategic alliance" with British Airways or another major
airline, a move the Greek government says is vital for the
airline's survival.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government has sunk billions of drachmas into
ill-fated restructuring programs and repeatedly covered debts at
Olympic Airways.
</P>
<P>
The Greek national carrier is now facing more domestic
competition since small private airlines serving Greek islands and
other domestic airports are just getting off the ground this
Summer and are expected to bite into Olympic Airways' share.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Expand Cooperation With U.N. Organization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian ministries and state
organs are to expand cooperation with the United Nations
Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Massoud Homayounfar, Director of UNIDO Coordination Office at
the Iranian Industries Ministry, said that seven UNIDO experts
came to Iran on Sunday to visit various organizations and
ministries and discuss issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
"During its 10-day stay in Tehran, the UNIDO delegation will
prepare a draft proposal on a comprehensive plan and will submit
it to the UNIDO board of directors for approval," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official noted that the cooperation is in line
with the reorganization of the UNIDO and the necessity of
coordination with UNIDO for better implementation of the country's
economic development plans.
</P>
<P>
Areas of cooperation includes small-medium scale industries,
efficient use of energy, preservation of environment, expansion
of agricultural and food industries, investment promotion schemes
and application of new technology in electronics and
biotechnology, he said.
</P>
<P>
Homayounfar said there is coordination between various
governmental organizations and UNIDO experts on important issues
related to the country's development plan.
</P>
<P>
He said that UNIDO generally formulates plans concerning
economic competitiveness, reduction of pollution and environmental
degradation, and expansion of productive employment in the
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
UNIOD's reorganization plan does not envision specific funds
to be provided to developing countries, but only acts as a
consultant to these countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The funds need for the approved projects between UNIDO and
governmental organizations and ministries have to be raised from
international financial institutions such as the World Bank and
United Nations Development Program, he added.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Leader Calls for Action Against Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Vice-President
Omar Ali Juma Wednesday directed the leadership in the northern
Arusha Region to take immediate steps to curb criminal acts after
a mayor there was attacked by bandits.
</P>
<P>
Juma said the general public currently have a rooted belief
that some of the regional leaders, and some regional police
officers are collaborating with suspected armed bandits in the
acts, according to a press release signed by the Vice-President's
pressman, Said Ameir.
</P>
<P>
He gave the directive in the Arusha, capital of the region,
when he visited and consoled the municipality's mayor Philip
Kivuyo who was attacked by eight bandits on June 15.
</P>
<P>
The bandits injured the mayor's face and leg with bottles when
he was staying with two colleagues in a local bar in the midnight
and made away with a pistol with 10 rounds of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
The group also stole 50,000 shillings from the mayor (about 70
U.S. dollars) and took away 100,000 shillings from the bar owner
and 30,000 shillings from one of the mayor's colleagues.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president ordered Arusha Regional Police Commander,
Juma Ng' wanang'wake to terminate the service of any policeman who
are found collaborating with criminals.
</P>
<P>
Arusha is an important tourist region vital for the economy of
the eastern African country and a lot of international meetings
are held there.
</P>
<P>
The factors require high state of security, he added, urging
the police to launch a special operation against crimes and common
people to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president opened a conference of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) early Tuesday and is expected to open
a general meeting for Council of Minister of the 14-member
organization Friday.

<P>
ATHENS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos on Wednesday took a sceptical attitude towards the
power by the NATO-led multinational peacekeeping force to secure
the presence of Serbs in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the presentation of a book on Kosovo,
Tsohatzopoulos said that it remained to be seen whether the
peacekeeping force had the power to guarantee the continued
presence of Serb inhabitants in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Fearing that more Serbs will flee Kosovo with the return of
Albanian refugees, Greece hopes that Kosovo should be a
multi-cultural and multi-racial place with a regime that is
tolerant of all the peoples and populations.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the U.S. had no strategic interest in
Kosovo but had exploited the crisis to legitimize NATO's new role.

<HEADLINE> S.Leone Rebels Reject Posts Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Foday Sankoh, leader of Revolutionary United Front (RUF), said
he was demanding the vice-presidency in a four-year transitional
government, and at least eight cabinet seats.
</P>
<P>
But the government has ruled out the possibility by saying the
country already had a democratically-elected vice-president.
</P>
<P>
The rebels' refusal to the government's peace terms came quite
of a sudden against the high expectations that a power-sharing
deal between the two sides was close at hand.
</P>
<P>
"The principle of the participation of RUF has been accepted,
but their level of participation is still posing a problem," ,
Togo's Foreign Minister, Joseph Koffigoh, announced Monday before
the adjournment of the peace talks for both delegations return to
Sierra Leone to hold further consultation with the leaders.
</P>
<P>
The rebels' power-sharing demand had been a major hurdle in the
peace talks held in Lome, Togo, between the government and RUT
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The RUF has been demanding certain key positions in a new
transitional government, but the government had formerly insisted
that the rebels must transform themselves into an unarmed
political party and participate in next election.
</P>
<P>
The RUF started war against successive governments in Sierra
Leone since 1991. International community managed a hard-earn
cease-fire on May 24 to usher in the peace talks in Lome.
</P>
<P>
Since negotiations began, the two sides have agreed in
principle on the release of Sankoh, the jailed RUF leader who was
sentenced to death last October on treason charges.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have also agreed on the release of prisoners of
war, and to allow humanitarian relief to be distributed in their
areas of control.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the power-sharing, the thorny issue of the future
role of the Nigerian-led intervention force of the West Africa,
remains to be sorted out. The ECOMOG (West Africa Peace Keeping
Force) has been defending the government against rebel insurgents.

NAIROBI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Congolese rebels fighting to
remove President Laurent Desire Kabila of the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC) have declared that they will be present in the
Lusaka, Zambia to participate in the meeting for peace deal.
</P>
<P>
''We have sent a strong delegation to Lusaka and we are
committed to giving peace in Congo a change,'' the new Congolese
Rally for Democracy (RCD) leader, Emile Ilunga told Rwanda's
official news agency, the Rwanda News Agency Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He, however, denounced meeting between RCD ousted leader,
Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, with Kabila in Harare Zimbabwe, on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
''I can confirm the presence of Wamba dia Wamba in Harare. Like
in the past, Wamba takes individual initiatives which are at the
origin of contradictions within RCD,'' Ilunga declared.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that Wamba does not represent the rebel movement,
or any faction of the opposition to Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu had earlier declared that
Rwanda will attend the Lusaka meeting but will not sign a
cease-fire as long as the Kabila regime and its allies have not
stopped arming and training the Hutu " genocidaire'' forces.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda, Donors Review Economic Reform Program. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda together with the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Wednesday opened a
two-day workshop in Kigali to review Rwandan economic reform
programs which began two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan Minister of Finance and Economic Planning, Donald
Kaberuka said as results of its two-year-old Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility (ESAF) program, Rwanda has registered
significant economic growth, more money have been located for the
social sector, mainly in education and health, and gross domestic
product has significantly increased, the Rwanda News Agency
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The economy of Rwanda was already experiencing severe economic
 difficulties since 1986. Real sector product had contracted, real
per capita income stood at 231 U.S. dollars, external debt had
accumulated quite a lot and debt service to exports stood at 18.8
percent in 1990, having risen from 7.6 percent in 1996," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
The civil war and genocide in 1994 compounded the situation by
introducing additional dimensions, he added .
</P>
<P>
In addition to the economic hardships, the economy experienced
human catastrophe due to many people were killed and displaced as
well as the reintegration of refugees.
</P>
<P>
"All these problems have implication for programs to revive
economic activities and address poverty," Minister Kaberuka
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
According to Kaberuka, Rwanda still experiences structural
problems relating to the fact that agricultural methods have not
yet changed while the population is increasing, and the growing
external dependence on foreign aid, both in human and material
resources.
</P>
<P>
The seminar organized by the Rwandan Minister of Finance in
conjunction with the Harvard Institute for International
development in the United States, brought together various
stake-holders in the country like civil servants, private sector,
cabinet, parliament, universities, donors and diplomats.

<HEADLINE> Titanic Discoverer Finds Oldest Deep Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 23 (Xinhua) -- American oceanographer Robert
D. Ballard, who located the wreck of the Titanic, and other
explorers have discovered the oldest known shipwrecks off the
coast of Israel, Israeli television reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ballard announced in Tel Aviv that he and his team had found
the wrecks of two ships of more than 2,700 years ago off the
southern port of Ashkelon in the eastern Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
He said they were the oldest shipwrecks to be found in deep
water.
</P>
<P>
The ships, lying more than 300 meters deep under the surface,
each carried hundreds of amphorae filled with wine. As a result of
the cold deep-sea waters and the absence of sunlight, the vessels
are both well preserved.
</P>
<P>
The expedition team said the vessels probably left the
ancient port of Tyre, now in Lebanon, about 750 B.C. bound for
either Egypt or Carthage in modern-day Tunisia. A fierce storm
might be the cause of their sinking, the team said.
</P>
<P>
Ballard told Israel Channel One that the discovery was a
by-product of the search for the Israeli submarine Dakar by
American search and salvage experts in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
Dakar was discovered about 480 kilometers off the Israeli coast
in about 2,926 meters deep under the water last month, 31 years
after it disappeared in its maiden voyage from England to
Israel.

<HEADLINE> Russia Wants Role in Control of kosovo Civilian Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said here Wednesday that Moscow will seek the appointment
of a Russian representative to the post of "one of the deputies to
the U.N. secretary-general's envoy to the structures in charge of
the civilian operation in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"Moscow is selecting candidates for various positions. The
moment the U.N. secretary general's envoy is appointed and the
structure of the civil operation in Kosovo is approved, we shall
propose our candidates for a number of posts," Ivanov told a press
conference following talks with his Danish counterpart, Niels
Helvig Petersen.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that, with due account taken of the role Russia has
played in the settlement of the Kosovo crisis, Russia has won the
right to be properly represented in the agencies in charge of the
civilian operation in Kosovo," he said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. chief Kofi Annan, who was visiting Moscow, promised
Wednesday that Russian officials would be included in a civil
administration for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Under the Kosovo plan, which Annan announced last week, the
U.N. peace-building mission will have four deputies serving under
a special representative.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Annan appointed a French official and a New
Zealand refugee expert as deputies to the special representative,
who hasn't been named yet.
</P>
<P>
In another related development Wednesday, Russian Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev said the dispatch of Russian peacekeepers
to Kosovo would begin next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev made the statement before an appearance before the
State Duma, or lower house of parliament in a closed-door hearing
on Yugoslavia, which was also participated by Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, deputy Duma speaker Sergei Baburin said
"Russia has no good reason to be proud of the settlement of the
situation in Kosovo" but that most deputies "approved of the
presence of Russian paratroopers in Pristina," capital city of the
Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the dispatch of some 200 Russian troops to
the Pristina airport, a move that took NATO by surprise and
strengthened Moscow's hand in negotiations with the United
Stations on Russia's peacekeeping role in the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
Under a deal hammered out after marathon talks between the two
countries' diplomatic and military officials, Russia will send
3,600 troops to three separate sectors in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Baburin said a group of Duma deputies will travel to Kosovo,
including Pristina, possibly together with Russian peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
He said Serbian authorities and the Russian defense and foreign
ministries have approved the trip.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Calls for Halt to Gold Sales by IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Ghana said the decision of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) to sell gold could have a
crippling effect on gold producing economies, the Ghana News
Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The proposal must be stopped entirely," Ghanaian Minister of
Mines and Energy Fred Ohene Kena said. "The IMF must look at some
other means of supporting distressed countries that depend heavily
on gold to fund their economies instead of selling gold,
especially when the price of the commodity is already down."
</P>
<P>
The IMF proposed selling gold and putting the revenue into a
trust fund and using the interest to fund debt relief and lending
program for poor countries.
</P>
<P>
IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus had assured that it
would make every effort to ensure the sales do not unsettle the
markets.
</P>
<P>
But Kena said that the intended sale must be stopped as
Camdessus' assurance can not be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
The minister said most gold producing economies are already
reeling under the pressure of the recent depreciation in gold
price and can not afford to experience another price fall.
</P>
<P>
Gold prices tumbled recently on the world market from about 269
U.S. dollars an ounce to 259.25 dollars, forcing some emerging
gold mines to live on the edge and totally realign their
production and marketing strategies.
</P>
<P>
The IMF started lobbying for gold sales in 1996, viewing them
as a way to close a funding gap in its program of concessionary
lending for poor countries.
</P>
<P>
It would sell up to 10 million ounces of gold and use the money
as debt relief for the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the South African gold mining industry has also
warned that the proposed sale of IMF gold reserves will undermine
the current fragile gold market and place further downward
pressure on the price.
</P>
<P>
A partial scrapping of Third World debt was decided at the G-8
meeting in Cologne, Germany, over the weekend.

<HEADLINE> Israel Accused of Violating International Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid on Wednesday accused Israel of violating the Fourth
Geneva Convention and international law.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid said Israel conducts illegal practices against the
Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian land, including torture,
demolition of Palestinian houses and confiscation of land.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League chief slammed Israel in a speech at the second
international symposium on international law and armament control
organized by the league in tandem with the Egyptian Society of
Criminal Law, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva convention stipulates that the rights of the
civilians under occupation should be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid, meanwhile, underlined that Israel's practices
would only strengthen the resolve of the Palestinian people to
continue struggles till they secure their legitimate rights,
including the establishment of an independent state with Jerusalem
as its capital.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East is going through a critical stage, entailing
sincere commitment on the incoming Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak to advancing the peace process, he said.
</P>
<P>
Barak, leader of Israel's moderate Labor Party, has pledged to
push forward the peace talks with the Palestinians and resume
negotiations with Syria and Lebanon after he won Israel's
elections on May 17.
</P>

<HEADLINE> African Countries Urged to Combat AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
said Wednesday that African governments must immediately declare
AIDS a national emergency and allocate appropriate resources to
combat the spread of the pandemic.
</P>
<P>
WHO African Regional Director Ebrahim Samba said in a statement
that people would take the epidemic seriously when leaders
publicly admitted that it was a problem.
</P>
<P>
"More people will be focused on the problem and international
assistance will be more forthcoming to tame the pandemic. I plead
that this be done without further delay," he said.
</P>
<P>
Africa accounted for 70 percent of people living with AIDS, 83
percent of AIDS deaths and 95 percent of the global AIDS orphans.
</P>
<P>
Samba said the epidemic had become a development issue as it
killed people of the most productive age groups.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the age group mostly affected by AIDS in
Africa was the working group between 20 and 40 years.
</P>
<P>
This pandemic had negatively affected Africa by further
straining on already under-staffed and under-funded health
services, the WHO official said.
</P>
<P>
"Factors accounting for this grim situation include the wide
practice of unprotected sex, high incidence of sexually
transmitted diseases and poor access to care and information," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Agriculture Harvest up 10% </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique harvested 1.8 million
tons of grains, in the 1998/99 farming year (from July 1 1998 to
June 30, 1999), about 10 percent more than the previous year,
despite the flood which has affected about 63,000 hectares of farm
land.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Agostinho do Rosario, Minister of Agricultures and
Fishery, attributed the harvest to to improved seeds, enlarged
farming acreage, and the increased number of farmers after the
civil war.
</P>
<P>
Rosario said in a news release here Wednesday that the country
is to export about 160,000 tons of maize and trying to realize
self-sufficiency in rice.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique now has a shortage of only about 67,000 tons of
grain to meet the domestic need, while the figure in 1995 was ten
times more.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the increased agricultural production
has helped enliven the market, adding that the government wishes
to further develop the trade in rural areas, and is planning to
repair roads so to facilitate the circulation of goods.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Close Second Largest Pyramid for Repairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will close the second tallest
pyramid to tourists on July 1 for repairs, Minister of Culture
Farouk Hosni said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hosni told Egypt's Middle East News Agency that the Pyramid of
Chefren, the second largest of the famous Giza trio, will be shut
for a year to enable workers to repair cracks and install new
light and ventillation systems.
</P>
<P>
The structure with a height of 136 meters was built as a tomb
for King Chefren about 4,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Egypt reopened the 137-meter tall Pyramid of
Cheops, the largest of the three pyramids, following a similar
restoration.
</P>
<P>
With hundreds of tourists visiting the pyramids each day, the
humidity in their passages has been crystallizing into layers of
salt and causing cracks.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's restoration of the pyramids is part of a plan to boost
the tourism industry, a major source of foreign currency.

<HEADLINE> EU Agency For Kosovo Reconstruction Set Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) formally
decided on Wednesday to set up a Kosovo rebuilding agency by
adopting a regulation on operating procedures for the
Pristina-based aid management agency.
</P>
<P>
European Commission, the EU's executive body, said the European
Agency for Reconstruction (EAR) on the spot in Pristina operating
in accordance with suitable rules and procedures will administer
the reconstruction programs for Kosovo locally, and allow fast,
effective and transparent operations.
</P>
<P>
"Reconstruction will involve carrying out a large number of
small projects quickly, managing a considerable budget and
bringing in numerous specialists with skills in a wide range of
fields, including engineering, experts in mine clearance,
architects, agricultural advisers, health and welfare workers and
advisers on small business and micro-enterprises," the EU
executive said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The agency will be able to recruit the necessary experts on
short-term contracts "limited to the period necessary for
reconstruction", the commission said, adding that once its job is
done the agency will be wound up.
</P>
<P>
EU commissioner Hans van den Broek said the new agency's
creation is seen as the most appropriate response to an
exceptional crisis situation. "The agency would enhance the
effectiveness, speed and visibility of European operations,
allowing them to be both decentralized and closely coordinated
with the United Nations interim administration," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Today's decisions laid the groundwork for central European
Union involvement in the reconstruction of Kosovo and the region
as a whole," van den Broek added.

<P>
ROME, June 23 (Xinhua) -- American Maurice Greene, who just
broke the world record for 100 meters, might not take part in Rome
's July 7 Golden Gala athletics meet, organizers said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Greene, the 100 world champion, shattered the old mark for the
sport's hallowed event by clocking 9.79 seconds last week at the
Olympic Stadium in Athens, Greece.
</P>
<P>
The event's budget has been cut by about 600 million lire (320,
000 U.S. dollars), making it tough for organizers to attract
everyone they hoped would attend.
</P>
<P>
The Golden Gala is the second leg in the IAAF's seven-meet
Golden League series, which offers a one million U.S. dollars
jackpot to be split among athletes who win their events at every
circuit stop plus the Grand Prix Finals.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Inject Funds Into Property Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government is stepping up
efforts to revive the property market by injecting 50 billion baht
(1.35 billion U.S. dollars) into the sector, the Thai News Agency
(TNA) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The injection would represent the government's new economic
stimulus measure, aimed at boosting demand and supply of local
properties, which would help spur economic activities, TNA quoted
Surapol Kwanchaithanya, managing director of Second Market Credit
Corp., as saying.
</P>
<P>
Surapol said under the new strategic measure, new loans of 45.6
billion baht (1.23 billion dollars) with a fixed annual interest
of around eight percent will be extended to people willing to buy
ready-built houses.
</P>
<P>
The money would come from issuance of bonds by the Government
Housing Bank, which would also be authorized to approve part of
the housing fund itself, and extend the rest to the Government
Savings Bank and commercial banks for lending to their clients,
Surapol said.
</P>
<P>
The bonds will be guaranteed by the Ministry of Finance to
ensure holders of certain returns, he added.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 4.4-billion-baht (118.9-million-dollar) loan
would come from issuance of bonds by Second Market Credit Corp.,
Surapol said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Supports Financial Reform in Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced on
Wednesday that it has approved a loan of 300 million U.S. dollars
to support reforms in Peru's banking, capital markets, and pension
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the new loan follows a previous loan totaling 400
million dollars it approved in 1992 in support of financial sector
reform in Peru.
</P>
<P>
In banking, the loan will support the introduction and
implementation of laws and regulations to increase bank
supervisors' ability to identify and correct problems threatening
banks.
</P>
<P>
In capital markets, the loan will support strategies to manage
public debt, and develop the domestic debt market, both of which
allow companies to mobilize resources more easily, stimulate
investment and reduce the economy's vulnerability to external
shocks.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the bank loan will assist managers of private and
public pension systems in their efforts to improve collection of
contributions, expand investment options to increase returns, and
reduce operating costs.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be disbursed in two tranches. The first tranche
of 175 million dollars will be available once the loan becomes
effective. The second tranche of 125 million dollars is expected
to be disbursed nine months following compliance with related
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The loan has a maturity of 17 years, including a 5-year grace
period, and will be made in U.S. dollars at the bank's standard
interest rate for LIBOR-based, single currency loans.

<HEADLINE> Canada Breeds New Pigs Good For Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Canadian scientists at the
University of Guelph have succeeded in creating a new breed of
transgenic pig, considered to be good for the environment, local
newspapers reported here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Named Enviropig, the new breed's manure is reputed to be free
of phosphorus, which promotes an excessive growth of algae in
water sources and robs fish of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
The Globe and Mail newspaper said Wednesday that scientists
were monitoring the progress of three transgenic pigs born to
surrogate sows in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
The piglets look like others of the Yorkshire breed, but inside
the nucleus of each cell of an Enviropig is a strand of DNA that
contains a snippet of mouse and a strain of bacteria.
</P>
<P>
The transgene will allow the Enviropig to produce additional
phytase in the saliva, which releases organic phosphorus in the
animal's gut so that it can be absorbed by the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
The result is "Environmentally friendly manure," whose
phosphorus level could be reduced by an estimated 20 to 50 percent,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
For each Enviropig, hog farmers could also save as much as 1.70
Canadian dollars (about 1.16 U.S. dollars), because they don't
have to add a phosphorus supplement in feeding them.

<HEADLINE> Former Tehran Deputy Mayor Sent to Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A Tehran local court on Wednesday
sentenced Gholamreza Qobeh, former Deputy Mayor of the Iranian
Capital to nine years in prison and barred him from holding
government post for good.
</P>
<P>
Qobeh was convicted of offenses ranging from embezzlement to
illegal occupation of municipality's properties, collaboration in
embezzlement and lobbying in government dealings, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The former deputy mayor in charge of executive and financial
affairs was also sentenced to 50 lashes and a fine of 27.963
billion rials (about 9.3 million U.S. dollars) along with two
times worth of 225 free-price gold coins.
</P>
<P>
He was also ordered to return to public treasury about 160.175
billion rials (about 53.39 million dollars), 225 free-price gold
coins, plus about 13.981 billion rials (4.66 million dollars) of
embezzled money.
</P>
<P>
Qobeh was a major assistant to former Tehran Mayor
Gholamhussein Karbaschi, who had been jailed in April for two
years prison terms on graft charges.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi, close ally of former Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani and strong supporter of President Mohammad Khatami,
has denied all the charges against him and termed the cases
against Tehran municipal officials as a politically-motivated
action by the conservatives against the moderates.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that some other officials of Karbaschi's
municipality would be put on trial in the future.

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD: World Foreign Direct Investment in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- World foreign direct investment
(FDI) inflows in 1998 rose to 644 billion U.S. dollars, 39 percent
more than those in 1997, according to the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).
</P>
<P>
"The increase was due largely to a substantial increase in
cross-border mega-mergers and acquisitions (M&AMP;A) among developed
country firms," said the UNCTAD in a press release here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of cross-border M&AMP;As, most of them in developed
countries, reached to 32 in 1998 from 15 in 1997 and just eight in
1996, UNCTAD said.
</P>
<P>
However, the UN agency said, FDI flows to developing countries
as a whole declined by four percent, from 172 billion dollars in
1997 to 165 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"This decline, the first since 1985, was largely caused by
lower flows to South, East, and Southeast Asia," it added.

BONN, June 23 (Xinhua)-The Bonn cabinet headed by Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder on Wednesday approved an austerity budget plan
that will cut Germany's spending by 150 billion marks (78 billion
U.S. dollars) in next four years.
</P>
<P>
The " Program 2000", raised by Schroeder's Finance Minister

<P>
With the spending cuts, Germany's new borrowing by the federal
government will be accordingly cut by 4 billion marks to 49.5
billion in next year, and will be further reduced to 46 billion in
2001 and 41 billion marks in 2002.
</P>

Bonn, Schroeder said: "with this budget we have a real chance to
support economic growth."
</P>
<P>
"Today's decision by the cabinet is historic and marks a
paradigm change of Germany.we are drawing the consequence of
Europeanization and globalisation," he announced.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Germany will also cut its corporate tax rate
from the current 40 per cent to 25 per cent in year 2001, giving
business an 8-billion-mark tax relief.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder predicted German economic growth would be improved in
the third and fourth quarter of this year, without spelling out
the overall impact on the country's annual growth rate gross
domestic products (GDP). The government had expected a GDP growth
rate of 1.5 per cent in an earlier forecast.
</P>
<P>
Though the reform plan won applause of German business leaders,
it was attacked by organisations from parliamentary oppositions,
environmental federations and labour unions to Youth Social
Democrats (Jusos), the youth movement of Schroeder's ruling SPD
who said the package would dismantle the social states.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the cabinet's decision, four leading German
business organisations declared to support the reform bill, saying
it would help Germany to attract more investments and to create
more jobs.
</P>
<P>
Hans-Olaf Henkel, the powerful president of German Federal
Association of Industry (BDI), told the Norddeutsche Rundfunk
radio that the major tax reform would by no way have any negative
effect on domestic and foreign investors and job creation.
</P>
<P>
The conservative opposition Christian Democrats (CDU) called
the reform bill a "political broken promise" and a "deception on
voters".
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the CDU Wolfgang Schaeuble said the bill failed to
strengthen Germany's craft for economic growth and job and it was
"fully insufficient".
</P>
<P>
The Socialism Democratic Party (PDS) criticised the reform plan
was a "social unfairness" and would hurt the weak in the society.
</P>
<P>
Bonn's austerity plan includes a cut in state pension growth
rate, health and other social welfare cuts. The pensions will
under the plan grow only by 0.7 per cent in year 2000, equal to
Germany's projected inflation rate.

<HEADLINE> UK Government Rejects Pro-Human Cloning Advice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The British government Thursday
imposed a moratorium on human embryo cloning by rejecting experts'
advice to allow limited human cloning research.
</P>
<P>
Instead, government ministers are proposing to set up a new
advisory group to investigate the therapeutic aspects of limited
human cloning.
</P>
<P>
In the past several months, scientists have been urging that
cloning of human embryos under 14 days old should be allowed in
Britain, which they believed could lead to revolutionary new
medical treatments.
</P>
<P>
Any form of human cloning is currently banned under British law.
The British government was widely expected to follow the advice
from scientists.
</P>
<P>
But on Thursday, government officials said more time was needed
to look into the implications of such a move, believing more
evidence is required of the need for such research and of its
potential benefits and risks.
</P>
<P>
"The government reaffirms its policy that human reproductive
cloning is ethically unacceptable and cannot take place in this
country." Tessa Jowell, public health minister, has told the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
"However, we recognize that regulations to allow therapeutic
research should be very carefully considered." she added.
</P>
<P>
The British government said that the new advisory group is
expected to begin work during the summer and report early next
year.

<HEADLINE> UK Hopes to Reduce Number of Troops in Kosovo by Autumn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary George
Robertson said here Thursday that he hoped to cut in half the
number of British troops in Kosovo by autumn.
</P>
<P>
"Our forces will come down by half. It depends on the number of
refugees. I'm hopeful we'll be able to (cut British forces) by
autumn," Robertson told the parliament's defense committee.
</P>
<P>
He said British General Mike Jackson, NATO's Kosovo commander,
was conducting an analysis on how many troops he would need.
</P>
<P>
Britain has 13,000 troops involved in the Kosovo operation. The
troops are now in Kosovo as part of a NATO-led peacekeeping
mission to ensure the safe return of ethnic Albanian refugees
following the withdrawal of Serb troops.
</P>
<P>
Robertson also said the treasury had confirmed it would meet
the cost of the Kosovo war from the government's contingency
reserves.
</P>
<P>
"At the end of May, the costs were 43 million pounds ($68
million), but that does not include replenishment (of military
equipment and weapons) which will be substantial. And that 43
million pounds will go up," he said, adding that the peacekeeping
effort will continue.
</P>
<P>
But the defense secretary declined to estimate the full cost of
replacing equipment and weapons, saying that some items were very
expensive and would bump up the final bill.

<HEADLINE> HK Imposes No Restrictions on Shipment Verifications of Strategic Goods: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Regional (SAR) Government has never and will not
impose any restriction on the U.S. agencies conducting pre-license
or post shipment verifications in Hong Kong, a government
spokesman said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the U.S. Senate's passing of the State Department
Authorization Bill on June 22 stipulating in certain provisions
that Hong Kong should be treated like the mainland or denied U.S.
export licenses if the U.S. is denied the right to conduct the
verifications, the spokesman reiterated that the provisions are
unnecessary as the U.S. authority is always free to call on Hong
Kong companies to do the pre-license and post-shipment
verifications.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong provisions in the Bill pay no regard to the
effectiveness of our systems and our status as a separate customs
territory and a separate trading entity.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to maintain an effective and autonomous strategic
trade control system after the reunification, which is regarded as
one of the best in the world by our trading partners. In
particular, our system has stringent special features to guard
against illegal transfer of strategic commodities," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Our system is law based and is totally transparent. We have
been working closely with the U.S. administration, building on the
solid foundation of cooperation as set out in an Agreed Minute
signed by the U.S. secretary of commerce and the secretary for
trade and industry," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He further pointed out that the HK SAR Government will continue
to keep in close contact with the U.S. administration officials
and congressmen to present Hong Kong's system and lobby against
the Hong Kong targeted provisions.

<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States must withdraw
all its troops stationed in South Korea, for the peace and
stability of the Korean Peninsula, said a spokesman for the DPRK's
Foreign Ministry here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remark following a recent U.S. proposal
for a pullout of all foreign troops from the Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
The Korean Central News Agency cited the spokesman as saying
that "The U.S. played with double standards as it pours in and
pulls out its forces, without caring about the interests of other
countries."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that the U.S. military presence in South
Korea has proved to be a threat to regional peace and stability,
and a possible cause for another Korean war.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Analyst Jeers at NATO Bombing of Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The robust retreat of Serb soldiers
from Kosovo surprised Western military analysts last week, as
hundreds of tanks and armored vehicles moved out after "the most
precise application of air power in history."
</P>
<P>
The opinion occupied a space of prominence in Thursday's "
National Post" newspaper of Canada.
</P>
<P>
Citing David Rudd, executive director of the Canadian Institute
of Strategic Studies, an article -- entitled "NATO air war far
less successful" -- argued that civilians and city infrastructure
suffered far more than the Yugoslav military in the declared
winning NATO bombings.
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of tanks that looked as though they were in
very, very good conditions," and "it looks like it wasn't a
military defeat for the Yugoslav army at all," Rudd was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The article said the Yugoslav army seemed far less demoralized,
better organized and much more battle-ready than anyone could have
expected after enduring two months of round-the-clock precision
bombing.
</P>
<P>
It is possible that Yugoslavia's widespread use of inflatable
decoys fooled NATO into claiming kills that never occurred, the
article said.
</P>
<P>
NATO said it dropped more than 20,000 precision, laser-or
satellite-guided bombs on Yugoslavia and insisted a remarkable 99.
6 percent found their targets.
</P>
<P>
But there are growing signs indicating that NATO wasted
expensive, precision-guided munitions on dummy targets, the
article said.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Northern Border Areas Shelled by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Residents in Israel's northern
border areas were instructed to stay in underground bomb shelters
Thursday afternoon after several Katyusha rockets fired from
Lebanon landed in the areas, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The rocket attack, in which no casualties have been reported,
were apparently launched by Hezbollah guerrillas following
reports that one Lebanese woman in south Lebanon was wounded by
shelling fired from the Israeli-occupied border zone.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli shelling was retaliation to previous operations
launched by guerrillas of Hezbollah, or Party of God, on Israeli
positions inside the occupied zone, the radio report said.
</P>
<P>
Saadah Mansour, 40, was wounded when her house in the village
of Kabrikha, just north of the so-called "security zone" carved
out by Israel in 1985 with a claimed aim of preventing
cross-border attacks, was hit by an Israeli shell.
</P>
<P>
She is the sixth Lebanese civilian wounded in Israeli shelling
in the same village in five days. The Hezbollah, who is fighting
to oust the Israeli army and its local militia South Lebanon Army
from the border zone, often fire Katyusha rockets or mortar fire
on northern Israel to retaliate the wounding of Lebanese
civilians.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army ordered residents in Kiryat Shimona and
Nahariyya, two border towns often targeted by Hezbollah
retaliatory rocket attacks, to enter bomb shelters, Israel Radio
said.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time in less than a week that Hezbollah
fired Katyusha rockets into northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Residents in western Galilee, south of the two border towns,
spent a tense night in bomb shelters Sunday after Hezbollah
slammed two Katyusah rockets there to retaliate the wounding of
three Lebanese civilians in Kabrikha by Israeli missile attack.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak has pledged to withdraw
Israeli troops from southern Lebanon within a year of office
through negotiations with Syria, the main power-broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Barak has until early next month to cobble together a
governing coalition, but his assistants said he might form a
government as soon as this weekend.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Orders for Durable Goods Rise 1.4 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Department said
Thursday that orders to U.S. factories for durable goods rose 1.4
percent in May, led by a big gains in aircraft, autos and other
transportation products.
</P>
<P>
Orders for big-ticket manufactured goods increased 2.8 billion
dollars last month to a seasonally adjusted 197.6 billion dollars,
the Department reported.
</P>
<P>
The rise followed a steep 2.3 drop in April and a 2.9 percent
gain in March. May's increase was the ninth in the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
Orders for transportation equipment rose a hefty 9.5 percent in
May, following a 12.6 percent decline in April and a 4.7 percent
gain in March. The transportation sector is often volatile from
month to month because it includes such big ticket purchases as
airplanes.
</P>
<P>
May's report said the rebound in transportation orders was led
by a big increase in orders for aircraft and airplane parts. U.S.
automakers are enjoying a good year of sales -- near record
levels.
</P>
<P>
However, if excluding the increase in transportation, overall
orders for durable goods would have fallen 0.7 percent in May, the
biggest decline since a 2.7 drop in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
Financial markets have grown increasingly nervous in recent
weeks that the Federal Reserve will begin raising interest rates
at their meeting next week to slow growth and keep inflation under
control.
</P>
<P>
One of the U.S. industries that has suffered the most from the
global economic turmoil has been steel. But today's report offered
a glimmer of hope that the worst of the crisis may be over.
</P>
<P>
Primary metals, the category which includes steel, rose by 0.7
percent in May, following a 1.4 percent gain April. It marked the
first back-to-back monthly gains in this sector in more than two
years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, orders for industrial machinery declined 2.5 percent
in May, following big gains of 3.6 percent in April and 3.5
percent in March.
</P>
<P>
Last month, shipments of big-ticket durable goods, a good sign
of current demand, also increased 1 percent.

BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Dalian Wanda
scored its first win finally this season as they defeated the
visiting Guangzhou Songri 3-1 in the 10th round of the Chinese
first division soccer league on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wanda, who won the league champion four times in the last five
years, slided to the bottom on the team standings last Sunday
after losing to Sichuan Quanxing 2-0, keeping their winnless
record intact.
</P>
<P>
The victory was precious for the fallen super 11, who is on the
brink of relegation. And their newly-appointed coach Li Yingfa,
who replaced Xu Genbao to take the helm last month was finally
able to take a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
But it was the visitors that took command after the start.
</P>
<P>
Formal Chinese national Hu Zhijun put Songri 1-0 up with a long-
range shot in the 15th minute. Wanda's goalie Han Wenhai touched
the ball but failed to stop it since the shot was too powerful.
</P>
<P>
Wang Peng levelled the score 30 seconds after the interval with
a header. Li Ming, Who failed to convert a golden chance to goal
in the 12th minute, made it 2-1 in the 66th minute.
</P>
<P>
Yan Song blasted the ball into the net right outside the area
in the 75th minute to seal the win for Wanda.
</P>
<P>
"I was satisfied with our players' performance," said Li Yingfa.
"But we must maintain the momentum and try hard to win more
matches since we're still in a unfavorable position. This is just
a beginning."
</P>
<P>
But he did not want to predict whether his side could win a
fifth champion since the Chinese professional league was
inaugurated in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"As long as our fans continue to support us, I think we will
not make them disappointed," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the other matches, Tianjin Taida tied Wuhan Heart K 0-0,
Shenzhen Ping'an beat Shandong Taishan 2-1, Chongqing Longxin
ousted Liaoning Fushun 3-1, Sichuan Quanxing edged Beijing Guo'an
1-0, Shanghai Shenhua routed Qingdao Hainiu 2-1 and Shenyang
Haishi drew with Jilin Aodong 1-1.

<HEADLINE> India Has No Intention to Cross LOC in Kargil: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Caretaker Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee Thursday made it clear that India had no intention
of crossing the Line of Control (LOC) in Kargil even as Pakistan
army took logistical control in Gilgit and Skardu regions in
Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (POK) from civil administration.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that Indian troops were facing difficulties in ending
the armed incursions in Kargil sector of Kashmir, Vajpayee told
newsmen here that "even then our intention is not to violate the
LOC and cross over".
</P>
<P>
"Till recently, any suggestion that New Delhi was thinking of
carrying the battle across the LOC was rejected outrightly by
official spokespersons. But for the past couple of days, they have
been saying that such an eventuality cannot be totally ruled out,"
Indian English newspaper 'The Statesman' noted here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"India now appears to be either building up a case for its
forces to cross the LOC, or talking in that vein to build up
international pressure on Pakistan to pull out intruders from
Kargil," it said.
</P>
<P>
Indian Chief of Army Staff V. P. Malik said here on Wednesday
that the possibility of crossing the LOC could be taken up with
the Union Cabinet if the situation warranted.
</P>
<P>
Caretaker Defense Minister George Fernandes Wednesday told
troops and air force fighters posted on alert across India's
Western front to "be ready for a war". "We must teach them a
lesson," he said time and again.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Food Agency Issues Urgent Appeal to Feed 800,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World
Food Program (WFP) has issued an urgent appeal for 40 million U.S.
dollars to avert widespread starvation among 800,000 people forced
to flee the continual fighting in Angola, U.N. officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The money will go toward more than 51,000 metric tonnes of
emergency food aid for the most vulnerable people during September
to December, when food shortages are expected to worsen, said the
officials.
</P>
<P>
"Unless food and cash are pledged now and the food delivered
quickly, WFP's aid pipeline will be exhausted by the end of
August," Francesco Strippoli, WFP representative in Angola, said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the people displaced from their homes are out
of the reach of emergency assistance and many of them are already
showing signs of malnutrition due to severe food shortages,
Strippoli said.
</P>
<P>
"Transportation of relief food by road is impossible because of
the upsurge in fighting and the high degree of insecurity in the
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Mid-May, WFP said that humanitarian conditions in the
northern city of Malanje, 450 kilometers east of the Angolan
capital of Luanda, had become "extremely worrying." The bombed-out
city is sheltering an estimated 100,000 people displaced by
fighting.
</P>
<P>
The mandate of MOUNA, the previous U.N. mission in Angola, was
terminated last February by the Security Council on the
recommendation of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan who said that
the peace process had collapsed and the country was in a state of
war.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan Government and aid agencies have issued warnings
that the civil war is creating a potential humanitarian
catastrophe with more than a tenth of Angola's 12 million people
displaced and dependent on scarce aid.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is still engaged in talks with the Angolan
Government on the future U.N. presence in the southwest African
country.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has accused rebel UNITA, the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola, of reneging on a 1994
peace accord that called for disarming its fighters.
</P>
<P>
Angola plunged back into civil war in December last year in
the final breakdown of the peace accord when the government
tried to ferret out UNITA fighters but failed to capture all the
diamond-rich areas they control.

People's Congress Standing Committee and Li Ruihuan, chairman of
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference.

<P>
Besides exchanging views on issues of common concern, the two
sides also expressed their hope to continue to support and help
each other and increase their mutually-beneficial cooperation
while building their own futures.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Beijing, Ranariddh also toured China's southern
city of Guangzhou and southwest Yunnan Province and visited
several enterprises. He briefed on the political situation and

<P>
ATHENS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Members of the environmental
organization "Greenpeace" on Thursday staged a demonstration
outside Greece's Development Ministry in Athens to draw attention
to the problem of dioxin contamination and genetically modified
animal feed.
</P>
<P>
Dressing as chickens, the protestors placed barrels with the
indication "toxic dioxins" and sacks of "modified animal feed" in
front of the entrance to the ministry and asked Minister Evangelos
Venizelos to take all the necessary measures to safeguard public
health, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
In Greece, dioxin pollution was some 135 grams annually, mainly
from industrial installations, and this was roughly 67,500 times
greater than the amount which caused the recent food scandal in
Belgium, the "Greenpeace" said.

<HEADLINE> Farmer Honored as China's First Anti-Narcotics Model (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Liu Tiangui, whose father and son
were both drug addicts, was honored today as the first "Anti-
Narcotics Model" in China.
</P>
<P>
When the National Narcotics Control Commission (NNCC) awarded
Liu the honorary title at a ceremony held here today, Liu, who
arrived in Beijing Wednesday, had driven some 12,500 miles across
the country calling for a crackdown on narcotics.
</P>
<P>
Liu, a farmer from Qingshui Village of Chengdu City in
southwest China's Sichuan Province, witnessed how young people
suffered when they were trying to kick the habit in a mandatory
drug rehabilitation center near his house.
</P>
<P>
"My father was a drug addict before 1949, when New China was
founded," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who has become well off since China started its reform and
opening up drive in the 1980s, found that his son had become a
drug addict 10 years ago. Fortunately, Liu managed to wean him off
the habit.
</P>
<P>
"Our country will never be peaceful if narcotics are allowed to
flourish," wrote Liu in a letter to the local public security
bureau.
</P>
<P>
"I decided to be a volunteer urging drug control," said Liu, "
in order to prevent parents being heartbroken and families being
broken up because of narcotics."
</P>
<P>
Liu started a "Long March" against drug in a van on January 20.
Over the past five months he has visited more than 30 big and
medium-sized cities in 28 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities.

<HEADLINE> Developing Sino-Russian Friendship Throughout Generations (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- In the mind of Oleg Korolyov, vice-
chairman of Russia's Federation Council, his China mission is not
only to promote economic and trade cooperation between localities
in the two countries, but is to say hello to the Chinese people
for his father.
</P>
<P>
"Before I came here, my father told me that I should express
respect for the great, diligent and brotherly Chinese people for
him during my visit. Now I can go home after fulfilling this
mission, " said Korolyov today at the end of a six-day visit to
China.
</P>
<P>
Korolyov's 86-year-old father, who once served as a former U.S.
S.R. Red Army member, joined the Chinese people in fighting
against Japan's invasion of China in northeast China more than a
half century ago.
</P>
<P>
"That experience left him with good memories, and I learned
about China and the Chinese people from his experience," Korolyov
said, adding that "I feel proud that my father joined the War of
Resistance against Japan."
</P>
<P>
Talking about the special sentiments of his family toward China,
Korolyov said that the tradition of Sino-Russian friendship was
not only inherited in his family, but also was rooted in the
hearts of the Russian people.
</P>
<P>
"The fine tradition of mutual support and cooperation,
initiated by the previous generations, should be carried on," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Korolyov was here for a Sino-Russian seminar on regional
cooperation oriented toward the 21st century, at which he said
that the potential in economic and trade cooperation between
localities in the two countries needs to be tapped to help promote
the further growth of Sino-Russian friendly relations in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
Russia is fully prepared to cooperate with China in energy,
metallurgy, agriculture and high technology, he added.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Fails to Meet Peace Challenges in Africa, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Foreign Minister
Seyoum Mesfin said Thursday that while the United Nations has made
a substantial differences in delivering its mandate in the past
half century, it has fallen far short of meeting the challenges of
peace and security and reducing poverty in Africa.
</P>
<P>
In his opening statement at the Africa regional hearing of the
millennium assembly here, Seyoum asked: "Has Africa received the
requisite solidarity and cooperation from the international
community within the context of the U.N. for it to be able to
overcome its challenges? Has the UN played an effective role for
peace in Africa in conformity with the provisions of its charter
to the same degree that it has in other parts of the world?"
</P>
<P>
Seyoum referred to conflicts in the Horn of Africa, Liberia,
Sierra leone and Angola to interpret U.N. failure in helping
Africa bring peace to the continent.
</P>
<P>
"The genocide in Rwanda which failed to be averted because of
inactions is a reminder of this state of affairs of neglect of
Africa and of the double standards applied to the continent," he
added.
</P>
<P>
On Africa's poverty reducing, he said that "the level of
international cooperation for Africa in this area has indeed been
meager and far from effective."
</P>
<P>
The two-day African regional hearing, organized by the United
Nations Economic Commissioner for Africa, is intended to provide
an open forum for African governments and civil society
representatives to share views and elaborate proposals on the
United Nations in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
About 350 participants will discuss the cooperation for
economic and social development in Africa, and the challenges of
development, peace and security in Africa, among others in the
meeting.

Korolyov came to Beijing in 1996 for the 96th conference of the
Inter-Parliamentary Union. "During my second visit to China, I saw
the great changes that have taken place in China over the past two
years," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The China that my father saw belongs to history. China today
is on the right track to build a prosperous and strong country,"
the Russian parliament leader said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the plainness, honesty and diligence of
the Chinese people remain unchanged. "During my visit, I felt that
the Chinese government and people are making efforts to promote
Sino-Russian relations, and the people of the two countries are
moving closer and closer," he added.
</P>
<P>
Describing Sino-Russian ties as "very good", which phrase was
often quoted in Chinese by his father at home, Korolyov said that,
because this year marks the 50th anniversary of the founding of
the People's Republic of China, Russia is expected to hold a
series of celebrations to highlight its determination to further
develop the traditional friendship and cooperative ties.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the further growth of Sino-Russian traditional
friendship is the common aspiration of the people of both
countries," he said.

Liu showed people posters, video tapes and handed out leaflets
in every place he arrived. Liu also expressed heartfelt resentment
towards narcotics by telling bitter stories of his family.

More than 1,000 people who were receiving drug rehabilitation
have listened to Liu's lectures. And tens of thousands of people
signed on a long banner of Liu's to voice their support for anti-
narcotics struggle.
</P>

The "Long March" has cost Liu 80,000 yuan (about 9,640 U.S.
dollars) of private savings, 30,000 yuan (3,615 U.S. dollars) of
borrowed money, and some 10,000 yuan (1,200 U.S. dollars) of
donation.

"It was a feat worth of appreciation that Liu unswervingly
stick to anti-narcotics promotion at his own expenses while taking

Liu, however, said that he only did what a citizen should do.
He planned to return home after finishing his promotion work in

<HEADLINE> Katyusha Rockets Fired into Northern Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Hours after a Lebanese woman was
wounded by Israeli shelling, a total of 15 Katyusha rockets were
slammed into northern Israel Thursday afternoon, Lebanese security
sources said.
</P>
<P>
It is still unknown whether the rockets that were launched from
south Lebanon had caused casualties or damage, the sources said,
adding no group has so far claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,
always fired Katyushas into Israel when Israeli operations caused
casualty on Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, a Lebanese woman was wounded during an
Israeli shelling on her village of Kabrikha just north of the
Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
She is the sixth civilian injured by Israeli shelling in the
same village in five days.
</P>
<P>
Two civilians were wounded in the village on Wednesday and
three on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli attacks came as a response to previous operations
launched by Lebanese guerrillas spearheaded by Hezbollah to oust
Israeli troops and its ally South Lebanon Army out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
But, a 1996 agreement reached between Israel and Hezbollah
after an Israeli 16-day blitz on Lebanon banned any attacks
from civilian area or on civilians.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.

<P>
MOSCOW, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Pristina airport remains under
the control of Russian peacekeepers, said Colonel-General Yuri
Baluyevsky, head of the Russian General Staff's Operations
Department, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The aerodrome will continue to be under the full control of
the Russian airborne troops and all movements on its territory can
only proceed on permission of the command of the Russian
peacekeeping group," the Itar-Tass news agency quoted Baluyevsky
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under a deal reached last week in Finland's capital of Helsinki,
the Slatina Airport, a few kilometers from the center of Pristina,
capital of the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, will be used by both
Russian and NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
Baluyevsky said a joint air traffic control center would be set
up at the airport to receive both Russian and NATO planes.
</P>
<P>
During the 77-day NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia, the
airport came under repeated attacks and communication and control
facilities were badly damaged, but the runaway remained intact.
</P>
<P>
In another related development, the Russian Aeroflot airlines
announced Thursday that it would resume flights to Belgrade on
Friday, Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
The air service between Moscow and the Yugoslav capital was
suspended following the commencement of NATO air strikes on
Yugoslavia on March 24.

<P>
A BN component party leader said the meeting was designed to
discuss the allocation of seats among BN parties in the coming
general election and the BN's preparations and strategies for the
election.
</P>
<P>
The current Parliament's term ends on June 7 next year, but
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who is also the BN chairman,
might call for an early poll this year to take advantage of the
economic recovery and the disarray among opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir, who chaired the meeting, ordered BN component parties
to activate their election machinery.
</P>
<P>
"The general election could be called at any time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said he would personally decide on the final list of
the BN candidates for the general election.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the allocation of seats among BN component
parties would be based more or less on the formula used
previously.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the general election would be held no later than
June next year. The last general election was held on April 24 and
25, 1995.
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's meeting, BN leaders exchanged views on national
issues which could be used for BN's advantage in the general
election such as the improving economy.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the leaders concurred that the BN would have to
deal with problems relating to rural development, which has always
been the BN's strongpoint.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the election campaigning period would be
shortened, Mahathir said it would be of normal duration (less than
two weeks).

<HEADLINE> Top Trade Union Official Urges Deepening of Anti-corruption Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official has
urged local discipline inspection personnel to deepen the anti-
corruption campaign by taking advantage of the on-going "three
emphases" movement.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide movement, targeting communist party officials at
all levels, puts the emphasis on education in theoretical study,
political awareness and good conduct.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, member of the Political Bureau of the Standing
Committee of the CPC Central Committee and the secretary of the
CPC Central Commission on Discipline Inspection, said discipline
inspection officials should improve their own political awareness
to better perform their duties.
</P>
<P>
Wei made the remarks during an inspection tour of northwest
China's Gansu Province June 16-24, where he visited enterprises
and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the present results of anti-corruption
work are far from meeting the requirements of the CPC Central
Committee and the great expectations of the public, even though
some achievements have been made.
</P>
<P>
Party committees and governments at al levels should strengthen
financial management work to prevent the occurrence of corruption
cases, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Anti-corruption work inside enterprises should be combined with
improving enterprise management, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wei, also the chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade
Unions, emphasized the role of trade unions in protecting the
rights and interests of workers, pushing forward reforms in
enterprises, caring for laid-off workers and supervising the

<HEADLINE> Thailand Opposes Linking Trade With Labor in WTO Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will propose that members
of the World Trade Organization (WTO) adhere to the agreement on
passing labor issues to the International Labor Organization (ILO)
and not link them with trade issues, a senior Thai Commerce
Ministry official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Thai News Agency (TNA) quoted Director-General of the
Department of Business Economics Karun Kittisataporn as saying
that Bangkok opposes proposals of some western countries that
labor issues be part of the next round of multinational talks on
trade in services, which will be held between November 30 and
December 3 this year in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
Allowing labor issues to be linked to trade would lead to
distortion of the real trade talks, as some countries might use
trade measures to retaliate against others, allegedly not
providing adequate protection for labor rights, Karun said.
</P>
<P>
WTO members must respect the agreement reached at the first
ministerial meeting held in Singapore in 1997 that rules out any
linkage between trade and labor issues and stipulates that labor
issues should be passed to the ILO, he said.
</P>
<P>
Karun said Thailand would propose that the talks be focused on
three main areas, namely to open more market access by lowering
import tariffs and tariff quotas, to cut governments' subsidies
and to deepen the study on genetically modified organisms.
</P>
<P>
The recent meeting of the Group of Eight industrialized nations
discussed linking trade and labor issues at the upcoming global
trade talks in Seattle, but no conclusion was reached due to
differing ideas and views.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi, who is also one of the two candidates for the WTO's
top post, earlier called on the new round of global trade talks to
ensure "balanced prosperity" for the entire international
community.

<HEADLINE> Thai Banks' Situation Improving: Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's banking sector have
achieved great improvement when compared to its situation late
last year, Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister
Supachai Panitchpakdi said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in response to a report Wednesday by
Moody's Investors Services, a U.S. rating company, saying that
Thai banks are still heavily insolvent in true economic term.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said that Thai banks were now at a much improved
status that could be seen in their abilities to recapitalize in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
It was possible, however, that local banks would have minimal
profits or incur some losses this year due to their cautious
policy to slow down or delay approving new loans to their clients,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Non-performing loans (NPLs) of the local banking system had
also declined when compared to those in late last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier report said that Thai banks' NPLs stood at 42.06
percent of the total loans in April compared to the 46-47 percent
in February.
</P>
<P>
The government's financial sector restructuring program has
helped reduce NPLs of local banks to a great extent, but further
reduction would also depend on improved economic conditions, which
has to take some time, Supachai noted.
</P>
<P>
About Moody's rating, Supachai said Moody's may not base its
latest rating of Thai banks on their most updated development and
data.
</P>
<P>
Moody's had upgraded its ratings of four major Thai banks,
namely Bangkok Bank, Thai Farmers Bank, Krung Thai Bank and Siam
Commercial Bank, from negative to stable on April 29 and from
stable to positive on May 2.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Nearly half of Australian
households have a home computer and the number of Australian
households hooked up to the Internet has soared to 1.3 million, a
five-fold increase in just two years.
</P>
<P>
That means almost one in five homes has Internet access, the
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said in its social trends
report issued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The number of households with computers rose from 1.9 million
in February 1994 to 3.2 million last November.
</P>
<P>
And the ABS tips 3.5 million households will have computers by
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
But the growth in Internet access has been even more rapid.
</P>
<P>
In February 1996, just 262,000 households, or 4 percent of the
total, had an Internet connection, but the number rose to 1.3
million by last November.
</P>
<P>
But daily computer usage at home rose by only six minutes to
103 minutes between 1992 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
Canberra residents led Australia in computer ownership, with 66
percent having computers and 28.2 percent linked to the Internet.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Mortgage
Corporation Limited (HKMC) signed the Master Mortgage Reinsurance
Policy with the American International Assurance Company Limited
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
HKMC is an affiliate of United Guaranty Mortgage Indemnity
Company.
</P>
<P>
Together with PMI Mortgage Insurance Co., Hang Seng Insurance
Company Limited and Asia Insurance Company Limited, the HKMC has
appointed four Approved Reinsurers to provide reinsurance for the
Mortgage Insurance Program.
</P>
<P>
Under the Program, the HKMC provides mortgage insurance to the
Approved Sellers for an amount up to 15 percent of the value of
the property to enable homebuyers to secure mortgage loans of up
to 85 percent LTV ratio. The HKMC hedges the exposure of the
mortgage insurance by taking out reinsurance with the Approved
Reinsurers.
</P>
<P>
The Mortgage Insurance Program continues to be well received by
the homebuyers. As of June 23, 1999, 740 applications have been
received from 22 Approved Sellers, involving a total mortgage
amount of 1,567 million HK dollars (or 200 million U.S. dollars)
and a total insured amount of 293 million HK dollars (or 37.56
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Secondary property accounts for over 90 percent of the
applications received so far, which indicates that the Program has
served to improve the liquidity of the secondary property market.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- With the emergence of a bigger
ageing population, the issue of senior citizens' cultural life
should be put on top of the agenda, said Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the number of Chinese aged over 60 has reached 120
million, making up an important part of our society. Therefore,
how to improve their cultural life is essential to social

departments at all levels should prioritize this task and improve
the situation by various measures.
</P>
<P>
Carrying out cultural activities is not only the government's
business, but a cause needing the whole of society's involvement.
Cultural and sports facilities should offer convenience and
privileges to senior citizens, and more community services should
be established to help them, Li added.
</P>
<P>
Li also pointed out that cultural and educational departments
should produce more excellent works for senior citizens,
especially those which reflect their lives.

<HEADLINE> 11th Panchen Lama Baptizes Lamas in Xigaze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIGAZE, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The 11th Panchen Lama, one of the
two top religious leaders in Tibet, today baptized lamas and
Buddhists in the Buddhism tradition at the Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery,
his main residence, in this second-largest city in southwest China
's Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
It was the first that the nine-year-old Panchen had baptized
lamas and religious followers.
</P>
<P>
The Panchen Lama told the lamas and believers to follow the
instructions of President Jiang Zemin, to love the country and the
religion, safeguard the country and serve the people, and make
contributions to the region's prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
Baptism is a ritual followed by monks of the Tantric sect of
Tibetan Buddhism when they enter a new stage of religious
cultivation.
</P>
<P>
The Panchen Lama entered a tent at 8 o'clock this morning.
Because of its esoteric nature, the ritual was shielded from the
public. One lama explained that the Panchen Lama and two other
Tantric masters had prayed together to instill their power into
the food and water to be distributed among the lamas and followers
to be baptised.
</P>
<P>
The Panchen Lama started to recite the sutra for longevity at
9:20. For the next two hours, he paused now and then to expound
some points when reciting the sutra of 10,000-odd words.
</P>
<P>
"Intelligent and diligent, the Panchen Lama is able to recite
sutras of more than 60,000 words," said Purbu Songzhub, one of the
young Panchen Lama's teachers.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Panchen Lama has an unusual understanding of
the sutras besides his outstanding memory, convincing his
followers that he is the true reincarnation of the last Panchen
Lama, who died in 1989.
</P>
<P>
After the recitation, the Panchen Lama told all present: "All
the lamas of Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery, including myself, and the
believers should love the Communist Party of China, love our
socialist motherland and love the religion we believe in."
</P>
<P>
He urged everyone to follow the example of the 10th Panchen
Lama and work for national unity, world peace, and the prosperity
and progress of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The lamas and believers then were baptized by the 11th Panchen
Lama.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President on Yellow River's Disaster Control, Development Issues (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DONGYING (Shandong), June 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President
Jiang Zemin has called for unremitting efforts to control flooding
on the Yellow River, better use its water resources and create a
good ecological environment along its entire valley.
</P>
<P>
Finishing an eight-day study tour today at this city in east
China's Shandong Province, where the Yellow River runs into the
Bohai Sea, Jiang described the harnessing and development of the
river as "a major issue of great strategic significance for the
benefit of the entire Chinese nation."
</P>
<P>
Zigzagging across the northern area of China, the 5,464-km-long
Yellow River is the second-largest river in China, after the
Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao, leading officials from
Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan and Shandong provinces and high-ranking
military officers, the president not only inspected hydrological
stations, and construction sites to reinforce dykes and hydropower
stations, but also visited local families, cities and oilfields
along the middle and lower reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
This is the sixth study tour made by Jiang to Yellow River
areas in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
At the Huayuankou Hydrological Station near Zhengzhou, capital
of Henan Province, Jiang asked experts to promptly provide
accurate hydrometric data as reference for policy-making and flood-
control efforts.
</P>
<P>
While inspecting construction work to reinforce the dykes in
Henan and an anti-flood exercise by local civilians and soldiers
in Shandong, Jiang repeatedly urged the locals to keep highly
vigilant against possibly serious floods this year, asking them to
ensure the safety of the dykes and the local people.

<TEXT>
<P>
New China has kept the river, which historically was notorious
for catastrophic floods, harnessed since its founding in 1949,
mainly through building dykes and water conservancy facilities.
</P>
<P>
A dozen large hydropower stations with a total generating
capacity of nine million kw have been built or are under
construction. A total of 7.3 million ha of farmland along the
river are now irrigated thanks to the water conservation
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made stops respectively at two major water control
projects at Sanmenxia and Xiaolangdi, and an irrigation facility
along the lower reaches of the river, where he emphasized
combining water control, rational use of water resources and
improvement of the ecological environment to seek a coordinated
development of the economy, population, resources and environment.
</P>
<P>
Worrying about severe soil erosion which constantly carries
sand into the river, Jiang called for unceasing afforestation
efforts and other ecological projects.
</P>
<P>
"Practical and effective measures should be taken to tackle the
water shortage problem, since it is becoming more and more
critical to the economic and social development of the areas along
the river," Jiang said in Henan. He stressed placing equal
importance on tapping water resources, avoiding waste of water and
curbing water pollution.

CHENGDU, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Sichuan Province in southwest
China has confiscated more than 200 kg of heroin since June last
year, the provincial anti-drug committee announced here today.

products that can be used to make drugs in the one-year period. A
number of drug traffickers were sentenced to death, the committee

Regulation on the Banning of Narcotics.

Moreover, a total of 74 drug rehabilitation centers have been
set up. Special courses on the dangers of drug abuse have opened

HONG KONG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The value of total sales of Hong
Kong in April 1999 is estimated at 14.3 billion HK dollars (1.8
billion U.S. dollars), a decrease of 10 percent compared with the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
After discounting the effect of price changes over the period,
the decrease in total retail sales volume was 4 percent, according
to the provisional figures on retail sales released Thursday by
the Census and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
The 4 percent decline in total retail sales volume recorded in
April represented a notable improvement from the decrease of 10
percent in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Analyzed by type of retail outlets, sales of motor vehicles
continued to show double-digit decrease, by 26 percent in volume
in April 1999 compared with a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
This was followed by sales of fuels (18 percent), and those of
jewelry, watches and clocks, and valuable gifts (13 percent).
</P>
<P>
The retail sales volume of clothing and footwear, however,
recorded a further year-on-year growth of 4 percent in April.
Sales of consumer durable goods other than motor vehicles also
returned to a positive growth, rising by 5 percent in volume
compared with the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
As to retail sales of food, alcoholic drinks and tobacco, there
was virtually no change in volume over the same period.
</P>
<P>
A Government Secretariat spokesman said that the overall
performance of retail sales improved considerably in April 1999,
along with an improvement in the local consumer sentiment and a
further pickup in inbound tourism.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Province Enjoys Surging Private Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Private enterprises, the most
rapidly developing sector in northeast China's Liaoning Province,
have emerged as a new growth point for the provincial economy.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show the province's 1.33 million private enterprises
employ close to 4.5 million people, or 20 percent of the total
provincial workforce.
</P>
<P>
Private investment has soared to 52.44 billion yuan and
accounts for 10 percent of the total registered capital for all
Liaoning enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The sector's 1998 sales volume hit 161.2 billion yuan,
including 88.6 billion yuan in turnover of consumer goods. The
latter figure accounted for 42.2 percent of the provincial total.
</P>
<P>
The sector also contributed 2.5 billion yuan in taxes, or eight
percent of the province's fiscal revenue.
</P>
<P>
"The private sector accounts for 30-50 percent of fiscal income
for most counties, with the figure for a number of counties
exceeding 80 percent," according to one provincial official.
</P>
<P>
The sector is also important channel for absorbing laid-off
workers from state-owned enterprises and has provided reemployment
for over 200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen provincial government departments launched a united
study of the sector in late 1998. The province is expected to
release regulations designed to accelerate the development of the
private sector in the near future.

<P>
URUMQI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Six drug traffickers were handed
the death sentence today by Urumqi Intermediate People's Court, in
the capital city of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, northwest
China.

China's Supreme People's Court has verified and approved the
punishment.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Raises Allowance of Troops in Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Thursday announced big increases in the compensatory
allowance for troops who are serving at an altitude of 12,00O feet
(3,658 meters) and above.
</P>
<P>
Sharif made this announcement while addressing troops stationed
in the Gultari sector, 14 kilometers off the Line of Control (LoC)
in the disputed Kashmir region and northeast of the Kargil sector
where intense artillery shelling has been exchanged across the LoC
recently.
</P>
<P>
The compensatory allowance of the soldiers serving at the
height of 12,000-13,000 feet (3,658-3,962 meters) will be
increased from the present by 40 percent to 50 percent. But For
those who are serving above the height of 13,000 feet, their
allowance level will be increased by 50 percent to 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
Because of the long-running tension with India over the Kashmir
dispute, Pakistan has stationed heavy troops in the mountainous
area where altitudes range from 6,000 feet (1829 meters) to 24,000
feet (7315 meters).
</P>
<P>
Sharif's visit to the LoC is comparable to that of Indian
caretaker Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on June 13 when he
said India didn't look forward to but never fear a war.
</P>
<P>
During the inspection at the front-line, Sharif renewed his
call for dialogue between Pakistan and India in a bid to defuse
the tension at the LoC.
</P>
<P>
He also visited Skardu Hospital and greeted wounded Pakistani
soldiers there.

<P>
CAIRO, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan expects Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak to exert efforts to help seek a solution to the
ongoing Pakistani-Indian disputes over Kashmir, a Pakistani
official said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Minister of Religious Affairs Rajah Zafer el Hajj met
with Mubarak after arriving here early in the day to deliver a
message to the Egyptian leader from Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif on the Pakistani-Indian disputes, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
El Hajj was in Cairo to attend an international Islamic
conference organized by Egypt's Higher Council for Islamic
Affairs, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, el Hajj said Mubarak
"has promised to work on" the issue, a move which the Pakistani
official said gives his country "a sense of assurance."
</P>
<P>
Cairo maintains close relations with both Islamabad and New
Delhi.
</P>
<P>
India accused Pakistani Muslims of infiltrating into the Indian
side of the Line of Control in Kashmir and has been shelling the
hilltops on which it said the infiltrators are entrenched in the
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan calls for a peaceful solution to the problem and sent
its foreign minister recently to New Delhi for talks on the issue,
which ended in failure to persuade India to stop military
actions.

<HEADLINE> Syria, Canada Talk on Peacekeeping on Golan Heights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Shara held secret talks here Wednesday with Canadian
Prime Minister Jean Chretien on a peacekeeping deal on the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
Canada's "National Post" newspaper said Thursday that the chief
envoy of Syrian President Hafez al-Assad pressed for the staying
of Canadian peacekeepers on the Golan Heights should an agreement
be reached with Israel over the area.
</P>
<P>
Canada has 187 troops among a 1,052-member U.N. peacekeeping
force, established in 1975, to maintain the buffer zone between
Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
"I had good talks with the prime minister. I conveyed a message
to him from President Assad," the Syrian envoy was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Syria hopes to get back all the Golan Heights from the Israelis
"so then the Canadians can turn to be a peacekeeping force along
the borders between Syria and Israel", the envoy noted.
</P>
<P>
But Canadian Press Secretary Jennifer Land has made it clear
that Mr. Chretien will not make a commitment on sending
peacekeepers until Damascus and Jerusalem engage in formal peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Farouk al-Shara arrived here on Sunday for a four-day official
visit, which was scheduled to be highlighted by the official
opening of the Embassy of Syria.

<HEADLINE> China's 1st Notables' Sperm Bank Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A sperm bank, which only accepts
donors with academic degrees equal to associate professor and
above, became operational early this month, causing heated
controversy.
</P>
<P>
The bank, known as the "Notables' Sperm Bank", is sponsored by
the Family Planning Technical Guidance Agency of this capital of
Sichuan Province, in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
It has received lots of phone calls and applications for
donations, mainly from intellectuals, says Huang Ping, manager of
the sperm bank.
</P>
<P>
The donors must be aged under 60 years and be healthy, and
there must be no congenital diseases in their families, she said,
adding that the Notables' Bank pays more for donations than
ordinary sperm banks do.
</P>
<P>
So far, all the applicants for donations have asked for
anonymity, Huang said. To avoid possible incest, one donor can
only donate sperm a maximum of five times, while one donor's sperm
will be used by women who live in different regions, according to
the bank manager.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some local experts have opposed the idea of opening
the sperm bank. Prof. Zhang Sizhong, a leading genetics researcher
at Huaxi Medical University, says that from the viewpoint of
genetics, the sperm of highly educated people may not be better
than that of others.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Yu Pingzhe, who teaches philosophy at Sichuan University,
questioned the ethics of the Notables' Sperm Bank, insisting that
both foolish and clever people have the right to live.
</P>
<P>
Sperm banks are still something new in China, and hospitals
find it very difficult to get suitable donations for infertile
couples.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champion Marie-Jo Perec says
she is fit again after two years out of competitive athletics and
is setting her sights on defending her two Olympic track titles in
Sydney next year.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published in the French sports daily L'Equipe
on Thursday, Perec said: "I'm thinking above all of the Olympic
Games. It's in Sydney that I have a rendez-vous with history."
</P>
<P>
Perec, who won the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics, said August's world championships in Seville, Spain,
were not a priority.
</P>
<P>
She added: "But if the chance arises to run decently in Seville
I'd go."
</P>
<P>
Perec, 31, has not competed at a major meeting since she
withdrew from the 200 metres semi-finals at the 1997 world
championships in Athens when she pulled a thigh muscle during her
warm-up.
</P>
<P>
She missed the 1998 season because of a viral illness and did
not return to proper training until February this year in
California, United States. Perec said. "I'm returning to Paris
soon and I'd like to run in some meetings between now and the end
of the season, but it's my body that will decide."

</P>
<P>
The Dubai Emirate has one of the most competitive gold markets
in the world.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture and Land
Reclamation will embark on its new fiscal year's plan next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Director of Agricultural Research Center Saad Nassar disclosed
that the plan envisages the consolidation of agricultural quarantine
stations, anti locust stations throughout the country, and overall

opportunities.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt has increased its exports by 4.7 percent in the

Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed Gowaili has said.
</P>
<P>
The increase amounted to 117 million Egyptian pounds (34.41

<P>
BEIRUT, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese woman was wounded
Thursday in Israeli attacks on her village in south Lebanon, the
Voice of the People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Saadah Mansour, 40, was wounded when her house in the village
of Kabrikha, just north of the Israeli occupied border zone in
south Lebanon, was hit by an Israeli shell.
</P>
<P>
She is the sixth Lebanese civilian wounded in Israeli shellings
in the same village in five days.
</P>
<P>
Two civilians were wounded in the village on Wednesday and
three on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli attacks came as a retaliation to previous
operations launched by guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah,
or Party of God, on Israeli positions inside the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
A 1996 agreement reached between Israel and Hezbollah after a
16-day Israeli blitz on Lebanon prohibited any attacks from
civilian areas or on civilians.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to dislodge Israeli occupation forces
and its ally South Lebanon Army out of the country.

BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Participants in the ongoing 10th
meeting of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) Standing
Committee today suggested draft legislation covering donations to
public welfare undertakings be submitted for a vote.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the draft, which has been revised by the
standing committee, has matured and should be submitted to the
session for vote.
</P>
<P>
Many members of the NPC Standing Committee said it is necessary
to adopt a law on donations in order to encourage and regulate
donation activities and protect the interests of both donors and
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
Cao Zhi, vice chairman of the committee, said the revised
legislation fully considers suggestions made during the committee'
s previous meeting and should be approved as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Committee member Teng Teng said the most important part of the
revision was the separation of voluntary donations and
solicitations for donations.
</P>
<P>
Some members stressed the draft should provide more specific
incentives in order to encourage businesses to donate to public
welfare undertakings.
</P>
<P>
The draft, which consists 31 articles in six chapters, deals
with issues such as the making and accepting donations, as well as
the use and management of donated assets and related incentives.

<HEADLINE> Australians Spend 478 U.S. Dollars Each on Gambling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Australian adults spend an
average 736 Australian dollars (478 U.S. dollars) each a year on
gambling, with people in the state of New South Wales the worst
offenders and pokies the most costly temptation.
</P>
<P>
A social trends survey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics
(ABS) said Thursday that in the fiscal year of 1996-1997,
Australians spent 6.5 billion U.S. dollars, or 3 percent of their
household disposable income, on gambling.
</P>
<P>
In the fiscal year of 1972-1973, gambling expenditure, the
amount wagered less than that won, was 1.6 percent of household
income.
</P>
<P>
"However, the recent rapid growth in gambling expenditure has
now begun to level out," the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
New South Wales, of which Sydney is the capital, has maintained
the highest per capita gambling expenditure, which reached 853
Australian dollars (554 U.S. dollars) in 1996-1997.
</P>
<P>
"People spend more time on gaming machines (poker machines)
than any other form of gambling," the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
But lotteries, lotto and pools were by far the most popular
forms of gambling throughout Australia, even though they accounted
for the least expenditure, it said.
</P>
<P>
The highest rates of participation were mostly in the states
where pokies were restricted.
</P>
<P>
Gaming machines came in second in popularity, followed by
racing and casinos.
</P>
<P>
Gambling participation rates increased steadily with age for
both men and women - from around 30 percent for 18-24 year olds,
to more than 55 percent for 55-64 year olds.
</P>
<P>
But rates declined for people aged over 65 years old.
</P>
<P>
Men are more than twice as likely than women to gamble on
racing, particularly in the under-35 and the 65-and-over age
groups.
</P>
<P>
On average, men gambled more frequently than women and spent
significantly more money on gambling.

LAGOS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior Sudanese official has said
that there was an on-going plan to seek Nigerian President
Olusegun Obasanjo's intervention in Sudan's civil war, The Post

</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Sudanese Minister of State for External

<P>
Rovic who is in Nigeria has already visited Benin Republic,
Gambia, Senegal, Togo and Cote d'Ivoire where he canvassed support
for an end to the on-going civil war.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters in Lagos that "I conveyed special message
from the President of Sudan, General Omar Hassan Al-Bashir to the
leaders of these countries," describing their responses as
"positive".
</P>
<P>
Expressing his optimism on final and decisive peaceful
arrangements in his country, Rovic noted that efforts by Nigeria
and other leading nations on the continent would help to achieve
this.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "our problems with Egypt and the United
States are being addressed," adding: "things are opening up in
relations between Sudan and other countries because we desire
peace."
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, Nigeria has involved in attempts to
reconcile the warring parties in Sudan, resulting in the Abuja I

interest rate hike and prompted high broad sentiment.

<P>
They noted that those who sold into the recent upsurge were
getting back into the market.
</P>
<P>
However, late profit-taking eroded early gains amid cautious
sentiment, bringing down STI from the record-setting intraday high
of 2,213.27 points.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Declares War on Trans-border Bandits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
has said his government would deal decisively with bandits
operating in the border towns, particularly in the northeast and
northwest zones.
</P>
<P>
In his address at the maiden meeting of the National Security
Council held in capital Abuja Wednesday, the president assured
that the government would curb any threats to security in the
villages in border areas where bandits operate.
</P>
<P>
"We have to enforce the confidence of our people and tell the
bandits that we won't fold our hands and let them do what they
like," Obasanjo stressed, New Nigerian newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Following heightened tension in the states bordering Niger,
Chad and Cameroun, Vice-President Atiku Abubakar last week
expressed the government's concern over the consistent threat to
life and property in the border areas.
</P>
<P>
He said Inspector General of Police Alhaji Musiliu Smith and
other security agencies had been mandated to deal with the
situation.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives had equally passed a motion
calling for stricter border checks, immediate completion of the
national identify card project and compensation for the victims of
bandits.
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, some bandits allegedly from Chad Republic raided
parts of Borno, Adamaw, Taraba and Pleateau states in northeastern
Nigeria, looting and inflicting injuries on a number of local
inhabitants.

<HEADLINE> Project Creates Brighter Tian'anmen Square </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Beijing authorities announced
today that the highly successful eight-month renovation project
has created a much brighter Tian'anmen Square.
</P>
<P>
The square is scheduled to reopen to the public by the end of
this month.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman with the Beijing municipal government said that 38
high intensity floodlights have been installed on four new poles
rising to heights of between 29-35 meters.
</P>
<P>
"The new lights will make night skies as bright as day,"
according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that brighter bulbs have been added to the 64
original poles.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of lights are added to decorate trees lining the
bypass, as well as the Great Hall of the People, Monument to the
People's Heroes, the Chairman Mao Mausoleum and various other
famous landmarks.
</P>
<P>
Tian'anmen Square, the largest square in world, covers 440,000
square meters. The famous landmark is fondly referred to as the "
Heart of China" because of its status as the venue for the most
influential events in Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
The existing lighting system was installed during the 1959
expansion project. Complaints that the darkness detracted from
mass activities sparked the ongoing renovation project.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Communist Party Central Committee approved the
project to beautify the square for 50th anniversary ceremonies
marking the founding of New China on October 1, 1949.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Special Envoy Arrives in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations secretary
general's special envoy for East Timor Jamsheed Marker arrived in
Dili, capital of East Timor, Thursday for a three-day visit,
according to Antara News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the Comoro Airport in Dili, Marker held a
closed-door meeting with East Timorese Catholic bishops Carlos
Belo and Basilio do Nascimento, who were about to leave for
Jakarta to attend the June 25-28 reconciliation meeting between
East Timor's warring factions.
</P>
<P>
Marker told reporters that he is visiting East Timor to make
preparations for the direct ballot.
</P>
<P>
"For that reason, I will hold dialogues with various parties
here to obtain inputs useful to the implementation of the ballot,"
he was quoted by Antara as saying.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the postponement of the ballot from August 8 to
two weeks later, he said this has been conveyed by U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan and that he has informed the Indonesian
government about it when he paid courtesy calls to President B.J.
Habibie, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas and Defense Minister/Armed
Forces Chief Gen. Wiranto Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that all parties would understand the
delay, saying the U.N. has to wait until the security in East
Timor is truly conducive to the ballot and the logistics
preparations are adequate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, spokesman of U.N. Assessment Mission in East Timor
(UNAMET) David Wimhurst said that Marker will meet with local
leaders and visit the districts of Baucau, Suai and Liquica to
observe the preparations for the ballot.
</P>
<P>
"What will be observed and discussed during his stay in East
Timor will be valuable inputs for the U.N. secretary general,"
Wimhurst was quoted by Antara as saying.
</P>
<P>
The August ballot in East Timor will allow the territory's
people to choose whether their homeland should become an
autonomous region within Indonesia or totally independent.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the U.N., which
still considers Portugal as the administering power of the
territory.
</P>
<P>
Early this year Indonesia announced it would grant East Timor
independence if the people in the territory reject Indonesia's
offer of a wide-ranging autonomy.

<HEADLINE> ADB Approves Road Loan to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
approved Thursday a 250-million U.S. dollar-loan to help China
build an expressway and upgrade feeder roads in the southwestern
province of Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
ADB said in a news release that the Southern Yunnan Development
Project will support the economic and social development of the
southern part of the province by removing a major road transport
bottleneck.
</P>
<P>
The project, scheduled to be completed by September 2003, will
also facilitate regional cooperation between Yunnan province and
neighboring countries such as Laos, Myanmar and Thailand, ADB
said.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan is one of the poorest areas in China. Average rural per
capita income in the project area is only about 0.32 U.S. dollars
per day, well below the international poverty standard of 1 dollar
per day.
</P>
<P>
According to ADB, the project will construct 147 kilometers of
four-lane toll expressway between two cities, Yuanjiang and Mohei,
in the province besides upgrading about 540 kilometers of feeder
roads.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the project will support institutional development
to improve expressway management and operation, construction
quality, road safety, and project monitoring and evaluation, ADB
said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB loan accounts for 32.5 percent of the estimated total
cost of 770.3 million U.S. dollars for the project. The remainder
of the cost will be borne by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be in U.S. dollars from the ADB's ordinary
capital resources and will have a maturity of 24 years, including
a grace period of four years.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate will be determined in accordance with the
bank's pool-based variable lending rate system for U.S. dollar
loans.

MOSCOW, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian champions Spartak Moscow
have lost some 35,000 U.S. dollars for playing their last home
match behind closed doors, a Luzhniki official said on Thursday.

right there."

<HEADLINE> NPC Session Deliberates Enterprise Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The draft law for solely
individual-funded enterprises should achieve the goal of both
encouraging and regulating the enterprises, according to delegates
to the 10th session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee here today.
</P>
<P>
Members of the NPC Standing Committee said that it is
imperative to have a law dealing with individual-funded
enterprises at a time when the country is developing a socialist
market economy.
</P>
<P>
The draft stipulates that the assets and other legitimate
interests and rights of these enterprises enjoy legal protection.
</P>
<P>
This will define the enterprises' legal status and should have
a positive effect in promoting their further growth.
</P>
<P>
As to whether the solely individual-funded enterprises could
use "company" in their names, the members had different opinions.
</P>
<P>
Some said that this provision is intended to prevent small
businesses from swaggering about and boasting by using big names.
</P>
<P>
Others said that the banning of "company" in the enterprises'
names does not conform with reality and is incompatible with
international practices.
</P>
<P>
In deliberating the draft, some members also voiced their hope
that the legislation contains items related to environmental
protection as some small enterprises are heavy polluters.
</P>
<P>
"Those producing shoddy goods should also be punished," they
said.

<HEADLINE> Sepeng Fined But Qualifies for World Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Olympic 800 meters silver
medallist Hezekiel Sepeng can compete in the world athletics
championships in August despite failing to show up in the national
championships, reports said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Athletics South Africa (ASA) announced at a news conference
that Sepeng had been fined 4,000 U.S. dollars for failing to
compete in the national championships, 2,400 of which is suspended
for 12 months.
</P>
<P>
Sepeng should have been ineligible for selection for both the
world championships and next year's Olympic Games, but after a
disciplinary hearing it was found that extenuating circumstances
had existed.
</P>
<P>
Sepeng had apparently written a letter to ASA president Leonard
Chuene on February 17 asking to be excused from the world
championships in Seville to allow him to concentrate on the Sydney
Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Hubei Securities Firm Wins Approval to Increase Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The China Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC) recent granted approval for Hubei Securities Co.
Ltd. to increase its registered capital from 300 million yuan to
one billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The company based in Wuhan, central China's Hubei Province,
will be the second Chinese securities firm to increase its capital
base. The company has also changed its name to Changjiang
Securities Co. Limited.
</P>
<P>
Xiangcai Securities Co. Ltd. in Hunan Province was the first
securities firm to win CSRC approval to increase its capital base
from 100 million yuan to one billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
China's first Securities Law, which is scheduled to enter
effect on July 1, divides securities firms into two categories.
Firms with registered capital of over 500 million yuan fall into
the comprehensive category and are permitted to underwrite new
stocks, while firms with less capital can only operate as brokers
with lower profit levels.
</P>
<P>
CSRC statistics show that China has some 90-odd professional
securities firms and an additional 230 firms engaged in part-time
securities business. An overwhelming majority of the firms
registered capital well below 500 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
CSRC officials have repeatedly asserted that enforcement of the
law will be a gradual process, and most securities firms have been
under pressure to expand their capital bases.
</P>
<P>
The CSRC is currently reviewing capital expansion applications
submitted by six firms.

<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Increasing numbers of China's air
passengers are paying their own fares rather than being sponsored
by enterprises or organizations, which is attributed to the
country's rapid economic growth and rising incomes.
</P>
<P>
 A recent survey revealed that this new breed of air traveler
accounts for 43.88 percent of the total, compared to 31.67 percent
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
 The passengers are mainly middle-aged people and youngsters,
who account for 43.38 percent and 46.92 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
 It also revealed that passengers on business trips make up
the majority of the civil aviation's customer base , accounting
for 58.53 percent.
</P>
<P>
 The survey, conducted by the China Civil Aviation Association,
questioned passengers flying between October 1998 to April 1999
and covered all large and middle-sized airlines and airports,

<HEADLINE> Pak Prefers Dialogue for Resolving Crisis With India: Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz reiterated Thursday that his country prefers dialogue
for resolving the current crisis in the disputed Kashmir area.
</P>
<P>
During a briefing with a group of Islamabad-based Chinese
correspondents, Aziz expressed the hope that the Indian side will
"respond positively" to the dialogue proposal he had made during
his latest visit to New Delhi and will come to the negotiating
table in a bid to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said it is "sad" that the Indian side had
rejected his proposal.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the G-8 summit this week also called for
resumption of Pak-India bilateral dialogue in the spirit of the
Lahore Declaration which was signed by the prime ministers of the
two countries in February this year.
</P>
<P>
The G-8 also urged both India and Pakistan to stop hostility,
stop fighting and respect the Line of Control (LoC).
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the G-8 proposal concerning the current crisis in the
region was the same as made by Pakistan. "Pakistan is ready to
respond to the G-8 proposal," he added.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that the tension on the LoC has been
escalated by India because of its heavy deployment of armed forces
and weaponry for "political and some other reasons."
</P>
<P>
Aziz is of the view that the current armed conflict in the
Kargil sector on the LoC is basically the reflection of the
long-running Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
"When the Kashmir problem is solved, issues like Kargil will
not happen," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question as how to assess the prospect of the
ongoing crisis in Kashmir, Aziz said, "We have, of course, been
ready in case there is any increased level of activities which
threat our security. We have to defend ourselves."
</P>
<P>
"But we prefer dialogue as it has also been suggested by the
G-8 group," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
To another question concerning the alleged "infiltration" by
Pakistan, Aziz said, Pakistan has never crossed the LoC. It is
India which has violated the LoC three times since 1972, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan is not calling them infiltrators, they are freedom
fighters. When the U.N. is not giving them the right of
self-determination for 50 years, and the Indians also denied that
right, they have to fight for their right," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the ongoing visit here by General Anthony Zinni,
commander in chief of the U.S. Central Command, Aziz said, Zinni
would be concerned that the current situation should not get out
of control, he would advise both sides to restraint, as "we are
exercising in any case."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that the current crisis could be
resolved if the two sides show their commitment to respecting the
LoC.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Kashmir, Aziz proposed that Pakistan and India
hold "a meaningful discussion" on it. The Kashmir issue, he said,
"needs a solution, not a temporary solution, but a sustainable
solution."
</P>
<P>
"We are ready for a U.N. role, we are ready for any mediator,
we are ready for good office," Aziz stressed.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that once the current crisis is resolved,
Pakistan and India will be able to discuss the core issue of
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question, Aziz said that "nuclear weapons are
basically a deterrent, they should never be used. And because of
the nuclear weapons, India will not expand the theater of war, and
there is no occasion to use it."
</P>
<P>
"Both India and Pakistan have to prove to the world that we are
responsible nuclear powers," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
To another query concerning the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
(CTBT), Aziz said Pakistan's position on signing the CTBT, as
announced by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif at the U.N. General
Assembly last September, is that Pakistan will sign the CTBT by
September this year in an environment which is free of coercion
and pressure.
</P>
<P>
He noted the precondition to that is both the economic and
military sanctions imposed on Pakistan must be removed.
</P>
<P>
However, the foreign minister also said that if India conducts
fresh nuclear test, "we have to reserve our right to respond."

<HEADLINE> Pak PM Renews Talks Offer to India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Thursday renewed his offer of talks to India for defusing a
war-like situation along the Line of Control (LoC).
</P>
<P>
"I invite the government of India to choose the path of
rationality and understanding," Sharif said while addressing the
troops at the height of 11,600 feet in Gultari sector along the
LoC.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should not only be made to put out the raging fire at
Kargil but also to extinguish the bigger fire which has now
brought the whole of Kashmir under its grip, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged India to de-escalate the situation because problems
could not be solved through war and conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Time and again, we tried to tell India that we want peace," he
said, adding that was the reason "we had extended an invitation to
India for talks."
</P>
<P>
"If there is war or if the present confrontation continues on
the borders, it will bring so much devastation, the damage of
which will never be repaired," said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
However, Sharif lauded the troops' efforts to effectively stop
the  Indian "incursions" along the LoC. "You are not fighting the
battle alone, as the entire nation is behind you," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Kargil sector, he said, "The occupation of Kargil
peaks by freedom fighters is the fruit of their 11-year-old
struggle for freedom."
</P>
<P>
It is the outcome of the sacrifices rendered by thousands of
Kashmiri brothers and sisters, he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the presence of 600,000 Indian troops in the "held"
Kashmir, the spirit of the freedom fighters could not be dampened,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he was confident that the Kashmiris would soon get
their right of self-determination.

<HEADLINE> Ministry of Railways to Promote "Arrival in One Day" Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Railways plans
to introduce a scheme for the rest of this year which will ensure
trains to and from major cities arrive in one day, in a bid to
shorten the time of some 2,000-km railway journeys.
</P>
<P>
By further improving the dispatching, the scheme is expected to
enable the original 30 to 35 hour journeys, starting from Beijing,
Shanghai or Guangzhou, to be completed in one day and one night,
to 21 to 22 hours, according to Li Zhonghao, vice director of the
ministry's Science and Education Department.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the scheme will greatly improve the railway's
ability to compete with airlines and road transport companies on
the medium-range and long-distance transportation market.
</P>
<P>
China's railway departments succeeded in speeding up trains on
three backbone railway routes: Bejing-Shanghai, Beijing-Guangzhou,
Beijing-Harbin in April, 1997 and October, 1998, respectively,
from below 100 km per hour to more than 100 km.

<HEADLINE> East Nile States Form Coop Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Minister of Water
Resources Shiferaw Jarso said East Nile countries comprising
Sudan, Egypt and Ethiopia have formed a joint cooperation
committee mandated to ensure fair utilization of the Nile waters
for carrying out development works.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian herald Thursday quoted Shiferaw as saying here
that the committee will meet at least once every month to discuss
matters by consulting the authorities of the three countries.
</P>
<P>
Shiferaw also said Ethiopia has been elected to chair this
technical committee.
</P>
<P>
Last month, 10 Nile River riparian states held a two-day 7th
conference of ministers of water affairs in Addis Ababa. The 10
Nile riparian states are expected to sign a final framework
cooperation agreement by the year 2002 at its 10th conference.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian minister said that conditions have now been
created, following cooperation agreements made with Nile Basin
countries, which allow Ethiopia to carry out development
activities on a wider scale by harnessing hydro-electric power and
diverting the waters of the Nile for irrigation and similar
activities.
</P>
<P>
He said, Ethiopia has water potential capable of generating
25-30 thousand megawatt of hydro-electric power, adding that the
country has harnessed at present only 370 megawatt.
</P>
<P>
He added that comprehensive development and investment plans
have also been prepared by the Nile Basin countries while projects
have been drawn in a very unambiguous and transparent way
sufficient to build mutual confidence among riparian states.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The number of stock investors has
been surging by more than 4,000 a day in the Chinese capital for
the past three days as a result of the bullish market.
</P>
<P>
The number in the city had climbed to a total of 1.52 million
by June 23.
</P>
<P>
A growing number of Beijing residents have opened stock
accounts since May 19 when the stock market started to take an
upward trend. They opened 2,200 stock accounts in the first week,
4,500 in the second, 6,200 in the third, 7,400 the fourth and 13,
000 in the fifth, according to Zhang Jinglin, vice-president of

</P>
<P>
Zhang said his company has opened new service windows, extended
service hours, and even added mobile service outlets to cope with
the rocketing number of new investors.
</P>
<P>
"Some stock companies are trying to lure more investors to open
trading accounts by waiving the accounts opening fee," said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Training schools and paging companies are also reaping fat
profits from the surge in stock investors.
</P>
<P>
"We offer classes in stock investing once a week now, compared
to once in two or three weeks in the past, and 80 percent of our
students are new stock investors," according to the president of
the Super-wave Securities School in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese stock market has ridden the wave of an upward trend
since May 19, and the Shanghai Composite Stock Index set a new

<HEADLINE> Senior Legislator Explains Draft Interpretation of Basic Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- It was both necessary and
appropriate for the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC) to interpret relevant articles of the Basic Law of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), according to
Qiao Xiaoyang, vice-chairman of the Legislative Affairs Committee
of the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the ongoing 10th meeting of the NPC
Standing Committee members which opened Tuesday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He said that HK SAR Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa presented a
report to the State Council on May 20. Tung asked the Central
Government to help solve the problems occurred in implementing
relevant articles of the Basic Law, in accordance with the right
granted by Article 43 and Article 48 (2) of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The State Council then put forward a proposal to the NPC
Standing Committee, seeking for interpretation of Article 22 (4)
and Article 24 (2)(3) of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that according to a meeting of chairpersons of the
NPC Standing Committee, issues mentioned in the proposal were
related to interpretation of some relevant articles of the Basic
Law made by the HK SAR Court of Final Appeal in a judgment
announced on January 29, 1999.
</P>
<P>
He noted that according to Article 158 (3) of the Basic Law,
the Court of Final Appeal should ask the NPC Standing Committee
for interpretation of relevant articles before giving the final
judgment if the case was about affairs governed by the central
authorities or about the relations between the Central Government
and the HK SAR government, and if the interpretation would affect
the ruling.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the HK SAR Court of Final Appeal did not
request the NPC Standing Committee to interpret the articles, and
its own interpretation ran counter to the legislative intent of
the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
According to the provisions of the Constitution and Article 158
(1) of the Basic Law, it was both necessary and appropriate for
the NPC Standing Committee to interpret relevant articles of the
Basic Law in order to ensure correct implementation of the Basic
Law.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of NPC chairpersons therefore has advanced a draft
interpretation and asked advice from a commission on HK SAR Basic
Law under the NPC Standing Committee.

<HEADLINE> China Widens Traders' Qualification Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to lift the
restrictions on who can take the qualification test to become a
certified trader and thrown it open to anyone, instead of only to
foreign trade companies, in a bid to meet the increasing demand
for such personnel, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Department of Personnel of MOFTEC told
Xinhua that "certified traders" are now in short supply in China
since more and more companies have gained the right to do import
and export business.
</P>
<P>
In the past couple of years, China gave the authority to carry
out foreign trade not only to actual trading companies, but also
to industrial enterprises, foreign-invested companies, private
firms and research institutes.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, certified traders with a basic knowledge and
experience of foreign trade business are now in great demand,"
said the official, who declined to be identified.
</P>
<P>
A certified trader can engage in not only commodities trade,
but also service and technology trade. They can participate in the
negotiations for imports, exports, contracting and bidding, said
the official.
</P>
<P>
Now anyone, including those working in foreign trade companies,
students, companies with import and export licenses and research
institutes, are allowed to participate in the test, which will be
held annually from this year.
</P>
<P>
Those who pass the test will be issued with a certificate
effective for five years. Certificate holders may find it easier
to get a job with relevant companies, said the official.
</P>
<P>
China introduced the test in 1989. A total of 230,000 people
have applied but only 60,000 passed the test and were awarded with
certificates. Most of them are now working in China's foreign
trade companies.

<TEXT>

<P>
PORTLAND, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Norway found
their rhythm in their second group match, beating Canada 7-1 at
Washington on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The victory sent Norway into the second round of the 1999
Women's World Cup. They beat Russia 2-1 in their first match.
</P>
<P>
Ann Kristin Aarones, last World Cup's Golden Shoe winner, scored
twice in the first half to give Norway a 2-1 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Norway turned up the intensity and dominated
the play. Unni Lehn, Hege Riise, Linda Medalen, Marianne Pettersen
and Solveig Gulbrandsen each scored a goal.
</P>
<P>
The victory added three more points to Norway's credit, assuring
they a berth in the second round with six points.
</P>

After playing their third and final group match against Japan,
Norway will travel to San Jose for a quarterfinal match on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Canada's sole goal in the match was scored by Charmaine Hooper
in the first half.
</P>
<P>
The match served as a severe setback to the Canadians as they
have one point and a -6 goal differential. They could still advance
with a win on Saturday against Russia, however the goal differential
will be a difficult obstacle to overcome.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Citizens Pawn Possession To Buy Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- As China's stock market enjoys a
bull run these days, people in Shanghai, the largest Chinese city
where one of the country's two bourses is located, have flocked to
the local pawn shops with jewelry and other valuable possessions
to swap in cash to enable them to buy shares.
</P>
<P>
"The stock market is in the middle of a golden time now, and I
need money badly to buy more shares. I can get the pawned items
back after selling my stock at a higher price, and it will turn
out to be a good deal," said a man who sent jewelry and even his
wristwatch to a pawn shop.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu Xianda, manager of the Shanghai Hualian Pawn
Shop, the shop's business volume has surged in the past few days.
At its peak the shop loaned more than 300,000 yuan (about 36,000 U.
S. dollars) in a single day, 50 percent more than the usual figure.
</P>
<P>
Apart from jewelry and watches, items Shanghai citizens pawned
included motorcycles and the title deeds of private houses, said
Wu.
</P>
<P>
There are now a total of 12 pawn shops in Shanghai, which
usually offer one month long short term loans worth some 50 to 80
percent of the items' value.
</P>
<P>
Many other Shanghai residents also sought loans from banks with
their fixed deposit certificates as security. According to
statistics from a local commercial bank, the number of such loans
it handled since early March has soared to 2,000 a month from the
previous 1,000.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that most of the new loans have flowed into the
stock market," said a bank official.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Stock Exchange's composite stock index Wednesday
exceeded 1,600 points, reaching a new historical high.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Boost Hopes of Qualifying for Second State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
PORTLAND, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Sweden boosted their hopes of
qualifying for the second round with a 3-1 win over Australia at
Washington on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Entered entered the match against Australia as the bottom team
of Group D as they lost their first match 2-1 to China at San Jose.
Australia tied for the second place after a frustrating 1-1 draw
with Ghana.
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's match, Sweden found the net first, scoring at the
ninth minute. Jane Tornqvist headed home a well-placed corner kick
from Malin Andersson to give Sweden an early lead.
</P>
<P>
At the 14th minute, Andersson nearly added a goal when her
attempt from outside the penalty area sailed just over the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
Hanna Ljungberg finished a cross from Kristin Bentgsson in the
21st minute. Bengtsson's pass barely found its way past the
Australia's goal-keeper. Ljungberg easily tapped it into the open net.
</P>
<P>
Julie Murray kept Australia in the match when she stole the ball
from a Swedish defender and the rushed onto a goal and slotted home
at the 32nd minute for her second goal in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
But Australia's hopes of getting an equalizer were dashed by
Ljungberg at the 65th minute when she sealed the 3-1 victory for the
Swedish team.
</P>
<P>
With only one point from two matches, the Australian team face
long odds of advancing. They must beat Group D leaders China on
Saturday and have the right results fall into place in the match
between Ghana and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Australia making the quarterfinals would clarify the race for
the 2000 Summer Olympics berths. As the host to the Sydney Olympic
Games, the Australian team have an automatic bid, seven other places
in the field remain. The least scenario for determining the Olympic
participants would take place if Australia advance.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan's Parliament Fails to Pass No-Confidence Vote in Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan's parliament failed to
pass a no-confidence vote in the government Thursday after
lawmakers had refused to adopt amendments to the national budget,
a news report said.
</P>
<P>
The government called for the no-confidence vote after the
parliament refused to adopt the amendments Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, a two-thirds majority is needed to pass
a no-confidence vote in the government. If the motion had been
approved, President Nursultan Nazarbayev would have had to order
the government to resign or dissolve parliament.
</P>
<P>
With the vote's failure, the budget amendments are adopted
automatically.
</P>
<P>
The amendments call for a reduction of revenue by 11.5 billion
tenge (about 87.8 million U.S. dollars) to 278.4 billion tenge (
about 2.1 billion dollars) and a cut of 18 billion tenge (about
137.4 million dollars) in expenditure to 338.8 billion tenge (
about 2.6 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> China Confident of Meeting Population Control Goal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- China has expressed full
confidence in meeting its goal of keeping population within 1.3
billion by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Looking at the progress being made toward this end, we have no
doubt that the target will be hit," said Yang Kuifu, deputy
minister in charge of the State Family Planning Commission (SFPC)
here today.
</P>
<P>
Yang is in this coastal city in northeast China attending a
seminar on population control. He said the conclusion was drawn
following comprehensive study based on a recent sample survey by
the State Statistics Bureau (SSB) and on thorough consideration
that some local officials might have concealed accurate population
figures.
</P>
<P>
Population control is a vital part in China's family planning,
a basic state policy. The population control goal is set in line
with the most populous country's social and economic development
program. Total population in China stood at 1.248 billion at the
end of 1998, according to the SSB.
</P>
<P>
The figure includes an increase of 11.84 million, up 0.95
percent from the previous year, and after subtracting the number
of 8.07 million people who died in the year."This was the first
time China's population growth rate was below one percent since
the 1970s," said Yang.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that population growth continued to slow
down in the first half of this year, and many experts believe that
China will probably add another 11 or 12 million people this year
to bring the total population to around 1.26 billion.
</P>
<P>
Average reproduction rate of Chinese women at child-bearing age
has dropped from 1970's 5.8 to two in 1997, placing China among
the low birth rate countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in population growth is also attributable to a
gradual change in people's attitudes towards having children.
People used to be obsessed with a long-standing concept: more
children, more happiness.
</P>
<P>
From the 1st century A.D. to 1949, China's population increased
ten-fold to reach 500 million. But the figure astonishingly
doubled in the following 30 years.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, China introduced the One-Child policy (one child per
couple), with some exceptions in rural areas which means that some
farmers can ask permission to have a second baby.
</P>
<P>
Real progress in keeping the count down were first seen in
cities, where the people are better-off and life style is more
modern, and where some couples are actually not inclined to have a
baby anyway.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang, major cities in ten eastern provinces have
actually reported a zero growth rate of population.
</P>
<P>
The major obstacles are in rural areas, where 70 to 80 percent
of the Chinese people live. Serious consideration is given in
these places to maintaining traditional philosophies such as the
continuation of the clan which can only be realized by a male
child. Its interruption would be a catastrophe for a family.
</P>
<P>
What follows does not usually have a happy ending. Families
with more children tend to be more poverty-stricken because
feeding them is a difficult job, not to say their schooling.
</P>
<P>
Today, however, the situation has changed in many areas. "In
our village, 69 women are qualified to apply to have a second baby
in accordance with the government policy, but only nine have
expressed any interest," said Xue Yuhuan, a villager of Qidingshan
village in coastal Liaoning province.
</P>
<P>
In another case, Yao Anhua, a farmer in the Baise Prefecture in
southwest Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, said that he did not
want to have more children. Instead, he would place top priority
on his kid's education which he said would help the child find a
well-paid job in the future.
</P>
<P>
According to Chao Jingchun, a member of the China Population
Society, the biggest change in attitudes is because an increasing
number of people realize that the government's targets are
actually in their personal interests.
</P>
<P>
The development of a socialist market economy, the mounting
media campaigns, and the improvement of the social welfare system,
helped in transforming people's way of thinking, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yang added that another very welcome measure has
been the introduction of a flexible policy which allows farmers to
freely choose contraception methods.
</P>
<P>
"I have not heard of a single case of a forced abortion in my
village for many years," said Zhao Guiqing, a village birth
control official.
</P>
<P>
China has only seven percent of the world's arable land, but
has to feed one fifth of the world's population. And it faces a
shortage of energy and environmental deterioration. "So, it has no
choice but to control population growth," said Tian Xueyuan,
director of the Population Institute of the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"If there is a population explosion in China, the whole world
will be affected," he added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indonesia's Political Struggle Shifts to Upcoming Presidential Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- With the Indonesian Democratic
Party of Struggle (PDI-P) led by Megawati Soekarnoputri certainly
to win the June 7 general election, the political struggle has now
shifted to the presidential election later this year.
</P>
<P>
Despite winning the general election, Megawati can not
automatically become president because Indonesia's national leader
is elected by the 700-member People Consultative Assembly (MPR),
comprising 462 elected legislators, 38 military appointees and 200
selected regional and group representatives.
</P>
<P>
Although PDI-P will likely win the parliamentary election with
about 40 percent of the votes, it is not enough for her to control
the 500-seat House or MPR.
</P>
<P>
Horse-trading and coalition building has already heated up
among the political parties to prepare for the November
presidential election. The National Awakening Party (PKB) threw
its weight behind Megawati while the United Development Party
(PPP) supported incumbent President B.J. Habibie for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
The two Muslim-backed parties are expected to play a major role
in shaping the next government as no single majority will come out
of these elections. So far, the PKB ranks third in the provisional
tally, while the PPP runs fourth.
</P>
<P>
PKB leader Taufikurrahman Saleh Wednesday said the party will
drop patron Abdurrahman Wahid from its candidacy and will instead
support Megawati.
</P>
<P>
PPP leader A.M. Saefuddin said that his party will throw its
support behind Habibie in the MPR general session in November.
</P>
<P>
Another Muslim-backed party, the National Mandate Party (PAN),
now fifth in the provisional tally, has expressed its support to
Megawati.
</P>
<P>
PAN General Chairman Amien Rais said that he had buried his
dreams of becoming president and implied that the president's
gender was not of concern to PAN.
</P>
<P>
The powerful Indonesian Armed Forces (TNI) has repeatedly
reiterated that TNI was hoping that the best citizen in the state,
"either a man or a woman," would be elected president.
</P>
<P>
However, Megawati is facing a bumpy road to the presidency as
some Muslim groups have aired their disagreement over the
possibility of a female president in the world's largest Muslim
country.
</P>
<P>
PPP has recommended that only a male Muslim candidate be
eligible for the presidency. Some public figures have also stated
that a woman should not be permitted to lead the country.
</P>
<P>
At a discussion in Jakarta on Wednesday, Emil Salim, who served
as environment minister under former president Soeharto, said
Megawati has more right than any other contenders to become the
country's next president because her party gained the lion's share
of votes in the election.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of volunteer election monitors, mostly women,
Wednesday staged a protest outside the House of Representatives,
condemning Muslim groups that claim Megawati can not become
Indonesia's next president because she is a woman.
</P>
<P>
The Movement for Anti-Violence Against Indonesian Women Tuesday
called on the public to accept the results of the election and the
presidential election. The group of 50 non-governmental
organizations said they suspected efforts to prevent Megawati from
running for presidency.
</P>
<P>
The Forum of National Communications for Alumni of the
Nationalist Student Movement Monday declared its support for
Megawati.
</P>
<P>
As no single party is expected to win the majority of votes in
this general election, many fear that the Golkar Party could bribe
unelected (and many elected) members of the MPR to ensure that
Habibie, its sole candidate, is elected for another term.
</P>
<P>
Golkar Party has also indicated that it may review the
nomination of Habibie if its approaches to other political parties
do not produce positive results.
</P>
<P>
With fears of a deadlocked presidential election looming,
Chairman of the Nahdlatul Ulama Muslim organization Abdurrahman
Wahid last week suggested a separation of power between the head
of government and the head of state.
</P>
<P>
He said the head of state should only perform protocol tasks,
while the head of government should carry out functional duties.
</P>
<P>
Wahid's idea has met with opposition from critics who say the
proposal is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
Chief of TNI territorial affairs Lt. Gen. Susilo Bambang
Yudhoyono said the military was seeking alternatives to avoid a
possible deadlock in the presidential election.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Spokeswoman Refutes Japanese Official's Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue today strongly refuted a Japanese official
's remarks concerning the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular news conference here, Zhang said that any
attempt to incorporate Taiwan into the scope of Japan-U.S.
security cooperation constitutes a serious infringement upon China
's sovereignty and a gross interference in China's internal
affairs, and is unacceptable to and will be firmly opposed by the
Chinese government and people.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said this when asked to comment on the June 23 remarks
made by Taku Yamazaki, a Japanese parliamentarian from the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party and chairman of the Special Committee of
Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation Guidelines of Japan's House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Yamazaki said that Japan would surely provide support to the
United States if China liberates Taiwan by force, which he
believes will "bring about major influence on the peace and
security of Japan."
</P>
<P>
"We are surprised by and indignant at the remarks made by an
important official of Japan's ruling party to interfere in China's
internal affairs," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
As is known to all, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's
territory and the Taiwan issue is purely China's internal affair,
Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government has made clear-cut commitment and
statement to this effect in the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement, the
spokeswoman said.

<HEADLINE> Manila Ready to Evacuate Residents Near Mayon Volcano </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government assured
the public Thursday it is ready to evacuate residents living near
Mayon volcano in Bicol region in the central Philippines, should
it again show signs of imminent eruption.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Orlando Mercado of the Department of National Defense
said his office has made the necessary arrangements with local
officials in the area.
</P>
<P>
"Our regional officers are ready and organized. We are ready to
evacuate persons," Mercado said in a radio interview Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Mercado also chairs the National Disaster Coordination Council,
which supervises over the Regional Disaster Coordination Council
in Bicol.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Mayon volcano raised fears among local residents
when it emitted ash. Authorities have marked the area within the
volcano's six-kilometer radius as a danger zone.
</P>
<P>
"We don't think the chances of Mayon erupting are that big. The
signs that the volcano is manifesting show that there is less
likelihood of a huge explosion taking place," Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that this does not mean the government has
become complacent. "It would be a tragedy if human lives are
sacrificed because of carelessness," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Reinforces Typhoon Preparedness (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- China has intensified efforts to
prepare for the approaching typhoon season, according to the State
Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The extensive effort has centered on reinforcing embankments
and dikes and establishing dense windbreaks in coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
China is highly vulnerable to typhoons due to unique geographic
conditions and extensive coastline stretching over 19,000
kilometers, according to officials with the China Meteorological
Administration. They noted that the country is especially
vulnerable to tropical cyclones spawned in the northwest Pacific
Ocean and the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
An average seven to eight typhoons hit 11 coastal provinces
annually, with tropical cyclones affecting as many as 25 provinces.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that typhoons destroyed 4.67 million
ha. of crops and heavily damaged more than 400,000 houses between
1990-1997, with direct losses averaging some 20 billion yuan
annually. The fact that only three typhoons hit the country in
1998 led to a sharp drop in losses.
</P>
<P>
China has placed great emphasis on strengthening typhoon
preparedness in coastal areas, with related efforts including the
construction of sea walls and embankments stretching 13,500
kilometers. Related fortifications stretching some 5,965 km, or 1.
23-fold more than in 1993, fulfill the highest state standards.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu Province plans to invest 1.8 billion yuan (217 million
US dollars) this year to standardize local river and sea walls.
All sea walls in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region
fulfill state standards.

<P>
Leaders in the coastal provinces, autonomous regions and cities
bear the responsibility for typhoon preparedness in their
respective areas. Some 342 counties and cities especially
vulnerable to typhoons have adopted typhoon preparedness measures.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has accelerated efforts to update typhoon preparedness
systems, including surveillance, forecasting, warning and
telecommunications systems. Tianjin, major port city in north
China, has allocated 550,000 yuan (62,300 US dollars) to establish
storm surveillance systems. Meteorological and water conservancy
departments in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, have strengthened
cooperation and introduced timely measures to deal with typhoons.
</P>
<P>
Hainan, China's southernmost island province, has established a
1,480-km coastal shelterbelt, or "green wall" circling the island.
Southeast China's Fujian province has established coastal
windbreaks stretching 3,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
"Green walls" shelterbelts currently protect over 11,000 km of
the country's coastline.
</P>
<P>
Authorities at all levels and the general public as a whole
have gained an increasing awareness of the importance of efforts
to reinforce preparedness for all types of natural disasters.
Related effort has established a solid foundation enabling the
country to reduce the typhoon losses to a minimum.

<HEADLINE> China Trounce Ghana 7-0 at Women's World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
PORTLAND, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China scored their second straight
victory, trouncing rough-tackle Ghana 7-0 in a Group D match here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team, who beat Sweden 2-1 in their first group match
at San Jose, took an early lead through captain Sun Wen who beat the
Ghana team's off-side trap and volleyed past Ghana goal-keeper at
the 9th minute.
</P>
<P>
Sun Wen went on to completed her hat-trick at the 21st and 54th
minutes. She also hit the post twice.
</P>
<P>
The Ghana team, which had one player sent off and other four
booked in their first match against Australia, still adopted a
rough-tackle tactic in the match. They time and again fouled down
Chinese players and earned two yellow cards quickly in the first half.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team, with better technique and splendid team-work,
totally out-played their opponents. They were 3-0 up at the 21st
minute with forward Jin Yan also scored one goal at the 18th minute.
</P>
<P>
After taking a 3-0 lead, the Chinese team played relaxed and
seemed satisfied with the scoring as they restrained their
attacking, trying to avoid injury from Ghana's tackle.
</P>
<P>
But the Ghana team would not give up their tactic. In the
second half, they tackled even harder and at the 52nd minute, Regina
Ansah was shown the red card after a brutal foul.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team made two substitutions in the second half, that
allowed young player Zhang Ouying scored twice from bench. Zhao
Lihong also added one in injury time to seal up the 7-0 victory for
China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Ma Yuanan was not overjoyed with the big-margin
win. He said his players played well in the match, but it was not
the time yet to celebrate as the tournament would be tougher and
tougher for China.
</P>
<P>
"I asked my players not to be too excited," Ma said, "We will
have to recover quickly as tomorrow we will have a long journey to
New Jersey."
</P>
<P>
China would be the most travelled team in the tournament. If
they can enter the final, they should travel up to 10,000
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Asked how he could motivated his players for the third match
against Australia since they have already qualified for the
quarter-finals, Ma said:" I would just ask my players to try their
best in every match."
</P>
<P>
Captain Sun Wen, a three-time World Cup player, said after the
match that the victory was no surprise for her.
</P>
<P>
"We knew we could win the match. The great margin is no reason
for us to celebrate as we all know it is not the most important match."
</P>
<P>
Sun said she was not happy with the way the Ghana team
played:"Their tackle tactics was dangerous, some of them were from
the behind. That is a great threat to our team as we could not
afford injuries as we will play the next stage of the tournament."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in a Group C match played here on Wednesday, Russia beat
Japan 5-0.

<HEADLINE> World's Longest Canal to Be Extended to Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal,
the world's longest, will be extended to the East China Sea as a 1.
8-km-long waterway is dug in the near future in east China's
Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The new waterway will act as a connection linking the existing
Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal and Hangzhou-Ningbo Canal with the
Yongjiang River, which flows into the East China Sea in Ningbo, a
major port city in Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the linking up of the two canals, the river and the
sea will help the Grand Canal to resume its status as a major
transport waterway.
</P>
<P>
The 1,789-km-long Grand Canal runs from Beijing, China's
capital, to Hangzhou, provincial capital of Zhejiang. The digging
of the canal originally started under the order of an emperor of
the Sui Dynasty (581-618).
</P>
<P>
It had been an important transport artery connecting southern
China with northern China, until recently when other means of
transportation became popular.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, a series of projects have been launched to widen
and dredge the southern part of the Grand Canal in a massive
effort to improve its navigational conditions.
</P>
<P>
The latest project is to build five ship locks along the canal
before the year 2002. It will cost more than one billion yuan,
including 53 million U.S. dollars in World Bank loans.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Opens Legislative Sessions to General Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital announced
today the members of the general public will be permitted to
attend sessions of the Municipal People's Congress Standing
Committee, the city's highest legislative body.
</P>
<P>
The regulation, as outlined in the committee's rules of
procedure, was approved during today's 11th session of the 11th
Municipal People's Congress Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
"The decision will increase the transparency of committee
sessions and improve the general public's ability to supervise
lawmakers," according to Wei Yongde, director of the committee's
policy study office.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese capital followed the lead of a number of provinces
and cities which previously introduced regulations allowing the
general public to attend local legislative sessions.
</P>
<P>
The People's Congress is China's basic political system. People
's Congresses at both the national and local levels have been the
pivotal force responsible for supervising and evaluating officials.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal People's Congress is responsible for
drafting laws and regulations covering development and emergency
situations in the city, as well as for appointing and removing
leading officials, including the mayor.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, the Communist Party of China (CPC) has
redoubled efforts to improve transparency in political affairs and
encourage Chinese citizens to study and discuss important state
issues. Related efforts have in turn helped build a clean, honest
and efficient government.
</P>
<P>
"The new decision represents a significant step in promoting
socialist democracy and enhancing the status and influence of the
Chinese capital," according to Wei.
</P>
<P>
The General Office of the Standing Committee is currently
deliberating specific regulations concerning the number of people
allowed to attend sessions, rules of behavior and various other
relevant issues.

<HEADLINE> China Cracks Down on Imports of Soft-Shelled Turtle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Agriculture is
to reinforce the ban on the illegal importing of soft-shelled
turtles to protect domestic turtle resources and the interests of
turtle breeders in the country.
</P>
<P>
An official from the ministry's fishery department said today
that in recent years, huge quantities of soft-shelled turtles have
been imported illegally to China, which once mixed with fine
domestic turtle strains have resulted in a downgrading of domestic
turtle resources.
</P>
<P>
"Turtles entering the country without quarantine also brought
in new diseases," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also blamed the dumping of imported turtles for impacting on
the production and sales of soft-shelled turtles in China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that some 20,000 to 30,000 such turtles are
brought into China through various channels every year, most from
Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The breeding of turtles has been a backbone of China's aquatic
industry. In 1998, the output of soft-shelled turtles reached 60,
000 tons, worth an estimated four billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> China Plans To Halt Decline of Postal Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A major campaign is to be
launched by China's postal authorities to try and reverse the
sectors devastating financial deficits over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Liu Liqing, director of the State Post Bureau, made the vow at
a national conference recently held here focused on improving the
postal service which lost a staggering 14 billion yuan (1.7
billion U.S. dollars) last year because of strong market
competition and rival modern communications technology.
</P>
<P>
He said that the bureau has decided to introduce new services,
including mail for commercial purposes and post cards carrying
paid advertising, to meet customers' demands and halt the decline.
</P>
<P>
Liu also suggested that post offices operate as agents for
insurance companies and banks, and that the sector should
strengthen its internal financial management and speed up the
introduction of a computer network.
</P>
<P>
The postal sector has long been the backbone of China's
communications system, and at times it was the only information
bridge connecting cities with distant villages across vast areas
of land.
</P>
<P>
But the rapid development of the telephone and even E-mail
services in the 1990s has almost left it standing, resulting in
rocketing deficits and a mounting number of laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
The change in fortunes was also influenced by the separation of
the postal sector from the former Posts and Telecommunications
Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Israel Moves to Scuttle UN Conference on Settlements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Israel is being engaged in
intensive diplomatic efforts to scuttle a U.N.-sponsored
international conference expected to condemn Israel for its
settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
The conference, set for July 15 in Geneva, was decided upon by
a special session of the General Assembly last year at the
initiative of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) after the
outgoing Likud government decided to build settlements at a
controversial site outside Arab East Jerusalem, the Haaretz daily
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The conference is scheduled to discuss means to enforce
application of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which deals with
treatment of civilians in occupied territories. All signatory
countries were invited.
</P>
<P>
Israel has claimed that the Geneva Convention is not
applicable in Gaza, West Bank and East Jerusalem, which it seized
from the hands of Arab states in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
But a preparatory meeting for the Geneva conference held in
Cairo last week at UN initiative concluded with a resolution
stating that the Geneva Convention does apply to these areas.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also criticized Israel for violating human
rights of the Palestinians and destroying "the social and
economic infrastructure" in these territories.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians see the building of Jewish settlements in these
territories as illegal and violation of signed agreements
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Foreign Ministry said the cancellation of the
Geneva conference will be considered a good will gesture toward
the incoming Israeli government of Ehud Barak, the Labor leader
who defeated hard-line Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the
May elections.
</P>
<P>
Barak, a moderate ex-army chief, has pledged to move
forward the Middle East peace process largely frozen in the
three years of Netanyahu's office.
</P>
<P>
Barak has until July 9 to put together a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Israel's efforts to block the conference are focused on two
channels: asking Western countries to boycott the meeting and
recruiting international support to pressure the PNA to abandon
its initiative, Haaretz said.
</P>
<P>
The paper said there is disagreement within the PNA as to
whether to go ahead with the conference in the wake of the new
political situation in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Canada and Australia have said they will
boycott the gathering, the paper added.

<HEADLINE> China's Gold Output Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Gold output in China totaled 56.6
tons during the January-May period this year, decreasing by 2.4
tons or 4.1 percent over a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the State Gold Administration, the
figure accounts for 32.3 percent of the planned output of this
year.
</P>
<P>
China is planning to produce 175 tons of gold this year, with
gold enterprises reaping total profits of one billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Monthly gold output increased markedly over the previous months
to 13.22 tons in May, though the figure was lower than in the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
An official from the administration attributed the decrease of
gold output to the shutdown of many small gold mines, which lack
competitiveness as gold prices kept fluctuating at lower levels.
</P>
<P>
He said that further restructuring of the gold industry and the
government's efforts to slow down the output growth were also
factors for the drop in gold output.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, lowered
the purchasing price of gold consecutively on May 20 and June 9,
cutting it by 11.95 percent. The move has had a good impact on the
country's gold industry.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year, gold enterprises have
painstakingly secured a rapid increase of profits by cutting costs
and improving proficiency.
</P>
<P>
China produced 172.8 tons of gold last year, when gold
enterprises earned total profits of one billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Tourism Declared New Zealand's Biggest Export Earner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Tourism has been officially
announced to be New Zealand's biggest export earner.
</P>
<P>
According to the Tourism Satellite Account, the first official
measurement of tourism's impact on the economy issued by the New
Zealand Government Statistician and circulated here Thursday, New
Zealand's international visitors spent 4.3 billion NZ dollars
(2.4 billion U.S. dollars) on goods and services in 1995.
</P>
<P>
This represented a nearly 16 percent contribution to the total
exports of the country, putting tourism a nose ahead of aluminium
and raw material exports such as iron, wool, fats and oils, and a
neck in front of dairy products and manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
Statistics New Zealand said tourism's earnings have been rising
since then.
</P>
<P>
The pilot account showed tourism in 1995 provided full-time
jobs for 58,000 people and another 60,000 people were employed
indirectly in supporting the sector.
</P>
<P>
Tourism directly contributed 2.9 billion NZ dollars (1.6
billion U.S. dollars) or 3.4 percent to the country's gross
domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
According to the New Zealand official statistical organ,
agriculture was the biggest contributor at nearly six percent.
</P>
<P>
Total spending in New Zealand by all tourists was 9.1 billion
NZ dollars (5 billion U.S. dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Of this 4.3 billion NZ dollars (2.4 billion U.S. dollars) were
spent by overseas visitors, and 3.5 billion NZ dollars (1.9
billion U.S. dollars) by New Zealand households traveling for
recreation and pleasure, while the remaining 1.3 billion NZ
dollars (700 million U.S. dollars) were spent on travel by
business and government.
</P>
<P>
The 4.3 billion NZ dollars spent by international visitors to
New Zealand accounted for 15.8 percent of total export earnings
for 1995, more than any other export category.

<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. direct-sales company Amway
(China) had an average of 67 percent growth in sales in the April-
May period over March, China Economic Times reported today.
</P>
<P>

China in 1995, a cut of from 30 to 40 percent on 23 of Amway's
daily-use products.
</P>
<P>
Lower tariffs on dozens of imported materials made the price
cut possible, according to the company, which says that other
factors include a fall in the tax rate on some luxury items as
well as improved efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Amway has decided to hold a big show of its products in
Beijing at the end of this month, the paper reports.
</P>
<P>
Amway is the largest direct-sales company in the world. It has

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Shilling Gains Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan shilling extended its
winning streak against the U.S. dollar Wednesday with the improved
dollar inflow from agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) Wednesday posted the shilling
at a mean commercial rate of 73.46 to the dollar from 74.36
Monday, while commercial banks quoted the shilling at 73.10/73.30
to the dollar from 73. 30/73.60 at Monday's close, the East
African Standard reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Local dealers said demand for dollars was subdued while inflows
from tea and coffee sales had improved, easing fears of a
prolonged dollar shortage.
</P>
<P>
The Coffee Board of Kenya said Monday that deliveries for
parchment increased to 60,759 tons since the beginning of 1998/99
crop year compared to 39,065 tons in the 1997/98 period.
</P>
<P>
Vikram Samsi, head of treasury at the Standard Chartered Bank,
said he expected the exchange rate to settle at 68 to 70 shillings
to the dollar in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
The shilling has clawed back against the dollar in the past
three days, helped by a surge in interested rates on treasury
bills that is expected to lure foreign exchange to the money
market.
</P>
<P>
Against the pound and euro, the central bank quoted the
shilling at a mean indicative rate of 116.85 and 75.98
respectively from 117.97 and 76.61 at Monday's open.

<HEADLINE> Spurs Beat Knicks 96-89 in NBA Finals Game 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 23 (Xinhua) -- David Robinson grabbed control of
the NBA Finals and would not let go.
</P>
<P>
Robinson's clutch scoring, rebounding and shot-blocking gave
the San Antonio Spurs a 96-89 victory over the New York Knicks and
a stranglehold on the series here tonight.
</P>
<P>
Waiting 10 years for a championship, Robinson displayed his
veteran leadership with 14 points, 17 rebounds and four blocks. He
had a response for every fourth-quarter push by the Knicks, who
went cold down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
"David was just a monster," Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. "I
'm so happy for him because he showed a lot of people what he
could do. A lot of people counted him out this year for reasons
that I'm still trying to figure out. But he was absolutely awesome.
"
</P>
<P>
With Tim Duncan laboring through another erratic fourth quarter
and the Knicks rallying, Robinson took control on both backboards.
"Big Dave stepped up with some great defensive plays," Spurs guard
Jaren Jackson said. "He played a big-time game. He was our best
player on the floor."
</P>
<P>
San Antonio grabbed 49 rebounds to 34 for New York, which
seemed to submit to San Antonio's size.
</P>
<P>
Duncan had 28 points and 18 rebounds for the Spurs, who have a
3-1 lead in the best-of-seven series and can win their first NBA
title on Friday in New York. No team has rallied from a 3-1
deficit in the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
"Size does matter in this league," Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy
said. "It does, and particularly in the playoffs."
</P>
<P>
San Antonio bounced back from a Game 3 loss and improved to 14-
2 in the playoffs, having not lost consecutive games since
February 28.
</P>
<P>
Latrell Sprewell scored 26 points and Allan Houston added 20
for the Knicks, who missed eight straight shots down the stretch,
sending the rabid Madison Square Garden crowd scurrying for the
exits.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't execute well down the stretch with about two minutes
to go," Sprewell said. "We were stuck on 84 for what seemed like
the longest time."
</P>
<P>
Marcus Camby started at center for the second straight game and
had 20 points and 13 rebounds. But he had no answer for Robinson,
who hammered him inside.
</P>
<P>
The next game will start on Friday here.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian Foreign Minister
Ali Akbar Velayati may run for the future secretary general of
the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), local daily
Iran News reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Iran intends to take over the post of OIC secretary general as
the official tenure of the current OIC secretary general Ezzddin
Larak will end this year, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
It is rumored that Iran intended to introduce its candidate
for the post during the recent founding conference of the
Parliamentary Union of the OIC Members end on June 17.
</P>
<P>
In view of the fact that a large number of the OIC members are
Arab states, Iran News said, analysts are reluctant to make
prediction with any degree of certainty on Velayati's nomination.
</P>
<P>
However, the daily said, considering Iran's achievements during
its chairmanship of the OIC, the likelihood of an Iranian being
appointed OIC secretary general is not far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
Velayati served as Iranian foreign minister for 16 years, and
then was appointed advisor on international affairs to the Iranian
supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in 1997.

</P>
<P>
A highway network has been built centered around Yinchuan, the
regional capital, with the total length reaching 9,000 km,
doubling the figure of a decade ago. "Almost all counties have
access to the 13 national or regional highway roads," Wang said.

BEIRUT, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Secret negotiations are under way
to arrange a new swap of four pro-Israeli militiamen held by
Lebanese guerrilla group Hezbollah for its fighters held in the
militia's prison, the Daily Star reported Thursday.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
The 2,500-strong militia was trained and armed by Israel to
help it patrol the border zone and police Jezzine, just north of
the zone.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is leading a
guerrilla war trying to oust Israeli forces and its proxy SLA out
of the country.
</P>
<P>
It is still unknown about the number of detainees the group
hoped to free from the Khiam Detention Center in south Lebanon in
exchange for the four SLA men. Approximately 150 Lebanese are
reportedly being held in the SLA-run prison.
</P>
<P>
In June 1998, Israel exchanged 65 Lebanese detainees and the
remains of 40 resistance fighters for the remains of one Israeli
soldier.
</P>
<P>
The swap was conducted through former Lebanese government of
Rafik Hariri, French government and ICRC.
</P>
<P>
In July 1996, Hezbollah and Israel exchanged the remains of two
Israeli soldiers held by the group since 1986 for the bodies of
123 resistance fighters under a German-brokered deal.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Zambian Babies Born with HIV: UNICEF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Zambian babies are
born infected with the Human Immuno Virus (HIV) that causes the
deadly Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), United Nations
Children's Fund (UNCEF) disclosed.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF representative Peter McDermott said Wednesday these
children have a five-to-six year life expectancy, thus creating
more social problems for a developing country like Zambia.
</P>
<P>
This puts the country among the world's worst affected in this
regard, McDermott said, while addressing a Mother To Child
Transmission (MTCT) of HIV Initiative here.
</P>
<P>
If not checked, the problem would eat up the nation's political
and socio-economic fabric, Zambian newspaper, The Post, Thursday
quoted McDermott as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We should not under-estimate what this problem can do to a
country. Unless something serious is done, urgently, HIV/AIDS will
affect the country in all spheres of life," he said.
</P>
<P>
Africa and other developing countries should not feel
discouraged from fighting the disease because of its scarce
financial resources, McDermott said.
</P>
<P>
Citing polio as an example of a disease not contained in most
countries, McDemott said the same determination used in
vanquishing the disease should be employed in overcoming AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"People thought Africa could not control polio because of its
scarce resources but with zeal the Third World countries have
proved the world wrong. Even AIDS can be controlled if we unite
and put all we have in the fight against this problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's expensive, there are no resources, people will say. But
Zambia is an excellent example of how polio has been contained
despite the earlier pessimism when the campaign started," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, MTCT-HIV coordinating team member Chewe Luo said
three sites have been opened countrywide to identify HIV positive
expectant mothers so they can be injected with an anti-AIDS
vaccine to prevent transmission of the disease on to their babies.
</P>
<P>
"We will start with 10,000 expectant mothers and then reduce to
3,000 whom we'll use as sample for this project," she said,
adding: about 400,000 U.S. dollars will be used to implement this
project.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Fujian Branch of Bank of China
(BOC) in east China's Fujian Province recently launched a new
financial guarantee and management services to serve exporters.
</P>
<P>
The new services integrate credit investigations, account
management and risk guarantees. Related services have been growing
rapidly on the international financial market, with global
earnings last year topping 500 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Export companies have warmly welcomed the highly efficient and
low cost services. Related companies were previously unable to
obtain bank guarantees and were instead forced to purchase
expensive insurance policies for export transactions.
</P>
<P>
The BOC has signed agreements to provide the new services to 50
financial companies in China's Hong Kong and Taiwan as well as 24
other countries.

JERUSALEM, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Several Labor Party Knesset (parliament) members Wednesday
criticized Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak for inviting the
right-wing Likud Party to join the new government. They also
complained that Barak made decisions only by himself in the
coalition talks with other political parties.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Foreign Ministry is engaged in intensive diplomatic
efforts to scuttle an international conference under United
Nation's sponsorship which is expected to condemn Israel over the
settlements issue and its attitude toward the Palestinians in the
territories.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is set for July 15 in Geneva and its cancellation
will be considered a good will gesture toward the new Israeli
government and recognition by the international community of
Israel's readiness to move ahead with the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak has held several
telephone conversations with Shas Party's spiritual leader Ovadia
Yosef recently, Shas sources said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Barak tried to persuade Shas to give up
its demand for the portfolio of the interior ministry, so that he
could bring the party into the coalition government.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- At least 335 people have died of
malaria in the past three moths in west Kenya, Kenya's Assistant
Minister for Health Abdullahi Wako has said.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Times newspaper Thursday quoted Wako as saying that
tens of thousands of people were infected with malaria, a
mosquito-transmitted tropical epidemic and top killer disease in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Wako said Wednesday that 14 Mitsubishi ambulances donated by
the World Health Organization had been dispatched to various
hospitals countrywide.
</P>
<P>
However, the assistant minister has come under fire from
parliament members when he could not state the amount and type of
drugs that have been sent to the affected areas.
</P>
<P>
Wako also could not specify what measures the government was
undertaking to control the perennial upsurge of malaria when
questioned by MPs.
</P>
<P>
International medical experts argue that malaria has apparently
become resistant to a number of drugs in the Kenyan market.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Senate Wednesday passed 42
of President Olusegun Obasanjo's 49 ministerial nominees,
concluding the marathon clearance only days before its expiration.
</P>
<P>
The list to be announced by the president will form Nigeria's
first civilian government for years.
</P>
<P>
Seven candidates were deleted from the list, which was not yet
published, because the sites of their origin have already secured
enough representation in the government, according to the Senate
sources.
</P>
<P>
"we will communicate our final decision to the president, who
will thereafter make it public along with the portfolios," said
Senator Joseph Waku after the ending of Wednesday's session of the
upper house of Nigeria' s National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The clearance of the list was delayed when the senators were
asking for more personal information on the ministerial nominees
last week.
</P>
<P>
The clearance was also proceeded amid severe quarrels between
the majority People's Democratic Party (PDP), and the two minority
parties the Alliance for Democracy (AD) and All People's Party
(APP).
</P>
<P>
The AD and APP senators Tuesday walked out of the National
Assembly Building to protest a corruption accusation against
them, leaving the PDP senators continuing their debate alone in
the building.
</P>
<P>
The protest took place when an AD sponsored motion seeking to
census PDP Senator Gbenga Aluko was killed. The motion demand a
apology from Aluku for allegedly designating the image of the AD
and APP senators in a newspaper pronouncement charging their
senators with involving in bribery and corruption.
</P>
<P>
President Obasanjo has been lobbying for a quickened step of
the Senator when the delay has put off many key policy decisions.

<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, June 24 (Xinhua) -- China sent its 10th scientific
expedition recently to an area near Hawaii where it has exclusive
prospecting rights and priority exploitation rights for seabed
mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
The expedition has about 120 scientists who will look for
mineral resources and study environmental conservation. A number
of scientists from Russia, the United States, and Germany will
join the expedition, which is scheduled to work there 130 days.
</P>
<P>
The previous 9 expeditions found nickel, cobalt, copper,
manganese and many more elements in a 150,000-square-kilometer
international area. China got the rights for half the area for
exploration and development, with the other half being handed over
to the United Nations. China's half is estimated to contain 423
million tons of mineral deposits.
</P>
<P>
The international seabed makes up 49 percent of the earth's
surface and is rich in natural resources, especially mineral
resources. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
stipulates that every country can prospect and have priority in
opening up natural resources in the international seabed if it
obtains UN approval and returns half of the prospected area to the
UN.
</P>

LHASA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- For Tibetans living alongside 8,848-
meter Qomolungma, the highest peak in the Himalayas, one of the
most popular figure is Zhenqiong, who has helped villagers heal
diseases and plant trees.
</P>
<P>
Zhenqiong is a 'Pendeba', a Tibetan word for welfare worker.
He is responsible for healthcare in villages. In 1994, with help
from the U.S.'s New Generation Fund, the Pendeba International
Assistance Project was begun by the Qomolungma Peak Nature Reserve
in the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The Pendebas provide medical services and environmental
protection information and help villagers increase their income,
according to the project manager, Zhuoma. The program has been an
effective way to make better use of villagers' ability to deal
with health problem and environmental and economic issues, she
says.
</P>
<P>
There are currently 224 Pendebas working in 80 percent of the
local villages who are mainly responsible for government
immunization and family planning programs.
</P>
<P>
In some villages, they have helped set up a special fund, the
Villagers Welfare Society Fund, to make up for fund shortages of
public health institutions in villages and townships.
</P>
<P>
The Pendebas have also made traditional Tibetan medicines from
medicinal herb that are favored by the villagers and foreign
tourists as well.
</P>
<P>
The five-year old Pendeba program has helped bring down the
infant death rate 50 percent, Zhuoma says.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian Foreign Minister
Ali Akbar Velayati may run for the future secretary general of
the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), local daily
Iran News reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Iran intends to take over the post of OIC secretary general as
the official tenure of the current OIC secretary general Ezzddin
Larak will end this year, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
It is rumored that Iran intended to introduce its candidate
for the post during the recent founding conference of the
Parliamentary Union of the OIC Members end on June 17.
</P>
<P>
In view of the fact that a large number of the OIC members are
Arab states, Iran News said, analysts are reluctant to make
prediction with any degree of certainty on Velayati's nomination.
</P>
<P>
However, the daily said, considering Iran's achievements during
its chairmanship of the OIC, the likelihood of an Iranian being
appointed OIC secretary general is not far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
Velayati served as Iranian foreign minister for 16 years, and
then was appointed advisor on international affairs to the Iranian
supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in 1997.

JINAN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Pine trees in the Laoshan Mountains,
a famous scenic spot in the coastal city of Qingdao in east China'
s Shandong province, are dying of branch-rot, a disease local
experts have no way to eradicate.
</P>
<P>
The disease first showed up in May and has so far caused the
death of more than 400 hectares of the 2,133 hectares of pine
trees in Laoshan, with another 266 hectares being affected.
</P>
<P>
Located half an hour's drive from the city proper of Qingdao,
renowned for its top-brand beer, the Laoshan mountain attracts
many tourists from both home and abroad with its grotesque view
and pine-tree forests.
</P>
<P>
Local workers are now cutting down the dead trees to save the
rest, under instruction from a number of experts.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Kegong, professor with the Nanjing Forestry University,
said the only efficient way to prevent further spread of the
disease is to fell and burn all sick trees.
</P>
<P>
"More efficient means are yet to be sought," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
According to Hu Zexu, director of the Laoshan Forest Farm, the
pine variety in Laoshan was introduced from Japan in the 1950s.

<HEADLINE> Thai Parliament Begins Debate on Budget Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's House of
Representatives Thursday began debating on the budget bill for
fiscal 2000, which starts on October 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai briefed the legislators on the
budget, which is worth 860 billion baht (23.2 billion U.S.
dollars), or 16 percent of the country's 5.42 trillion baht (146.4
billion dollars) gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The budget, a 4.2-percent increase from the previous fiscal
year, carries a 110-billion-baht (2.97 billion dollars) deficit,
or 2.2 percent of the GDP, based on the government's capability to
generate a revenue of only 750 billion baht (20.2 billion dollars)
from tax collection.
</P>
<P>
A deficit budget showed the government's resolution to
stimulate the economy by government expenditure at a time when
private consumption is weak.
</P>
<P>
The budget allocations are aimed largely at toning down the
adverse effects of the crisis on the social front, improving the
state administrative system, increasing the potential of manpower
and society for sustainable development and restructuring the
economy and economic infrastructure to speed up recovery.
</P>
<P>
The debate is expected to last three days till Saturday, when
legislators will vote on the budget bill.
</P>
<P>
Despite the opposition's allegation that the budget is
relatively too small to really kick-start the economic recovery,
the ruling coalition, with Prime Minister Chuan's Democrat Party
at its core, is confident to win enough "yes" votes.
</P>
<P>
The six-party coalition holds a 257 majority in the 393-strong
lower house.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Changes Badminton Lineups For Malaysia, Thailand Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Badminton Association of
Indonesia (PBSI) has made changes to its lineup of shuttlers to
compete in the Malaysia and Thailand Opens, the Jakarta Post
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The PBSI secretary-general Leo Chandra Wiranata said the
official in charge of athletes' development Mangombar Ferdinand
Siregar changed some names on June 17.
</P>
<P>
PBSI pulled men's singles Johan Hadikusuma and Indra Wijaya
from both tournaments and replaced them with Irwansyah and Yudi
Suprayogi. Jeffer Rosobin and Rony Agustinus will still play at
both events.
</P>
<P>
In the women's singles, Lidya Djaelawidjaja and Ellen Angelina
replaces Meiluawati and Yuli Marfuah in the Malaysia Open to
accompany Cindana. In the Thailand Open, only Yuli Marfuah will
compete because PBSI has withdrawn Ellen and Lidya.
</P>
<P>
In the men's and mixed doubles, Agung Wahyu will replace Imam
Tohari in the Malaysia Open. Agung will partner Halim Heryanto in
the men's doubles and Emma Ermawati in the mixed doubles.
</P>
<P>
But in the Thailand Open, Imam will compete in the mixed
doubles with Vita Marissa, who will also play in the women's
doubles with Emma.
</P>
<P>
The national training director Christian Hadinata said Siregar
was in charge of deciding which shuttlers compete in tournaments.
</P>
<P>
"I don't really know about it because coaches discuss the
problems directly with Siregar," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysia Open will start on June 30 and last through July 4
while the Thailand Open is on July 7 through 11.

<HEADLINE> Supriati Hoped to Beat Her 5,000m Mark at SEA Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Amateur Athletics
Association (PASI) hopes Supriati Sutono will shave at least 15
seconds off her personal best in the 5,000 meters at the Southeast
Asian (SEA) Games in order to qualify for the Olympic Games in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
PASI secretary-general Barmawi Chaidir said that the long-
distance runner was expected to achieve a time below 15 minutes
and 30 seconds -- the minimum Olympic qualification time -- in the
Games in August.
</P>
<P>
"The SEA Games is an event recognized by the International
Amateur Athletics Federation and Asian Amateur Athletics
Association," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
During recent training, Supriati has run 16:11 to equal her
mark in winning the SEA Games in 1997. The time is well outside
her national record of 15:54.45 set in her gold-medal run at the
13th Asian Games in Bangkok last year.
</P>
<P>
Chaidir said Supriati was expected to represent Indonesia in
the World Championships in Sevilla, Spain, in August.
</P>
<P>
Supriati is also expected to retain her SEA Games titles in the
1,500, 5,000 and 10,000 meters in the biennial event from August 7
to 15 in Brunei Darussalam.
</P>
<P>
Supriati has recorded 4:21 in the 1,500 meters to equal her
record in the SEA Games two years ago.
</P>
<P>
In the 10,000 meters, Supriati clocked 32:54 in training, 52
seconds slower than when she won the SEA Games gold.
</P>
<P>
Chaidir said Indonesia would face a tough challenge from
Malaysia and Thailand on the track, especially to win the 10 golds
expected by the National Sports Council.
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago we won eight golds, and two of them were from
the marathons. This year, host Brunei will not stage both events,
so we will have to work harder to win six golds as expected," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Sports Minister Says Overseas Competitions Needed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian State Minister of Youth
Affairs and Sports Agung Laksono advised sports bodies to fund
overseas warm-up competitions for their athletes ahead of the
Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in August.
</P>
<P>
"Athletes appear prepared for the SEA Games but they should
have more overseas tryouts to boost their confidence," he said
after visiting the training centers for swimming, water polo,
diving, squash and sepak takraw on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Agung urged the National Sports Council (KONI) and sports
organizations to provide financial assistance for the overseas
tryouts, saying the government already disbursed its budget
allocation for the Games.
</P>
<P>
The National Development and Planning Board and the Gelora
Senayan Management Board provided 5.5 billion rupiah (797,000 U.S.
dollars) and 4.5 billion rupiah respectively to finance the
training.
</P>
<P>
Agung said previously that the government could not provide
more funds, but he indicated on Wednesday that it would be able to
dispense bonuses to the winners.
</P>
<P>
"There is extra money to be given as bonuses to successful
athletes but KONI must decide the amount of the bonuses," he said,
adding that the money might be taken from the state budget.
</P>
<P>
Agung said he was confident Indonesia could grab at least 70
golds to retain the overall title at the SEA Games in Brunei
Darussalam from August 7 to 15.
</P>
<P>
"We have a big chance to win 70 golds and even more. The
training programs and human resources are well-prepared. Some
sport bodies have even groomed potential juniors for the Games,"
he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.

<HEADLINE> Most Thais Unsure of Recovery This Year: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Despite the government's
confidence, most Thai people are still not sure that Thailand's
economic recovery will take place in the second half of this year,
said a poll conducted by a leading research center.
</P>
<P>
Some 82.9 percent of the polled respondents were not convinced
by the government's remedial measures due to some unsolved
problems, especially rising unemployment, slower export growth and
the increasing non-performing loans, Thai Farmers Research Center
said in a report which was available Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The poll, entitled "Will the Economy Recover in 1999?", is a
qualitative survey, collecting data from 4,833 samples nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Only 17.1 percent of the respondents were certain that the
economy would recover, claiming the government had tried every
possible way to handle the problems.
</P>
<P>
As for the impact on their daily life, 47.4 percent of those
surveyed said they had cut consumption expenditure, especially for
utilities, such as furniture, electrical appliances, mobile phones
and pagers.
</P>
<P>
They had also sharply cut spending at leisure spots, on dining
out and nightlife.
</P>
<P>
The economic recession has led to adjustments in business
operation. 58.6 percent of the respondents have stopped business
expansion, but 16.7 percent still see promising opportunities in
agri-business and daily-life business.
</P>
<P>
Most of the polled respondents also disclosed that business
adjustments for survival is now their top priority. Emphasis will
be given to efficient personnel management.
</P>
<P>
With regard to government performance, the polled entrepreneurs
voiced the opinion that the government had shown strong intentions
to fully remedy the economic problems. But the problems are too
complex to overcome in a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
Of the total samples, 51.5 percent are in Greater Bangkok, 11.3
percent in the northeast, 10.3 percent in the east, 9.5 percent in
the north, 8.9 percent in the central and 8.5 percent in the
south.
</P>
<P>
By occupation, 21.1 percent of the respondents run their own
businesses while 17.9 percent are employees of private
enterprises, 15.9 percent housewives, 15.6 percent hired workers,
15 percent government officials, 6.8 percent state employees and
7.7 percent others.

<HEADLINE> Germany Passes Austerity Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The German government Wednesday
passed an austerity plan to cut 30 billion marks (16 billion U.S.
dollars) in federal budget next year.
</P>
<P>
 The austerity plan is part of the reform package which was
described by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder as the "biggest (
economic) reform project that postwar Germany has ever seen."
</P>
<P>
 Under the package, initiated by Finance Minister Hans Eichel
with Labor Minister Walter Riester's help in the reform of the
social security system, Germany is to curb 8 billion marks (4.2
billion dollars) of corporate tax from the year 2001 in a bid to
sharpen the competitive edge of the country's business sector.
</P>
<P>
The government will start next January to raise its subsidiary
for children while slightly lowering pensions for the old and the
jobless.
</P>
<P>
Labor unions, who have strong influence in Schroeder's party,
swiftly criticized package as unfairly harsh on pensioners and the
jobless.
</P>
<P>
German industry welcomed the measures, but complained that the
corporate tax relief should be brought forward from 2001.
</P>
<P>
According to the plans, Germany will continue its ecological
reforms by increasing the price of gasoline by 6.0 percent of a
mark per liter every year in the four years to come to help
finance cuts in social security contributions by workers and
employers, which drive up German labor costs.
</P>
<P>
At the same time the price of power will rise at the rate of 0.
5 percent of a mark each year.
</P>
<P>
Parliament is expected to vote on the package in the fall.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Send Troop Reinforcements to Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Despite the end of NATO airstrikes
against Yugoslavia, the United States will send more troops to
Albania to strengthen the U.S. military presence in the Balkan
region, the Albanian Telegraphic Agency said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reinforcements will arrive under a White House order, the
report quoted a spokesman for the U.S. task force in Albania as
saying. He did not say when and how many troops will come, but
made it clear that they will be deployed in different places.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. task force in Albania is mainly composed of Marine
Corps equipped with heavy weapons including the Apache attack
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
After Belgrade withdrew all its forces from Kosovo on June 20,
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana announced the official end to
the alliance's bombardment of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Now, British, French, German, Italian and other NATO member
states' troops are leaving Albania for Kosovo to take part in the
peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
However, a senior NATO military official told Albanian Prime
Minister Pandeli Majko on Wednesday that NATO troops will not
leave Albania until all of NATO's objectives have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> City Square Becomes New Symbol Of Tibetan Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- It's a normal day on Potala Palace
Square in Lhasa, the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, but
the square is something special for local people, and a young baby
struggles toward pigeons that are being fed by tourists while a
group of soldiers take pictures with Potala Palace as a backdrop.
</P>
<P>
Sangji, the 73-year-old grandmother of the baby, says she
suffers from leg problems but still often comes to the square in
front of Potala Palace. The elderly woman lives in Bharkor Street,
the old part of Lhasa, and explains that the square used to be a
garbage dump in the suburbs of Lhasa,.
</P>
<P>
At one corner, seven-year-old Suoqiong is playing with a toy
locomotive, but he's probably too young to know that Tibet is the
only province-level administrative region in China that has no
railways. Work on the Qinghai-Tibet Railway was halted in Golmud
in Qinghai because of many obstacles.
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the square, a silver-colored air fighter
is attracting a large number of herdsmen. The Chinese Air Force
presented the retired aircraft to Tibetan children in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Potala Palace Square was built from a smaller square, Cultural
Square, in 1995, with 110 million yuan from the central government,
says Ngawang Ngamgyai, administrator in charge of the square. It
covers 240,000 square meters and is the second largest in China
after Tian'anmen in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Loud speakers and a large water fountain and pool occupy the
center of the square, which has ballrooms, a library, a playground,
shops, an outdoor market, and a pond for boating around it. A 100-
member cleaning team is at work on the square, which costs more
than 2 million yuan a year to maintain. Their worst fear is of
windstorms that could destroy the equipment, especially the
expensive lights.

<HEADLINE> East Timor Ballot Delay Accepted by Rival Factions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- East Timor rival factions welcomed
and accepted the U.N. decision to delay by two weeks the August 8
ballot on the future of the territory, The Indonesian Observer
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan decided on Tuesday to
postpone the crucial vote on self-determination of the former
Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
In a six-page report to the U.N. Security Council, Annan did
not give a precise date. But U.N. officials said they expected the
poll to take place either on August 21 or August 22.
</P>
<P>
Pro-integration organizations in East Timor said they would
benefit from the delay in the direct ballot on self-rule for the
territory.
</P>
<P>
The organizations "will give a positive contribution to the
United Nations to create a conducive, stable and peaceful
situation for the ballot," Lopes da Cruz, leader of the
newly-formed United Front for East Timor Autonomy, said.
</P>
<P>
Da Cruz is also the Indonesian government's envoy with special
responsibility for East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Another pro-integration leader, Basilio Araujo, welcomed
Annan's decision. "For us it is no problem. It will give us more
time to prepare."
</P>
<P>
Jailed East Timorese pro-independence leader Jose Alexandre
"Xanana" Gusmao said he backed the U.N. decision to delay the
vote.
</P>
<P>
"All parties involved in this process, and obviously the U.N.
secretary general, are unanimous in considering that the existence
of conditions of security and tranquillity in East Timor is a
prerequisite and a sine qua non condition for the holding of a
free, fair and democratic consultation," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his commitment "to continuing to work and
cooperate with all parties involved in the self-determination
process so as to guarantee to the people of East Timor the needed
and yearned-for peace and tranquillity."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Alatas said Indonesia
accepts the postponement of the direct ballot in East Timor, but
rejects security as the reason behind the delay.
</P>
<P>
Annan said in his report that pro-integration militias in East
Timor were intimidating voters in rural areas, "thus jeopardizing
the necessary openness of the consultation (voting) process."
</P>
<P>
Alatas said he hoped the decision was made for fair and honest
reasons.
</P>
<P>
"In Indonesia's view, concerning a delay with security
conditions as a pretext, we regard it as unfair," he said after
meeting with President B.J. Habibie and other ministers here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said the delay was probably caused by logistics hurdles,
saying the U.N. Security Council was late in its approval of the
U.N. Mission in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister/Armed Forces Chief Gen. Wiranto also pointed
out that the security in East Timor should not be made the
scapegoat for the postponement of the ballot in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the June 7 general election in East Timor was
peaceful, proof that security is conducive to the ballots.
</P>
<P>
The August ballot in East Timor will allow the territory's
people to choose whether their homeland should become an
autonomous region within Indonesia or totally independent.
</P>
<P>
East Timor was integrated into Indonesia in 1976 in a move
never recognized by the United Nations, which still considers
Portugal as the administering power of the territory.
</P>
<P>
Early this year Indonesia announced it would grant East Timor
independence if the people in the territory reject Indonesia's
offer of wide-ranging autonomy.

COLOMBO, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A South Korean construction
company is to build 10,000 apartments for the relocation of
low-income families in the capital city of Colombo, the Sri Lankan
Ministry of Housing and Urban Development said Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar Takes Measures to Eradicate Drugs (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Strengthening of international and bilateral cooperation also
constitutes one of Myanmar's measures in fighting drugs. Myanmar
became a state party to the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic
Drugs in July 1963 and is also a signatory to the 1988 Convention
Against Trafficking in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances
and 1971 Convention on the substances.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Drug Control Program (UNDCP) has extended a total of
15 million U.S. dollars of aid to Myanmar for the implementation
of a five-year drug eradication project (1998-2003) in the Wa
region, the country's northern Shan state.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has also joined a six-nation memorandum of
understanding on sub-regional cooperation in drug abuse control
involving the UNDCP. These six nations are China, Cambodia, Laos,
Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Myanmar reached bilateral cooperation agreements to
control illicit drug trafficking and abuse with India in 1993,
with Bangladesh in 1994, with Vietnam in 1995 and with the Russian
Federation, Laos and the Philippines in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The country also carried out four joint poppy-yield surveys in
Shan state with the United States in 1993, 1995, 1997 and 1998
under the two countries' anti-drug program. One more survey is
planned in 1999.
</P>
<P>
As one of Myanmar's drug eradication efforts, it steps up
dissemination of information and education against the serious
danger of drug, calling on people to keep away from drugs.
</P>
<P>
The country is also building two drug museums, while carrying
out education on prevention against drugs for its citizens,
especially young students, through radio, television, newspapers,
magazines, movies, video, exhibitions and seminars. These efforts
have made achievements to certain extent.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has also established drug treatment centers throughout
the country, providing compulsory treatment of addicts. So far,
six major centers of this kind have been set up in Yangon,
Mandalay, Myitkyina and Taunggyi, admitting 2,000 addicts
annually.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, there were 66,463 registered
drug addicts in the country, of whom 50.01 percent deal with
opium, 37.4 percent with heroin, 7.7 percent with tranquilizer and
4.89 percent with other drugs.
</P>
<P>
According to officially published figures, during the past 10
years between 1988 and 1998, Myanmar seized a total of 4,125 kilos
of heroin, 28,385.89 kilos of opium, 6,606 kilos of marijuana and
26.96 million tablets of amphetamine stimulants.
</P>
<P>
During the period, 32,787 hectares of poppy plantations were
destroyed, resulting in a drop of 356.17 tons of opium production.
The country's Mongla region in eastern Shan state was declared as
"drug-free zone" in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has started in 1999 implementing a plan, aimed at total
eradication of drugs in the whole country in 15 years. The plan is
estimated to cost 5.6 billion dollars and will be carried out in
three phases -- the first phase is from fiscal 1999-2000 to
2003-2004, the second one from 2004-2005 to 2008-2009 and the
third one from 2009-2010 to 2013-2014.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Consumers Concerned about Safety of Imported Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese consumers are concerned
about food safety in the wake of the contamination incident in
Europe and have been cautioned against eating meat, poultry and
dairy products from Belgium, France, Germany and Netherlands,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yuanchao, secretary general of the China Consumers
Association, gave the advice at a news conference in Beijing on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He also advised consumers to eat domestic products which have
proven to be free from dioxin contamination instead of buying
products with ingredients from unnamed suppliers.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, China banned the imports and suspended sales
of products produced after January 15 from the four countries, as
the cancer-causing dioxin stirred a widespread health scare in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
However, the Ministry of Health may lift the ban on sales of
the products from the four countries if they can provide valid
papers verifying safety of their products.
</P>
<P>
The documents include: test reports on the products' dioxin
content issued by authoritative testing centers and approved by
health departments in their home countries, and papers issued by
their home countries and the European Union permitting the sale of
the products after June 1, according to a circular issued by the
ministry's Law and Supervision Department on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Sacrificial Vessels Unearthed in Ningxia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-eight sacrificial vessels
dating back to the Western Xia kingdom (1038-1227) have been
unearthed in Huinong County, in northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
This is the first batch of Western Xia sacrificial vessels ever
found, said Zhou Xinghua, deputy director of the region's cultural
relics bureau, adding that the vessels are of great significance
for research into metal manufacturing, art technology and
religious affairs of the period.
</P>
<P>
All the vessels are made of bronze. Also unearthed were two
coins.
</P>
<P>
Western Xia was a feudal kingdom whose territory covered the
major part of present-day Ningxia, Gansu, Shaanxi, Qinghai and
Inner Mongolia. When Mongolian troops conquered Western Xia, they
destroyed it almost entirely, leaving very few relics or written
materials relating to it.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Economy to Grow in 2000: Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will continue to see a
declining economy in 1999, but will start to register positive
growth in 2000, an economist said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC),
quoted by The Indonesian Observer on Thursday, the Indonesian
economy will grow by 3.7 percent in year 2000 and reach a
steady-state, long-term growth of less than 5 percent beginning
2001.
</P>
<P>
Suhadi Mangkusuwondo, a senior economist at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), said the PECC economic
outlook is neutral to the outcome of the June 7 election result.
</P>
<P>
The forecast is unlikely to be affected by any change of power
in the government because the new economic paradigm labeled
"people's economy" cannot deviate much from the trend of
market-friendly policies.
</P>
<P>
He said inflation in 1999 will stand at 20 percent but is
showing a continuous downtrend until 2000. The inflation rate is
forecast to reach 15 percent in 2001. Trade financing should
improve gradually with the introduction of a new Export Financing
Agency which will provide subsidized working capital and export
credits for exporters.
</P>
<P>
Slower increases in imports will improve the trade balance but
the surplus will shrink as the growth of imports accelerates in
2000. In 2000 and 2001, other components will contribute
significantly and positively to economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Mangkusuwondo said private investment and bank lending for real
investment are expected to resume and foreign capital will begin
to increase during this period. Government expenditure, however,
will continue to increase but most of the money will be spent on
the social safety net.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the risk in this forecast is largely
political. Should the political assumptions of fresh social chaos
and some sort of power vacuum in the government occur, the economy
could contract by 7 percent in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Navy Searches for Missing Malaysia Ship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Navy is searching
for a Malaysia-owned ship, earlier believed to have been sunk off
Sri Lanka's eastern coast last month, but now suspected to have
been captured by the country's Tamil rebels.
</P>
<P>
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has been
asked by the Singapore-based International Maritime Bureau to
contact the rebels and make inquiries about the ship, informed
sources here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Navy officials were quoted as saying they had not found the
ship which had been reported sunk and had no idea what had
happened to the vessel.
</P>
<P>
The freighter Sik Yang with a crew of 15, had been carrying
4,000 tons of salt when it disappeared without trace. It had been
en route to the port of Malacca in Malaysia from India on May 25,
the day it was reported missing.
</P>
<P>
There are suspicions that the vessel which disappeared on calm
seas was hijacked by the Tamil rebels who have been fighting a war
 for a separate Tamil state in Sri Lanka since 1983.
</P>
<P>
If the ship had been sunk there would have been some evidence
such as an oil slick, debris, or a washed-up body, but none of
these had been found either by the navy or fishermen in the area,
the navy officials added.

<HEADLINE> FM: Panama Able to Protect Canal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian Foreign Minister
Jorge Eduardo Ritter Wednesday rejected a U.S. commander's
comments and reaffirmed categorically that his country is capable
of protecting the canal.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in reply to U.S. South Command Chief
Charles Wilhelm, who questioned Panama's capability to protect the
canal.
</P>
<P>
Wilhelm, testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations
subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere Tuesday, said Panama does
not have the capacity to defend the canal from Colombian guerrilla
raids, and announced that the U.S. will act unilaterally if the
security of the canal is threatened.
</P>
<P>
Ritter said the U.S. commander's comments are groundless and
totally untrue, noting that his country has now assumed control of
the canal and that Panamanian police are patrolling the
installations.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said the U.S. military presence in Panama
has historically been linked to the application of the U.S.
military political strategy in the region, and that it never had
anything to do with the security of the country.
</P>
<P>
"The aim of the U.S. military bases on Panamanian territory has
never been to protect the inter-oceanic canal, and much less the
protection of the borders," he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the Torrijos-Carter treaties, the United States must
withdraw all its military forces from Panama by the end of the
year, a process that is well under way.
</P>
<P>
Ritter said it is improper for the U.S. to use these false
accusations as an excuse to give the impression that the canal is
under threat.
</P>
<P>
"The canal is at present functioning normally and at the moment
is in fact extending its capacity in order to serve the needs of
international maritime commerce," he noted.

<HEADLINE> China Adapting Price Controls And Services To Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- China's government price control
departments and service institutions are being asked to use more
legal means to regulate market prices, in a move to protect
economic growth and the rights and interests of businesses.
</P>
<P>
Twenty years of price reforms have made it possible for China
to leave the prices of an overwhelming majority of commodities and
services to the swing of the market. And price regulation and
consultation have become major forms in which government
departments provide services to society.
</P>
<P>
Wang Chunzheng, vice-minister of the State Development
Planning Commission, told a national meeting on price controls
recently that the government is responsible for both regulating
macro-economic activity and pricing a certain limited number of
commodities and services over which it still has direct control.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to retain price regulation at the early
stage of a socialist market economy. "Governments have to decide
whether or not a price set by an enterprise is legitimate," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He explained that government departments should better manage
price controls and help handle problems that businesses themselves
can't solve, but should leave those they can solve to themselves
or to price service firms.
</P>
<P>
Pricing services are necessary for building a socialist legal
system, Wang said. Last year, price control offices appraised 39
billion yuan worth of goods, 34 billion yuan of which had some
form of criminal activity involved in their pricing.
</P>
<P>
The senior official also urged local areas to standardize price
controls to safeguard fair and open market competition.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 2,800 pricing affairs offices, employing
more than 15,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Glacier At Source Of Yangtze River Getting Smaller </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A glacier at the source of China's
Yangtze River has shrunk 600 meters over the past 30 years,
according to a recent study.
</P>
<P>
The study was done by a team headed by Xi Qingji, the director
of Qinghai Mapping Institute No.1 at a place 5,367 meters above
sea level on Geladandong Snowy Peak in May.
</P>
<P>
Xi's study has been recognized by the Chinese Academy of
Sciences' Lanzhou Research Institute of Glaciology and
Cryopedology.
</P>
<P>
He made the conclusion by comparing recent surveys with aerial
photographs taken in 1970, Xi explains, and a great number of
Chinese scientists have been amazed at the rapid shrinkage.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze comes from Tanggula Mountains, which have thirty-
three 6,000-m. snow-covered peaks, of which Geladandong is the
tallest. The mountains also have 59 glaciers. A survey done in
1976 showed a glacier that covered a 750-square-kilometer area at
that time.

<HEADLINE> China's Coastal Cities Increasing Marine Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The coastal cities of Shenzhen in
Guangdong Province and Xiamen in Fujian Province have been moving
to protect their coastal environment.
</P>
<P>
A legislative affairs bureau official in Shenzhen says that
they drew up a 60-article regulation on marine pollution control
that will go into effect after members of the Shenzhen City People
's Congress Standing Committee pass it.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen has a 260-km coastline with marine breeding centers
and tourist beaches and pollution in the area has been getting
worse and the new regulation is intended to stop this worsening
trend in marine pollution with more intense law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
The port city of Xiamen has also started a campaign to reduce
marine pollution from the food business. Restaurants built along
the sea have been given a certain time limit to move out of the
area or suffer the consequences if they fail to do so, local
sources report.

<HEADLINE> Returned Tibetans Get Good Care at Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Gongtang Ouzhu, a Tibetan who fled
to India in 1958, still felt homesick until 1983, and decided to
pay a visit to his home in the Chinese province of Gansu.
</P>
<P>
"I was nervous day and night and couldn't get to sleep because
I was homesick," he recalls, even though he was the head of a
group of Tibetans in India, where he owned factories and shops.
</P>
<P>
On his first visit back home, he was welcomed by the local
government and his six brothers and sisters, who asked him to stay,
but it wasn't until 1990 that he finally returned to China for
good and now lives in Lhasa, the capital of the Tibet Autonomous
Region, where he is a member of the regional People's Congress
Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
There have been more than 50,000 other exiled Tibetans who have
visited their homes and more than 2,000 who have settled in Tibet,
and Gansu or in Qinghai and Sichuan provinces.
</P>
<P>
Tuomei Langjia used to be in charge of exiled Tibetans in Nepal
but returned in 1985. "I was engaged in the Dalai Lama's 'Tibet
Independence' activities for more than 20 years," he says, "but my
experience showed that the efforts were fruitless and gradually I
got tired of it." After he returned, the government helped his
wife find a job and later sent his two sons to other parts of the
mainland to study in special classes for Tibetan students.
</P>
<P>
Renqing, an 82-year-old Tibetan woman has a different story to
tell. She went on a pilgrimage to India in the 1950s and had to
beg. Much later, when she came back, she saw that the government
had not abandoned her and she now lives in a House for the Elderly
in Lhasa that was built specifically for returning Tibetans and
the government gives her food, oil, meat, and pocket money every
month and she is satisfied, she says.
</P>
<P>
Some Tibetans have come home for reasons other than
homesickness. Guisang, who is now 75, opened a Tibetan pharmacy
after returning to Tibet, where he provides employment for a large
number of jobless youth.
</P>
<P>
"To this day, there are still some exiled Tibetans, especially
some young people, who are not aware of the real situation in
Tibet," says Danba Chelie, an elderly Tibetan who returned
recently, adding that they can't know the truth unless they come
back and see it with their own eyes.

<HEADLINE> EU, U.S. Promise to Help Ukraine Close Down Chernobyl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Union and the United
States have reaffirmed  they will provide sufficient
economic aid to help Ukraine close down the Chernobyl nuclear
power station by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued on Wednesday, the EU and the U.S.
expressed the hope that Kiev will shut down the troubled station
by the end of 2000, and promised full financial support to
alleviate the burden arising from the close-down of the nuclear
power plant and from Ukraine's efforts to develop its energy
industry.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian government has repeatedly complained that if the
Western countries do not implement the agreement reached five
years ago, Ukraine will not have the ability to close down
Chernobyl as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement reached between Ukraine and the G7
countries in 1995, Ukraine has the obligation to shut down
Chernobyl nuclear power station before 2000. Meanwhile the Western
countries should provide economic assistance to help Ukraine build
two other nuclear power stations. However, the pledged two billion
U.S. dollar foreign aid has not yet arrived by now.
</P>
<P>
One of the reactors of the Chernobyl power plant exploded on
April 26, 1986, causing a serious nuclear disaster in Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> Zhuhai SEZ Economy grows 9.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Economy in the Zhuhai Special
Economic Zone (SEZ) in south China's Guangdong province grew 9.4
percent in the first five months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Total Gross Domestic Products in the period hit 10.7 billion
yuan, close to the 10-percent growth goal set by the SEZ's
authorities at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Zhuhai, a pioneer in China's opening up drive, is one of the
country's five SEZs. The rest are Shenzhen, Shantou, Xiamen, and
Hainan. China established the SEZs and the Pudong New Area in
Shanghai to experiment with bold economic reforms and opening to
the outside world.
</P>
<P>
During the January-May period, the city recorded 447 million
yuan in added agricultural output value thanks to good harvests, a
1.9 percent rise over same period last year.
</P>
<P>
It also had 18.97 billion yuan worth of industrial output value,
up 14.67 percent, and saw remarkable growth in the transport and
telecommunications sectors.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Telecoms Equipment Getting Wider Recognition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Satellite telecommunications
equipment with the label "Made in China" is getting greater
recognition here in China's oldest special economic zone.
</P>
<P>
The Runxun Telecommunication Co., one of the major wireless
telecommunications companies in China, has just spent 10 million
yuan on 1,000 satellite receivers developed independently by
Shenzhen's Kingsky Co. Previously, Runxun, like many other pager
companies in China, had imported its telecommunications equipment.
</P>
<P>
"We are very prudent about choosing receiver products," says
Liu Liguang, who is in charge of its technical department, "We
believe that these products can compete technically with imported
devices -- and at half of the price." Savings are important for
domestic pager companies that face increasingly fierce competition,
he explains.
</P>
<P>
Lin Pinglan, Kingsky's general manager, says that China's fast
growing satellite equipment business has caught the interest of
many foreign companies, because it is worth 2 billion yuan
annually and is growing.
</P>
<P>
His company is aiming for a 30 percent share of that market and
expects 30 million yuan in sales this year. That would be triple
last year's sales.
</P>
<P>
The company specializes in satellite data transmission systems
and is a supplier of the Xinhua News Agency and the China
Meteorological Administration.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Sees Falling Consumer Price Index </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's consumer price index in
June was down 0.3 percent from May, Vietnam News Agency Thursday
quoted Vietnam's General Department of Statistics as saying.
</P>
<P>
It is the fourth monthly decline recorded so far this year.
</P>
<P>
The price for food continued dropping in June by 2.9 percent
from May or equivalent to 95.1 percent of that for December last
year.
</P>
<P>
Localities seeing decreases in food prices included Hanoi (3.1
percent), Hai Phong (5.5 percent), Thua Thien-Hue Province (5.6
percent) and Da Nang City (3.5 percent). However, An Giang and Can
Tho provinces saw increases of 3.4 percent and 0.2 percent,
respectively, in food prices due to exports.
</P>
<P>
The decline of the food prices was attributed to this year's
bumper winter-spring harvest with an estimated output of 13.9
million tons of rice, the highest so far.
</P>
<P>
Drops of between 0.2 and 0.3 percent were also recorded in the
prices of soft drinks, tobacco, traveling and post services and
others.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, increases ranging from 0.2-1 percent were recorded
with the prices of schooling facilities up 1 percent, household
goods and utensils 0.4 percent and pharmaceutical products 0.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
The price of the U.S. dollar was unchanged in June while the
price of gold fell 2.4 percent from May.
</P>
<P>
With decreases of prices in the four consecutive months, the
price index in the first half of this year increased by only 1.6
percent compared with that of December last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Senate approved Wednesday
42 of the 49 ministerial nominees proposed by President Olusegun
Obasanjo, concluding the marathon clearance only days before its
expiration.
</P>
<P>
The list to be announced by the president will form Nigeria's
first civilian government in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Seven candidates were deleted from the list, which was not yet
published, because the states of their origin have already secured
enough representation in the government, according to Senate
sources.
</P>
<P>
"We will communicate our final decision to the president, who
will thereafter make it public along with the portfolios," said
Senator Joseph Waku after the ending of Wednesday's session of the
upper house of Nigeria's National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The clearance of the list was delayed when the senators were
asking for more personal information on the nominees last week.
</P>
<P>
The clearance was also proceeded amid severe quarrels between
the majority People's Democratic Party (PDP) and the two minority
parties, the Alliance for Democracy (AD) and All People's Party (
APP)
</P>
<P>
The AD and APP senators walked out of the National Assembly
Building Tuesday to protest a corruption accusation against them,
leaving the PDP senators continuing their debate alone in the
building.
</P>
<P>
The protest took place when an AD-sponsored motion seeking to
censure PDP Senator Gbenga Aluko was dropped in the Senate. The
motion demanded an apology from Aluko for his allegation in a
newspaper pronouncement, accusing some AD and APP senators of

<HEADLINE> Rising Sea Levels Could Have Impact On Southern China's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A study has found that the sea
around Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao will rise by 10 cm to 30 cm
in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Water in the Pearl River estuary is expected to rise 30 cm and
on the western side of the Leizhou Peninsula to rise 10 cm. This
will take place from 1990 to 2030 and will have a significant
impact in many areas like the coastal economy, land resources, and
the environment, members of the study team say.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Sciences' Guangzhou Branch and the
Guangdong Provincial Institute of Sciences started four years ago
with more than 100 scientists and technicians participating on the
"Impact and counter measures of rising sea levels on coastal
economic development of Guangdong Province" study.
</P>
<P>
They call for better standards in water control projects and
works on the coast and suggested building a major water control
project on the Pearl River Delta to control the volume of water
from the Xijiang and Beijiang rivers, two tributaries of the Pearl,
and to alleviate possible disasters from a rising sea level.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province now
leads the country in private business operations boasting 105,000
such enterprises, employing 1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
There are also 2.79 million self-employed households with 6.21
million employees.
</P>
<P>
These private businesses have a combined registered capital of
62.8 billion yuan (7.56 billion US dollars), accounting for 9.3
percent of the total in the province, up 1.6 percentage points on
a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Renjing, director of the Provincial Administration for
Industry and Commerce, attributed the local booming private
economy to the national policy of upgrading non-state businesses
as an important component of the country's economy, instead of
being merely complementary as before, an encouragement which was
decreed at the 15th National Party Congress in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Shandong authorities have now sworn to step up support for
private enterprises and self-employed households and to a create
more favorable business environment for them.
</P>
<P>
The second largest province after Henan in China in terms of
population, Shandong now also ranks third nationwide in terms of
GDP.

<HEADLINE> Township Businesses Boost Export in Hubei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Export losses made by foreign-funded
enterprises in central China's Hubei Province this year may be
written off by a booming foreign trade conducted by township
businesses, according to the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
The township sector, which only took off in 1993, has just
become a driving force to revive the province's waning exports,
said Deputy Governor Zhang Hongxiang.
</P>
<P>
The sector exported goods worth over two billion yuan in the
first four months of this year, up 10 percent compared to the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
There were more than 600 township firms having foreign trade
licenses in Hubei by the end of last year. They realized a
combined 8.3 billion yuan-worth of exports in 1998, compared with
eight million yuan 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Tianyu Garment Firm, for example, has successfully entered
overseas markets in North America, Europe and Africa. Its exports
reached 23 million U.S. dollars-worth last year.
</P>
<P>
High value-added exports, such as chemicals, light industrial
products, foodstuffs and medicines, account for 40 percent of the
total, up 20 percent from five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to bestow more flexible policies to help
township enterprises get involved in foreign trade.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rican-Nicaraguan Dispute Re-emerges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The dispute between Costa Rica
and Nicaragua over navigation rights on the San Juan River has
risen once again as presidents of both countries issued statements
Wednesday to defend each other's stand.
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman rejected on Wednesday once
again Costa Rica's request to transport armed civil guards on the
river, the Costa Rican press reported. The dispute led to a crisis
in bilateral relations last year.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican President Miguel Angel Rodriguez, in return,
reaffirmed his stance on Wednesday that their rights must be
respected.
</P>
<P>
He said he would consider President Aleman's request last week
to extend an migratory amnesty granted to Nicaraguan citizens, due
to expire on July 31, but added that there were growing pressures
against such an extension.
</P>
<P>
Local press quoted certain treaties as saying that Costa Rica
has the right of free passage on the river. However, Nicaragua
exercises sovereign rights over the river.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, President Aleman quoted an old phrase, "
Sovereignty is not discussed, it is defended with arms," referring
to the case.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that around 150,000 Nicaraguans have taken
advantage of the amnesty to enter Costa Rica. However, Councilor
Roberto Rojas said that there might be up to 600,000 Nicaraguans
living in Costa Rica illegally.
</P>
<P>
The massive influx of Nicaraguans into Costa Rica was
attributed to the difficult economic situation and a high
unemployment rate in Nicaragua.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Explore LNG Market in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is to explore
possibilities of selling liquefied natural gas (LNG) from its
Tangguh field in Irian Jaya to China, Antara News Agency Thursday
quoted a spokesman for state-owned oil and natural gas company
Pertamina as saying.
</P>
<P>
Pertamina's President Director Martiono Hadianto said he had
met President B.J. Habibie on Wednesday to report that he would
soon visit China to sound out relevant authorities, business or
industrial circles there about the possibility of marketing
Indonesian LNG in the world's most populous country.
</P>
<P>
The Tangguh gas field in Indonesia's easternmost province of
Irian Jaya was known to hold up to 14.6 trillion cubic feet of
natural gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
The field was being developed by contractor-operator Arthur
Richfield Company (Arco) of the United States and LNG production
facilities were also being set up in the region.
</P>
<P>
Asked about LNG consumption in China, Hadianto said so far
China was mostly using oil and coal but lately demand for clean
energy was rising so rapidly that China was considering to use
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that Indonesian LNG exports had recently been
through a difficult period due to a decline in world demand and
the emergence of more competitors in the international market.
</P>
<P>
Regular takers of Indonesian LNG so far are South Korea, Japan
and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Hadianto said Pertamina needed to sound out sales possibilities
abroad properly as LNG production costs were very high.
</P>
<P>
"So even before the LNG production facilities are in place, we
need to know who is going to buy the product," Hadianto added.

TIANJIN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's Asea Brown Boveri (
ABB) is stepping up cooperation with China's Tianjin University in
research for cleaner, alternative energy.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to synthesize gasoline from methane and carbon
dioxide.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Baldur Eliasson, who is in charge of the company's energy
and global change department, says that they signed a contract two
months ago and ABB is quite willing to increase cooperation with
China in environmental protection and energy development.
</P>
<P>
In addition to business cooperation, it has also made an effort
at increasing study and research with Chinese partners. It
provided a fund of two million U.S. dollars with the Alliance for
Global Sustainability in May to study the influence of the
electric power system on the environment in China.
</P>
<P>
The energy and environmental protection market in China has
great potential, because at present the per capita energy
consumption in China is only a tenth that of developed countries.
</P>
<P>
ABB is a multinational that deals mainly in electricity,
automation, oil and gas, and fiscal services. It has 16 offices
and 20 enterprises in China, employing over 6,000 people.

GUILIN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- China plans to use World Bank loans
to speed up water flow on the Li River in the city of Guilin, a
tourism spot known for its picturesque landscape in China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the river during dry seasons flows
at only 10 cu.m. per second and stops navigation because of
insufficient water level. Analysts say that 30 cu.m. per second is
needed and that this is especially necessary when tourists visit
the city.
</P>
<P>
The water supply work will consist of a new reservoir, at least
two water diversion projects, and a couple of other projects that
will be financed through different channels, one of which is World
Bank loans.
</P>
<P>
Construction will start this year and will be finished in two
or three years. When it is finished, water flow will reach 40 cu.m.
per second during dry season, and boating on the river will be a
year-round event, experts say.
</P>
<P>
The city is also increasing efforts to stop industrial
pollution and 98 percent of the city's industrial waste water is
being treated and 72 percent of treated waste water have reached

After Myanmar regained independence from British colonial rule
on January 4, 1948, successive governments have taken various
measures in an effort to eliminate drugs.
</P>
<P>
One of the main measures taken was promulgation of
anti-narcotics laws, trying to put drug abuse in the country under
control and be governed by laws.
</P>
<P>
The country enacted the first Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Law
in 1974, to which it made amendments and supplements in 1983 and
1988.
</P>
<P>
Later on January 27, 1993, Myanmar promulgated the second
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Law, abolishing and
replacing the 1974 anti-drug law. The only difference is that the
1993 law allows for death penalty to be imposed upon drug
violators under certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Setting up special drug control organizations is the next
measure Myanmar has taken. To strengthen the leadership and
supervision in the drug control work, Myanmar formed the Central
Committee for Drug Abuse Control in 1975.
</P>
<P>
Increase of government's investment in the development of
border areas and ethnic races, raising of the living standard of
inhabitants in these areas, changing of their traditional
livelihood which depends on poppy cultivation and cutting off the
drug sources are also measures taken by Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
According to official data, during the past 10 years between
1988 and 1998, the Myanmar government injected 14.6 billion kyats
(48.6 million U.S. dollars) for the development of border areas
and ethnic races, building 15,565 kilometers of roads, 714
bridges, 43 hospitals, 79 clinics, 44 rural health centers, 411
schools, 18 dams, 18 livestock breeding farms, eight power
stations, 77 TV relay stations and 52 posts and telecommunications
offices.
</P>
<P>
The building of these facilities greatly improved the
conditions of transport, health and education in the border areas,
promoting the economic development there.
</P>
<P>
The most important is that some farmers have cultivated
sugarcane and buckwheat, substituting poppy. In 1998, the
cultivation area of poppy substitute crops stood at 5,898 hectares
and it increased to 4,916 hectares in 1999. Due to the expanded
cultivation area of these substitute crops, the production of drug
and its supply dropped.

<HEADLINE> European Bourses Dip on U.S Rate Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON June 23 (Xinhua) - European stock markets fell sharply
Wednesday amid rekindled fears of a hike in US interest rates
later this month.
</P>
<P>
The leading UK FTSE 100 finished weaker on fears of interest
rates hikes in the United States. Merger news in Britain failed to
boost sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The blue chips ended down 55.9 points, or 0.85 percent, at
6496.5 after an agreement by Lloyds TSB to pay 11 billion US
dollars for mutual group Scottish Widows met with a lukewarm
reception.
</P>
<P>
Lloyds stock rose at first but then fell back, finishing the
day at 899.5p, a drop of 2.7 percent as analysts concluded that
Lloyds may have paid too much.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the electronically traded Xetra Dax extended
earlier losses to close 1.3 percent lower at 5399.11, a loss of
just under 70 points.
</P>
<P>
Automakers BWM and VW led the market down after BMW revealed an
unexpectedly large rescue package for Rover. Fears that VW was
going to buy Scania, the Swedish truck maker, also depressed
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
Paris stocks also drifted lower after interest rates worries
depressed Wall Street. The Cac 40 index was down more than 1
percent at 4481, well below its record highs of last week.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Decides to Postpone East Timor Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Wednesday decided to postpone for two weeks a August 8
vote on the future of East Timor because of security concerns and
logistical problems.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the United Nations Security Council, Annan did
not give a precise date.
</P>
<P>
In the report, Annan said pro-integration militias were
intimidating voters in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
"Militia activities continue to have a constricting effect on
political freedom, silencing pro-independence activists and their
supporters and forcing them into hiding, thus jeopardising the
necessary openness of the consultation process," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he hoped registration of voters would begin on July
13, a delay of three weeks, which would give U.N. staff time to be
deployed in all areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the the security situation will have improved
sufficiently by then to enable me to make a position determination
of the security conditions so that the operational phases of the
consultation can begin," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said in the meantime, Indonesia and Portugal had
agreed to a two-week postponement of the ballot date.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is fielding a mission of 900, including 270
civilian police, 50 military officers and hundreds of electoral
officials and administrators.
</P>
<P>
Annan said delays in obtaining Indonesia visas and slow action
by the Security Council have slowed the deployment of the U.N.
mission in East Timor.

<HEADLINE> Premier League Windfall Tax Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Premier League has rejected
calls for England's richest football clubs to pay a windfall tax
to help the grassroots game, according to a BBC report.
</P>
<P>
The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) is calling for
a redistribution of money from television rights to improve grass
roots football.
</P>
<P>
In a report on the future of sport in the UK, it acknowledges
the government's Football Task Force's proposal for a 5% levy on
the money raised from the next television rights deal.
</P>
<P>
The current contract between BSkyB, the BBC and the Premier
League is worth 185m a year to the clubs.
</P>
<P>
If there was to be a 5% levy on that total, a windfall of 9.25m
each year would go to the grassroots.
</P>
<P>
This money would be used to improve facilities for football at
schools and community sports fields, helping to create the stars
of the future.
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman for the Premier League said that its clubs -
the 20 top teams in England - already did their bit.
</P>
<P>
The Premier League estimates that 50m was paid into Government
coffers by clubs in the form of taxes and other levies such as
National Insurance during the past season.
</P>
<P>
It also said that clubs in the English game's top division had
spent 50m over the past four years in the game outside the Premier
League.
</P>
<P>
This was through a variety of means, including the Football
League, Football Trust and new academies for young football
players.
</P>
<P>
"This windfall tax proposal seems to have been rather plucked
out of the air without any real regard for the way much is already
being invested in the game," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"Premier League clubs who face enormous and growing cost
pressures already make a significant contribution to the game and
to their local communities.
</P>
<P>
"Threats of a windfall tax will do nothing to aid that process
and could undermine the commercial well being of our top clubs who
have increasingly to compete in a truly international market place.
"
</P>
<P>
The idea of a windfall tax has been used in the past in the UK,
most recently in 1997 when former state owned companies had to pay
a one off tax.
</P>
<P>
The think-tank also stressed the connection between sport and
other areas of social policy, including health and social
exclusion.
</P>
<P>
One of its other suggestions is for doctors to be able to
prescribe sport.
</P>
<P>
Among other proposals will be a reduction in the number of
sports supported by the Sports Councils.
</P>
<P>
The sports should be selected according to international
standing or visibility, emotional importance to the country - and
cost-effectiveness.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Speeds Up Expressway Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, a remote border area in northwest China, has used a loan
from the World Bank of 450 million U.S. dollars to build
expressways.
</P>
<P>
The loans make up one tenth of the total sum provided by the
World Bank for highway construction in China, a regional
government official said.
</P>
<P>
Work on the first road started in March in 1995, at a cost of
three billion yuan, of which 150 million U.S. dollars came from
the World Bank. The 283-km-road between Turpan and Dahuangshan
opened to traffic in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
Work on the second one, which links Urumqi with Kuitun, a
distance of 266 km, started in April, 1997. It will cost an
estimated five billion yuan. The World Bank is to provide 300
million U.S. dollars for the project. The road is expected to be
completed in September 2000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the region is making preparations for the
construction of third highway, which will link Kuitun City with
Sailimu Lake, a distance of 323 km, with World Bank loans.
</P>
<P>
A feasibility study for a fourth highway, with a designed
length of 464 km, is now under way.
</P>
<P>
Construction of new expressways will accelerate economic growth
in Xinjiang, where highway transport accounts for 95 percent of
the total volume of goods transported.

<HEADLINE> Exiled Iraqi Opposition Asks U.S. to Take "Bold Action" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The exiled Iraqi opposition
asked the United States on Wednesday for "bold action" to help
them overthrow President Saddam Hussein, but the Clinton
administration deemed the time was not ripe for that kind of
action.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Chalabi, a member of the executive presidency of the
Iraqi National Congress (INC), told a Senate committee that the
opposition wanted more protection given by the U.S. military, to
embolden internal opponents fighting the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
"What we need is bold action," he said, arguing that the
opponents inside Iraq were looking to get equipment and training
through the INC under the Iraq Liberation Act.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq Liberation Act, passed by U.S. Congress last year,
gave the administration power to give the Iraqi opposition goods
and services worth up to $98 million, mostly in the form of
surplus equipment from the Department of Defense.
</P>
<P>
So far the Clinton administration has not used the power and
is planning to release mainly office and communications equipment.
</P>
<P>
Beth Jones, the principal deputy assistant secretary of state
for Near Eastern Affairs, told the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee that the administration did not see "an effective use
of military equipment now."
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton decided last year to add "regime
change" to U.S. policy toward Iraq and began to reactivate the
INC. But his administration said it was premature to give
military support for the INC.
</P>
<P>
"There are a host of issues that must be resolved before we
can hae confidence that providing arms would advance our
objectives of promoting a change of regime," Jones said.
</P>
<P>
The United States, in its attempt to topple the Iraqi
government, will help convene a meeting next month in a Western
capital, which is meant to bring together all opposition groups
and united them under a single umbrella organization, possibly
using the INC label.

<HEADLINE> 10 Billion U.S. Dollars Needed to Save Mediterranean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A grand total of 10 billion U.S.
dollars will be needed to save the Mediterranean from death by
pollution, an international conference estimated Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The international conference, which held in Italian south city
of Reggio Calabria, said the money is needed to clean up urban and
industrial wastes, for toxic waste management, monitoring of
water-courses for pollution, public information and education
programs, and national action plans.
</P>
<P>
The Mediterranean is a closed sea whose only major outlet
permitting an exchange of its water with one of the world's oceans
is to the Atlantic through the straits of Gibraltar.
</P>
<P>
The conference also accepted a proposal from environmentalist
groups on hand at the meeting to set up a register plotting the
loading, unloading and movements of the main agents of pollution
in the Mediterranean area.
</P>
<P>
About 20 percent of the world's crude oil is transported
through the Mediterranean, and countries with intensive
agriculture such as Italy's use large amounts of fertilizers and
pesticides.
</P>
<P>
According to recent figures, Italy, for example, spreads two
million tons of phosphates and nitrates on its fields each year,
and much of this eventually finishes in the sea.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Says Fund for Kosovo Mission Is Empty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations said
Wednesday that a fund set up for its civilian operations in
Kosovo, a Serbian province, was empty, making it impossible to pay
for local civilian servants and small-scale infrastructure
projects.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Interim Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK) is attempting
to set up seven commissions among Kosovo Albanians and Serbs on
such issues as health, education, public utilities, justice, trade
and agriculture, finance and communications, U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of funding to execute UNMIK's work is a top
concern," he told a press conference, "Trust funds have been set
up but so far remain empty."
</P>
<P>
"Money is urgently needed to pay for the civilian servants --
many of whom have not been paid for more than two months," the
spokesman said. "Another priority for funding so-called 'Quick
Impact Project' which are small-scaled projects ranging from
repairing damaged water supplies, mosques and churches."
</P>
<P>
UNMIK, he said, also needs money to procure computers for the
judges to carry out their work.
</P>
<P>
Under a peace plan, adopted by the U.N. Security Council on
June 10, the United Nations is to administrate the civilian
component in parallel with the peacekeepers who are flying U.N.
flag in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The European Union, which is responsible for the post-war
reconstruction, estimates that rebuilding Kosovo would cost about
1 billion euros, the equivalent of 1.03 billion U.S. dollars, per
year for next three years with half the funds coming from 15
European countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission will have the task of resettling and proving
an interim administration for up to a million ethnic Albanian
refugees, many of whom sought refuge in neighboring countries
after NATO's March 24 bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
UNMIK is also expected to provide international police advise.
However, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has to appoint an
overall administrative, called his special representative, which
he has not made yet a final decision, naming instead Sergio Vieira
de Mello, U.N. under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs,
on an interim basis.

It also urged Americans travelling abroad to exercise caution.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan warned Turkey on Wednesday to beware of a bloodbath that
could unleash a military coup if it executed him.
</P>
<P>
"If capital punishment is inflicted there will be negative
consequences, a lot of blood will flow and the blood could lead to
a military coup d'etat," Ocalan told the Rome Daily La Republica
in an interview conducted through his lawyer.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Chinese Sport Works Shown in Olympic Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Some 150 pieces of works about
sports in ancient China are on show at the Olympic Museum in
Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
He Zhenliang, Chairman of the Cultural Commission of the
International Olympic Committee (IOC), formally opened the
exhibition "5000 Years of Sport in China - Art and Tradition" here
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"With its origins in the Yellow River Valley, the Chinese
civilization has its own time-honored sports like all other
ancient civilizations," He said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 5,000 years, he told more than 100 guests at the
opening ceremony, the Chinese people have created a great variety
of sports and games.
</P>
<P>
"A number of modern sports can be traced back to ancient China:
weightlifting, swimming, archery and equestrian sports in summer,
and skating and skiing in winter," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the visitors to the exhibition would
gain a better knowledge and understanding of China.
</P>
<P>
In a written message to mark the exhibition, IOC President Juan
Antonio Samaranch praised the Chinese Olympic Committee and the
Chinese athletes for their contributions to the Olympic movement.
</P>
<P>
Hosting the exhibition entitled "5000 Years of Sport in China,"
Samaranch said "the Olympic Museum in Lausanne will enable its
many visitors to discover a remarkable exhibition presenting a
highly original vision of sport".
</P>
<P>
The exhibits have been provided by China Sport's Museum in

<HEADLINE> Women's Seeds Advance in Wimbledon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- All women's seeded players playing
on Wednesday advanced into the third round of the singles event at
the Wimbledon tennis championships.
</P>
<P>
Out of the eight women's seeds on display, only second seed
Steffi Graf of Germany was taken the distance as the others had
relatively easy straight sets victories.
</P>
<P>
Graf, seven-time Wimbledon champion, survived a scare as she
faced an inspired Marian De Swardt of South Africa who served and
volleyed exceptionally to take the opening set 6-4.
</P>
<P>
However, Graf brought herself back into the match with some
trademark forehand winners, while De Swardt was unable to maintain
the high standard of the first set. Graf went on to win the next
two sets at 6-3, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
The German, who is now the highest seed left in the competition
after the shock defeat of Martina Hingis of Switzerland yesterday,
will now meet Corina Morariu who took Graf to three sets at last
year's U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
Graf's long-time rival Monica Seles of the United States
enjoyed an extremely easy victory in comparison. Seles, the No. 4
seed this year, whitewashed Germany's Marlene Weingartner 6-0, 6-0,
hitting an astonishing 92% returns in court. Seles simply ran the
German opponent ragged and Weingartner, whose appearance this year
is her first ever at Wimbledon, had no response.
</P>
<P>
Seles will face talented 17-year-old Croatian Mirjana Lucic in
the next round.
</P>
<P>
Joining Seles in the third round is fellow American Venus
Williams, who defeated a stubborn Elena Tatarkova 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the spotlight focused on the 18-year-old
Russian Anna Kournikova, as she won a tough encounter against
Maria Vento of Venezuela 7-5, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Other seeds who also played early were Amanda Coetzer, the No.
12 seed, who defeated Japan's Miho Saeki 6-4, 6-1, and Sandrine
Testud, who won a prospectively tough match with Barbara Rittner
quite easily, 7-6 (7-2), 6-1. Testud's French compatriot eighth
seeded Nathalie Tauziat, who reached the final last year, beat
Amanda Hopmans of the Netherlands 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
In men's section, Jim Courier of the United States shoved 12th
seed Carlos Moya out of the Wimbledon championships in the second
round in a five-set tussle of former French Open champions.
</P>
<P>
But five-times champion Pete Sampras needed just 81 minutes to
crush Canada's Sebastien Laureau 6-4, 6-2, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Laureau showed the odd flash of inspiration -- even breaking
Sampras's serve twice -- but didn't have the weaponry to hurt the
top seed who is yet to lose a set and gave a masterclass in
consistency.
</P>
<P>
Courier showed once more what a determined streetfighter he is
in toppling former world number one Moya 6-3, 3-6, 7-6, 3-6, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old American, who was himself world number one back
in 1992, proved that his power has not lost its edge against Moya'
s claycourt skills.
</P>
<P>
Spanish 16th seed Felix Mantilla became the first men's seed to
fall at this year's Wimbledon, losing 6-2, 6-4, 6-7, 6-2 to
American Paul Goldstein minutes before Moya went under.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in 12 years, Wimbledon had seen all 16 men's
seeds survive into the second round.
</P>
<P>
Men's ninth seed Greg Rusedski thrashed British compatriot
Arvind Parmar, a qualifier, 6-3, 6-4, 7-6. The 21-year-old Parmar
took just 11 points on Rusedski's serve.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski now faces an interesting test against Swede Magnus
Norman, who beat Goran Ivanisevic 14-12 in the fifth set in an
epic second-round match at Wimbledon two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Norman, who has a long-standing heart problem which doctors
have warned could curtail his professional career, beat Fabrice
Santoro of France 6-2, 6-3, 7-6.
</P>
<P>
Thirteenth seed Karol Kucera of Slovakia made it into the third
round with a 7-6, 6-3, 6-2 victory over Brazilian qualifier Andre
Sa while 1997 runner-up Cedric Pioline also went through after
beating fellow Frenchman Arnaud Clement 6-3, 6-1, 6-3.

Ozolas had proposed sending Ben Hur away in a letter to
Lithuanian Foreign Minister Algirdas Saudargas, the Interfax
