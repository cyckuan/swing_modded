IRAQI LEADERSHIP DEFIANT AS ATTACKS CONTINUE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BAGHDAD _ The US and British missile attacks on Iraq intensified
before dawn Sunday, pounding the heart of Saddam Hussein's regime,
leaving a trail of destruction at southern positions of the
Republican Guard, oil refineries in Basra, TV transmitters near
Baghdad, and presidential palaces.
</P>
<P>
   After three straight days of missile strikes, Iraq held out hope
that the bombing would end with the dawn, which the nation marks as
the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   But as morning neared, the skies lit up in fiery nighttime
finale. One cruise missile tracked through the night sky over
Baghdad, passed unscathed through a short barage of Iraqi
antiaircraft fire, and detonated in a direct hit on a large
government building.
</P>
<P>
   Two more cruise missiles then hammered the building, bursting
into mushroom clouds of fire. The building spewed acrid smoke into
the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   In and around Baghdad, the continued pounding of cruise missiles
could be heard and flames from destroyed buildings shot lit up the
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   It ended just before 5 a.m. as, following the sudden silence, a
slow, melancholy morning call to prayer came from a downtown
mosque.
</P>
<P>
   The sustained strikes prompted an angry and besieged Iraqi
leadership to respond by sharply redrawing diplomatic lines, and
making it apparent that the UN weapons inspectors would not return
to Iraq unless harsh economic sanctions were lifted.
</P>
<P>
   A defiant Hussein appeared in a taped statement Friday night
aired on a Qatar-based television network, telling the Iraqi
people, ``You must thank God for your success, and continue
resistance. We are the people of good morality. We are not going to
compromise to the other side of evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the words of defiance, Pentagon officials said they have
been struck by the lack of military resistance from Iraqi forces.
The United States denied Iraqi assertions that more than 77 US
cruise missiles had been shot down.
</P>
<P>
   The streaking red tracers and rattle of Iraqi antiaircraft fire
over Baghdad in the predawn hours Sunday were noticeably shortlived
compared to the resistance offered in the previous two days of US
missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Following through on President Clinton's promise to step up a
campaign aimed at toppling Hussein, US jets also dropped leaflets
on Iraqi forces in southern Iraq telling them not to worry about
being targeted unless they are defending what they referred to as
``the Baghdad regime,'' according to Voice of America broadcasts
heard in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Already more US cruise missiles have been launched in Operation
Desert Fox, as the attacks have been dubbed, than the 289 fired at
Iraq in the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference in Baghdad, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz said that chief UN weapons inspector Richard Butler
``has killed his job'' by ``preparing the grounds for this
aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   Aziz said that the US and British attacks were orchestrated
through Butler via a report to the UN Security Council that, Aziz
asserted, falsely accused Iraq of not cooperating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq will not tolerate UNSCOM and sanctions at the same
time,'' said Aziz. ``If they want to keep the sanctions, let them
leave UNSCOM in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Aziz stressed that Iraq fulfilled its responsibility in
accordance with the spirit of the letter it sent to the UN
secretary-general on Nov. 14 and that UNSCOM has carried out
hundreds of inspections since then.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz also expressed anger that the United States and Britain
have attacked targets that have wounded civilians in Iraq. He
described sustained missile strikes causing vast damage.
</P>
<P>
   A warehouse belonging to the Ministry of Trade was hit. Four
warehouses in Baghdad holding 1,000 tons of cotton were destroyed
by a cruise missile, he said. The targets also included an oil
refinery in the southern port city of Basra and the old Ministry of
Defense building in downtown Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The targets seem aimed at degrading Hussein's military machinery
as well as his grip on the civilian society.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz said attacks on civilian targets were ``sinister.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The collateral damage on the Ministry of Defense led to the
nearby destruction of hospitals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters Sunday were taken to see the hospital, which had blown
out windows and moderate damage from the nearby attack. But there
were no reports of injuries to patients.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi Health Ministry announced Thursday that at least 25
people have died during the attacks and 75 have been wounded in
Baghdad, but a complete casualty toll has not been announced. The
bombings in the southern cities of Basra and Hussein's hometown of
Tikrit were certain to have caused some casualties but Iraqi
officials offered no official accounting of dead or wounded.
</P>
<P>
   At the Al Yarmouk Hospital, among Iraq's largest hospitals and
located in the Western part of the city, officials said they had
received approximately 13 people who were dead when they arrived at
the hospital during the first two days of attacks. They said they
had treated a total of 34 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital was once a crown jewel in Iraq's formerly advanced
and now crippled medical infrastructure. The hospitals are hard hit
by the crushing economic sanctions imposed in the aftermath of the
1991 Gulf War. At the entrance there are large painted signs that
read, ``Down, Down, USA.''
</P>
<P>
   In the emergency and surgical wards, those wounded lay in
rusting cots amid bleak conditions. Among them was Muhsin Hadi, 20,
who said he was walking home from his job selling cigarettes on
Thursday night when US cruise missiles pounded a seven-story
military industrial building in the heart of downtown Baghdad. The
blast blew him off his feet, he said, and sent shrapnel into his
abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can America do this?'' he asked. ``They say they hit only
military targets, but they hit people too.''
</P>
<P>
   In the surgical ward, Jasem Zubati, 41, was listed in serious
but stable condition with head wounds and a fractured vertebra.
With bandages wrapped around his head and in obvious pain, he
described how his home in the Al Adel section of Baghdad was hit by
a missile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It crashed through the back of our house, right into the
kitchen,'' said Zubati, a well-to-do engineer who has profited from
an import business under the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter visited the home, and saw the evidence of the damage.
There was a crater in the rear of the house, and broken kitchen
appliances were stacked in the front of the house. Zubati said his
injuries came in the collapse of the roof of his home, where he
lived with his wife and three children. He has a 3-week-old son.
Two older children were injured slightly and hospitalized, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is my house a secret, military location? Have I done anything
to America?'' he asked, shaking with anger and pain. ``I will
avenge myself if it takes 40 years. I will ask Saddam to take
revenge. I have great hatred for your government.''
</P>
<P>
   It remained difficult for reporters to assess the full extent of
the damage. The Ministry of Information forbids reporters from
traveling without a government ``minder'' accompanying them, and no
reporters have been permitted to travel outside Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Angry that the attacks seemed aimed directly the heart of the
Iraqi leader's personal power base, Aziz said virtually all of the
sites had been inspected and heavily monitored by UN arms
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They attack presidential sites, they are guest houses built by
the Iraqis, they are fine buildings, they just want to destroy
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz made repeated references to the impeachment proceedings
engulfing Clinton's presidency and fixating both the American and
Iraqi people. He said that Clinton ``lied to his own people'' and
that he was now ``lying about Iraq to justify this aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can the American people believe a man who has lied to his
own people, to the Congress. He lies to his nation and tells the
truth about Iraq? How can that be? How can we swallow that? These
are lies, cheap lies,'' Aziz said.

MCCURRY ADMITS `DOUBTS' ABOUT CLINTON 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SARAH LYALL  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Michael D. McCurry, the former White House press
secretary, said Friday that he had ``enormous doubts'' about
President Clinton. Speaking on the BBC public affairs program
``Newsnight,'' McCurry said that although he respected Clinton's
professional ability, he had serious concerns about his
``incredibly bizarre personal behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he had confidence in the president, McCurry
said: ``I have enormous doubts because of the recklessness of his
behavior. The immorality is troublesome to me, but one can sort of
understand how an adult male gets in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry left his job in October after months of deflecting
questions about the Monica Lewinsky affair. ``But there's something
beyond that, the nature of this particular affair and the way in
which he did conceal it really does raise some profoundly troubling
matters.''
</P>
<P>
   He said of Clinton's behavior, ``It's surely reckless, contrary
to the way you'd expect a rational human being to behave.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had believed Clinton was telling the truth when he
denied having a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, and felt
aggrieved that he had had to spend so many months trying to
``wiggle through'' questions put to him by the news media.
</P>
<P>
   While the president never ordered anyone to lie, McCurry said,
he allowed ``the deception to go on, knowing the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he thought the president would not consider resigning
from office unless he was sure the country would be damaged too
severely otherwise. ``He can't suffer any more personal
embarrassment than he's already suffered,'' McCurry said. ``The
question is, how much do we all have to suffer through at this
point?''

 &HT;    Georgians in House split on party lines
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr and Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One called on President Clinton to resign. Another
attacked his Republican foes. A third called for reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the historic vote on whether to impeach the
president, members of the Georgia congressional delegation spoke
out on the floor of the House as they were poised to cast their
votes down party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Ending months of fence-sitting, Rep. Sanford Bishop came out
Friday against impeachment. Bishop's conservative southwest Georgia
constituents have flooded his office with calls urging him to vote
to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I cannot defend the president's conduct, it is my solemn
duty to defend the Constitution,'' Bishop said. ``Even if true, the
president's actions do not rise to the high level of `high crimes
and misdemeanors.'''
</P>
<P>
   The other two Democrats in the Georgia delegation, Cynthia
McKinney and John Lewis, had long been on the record opposing
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   All eight Republicans said they would vote to impeach the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) took an active role in steering more than
12 hours of debate, spending most of the day at the equivalent of
the prosecution's table.
</P>
<P>
   One of a handful of Republicans charged with responding to
points of law raised by the Democrats, Barr took the House
microphone repeatedly to differ with Democrats' interpretation of
the facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no such thing as entrapment for perjury,'' he shouted
in response to suggestions that independent counsel Ken Starr had
set up Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   With 12 hours of debate to fill, however, nearly every member of
Georgia's delegation became players in the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is sick. Her heart is heavy,'' said Rep. John Lewis
(D-Ga.), the Democrats' chief deputy whip in an appeal for
reconciliation. ``Her soul is aching and her spirit is low. Today
our nation stands at a crossroads, at the intersection of
participatory democracy and the politics of personal destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people elected Bill Clinton president of the United States
and they want him to remain president of the United States,'' Lewis
said. ``Some ... have never accepted the verdict of the people ...
Instead they embarked on a crusade of personal destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.) said he was dismayed to see the House
chambers half-empty, but he said it showed that the public seemed
resigned at the notion that the House would vote to impeach the
president for the second time in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a degree of sadness, a high degree of sobriety,''
Kingston said. But it does not take away from the evidence,
evidence that makes Kingston believe the president ought to be
impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Kingston noted that the Democrats argued it is wrong to debate
the impeachment vote when American forces have been sent to attack
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But Kingston said there were 62,000 troops on the ground in
Vietnam when three resolutions were presented in the House to
impeach President Nixon on May 18, 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Those articles called for Nixon's impeachment based on military
action in Indochina, not the Watergate matter.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charlie Norwood (R-Ga.) went further, asking for the
president to resign and spare the country the spectacle of a trial
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   There are thousands of pages of material that have not been made
public in the House that would be in a Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country does not need that,'' Norwood said. ``Clinton
doesn't know how to be straight, and that scares the bejesus out of
me.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Republican members say this is not about sex, the
Democrats say it is just that.
</P>
<P>
   They portrayed the GOP as a party obsessed with removing the
president at any cost, including the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is a sad day for our republic,'' said Rep. Cynthia
McKinney (D-Ga.). ``The Republican leaders have chosen to trample
the Constitution with partisan arrogance in order to strike a
political blow against President Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The American people clearly oppose impeachment, McKinney said,
but that won't stop lawmakers like Barr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republican leaders, blinded by their own sanctimonious piety
and hypocrisy, have chosen to push our nation to the brink of a
constitutional crisis for their own petty, political benefit,''
McKinney said.

IRAQI LEADERSHIP DEFIANT AS ATTACKS CONTINUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Corrects day of week throughout to Saturday)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD _ The US and British missile attacks on Iraq intensified
before dawn Saturday, pounding the heart of Saddam Hussein's
regime, leaving a trail of destruction at southern positions of the
Republican Guard, oil refineries in Basra, TV transmitters near
Baghdad, and presidential palaces.
</P>
<P>
   After three straight days of missile strikes, Iraq held out hope
that the bombing would end with the dawn, which the nation marks as
the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   But as morning neared, the skies lit up in fiery nighttime
finale. One cruise missile tracked through the night sky over
Baghdad, passed unscathed through a short barage of Iraqi
antiaircraft fire, and detonated in a direct hit on a large
government building.
</P>
<P>
   Two more cruise missiles then hammered the building, bursting
into mushroom clouds of fire. The building spewed acrid smoke into
the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   In and around Baghdad, the continued pounding of cruise missiles
could be heard and flames from destroyed buildings shot lit up the
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   It ended just before 5 a.m. as, following the sudden silence, a
slow, melancholy morning call to prayer came from a downtown
mosque.
</P>
<P>
   The sustained strikes prompted an angry and besieged Iraqi
leadership to respond by sharply redrawing diplomatic lines, and
making it apparent that the UN weapons inspectors would not return
to Iraq unless harsh economic sanctions were lifted.
</P>
<P>
   A defiant Hussein appeared in a taped statement Friday night
aired on a Qatar-based television network, telling the Iraqi
people, ``You must thank God for your success, and continue
resistance. We are the people of good morality. We are not going to
compromise to the other side of evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the words of defiance, Pentagon officials said they have
been struck by the lack of military resistance from Iraqi forces.
The United States denied Iraqi assertions that more than 77 US
cruise missiles had been shot down.
</P>
<P>
   The streaking red tracers and rattle of Iraqi antiaircraft fire
over Baghdad in the predawn hours Saturday were noticeably
shortlived compared to the resistance offered in the previous two
days of US missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Following through on President Clinton's promise to step up a
campaign aimed at toppling Hussein, US jets also dropped leaflets
on Iraqi forces in southern Iraq telling them not to worry about
being targeted unless they are defending what they referred to as
``the Baghdad regime,'' according to Voice of America broadcasts
heard in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Already more US cruise missiles have been launched in Operation
Desert Fox, as the attacks have been dubbed, than the 289 fired at
Iraq in the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference in Baghdad, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz said that chief UN weapons inspector Richard Butler
``has killed his job'' by ``preparing the grounds for this
aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   Aziz said that the US and British attacks were orchestrated
through Butler via a report to the UN Security Council that, Aziz
asserted, falsely accused Iraq of not cooperating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq will not tolerate UNSCOM and sanctions at the same
time,'' said Aziz. ``If they want to keep the sanctions, let them
leave UNSCOM in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Aziz stressed that Iraq fulfilled its responsibility in
accordance with the spirit of the letter it sent to the UN
secretary-general on Nov. 14 and that UNSCOM has carried out
hundreds of inspections since then.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz also expressed anger that the United States and Britain
have attacked targets that have wounded civilians in Iraq. He
described sustained missile strikes causing vast damage.
</P>
<P>
   A warehouse belonging to the Ministry of Trade was hit. Four
warehouses in Baghdad holding 1,000 tons of cotton were destroyed
by a cruise missile, he said. The targets also included an oil
refinery in the southern port city of Basra and the old Ministry of
Defense building in downtown Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The targets seem aimed at degrading Hussein's military machinery
as well as his grip on the civilian society.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz said attacks on civilian targets were ``sinister.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The collateral damage on the Ministry of Defense led to the
nearby destruction of hospitals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters Saturday were taken to see the hospital, which had
blown out windows and moderate damage from the nearby attack. But
there were no reports of injuries to patients.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi Health Ministry announced Thursday that at least 25
people have died during the attacks and 75 have been wounded in
Baghdad, but a complete casualty toll has not been announced. The
bombings in the southern cities of Basra and Hussein's hometown of
Tikrit were certain to have caused some casualties but Iraqi
officials offered no official accounting of dead or wounded.
</P>
<P>
   At the Al Yarmouk Hospital, among Iraq's largest hospitals and
located in the Western part of the city, officials said they had
received approximately 13 people who were dead when they arrived at
the hospital during the first two days of attacks. They said they
had treated a total of 34 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital was once a crown jewel in Iraq's formerly advanced
and now crippled medical infrastructure. The hospitals are hard hit
by the crushing economic sanctions imposed in the aftermath of the
1991 Gulf War. At the entrance there are large painted signs that
read, ``Down, Down, USA.''
</P>
<P>
   In the emergency and surgical wards, those wounded lay in
rusting cots amid bleak conditions. Among them was Muhsin Hadi, 20,
who said he was walking home from his job selling cigarettes on
Thursday night when US cruise missiles pounded a seven-story
military industrial building in the heart of downtown Baghdad. The
blast blew him off his feet, he said, and sent shrapnel into his
abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can America do this?'' he asked. ``They say they hit only
military targets, but they hit people too.''
</P>
<P>
   In the surgical ward, Jasem Zubati, 41, was listed in serious
but stable condition with head wounds and a fractured vertebra.
With bandages wrapped around his head and in obvious pain, he
described how his home in the Al Adel section of Baghdad was hit by
a missile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It crashed through the back of our house, right into the
kitchen,'' said Zubati, a well-to-do engineer who has profited from
an import business under the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter visited the home, and saw the evidence of the damage.
There was a crater in the rear of the house, and broken kitchen
appliances were stacked in the front of the house. Zubati said his
injuries came in the collapse of the roof of his home, where he
lived with his wife and three children. He has a 3-week-old son.
Two older children were injured slightly and hospitalized, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is my house a secret, military location? Have I done anything
to America?'' he asked, shaking with anger and pain. ``I will
avenge myself if it takes 40 years. I will ask Saddam to take
revenge. I have great hatred for your government.''
</P>
<P>
   It remained difficult for reporters to assess the full extent of
the damage. The Ministry of Information forbids reporters from
traveling without a government ``minder'' accompanying them, and no
reporters have been permitted to travel outside Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Angry that the attacks seemed aimed directly the heart of the
Iraqi leader's personal power base, Aziz said virtually all of the
sites had been inspected and heavily monitored by UN arms
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They attack presidential sites, they are guest houses built by
the Iraqis, they are fine buildings, they just want to destroy
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz made repeated references to the impeachment proceedings
engulfing Clinton's presidency and fixating both the American and
Iraqi people. He said that Clinton ``lied to his own people'' and
that he was now ``lying about Iraq to justify this aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can the American people believe a man who has lied to his
own people, to the Congress. He lies to his nation and tells the
truth about Iraq? How can that be? How can we swallow that? These
are lies, cheap lies,'' Aziz said.

CSUN UP FOR UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Officially, the series dates back only six
seasons. Three lopsided meetings, to be exact, and each went in
UCLA's favor.
</P>
<P>
   But there were also the days when Cal State Northridge's
freshman team met UCLA's freshman squad regularly. It was before
Lew Alcindor was so much in the public's eye and only playing with
a bunch of other first-year guys.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the Bruins dominated.
</P>
<P>
   So when, or if, CSUN beats UCLA for the first time on the
basketball court, it will send a lot of shock waves throughout the
region. And based on a quick start, high expectations and perhaps
the most talented CSUN team in 40 years, many of the Matadors think
today is a fine time to stage an upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our best chance to beat UCLA,'' CSUN guard Jason Crowe
said. ``This is our best record we've had (6-3) since we've moved
to Division I. I'm sure they don't feel Northridge is in the same
category as they are, and maybe they'll take us lightly. We match
up pretty well. We feel we're just as talented as they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Tipoff for CSUN and No.12 UCLA is 7:30 p.m. at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCLA, the pressure is on them,'' Crowe said. ``They don't want
to lose to a team that really hasn't been successful in the past.
We have the same amount of talent as anyone. It's how we perform.''
</P>
<P>
   While UCLA might consider it just another nonconference
game,it's not like that for CSUN. It's a marker, and not just with
the basketball players but within the athletic administration.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Matadors grew up rooting for UCLA, wanting the
opportunity to play at Pauley Pavilion. They were on the couch
cheering for Tyus Edney to go the distance against Missouri, and
have spent summers playing against other Bruins in leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be one of the hardest games they play,'' CSUN
senior guard Derrick Higgins said. ``This is territory claiming.
Are we getting respect? I think someone out there gives us a
chance. Probably 12 out of a million.''
</P>
<P>
   The repercussions of a CSUN win would validate the rise of the
program and give the school unmatched publicity _ in a good way _
which can be a rarity on the Northridge campus. Even third-year
CSUN coach Bobby Braswell admits to having a different feeling
heading into this game as opposed to the 95-73 beating the Matadors
suffered in his first season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely feel like we're in a better position
talent-wise,'' Braswell said. ``You feel like you have a chance,
but we're going to have to play a perfect game.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1992 meeting, in which UCLA won by a misleadingly
close 80-73 score, the only opportunity the Matadors had to play
the Bruins was on the freshman level because CSUN was a Division II
school.
</P>
<P>
   Sheer timing has placed CSUN in an intriguing position. The
Matadors aren't loaded with experience _ three of their five
starters didn't play last season _ but they certainly have more
veterans than UCLA. Which is what CSUN is banking on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more experience and they have more high school
All-Americans,'' CSUN forward Andre Larry said. ``In a way, we can
have the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA has some of the best young talent in the country in
freshmen JaRon Rush, Jerome Moiso and Dan Gadzuric, but the Bruins
also start a pair of sophomores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't afford to overlook anybody because we're such a young
team,'' UCLA coach Steve Lavin said. ``We're still trying to
develop as a basketball team. We've struggled in every game this
year. Our team couldn't possibly have an exaggerated since of
themselves because we haven't played very well this year. We're
still trying to find our identity and still trying to find our
chemistry.''

UCLA READY FOR FINE-TUNING
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Maryland, Kentucky and Oklahoma State are in the
rear-view mirror. Arizona and Stanford arrive in a few weeks. But
tonight, against Cal State Northridge, the Bruins (5-2) begin the
critical three-game transition portion of their schedule.
</P>
<P>
   They've tested themselves against three ranked teams and
compiled a lengthy list of deficiencies, ranging from inexperience
and impatience to floor balance and transition defense.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge, American University (Dec. 23) and Loyola Marymount
(Dec. 29) provide three opportunities to smooth those glitches
before Pacific-10 play begins Jan. 2 against unbeaten Arizona. The
Bruins play at Oregon the following week, then host Stanford and
Cal. There won't be much chance for introspection or correction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we'd have a high level (of competition) in Puerto Rico
. . . so we tried to find a nice mix,'' coach Steve Lavin said.
``Obviously, it worked out ideally.
</P>
<P>
   ``(These) are games where we can get a look at more players.
They're at home, and they can build confidence. We thought it was a
nice blend.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN is 6-3 and lost its most recent game, at Brigham Young.
American, which plays USC on Monday, is 3-6 and Loyola Marymount
4-4.
</P>
<P>
   __ Dawn patrol: Because of exams, the Bruins practiced at dawn
this week for 90 minutes or two hours. Although short, the workouts
were productive. UCLA held three formal scrimmages, complete with
the scoreboard, uniforms and Pac-10 officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to make it as close to game conditions as we could,''
Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Lending a hand: Guard Ray Young and walk-on forward Sean
Farnham continue to provide brief but significant contributions in
limited playing time _ Young with his defense and athleticism,
Farnham with his spirit and physicality.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, they're averaging four points and three rebounds in 12
minutes.``From where I've been, it's just nice to make a
contribution,'' Farnham said.
</P>
<P>
   Young, a McDonald's All-American who had trouble adjusting to
college life and practice length, is UCLA's most improved player
since Oct. 17. But he might be limited tonight because of a
sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made a quantum leap,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Stat of the month: The Bruins held Nevada-Las Vegas to one
field goal in the final 13 minutes, their best defensive stretch of
the early season.
</P>
<P>
   Through seven games, opponents are shooting 39.6 percent from
the field and 34.7 percent from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   __ Quote of the month: Perhaps it was subconscious; perhaps it
was lingering frustration. But Lavin appeared to take a subtle dig
at Jelani McCoy, Kris Johnson, Toby Bailey and J.R. Henderson when
he said of the current roster:
</P>
<P>
   ``They're low-maintenance. They're all well-adjusted kids. There
are no dysfunctional personalities in the group.''

CONGRESSMAN CITES STATISTICS ON PUNISHMENT OF PERJURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Rep. James E. Rogan, R-Pasadena, used statistics
as a weapon against President Clinton on Friday, calling on his
experience as a prosecutor and judge to show punishment for perjury
is not nearly a rarity.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan told his colleagues during debate on the floor of Congress
that about 700 people have been convicted in federal court for
perjury-related crimes since Clinton became president, with 115 now
imprisoned. Later, he pointed out that the figures are much higher
on the state level.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my home state of California, since Bill Clinton became
president, there have been some 16,000 prosecutions for perjury,''
Rogan told his colleagues. ``So the suggestion that perjury would
not be brought in an appropriate case is incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state officials said Rogan's figures check out and
may even be a little low.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, in Ventura, Calif., on Friday, a man pleaded no
contest to a charge of perjury and faces up to four years in prison
on allegations he forged a veterinarian's name on wildlife
documents.
</P>
<P>
   While most perjury cases involve documents, people have been
prosecuted for such crimes as deceiving a grand jury on the witness
stand and lying about assets in a divorce case.
</P>
<P>
   The California Department of Justice reports there were 15,680
perjury prosecutions in the state between 1993 and 1997, and there
probably have been thousands more this year.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern University law professor Robert Pugsley called
perjury an underprosecuted crime that was set up as a deterrent. In
light of recent events, he expects perjury will get a lot more
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would imagine, at least in the short term, this Clinton deal
will stimulate a rash of perjury prosecutions and make people aware
of what perjury is,'' Pugsley said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said a large chunk of the California prosecutions came
from Los Angeles County, where Rogan worked for six years in the
1980s as a deputy district attorney in the hard-core gang murder
unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past five years, we have prosecuted several hundred
perjury cases,'' said Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the Los
Angeles County District Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons said most of them are perjury of document cases, in
which someone signs papers under penalty of perjury. Cases
involving witness-stand testimony are much more rare, Gibbons said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, at the U.S. Attorney's Office, perjury cases have
been few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Justice statistician Jon Scalia said the federal
government undertakes about 130 perjury prosecutions per year
nationwide. There were 139 in 1997, with the average sentence at
about 27 months, Scalia said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney's Office spokesman Thom Mrozek said he knows of
only two perjury prosecutions in the Central District, which covers
most of the Southland and is the largest district in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my knowledge, nobody prosecuted in this office is in
custody for perjury charges,'' Mrozek said.
</P>
<P>
   If the number of perjury cases seems small -- less than 10
percent of state prosecutions and less than 1 percent of federal
prosecutions -- perhaps it's because they are very hard to
prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   To get a conviction, law enforcers need to prove:
</P>
<P>
   _ The defendant knew what he was asserting was false;
</P>
<P>
   _ He intended the information to be false;
</P>
<P>
   _ And the false information was material to the case.

BEARS BEGIN ERA OF STEELE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Addressing an enthusiastic audience at a Baylor
news conference yesterday, new Bears football coach Kevin Steele
was reminded of a recent public appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure you all came here today to hear what I sound like,''
he said. ``Because after last Sunday, you all know what I look
like.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, a day before he interviewed for the Baylor job,
Steele _ an assistant with the Carolina Panthers _ became the star
of the highlight films after being attacked on the sideline by one
of his own linebackers, Kevin Greene.
</P>
<P>
   The green-and-gold crowd roared with laughter, and thus was born
the Steele era at Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very exciting,'' said linebacker Fred Rogers. ``This
program is in the basement right now, and there's nowhere to go but
up. I think we have a guy now who is a good coach and very
intelligent, and he can take us up.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying that he would begin immediately with the task of
rebuilding the Bears _ 2-9 each of the last two years under Dave
Roberts _ Steele promised the crowd that ``we will soon be
competitive in the Big Eight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, excuse me,'' he said, quickly, ``I meant Big 12. I was
thinking about when I used to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele, 40, was formerly an assistant at Oklahoma State
(1984-86), and Nebraska (1989-94), before the league expanded. This
is his first head coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can be competitive here _ I know that because of that man
right there,'' Steele said, pointing at former Baylor coach Grant
Teaff. ``He proved Baylor can win, and along with Tom Osborne at
Nebraska, he was one of those I always looked to as a mentor _ even
though he never knew I was looking. He laid the foundation here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Steele, who was linebackers coach at Carolina for the past
four years, said he still has a commitment to the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will finish out the season with them, but only on Sundays,''
he said. ``The rest of the time I will be here _ but I'll be going
back to coach in each game the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL was a great experience _ I got a doctorate in Xs and
Os _ but I really missed college coaching. When I took the job, I
told \RPanthers owner\S Jerry Richardson that my dream had always
been to be a college head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very understanding, and when this came up, he told me
to go after it and not worry about the remaining games on the
schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with a late start, Steele said he was eager to begin
recruiting, ``because Texas has the best high school players in the
country, and we plan to get our share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, recruiting is my golf game _ it's what I do for fun.
I know that sounds sick, but it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding his plans for a staff, Steele said that he would
``look first at the present staff, then after that look at anyone
who has Baylor ties. After that we will look for Texas ties \Rthe
state, not the Longhorns\S, and if there's anything left we'll look
at people noted for great offensive or defensive schemes.''
</P>
<P>
   After introducing his wife, Linda, he said, ``We also have a
12-year-old son, Gordon, who is ecstatic about being a Baylor Bear,
and a nine-year-old daughter Caroline, who is like her dad _ up for
any challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   All of that sounded pretty good to safety Curtis Henderson, who
said, ``I'm excited. Coach Osborne spoke highly of this man, did
you see that? If that's what Coach Osborne thinks, it's good enough
for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of talent here, and next year's schedule isn't
as bad as this year's was. This team can go a long way up in one
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting Steele's commitment to Christian values and education,
Baylor athletic director Tom Stanton called him ``the cornerstone
of the future,'' saying, ``He's the right man at the right time for
the right university.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is who we are at Baylor University.''

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ For the second time this week, Texas missed
out on one of the top quarterback prospects in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Manning of Newman High School in New Orleans committed to
Mississippi, his mother, Olivia Manning, said yesterday. He chose
the Rebels over Texas and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Manning, a member of the ``Star-Telegram'''s National Top 100
recruits, is the son of former NFL quarterback Archie Manning and
the brother of Peyton Manning, the starting quarterback for the
Indianapolis Colts. Archie Manning played quarterback for
Mississippi before going to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Chris Simms, the son of former NFL quarterback and
current TV analyst Phil Simms, committed to Tennessee. Simms, also
a member of the ``Star-Telegram'''s National Top 100 recruits,
chose the Volunteers over Penn State and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns have a commitment from Westlake quarterback Adam
Hall, a member of the ``Star-Telegram'''s State Top 100 recruits.
VOLS GET TOP LINEBACKER Austin McCallum linebacker Devon Davis
committed to Tennessee, his mother, Ruby Davis, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's loved Tennessee for a long time,'' Ruby Davis said. ``He
was honored that all the other schools were interested in him.
Tennessee just seemed to be the right place for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a member of the ``Star-Telegram'''s State Top 100
recruits, had been to Michigan and had official visits set up for
Texas A&AMP;M and UCLA. His mother said she does not believe Davis will
take those visits. BELL KICKER PICKS AIR FORCE L.D. Bell kicker
Adam Thornton has received his appointment to the Air Force Academy
and has committed to the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I want to fly, and Air Force has the premier
planes,'' Thornton said. ``I want to get into their astronaut
program.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton made 9 of 15 field-goal attempts this season, including
four longer than 40 yards and made all 18 of his extra-point tries.
He also averaged 38.6 yards per punt for the Blue Raiders this
season. He had considered Navy, Washington and Washington State.
SYRACUSE LANDS GARLAND LINEMAN Garland offensive lineman Tre Mathis
committed to Syracuse yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I saw when I got there was the closeness and
the unity of the players,'' Mathis said. ``I felt at home as soon
as I got there. The players really welcomed me and I fit in with
the crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis, 6-foot-3, 340 pounds and a member of the
``Star-Telegram'''s State Top 100 recruits, had also seriously
considered Arkansas, but the Razorbacks withdrew their scholarship
offer, making the decision easy for Mathis.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis picked Syracuse over Oklahoma State and Tennessee. He has
an official visit with Tennessee on Jan. 15 and said he was unsure
if he is going to take it or not. BUFFS GET HOUSTON TE Houston
Forest Brook tight end Terry Phillips has committed to Colorado. He
will still take a visit to TCU on Jan. 15, but has canceled his
official visit to Texas A&AMP;M.

SANDERS LIKELY TO MISS GAME WITH EAGLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys coach Chan Gailey all but ruled Deion
Sanders out of tomorrow's crucial matchup with the Philadelphia
Eagles after the cornerback was unable to practice for a second
consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who has been sidelined the past four-and-a-half games
with a sprained left toe, will be re-evaluated again today and
before the game, but Gailey said ``he's very doubtful at this
point.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how it goes, but that's where it stands right now,''
Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Smith will start at right cornerback in place of Sanders.
Kevin Mathis will start at left cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey acknowledged that Sanders' absence would be a setback,
considering that the Pro Bowl-bound cornerback/kick returner badly
wanted to play, and the team sorely missed his big-play ability.
The Cowboys are 0-6 the past two years when Sanders is not in the
starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there is a question as to whether Sanders will play in the
regular-season finale against the Washington Redskins on Dec. 27.
If the Cowboys beat the Eagles and clinch the NFC East title,
Sanders could be held out until the playoffs, which begin on Jan.
2. BACK RUNNING Gailey said he can't put a finger on why the
offense has had problems the past two weeks, but he has some ideas
about the running game.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey blames himself for giving up on the run too quickly and
links his thought process to his infatuation with quarterback Troy
Aikman's record-setting 455-yard passing performance against the
Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't blame running back Emmitt Smith, who has totaled 48
yards the past two weeks combined after rushing for just 44 against
the Vikings on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think there was any place for Emmitt to run,'' Gailey
said. ``And I have found myself getting away from the running game
\Rwhen they have fallen behind\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said he will make a more concerted effort to stay
committed to the run against the Eagles, as offense is best when it
is balanced. BRIEFLY Tight end David LaFleur (sprained knee) will
not play against the Eagles. ... Wide receiver Michael Irvin
(strained lower back) looked good in practice yesterday, and Gailey
doesn't expect him to have any limitations against the Eagles.

KATY FLAGS ITSELF, VACATES 5A FINAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CARLOS MENDEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ San Antonio MacArthur lost to Katy in a
Class 5A Division II semifinal last week, but at 12:06 this
afternoon at Texas Stadium, MacArthur will be on the field playing
in the state championship game. With a half-day of preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Katy withdrew from the state high school football playoffs
yesterday morning after learning Thursday night that a player who
participated in three plays in the playoffs had falsified grade
reports and forged a teacher's signature. That sent MacArthur, a
14-6 loser to Katy in the semifinals at the Alamodome last weekend,
against Midland Lee in the title game today.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no options,'' University Interscholastic League
athletic director Charles Breithaupt said. ``Katy self-reported and
took themselves out of the playoffs. They did the thing that they
had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday at MacArthur High School, school officials knew what
to do first _ post somebody at the front desk to answer the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pandemonium,'' said defensive coordinator Cade King, who
drew the assignment to answer the phones after the school learned
it was back in the playoffs. The announcement drew TV crews,
newspaper reporters, photographers, fans and parents to the school,
which hadn't gotten as far as the semifinal round in the playoffs
since 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a pretty sketchy playoff history around here, so
this is big,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   Breithaupt said there was no discussion about delaying the game
to give the teams a better chance to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfair to Midland Lee on one side, but MacArthur is not
prepared at all,'' Breithaupt said. ``It's going to be difficult to
get their folks together and get there.''
</P>
<P>
   MacArthur made plans quickly. The UIL called at noon, and by
1:30 p.m., athletic officials were meeting, parents and players
were being notified, and coaches were pulling out helmets, shoulder
pads and uniforms that had been stored on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   By 2:30, travel arrangements were complete: two Southwest
Airlines flights, leaving at 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. and reservations at
a Dallas hotel. Coaches planned for an early film-watching session
today and a walk-through at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   In Midland, Lee was changing its plans, too. The Rebels had
scheduled a leisurely bus trip, leaving Midland around 3 p.m., with
dinner along the way, then a short meeting or two upon arrival.
Those plans were scrapped when UIL officials called at 10:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were basically ready to get on the bus and go,'' Midland
schools athletic director Tim Whalen said. ``Now, a week of
teaching has disappeared. Our focus has to change. Teaching-wise,
it's going to be a level playing field. But emotion-wise, MacArthur
can go wide open now _ they have nothing to lose.''

   Breithaupt said the UIL has no lesser punishment for Katy's
violation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have debated in our meetings about what to do about a kid
that makes an insignificant contribution,'' Breithaupt said. ``But
then you have to decide what is insignificant. If a player is
ineligible, this is the minimum penalty. We have to do what the
schools have told us to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Katy Principal Robert Blankenship said the school learned late
Thursday that a player falsified grades and forged a signature on a
three-week grade report the week after Thanksgiving, violating the
state's no-pass, no-play rules. School officials declined to
identify the player, saying only that he was a 17-year old senior.

SUCCESSFUL COACH IS TALK OF THE TOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STEPHENVILLE, Texas _ If it were not for La Marque's run of
playing in six consecutive championship games, the Stephenville
Yellow Jackets and coach Art Briles would reign as the undisputed
kings of Class 4A football this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Around town these days, it's hard to believe things were ever
different. Aside from periodic winning seasons, football in
Stephenville never did much to grab the community's imagination.
Before Briles came in 1988, Stephenville last made the playoffs in
1952.
</P>
<P>
   ``My senior year in 1985 we had a perfect record _ 0-10,'' said
Stephenville native Robert ``Boots'' Elliott Jr., president of
Stephenville's local radio station, KSTV, the home of Jackets
broadcasts. ``No one really came to the games except the parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott probably has enjoyed the closest view of the coach, a
man whose success and style has mystified out-of-town fans and
coaches. Briles joins Elliott every Friday in the NationsBank lobby
for a half-hour radio talk show. Yesterday's show focused on one
topic: Stephenville's attempt to secure its third Class 4A state
championship in six years. The Yellow Jackets face three-time
defending champion La Marque today in the Division II title game at
4 p.m. at Texas Stadium. More than ]half the town, a projected
10,000 fans, will be in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, just getting Briles to talk about his team for 30 minutes
on the air can be a feat in itself, although not as difficult as in
his earlier coaching days, Elliott said. Briles relies on his
119-27-2 record at Stephenville and multiple title runs to speak
for his success. Briles prefers not to get introspective toward his
program. After victories, he is the first off the field so his
players receive the attention. He will always defer success onto
others. Briles prefers to remain behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in West Texas, Briles is somewhat of a homebody. He'd
rather be with his family than out fishing or hunting. When he's
not at practice or a game, he'll be at home, relaxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really have no hobbies,'' Briles said. ``I try not to get
too tight as to have to unwind. I enjoy being around the high
school, the coaches and the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than his family, the only thing Briles seems to consume
himself with is coaching the Yellow Jackets and concocting one of
the most dynamic offenses in the state. Opposing coaches accuse him
of using all of his free time drawing up plays in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   He despises talking about anything that can be construed
negatively, such as his coaching salary and other benefits like his
radio show, for which he receives financial compensation. He makes
no excuses for his pay, one of the top coaching salaries in the
state, in the mid-$80's, but refuses to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've developed one of the most dominant programs in the
state,'' Briles said. ``We had to make them \Rthe players\S believe
they could be winners. Once they got that, it goes to work ethic.
Once you win, people see results of hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the community there are few complaints about his salary.
Winning, apparently, is well worth the price. Plus, Briles'
off-the-field character is worth a portion of his salary, some fans
say. The husband of 20 years and father of three embodies the
community's dearest traits. His yes-ma'am, no-sir,
see-you-in-church-on-Sunday character fits this conservative, Bible
Belt town to a T.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has all the Southern mannerisms,'' Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with championships, Briles has become the Tom Landry of
Stephenville. Sellouts of 6,500 at Tarleton State's Memorial
Stadium are the norm. To get season tickets you first have to get
on a waiting list. Briles and his team have grown into almost
mythical proportion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning is just a lot better than losing,'' said Betsy
Chambers, a booster-club member who remembers watching two stepsons
play in the days before Briles. ``It just gives you so much pride.
It goes beyond football, it seeps into the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, there's something to talk about, something other than
rodeo and world champion Ty Murray to get excited about.
Stephenville football requires wearing your emotions on your
sleeve. In the semi-rural setting, free from the distractions of
the big city, high school football can help bring back those
simpler days the town covets.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is that worth? Those who haven't seen it don't know. I've
been there. I've seen what it's meant to a town,'' said W.T.
Stapler, a revered high school coach who became Briles' mentor.
</P>
<P>
   The retired Stapler hired Briles as an assistant at Sweetwater,
leading to Briles' first head coaching job at tiny Hamlin. His next
stop was Georgetown. When the Stephenville administration called on
Stapler to coach its program in 1988, Stapler chose to remain at
Andrews and sent Stephenville after Briles.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a two-way love affair ever since.
</P>
<P>
   He led Stephenville to the playoffs in 1989 and won the district
title in 1990. Stephenville hasn't missed the playoffs since. In
1993 and '94, the Yellow Jackets steamrolled to back-to-back titles
and a 32-0 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fortunate we haven't just fallen on our face,'' said
Briles, who owns a 28-3 playoff record since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows how much longer Briles will stick around.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunities at college jobs have and will continue to come his
way. He professes his love for the town and the school. His wife,
Jane, teaches third grade. Two daughters, ages 18 and 12, are
enrolled in Stephenville schools. His son, Kendal, likely will be
the starting quarterback the next two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Some speculate he will move on once Kendal graduates. Others
think he could remain for years, eventually compiling a career that
will rival legendary former Brownwood coach Gordon Wood.
</P>
<P>
   Few like to wonder what life after Briles would be like.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be tough,'' Betsy Chambers said. ``It would be
tough.''

`MYSTERY CLAUSE' LEAVES BLUE JAYS WITHOUT A CLUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Just when you thought the Roger Clemens
`It's A Wonderful Life'' Sweepstakes had become as (pick one)
wearying, unseemly, extravagant or nauseatingly greedy as the law
allows, yet-another plot twist has taken root.
</P>
<P>
   As originally reported in the ``Toronto Star'', Clemens'
arrangement with the Blue Jays allegedly contains a ``separate
addendum'' that would make the five-time Cy Young Award winner a
free agent if he's not traded by March 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything about it,'' Rangers general manager Doug
Melvin said yesterday. ``I've heard rumors that it's a handshake or
a side agreement or even that he could be a free agent. But it's
all speculation at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear all that. But we don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   What Melvin has seen is Clemens' current, binding Toronto
contract. ``And it's not in there,'' Melvin said of the mystery
clause.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Jays general manager Gord Ash said that he had no
discussions with any teams yesterday on a possible trade for
Clemens. It would not be a long stretch to conclude that the lull
is being caused, in part, by Major League Baseball officials
looking into these possible new revelations about the
Clemens-Toronto arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The importance for the Rangers would be twofold. If Clemens does
have a 90-day, must-trade clause, major-league teams could ignore
the Blue Jays' trade offers and allow The Rocket to become a
free-agent on March 1.
</P>
<P>
   But, on the other hand, that could be expensive, in that it
would wipe out the two remaining years on Clemens' existing
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that makes him attractive is that his salary
would be $8 million for the next two years,'' Melvin said. ``The
point that doesn't make him attractive is that you might end up
having to pay him $15 million each year for the next four or five
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The alleged addendum comes across as contract roulette. The Blue
Jays would be compelled to make a deal by the 90-day deadline, or
get nothing in return for Clemens. The teams that want the pitcher,
on the other hand, would have two choices:
</P>
<P>
   Surrender players in a trade to Toronto by the deadline, and
then assume Clemens' contract with its reported new, third-year,
$27-million extension. Or allow the deadline to pass, trade no
players, and otherwise hand Clemens the checkbook.
</P>
<P>
   Is any of it legal?
</P>
<P>
   We might never know. The man who orchestrated the original deal
in Toronto was then-club president Paul Beeston. He now serves as
president and chief operating officer of Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   According to Melvin, whose family recently vacationed with the
Ash family, ``Gord wasn't really aware of it, from what I
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   The 90-day addendum smacks of being unethical, at best, or
simple blackmail. But who was the victim here?
</P>
<P>
   Both the mystery clause and the one invoked by Clemens' agents
on Dec. 2, allowing him to demand a trade, obviously were designed
to give The Rocket his freedom. Without the escape clauses, Clemens
might not have stunned the baseball world and signed with Toronto
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays had to realize that retaining Clemens beyond two
years was a longshot. They received two seasons of Cy Young
Award-winning service from Roger.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens' probable intent, if not the letter, of the original
agreement was fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't stopped the Blue Jays from trying to squeeze
compensation for what, in essence, was a flawed deal, a deal they
willingly made.
</P>
<P>
   Once a team agrees to a must-trade clause, it deserves to
forfeit all leverage. And without leverage, how can Toronto expect
a Rick Helling, an Andy Pettitte or a Derek Bell?
</P>
<P>
   Ash expects a pitcher in return for any deal involving Clemens.
My suggestion would be that, instead, he goes to the VCR and looks
at those two years of Roger Clemens highlights. They'll never ride
a cheaper Rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Bud Selig. If the commissioner upholds the mystery
addendum, he probably adds another expensive chapter to baseball's
current spending frenzy. Clemens is going to want five years, $75
million and all the hotel suites that Kevin Brown doesn't already
have booked.
</P>
<P>
   But if Selig tosses out the 90-day addendum, he's legitimized
what was, from the start, a flawed baseball deal.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto got its two Cy Young years. Anything it's allowed to
squeeze out of teams beyond that should be considered an undeserved
bonus.

ARCHITECT OF CSUN SOCCER PROGRAM LEAVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Marwan Ass'ad will not be the next women's soccer
coach at Cal State Northridge, despite the heavy politicking in the
last week. But the bigger surprise is he won't remain as coach of
the men's program, either.
</P>
<P>
   After 16 seasons in which Ass'ad won a school-record 192 games,
he announced his resignation Friday, effective Dec. 31. He will
become the coaching director of the West Valley Soccer League, an
organization that has more than 1,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't pass up this great job,'' Ass'ad, 44, said. ``It's
too good. I'm going to coach the parents (who are coaching) and be
very active in the club section. And I'm going to coach a youth
team.''
</P>
<P>
   It leaves CSUN without a soccer head coach for either program.
Women's coach Brian Wiesner resigned last Friday, which is also
effective Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know (Ass'ad) got a very good opportunity,'' CSUN assistant
athletic director Brian Swanson said. ``Just like for the women's
position, we'll conduct a national search.''
</P>
<P>
   Ass'ad said salary was a factor in his decision. At $18,000 per
year, Ass'ad regularly commented he was the lowest-paid head coach
at CSUN _ though it should be noted he took a pay cut to save the
men's soccer program two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A sore point with Ass'ad was the $37,956 that Wiesner was paid
annually, though Wiesner's contract also called for him to teach
several classes in the kinesiology department.
</P>
<P>
   While Ass'ad wouldn't say how much he was being paid by the West
Valley Soccer League, he said ``Financially speaking, it's very
rewarding to me. It's so much better for me and my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Ass'ad said one of the reasons he decided to leave CSUN was the
relationship he cultivated with former U.S. National Team coach
Steve Sampson, who now heads California's amateur soccer programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My future at Northridge is as its soccer coach, and he said I
could have more of an impact coaching with (West Valley) than in
college,'' Ass'ad said. ``I don't want to sound cocky, but I'm an
awesome coach. People have so much respect for what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ass'ad, who had a 192-102-26 record with the Matadors, saw CSUN
flourish at the Division II level. The Matadors reached the NCAA
tournament six straight seasons and were national runners-up in
1987 and 1988. He also led CSUN into Division I and was named the
MPSF Pacific Division Coach of the Year in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps his most notable accomplishment came without reward.
Two years after the program was dropped, Ass'ad rebuilt the
Matadors and went 12-5 this fall. However, since CSUN wasn't
affiliated with a conference, it was left out of the NCAA
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will miss the staff, but most importantly, I will miss Grace
(Collins, an associate athletic director),'' said Ass'ad, who had
three losing seasons with the Matadors. ``She was so supportive of
our program. But I do want to thank the fans and my booster club
and former players.''

SENATE EXPECTED TO RISE ABOVE FRAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It turned out to be one of the most intensely
partisan debates in memory, split almost precisely down party
lines.
</P>
<P>
   And if it continues to unfold that way, impeachment is not more
likely, but less, and for an important historical reason: The
founding fathers intentionally made the Senate a brake on one-sided
efforts to remove a president from office.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's impeachment authority over the House avoids
``making the same persons both accusers and judges, and guards
against the danger of persecution from the prevalence of a factious
spirit,'' wrote Alexander Hamilton in 1787.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, even when the House is full of fury, the Senate
is expected to rise above the fray and adopt a broad view.
</P>
<P>
   While the House requires a simple majority vote to pass
impeachment, the Senate mandates a two-thirds vote. The founding
fathers believed the Senate could afford to be somewhat detached
from their constituents' passions because they face the voters
every six years, compared with every two years in the House.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the House impeachment debate was at times raw and
emotional, just as the drafters of the Constitution might have
predicted. With the House poised to endorse impeachment articles
against President Clinton, the president's supporters may have
taken a small degree of comfort in Hamilton's words.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate trial would likely begin in January on any impeachment
article approved by the House. On most legislation _ not just
impeachment _ the Senate tends to move more deliberately than the
House, in part because its rules give members more stratagems for
bottling up bills they don't like than are available to their
counterparts in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Already, 1996 GOP presidential candidate Bob Dole is urging his
former colleagues to forgo a trial and agree instead to a harsh
condemnation of the president. It's far from certain that the
Republican-controlled Senate will go along with the plan, which
would require Clinton's signature.
</P>
<P>
   Months ago, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., pledged to keep the process as free from partisan strife as
possible. He said the founding fathers intended it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's efforts notwithstanding, Friday's debate was full of
bitterness and angry words from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said the impeachment effort was
characterized by ``unbridled hatred and meanness.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans countered that they were following the ``rule of
law.''
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere likely will be cooler in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the senators feel any less strongly about the
issue than their House colleagues. Rather, the Senate knows that
the Constitution confers upon it the burden of being the last fire
wall separating a chief executive from impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were expected to be a more mature, deliberative body,''
said constitutional scholar Alan Hirsch. &QL;

GOP'S JOHN RHODES FAVORS CENSURE, BUT NOT IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former House Minority Leader John Rhodes of Arizona, who played
a key role in persuading Richard Nixon to resign the presidency,
says President Clinton should be censured, not impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have impeached him,'' Rhodes, 82, said Friday. ``I
was one of the first that I know of who talked about censure.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes, who lives in the East Valley, said he has expressed
those sentiments in letters to House Judiciary Committee Chairman
Henry Hyde, Rep. Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing in the Constitution that says you have to
impeach him,'' Rhodes, an elder statesman of the Arizona Republican
Party, said. ``There are a lot of ways the House could have brought
this up.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes also denied that an incident about him recounted on the
House floor during Friday morning's debate ever took place.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., in responding to
demands by Democrats that they be allowed to vote for censure
rather than impeachment, said that in 1974, John Rhodes, then House
minority leader for the Republicans, approached Speaker Tip O'Neill
and asked that Republicans be permitted a censure vote as an
alternative to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill turned down the request, Solomon said, adding that
today's Democrats ought to heed the word of their late leader.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, Rhodes told ``The Republic'' that the incident
never happened.
</P>
<P>
   In the Nixon-Watergate era it was Rhodes, along with the late
Sen. Barry Goldwater, who met with Nixon two days before he became
the only U.S. president to resign from office, on Aug. 9, 1974.
They told Nixon that impeachment was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was a dramatic moment in history that Rhodes
recalled in ``The Arizona Republic'' recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry and I had campaigned and worked with Richard Nixon for
years. The whole Watergate thing practically broke our hearts, yet
we had to tell this man whom we had trusted that his presidency
would be ended. It was indeed a very bad day for us,'' Rhodes
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He said in an interview Friday that Clinton should be punished.
Congress, he said, ``couldn't let the people of the country think
morals were no longer important.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Rhodes said he's not sure that independent counsel Kenneth
Starr's case ``should go all the way to the point of impeachment,
and removal from office.''
</P>
<P>
   A key difference in Clinton's case, Rhodes said, is that Nixon's
resignation opened the door for Gerald Ford to become president.
``There was a wide amount of trust and respect for Gerald Ford,''
Rhodes said.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, he added, ``ain't no Gerald Ford.'' &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ On the third day of the air assault on Iraq, the
Pentagon said Friday that it was able to confirm that only 18 of
its 89 targets had been severely damaged or destroyed, despite
waves of bombers and more laser-guided cruise missiles than were
hurled at Iraq during the gulf war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam Hussein, the president of Iraq, showed defiance toward
the United States in his first televised address since the attacks
began, calling his attackers ``the agents of Satan.'' U.S. military
planes rained thousands of leaflets on Iraq warning ground troops
that if they mobilized they would face bombing raids from the
forces assembled on aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf and at
bases scattered around the region.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was scheduled to meet Saturday with his
national security advisers to talk about how long the air campaign
would continue, but the Pentagon suggested the bombing would go on
into the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, at about 4 a.m. Saturday (8 p.m. Friday Eastern time),
another air raid was reported under way in Baghdad, according to
news services dispatches from the Iraqi capital.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing Friday afternoon, the military released the first
detailed assessment of the damage inflicted on Iraq in the largest
military strike ever ordered by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   While refusing to say exactly how many laser-guided cruise
missiles and conventional bombs were hurled against Iraq this week,
Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
more cruise missiles were launched in the first two days of the air
campaign than the 290 or so missiles that were showered on Iraq in
1991. Each of the flying, computer-guided bombs costs about $1
million. Cruise missiles were not the main weapon of the 1991 air
war against Iraq, which relied much more heavily on bombs dropped
from B-52 airplanes. But Pentagon planners are anxious to keep the
risk of casualties to an absolute minimum in this operation, and
cruise missiles do not require human pilots or crews. Cruise
missiles also present a lower risk of civilian casualties in Iraq,
since they are far more accurate than bombs dropped from overhead,
even laser-guided bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton, seeming anxious not to offer the sort of inflated
damage assessments that embarrassed the Pentagon during the gulf
war, acknowledged that the results of the U.S. and British air
campaign had been mixed so far.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports from the first two nights of air strikes on Iraq
showed that the Pentagon was able to confirm that only 18 of the 89
targets had been severely damaged or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The targets included military command centers, missile
factories, television and radio transmitters and an oil refinery in
the southern Iraq city of Basra, which the United States said was
being used for oil exports in violation of United Nations economic
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   According to the initial assessment, the Pentagon was able to
confirm that of its 89 targets, 8 had been destroyed completely,
including an Iraqi air defense site; 10 were severely damaged,
including the Iraqi military intelligence headquarters; 18 were
moderately damaged; 8 were lightly damaged, and 12 had not been
damaged at all.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department said it had no assessments yet for damage
to the other 33 targets, including the Basra refinery and several
facilities believed to have been used for the production of
chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had some very good success with our strikes, but not
all of them have gone exactly as planned,'' Shelton said at a news
conference in the Pentagon, where he released videotape of
laser-guided bombs slamming into a variety of targets.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Clinton administration officials continued to insist that
the goal of its military campaign was not to to destabilize the
Iraqi government or encourage a coup against Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon confirmed reports by the Iraqi government that
U.S. warplanes had dropped tens of thousands of leaflets on Iraqi
troops in the southern part of the country, informing them that
``only those units that support the Baghdad regime'' are being
targeted for attack by U.S. missiles and bombers.
</P>
<P>
   The leaflets, which were printed in Arabic, bore photographs of
the charred hulks of Iraqi tanks destroyed during the 1991 gulf
war. ``Your unit has not been targeted but it is being watched,''
the leaflets said, warning the soldiers not to mobilize.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Radio Free Iraq, the seven-week-old
U.S.-sponsored radio network beamed into Iraq and described by the
Iraqi government as an anti-Saddam propaganda machine, said that it
had expanded its programming to Iraq to four hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the Arabic-language radio network insisted that
the programs were straightforward news broadcasts but acknowledged
that they also reported on the activities of Iraqi opposition
groups.
</P>
<P>
   In releasing its bombing reports Friday, the United States said
that it had targeted television and radio transmission towers in
hopes of cutting off communication from the central government in
Baghdad to Iraqi troops and the public, and it was unclear how many
Iraqis may have seen Saddam's defiant television address.
</P>
<P>
   In the speech, the Iraqi leader, dressed in a military uniform
and seated beside an Iraqi flag, with an enormous bouquet of red
flowers on the table in front of him, offered fierce words that
contrasted sharply what U.S. military officials have described as
the feeble response of his military to the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``By God, we will not compromise,'' he thundered in the taped
address, which was broadcast shortly before air-raid sirens sounded
in Baghdad to mark the start of the third night of air strikes.
``We stand against the barbaric way of those that have used our
airspace to launch an aggression against our people. A curse on the
agents of Satan.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked Iraqis to ``continue resistance and attack in the name
of God and may the criminals lose.'' He added, ``We will fear
nothing but God and we will not kneel except to the face of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Military commanders at the Pentagon said Friday night they were
closely studying new bombing reports from the third day of air
strikes to determine when they they could halt the air campaign,
which they hope to do this weekend given the imminent start of
Ramadan, the month of religious reflection that begins Saturday and
is the holiest time in the Islamic calendar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sensitive to the issue of Ramadan and will take that
into account,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen said in an
interview Friday night on CNN. ``But there is no fixed end time. We
have to keep some flexibility''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the air strikes would continue until the United
States and Britain determined that the bombing had accomplished
done significant damage to Iraq's ability to make chemical and
biological weapons. ``Once those missions are completed, the
mission will end,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another senior administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the United States might halt the air strikes this
weekend but make clear that bombing would resume after Ramadan
unless Iraq allows United Nations weapons inspectors to resume
their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not over by a long shot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and other diplomats sought Friday to heal a rift in relations with
Russia, which has harshly criticized the air strikes on Iraq and
withdrew its ambassador to Washington in protest.
</P>
<P>
   And violent anti-American protests were reported in several Arab
capitals, with many demonstrators claiming that Clinton had
launched the attacks to divert attention from the impeachment
debate in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen insisted at a news conference that the political crisis
here was having no effect on the ability of U.S. forces to carry
out the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to speculate at this point that those people
involved in this operation are focused on one thing, and that's
carrying out the mission,'' he said. ``Whatever else is going on at
this particular moment is probably of little concern to them until
they carry out their mission.''

NIKE WITHHOLDING PAYMENTS TO LOCKED-OUT PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also BKN-NBA-PLAYERS) 
(mk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   National Basketball Association players who were expecting Nike
to supplement their income during the lockout may have to start
searching their couch cushions and car ashtrays for loose change.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the more than 100 players with deals to wear the swoosh
have discovered language in their contracts that gives Nike the
right to withhold payment because of a work stoppage. With the
exception of a few signature clients _ like Michael Jordan and
Anfernee Hardaway _ agents say that most players under contract did
not find a quarterly check in the mail on Tuesday. No games, no
visibility, no pay.
</P>
<P>
   While other shoe companies, like Reebok and Adidas, are paying
their endorsers during the nearly six-month-old lockout, no other
company has the number of clients Nike has. Combined, Reebok and
Adidas account for fewer than 20 players, a number that reflects a
troubled industry that has been forced to downsize its marketing
budgets in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Although sports marketing firms have watched various national
advertisers pull deals off the table because of a hostile lockout
that has left product visibility impossible and players' images
stained, Nike's actions constitute a noticeable hit. While a
handful of charismatic stars have soft drink and fast-food deals, a
quarter of the league's 400-plus players have Nike contracts that
industry analysts say pay middle-range players approximately
$100,000 a year and an all-star anywhere from $250,000 to $1
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nike's explanation for this is that they want to see how this
whole thing plays out,'' said Eric Fleischer, an agent who
represents several top players, including Kevin Garnett. ``I'm
obviously very disturbed by it. I find it amazing that a company
that was started by athletes for athletes has taken a position
which, for all practical purposes, is choosing sides. If they are
prorating their sponsorship agreements with the league, it would be
different. But I haven't been told that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike officials maintain that their contracts with players, teams
and the league are confidential, but they said the company is
reassessing the value of its investments in the NBA across the
board.
</P>
<P>
   ``For anyone to assume that we are taking sides based on our
actions, or that we are doing one thing to one party and not
another, is inaccurate,'' said Vizhier Mooney, a Nike
representative. ``We stand firm in choosing to not take a side.
This issue is between the players and the league. We owe it to our
employees to be fiscally responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Nike, the world's top athletic shoe and apparel
seller, announced that second-quarter earnings were off 51 percent.
The soles of the shoemaker, once filled with air, have gone flat,
and chairman Phil Knight placed part of the blame for the company's
recent earnings decline on the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the right way to look at it, if we were a fashion
house, they've taken away one of our critical runways,'' Knight
told reporters on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of television spots that poke fun at the
lockout _ like the Sprite ads with Grant Hill and Tim Duncan _ the
lockout has also eliminated the showroom floor for companies beyond
the shoe industry. Many advertisers are treating the lockout as a
burning house, standing a safe distance away while waiting to see
what is left amid the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the season is canceled or the lockout ends, advertisers
who once gladly invested in the stars who pushed the NBA atop the
pop charts will keep an eye on fan reaction in an effort to gauge
the feel-good meter concerning the sport. Throughout the lockout,
players have done little to endear themselves to fans by making
comments that are perceived to be greedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have done themselves tremendous harm here,'' said
Bob Williams, president of Burns Sports, a company that matches
athletes with advertisers. ``Leverage could have been generated
with the players keeping their mouths shut, which would have
created an image of being locked out. That has gotten lost in the
process. The players want to play. That message comes out once in a
while but it gets squashed by, `Well, poor me, I'm going to have to
sell one of my eight cars.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some players are more savvy than others. A select few have
remained noticeably silent during the lockout. Although his
commercials are broadcast, Hill has stepped into the background and
declined interview requests concerning lockout issues. While he has
drawn some criticism for not being a vocal member of the union, he
has also kept his wholesome image intact by not joining the ugly
word fray.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Bonham, of the Bonham group, a sports marketing firm in
Denver, said: ``The players that are taking the position that I'm
going to sit by and let the union represent me and work it out, and
I'm not going to make a public case about why I'm economically
disadvantaged, that's smart. The players that are keeping a low
profile are the ones conscientious of the importance of maintaining
a positive image with the fans. Those who are complaining about
things and bringing up the race issue and how they are being
treated, they are not making friends with the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps players feel that the public fight for a deal at the
bargaining table is more important than the falloff in advertising
dollars. After all, only the telegenic elite, such as Jordan, Hill,
Dennis Rodman and Scottie Pippen, can match their on-court earnings
with their off-court endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if endorsement opportunities decline further as a result
of the lockout, there will be less visibility for the players and
less saturation for a league that found its niche based on the
celebrity of its players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NBA is much more of a celebrity-driven league than the NFL
or baseball or the NHL,'' Bonham said. ``The word celebrity is used
because the NBA is as much entertainment as it is sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the league will have to use other strategies to keep
their visibility up if, in fact, this trend continues to go down
the path it's traveling now,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   This path was unthinkable six or seven years ago, when shoe
companies drove the market. At the time, Nike was hip and cool and
omnipresent in every school. Nike Airs were selling, and the
competition was at Knight's mercy. At the time, rivalries were
created that had nothing to do with the game as shoe companies
raced to sign rookies to seven-figure shoe deals.
</P>
<P>
   As the industry has struggled, so have the players. Off-court
issues have companies severing their shoe deals with players.
Still, plenty have found that a shoe deal makes a nice supplement
to their incomes, a source some Nike endorsers have discovered is
not going to soothe any pinch caused by the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone takes a hit in this situation,'' said the agent Mark
Bartlestein. ``This is just another issue the players have to deal
with.''

BELCHER JOINS ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; ANAHEIM, Calif. _ He's not exactly Randy Johnson or Kevin
Brown, but Tim Belcher will have to do for the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels announced Friday they have signed Belcher, 37, to a
two-year, $10.2 million contract with a club option for a third
year. Belcher will make $4.6 million a season in 1999 and 2000. The
option year is worth $5.1 million with a $1 million buyout.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher was the Kansas City Royals' win leader in each of the
past three seasons, including a 14-14 record with a 4.27 ERA in
1998 while being tied for second in the American League with 34
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Angels general manager Bill Bavasi said the signing was
important not only because the Angels got much-needed pitching help
but because the club was able to acquire a starting pitcher without
having to give up a player in return _ namely, Jim Edmonds or
Garret Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we went to the winter meetings, we really got a bad
feeling for how other people were looking at our club,'' Bavasi
said. ``They were thinking, `They got Mo (Vaughn), they have to
trade one of their outfielders for some pitching.' Well, we don't
have to. We were dealing with clubs that were thinking it was
possible to steal our gold in exchange for brass.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts us in a better position. It helps us relax because
we don't have to make a deal. But if we can make a good deal, we
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher, who is a native of Ohio and still lives there, said
going to a team with a chance to win was his top priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I was looking at it was that this could possibly be my
last contract,'' Belcher said. ``I came in a winner in '88 with the
Dodgers, my first full year. I'd like nothing more than over the
next two or three years to go out a winner with the Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher has a career record of 136-127 in 12 major-league
seasons playing for six teams _ the Dodgers, Reds, White Sox,
Tigers, Mariners and Royals. Three times he has won 15 games in a
season and he has averaged more than 200 innings per season for his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the most durable guy out there,'' Bavasi said. ``And
maybe sometimes we look too much at the durability and overlook the
fact that he's a good pitcher. It was a chance to get a quality guy
with a quality arm. He's a good fit for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher said he's not the same pitcher he was 10 years ago. But
then again, nobody is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you hang around in this game, you have to adjust,''
Belcher said. ``You'll have your freaks, like Nolan Ryan, who stick
around until they're 62, so you have to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm still a power pitcher. I won't blow the ball by people
like I did seven or eight years ago, but I still throw primarily
fastballs. I'm not looking for a strikeout like a young guy, I'm
looking to make a guy make weak contact as early in the count as I
can get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher joins a starting rotation that will include Chuck Finley
and Ken Hill. Those who will compete for the final two spots in the
rotation are Omar Olivares, Steve Sparks, Jarrod Washburn, Jason
Dickson and Mark Petkovsek.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: The Angels will not tender contract offers to
infielder Paco Martin or pitcher Allen Watson. . . . To complete
the trade for pitcher Petkovsek, the Angels sent minor-league
catcher Matt Garrick to the St. Louis Cardinals.

WAITING FOR CHANCE AT IBF HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (lb) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ David Tua and Hasim Rahman are in the no man's land of
boxing's heavyweight division. They are young, they hit hard and no
one who has a world title or who has designs on winning a world
championship wants to fight them.
</P>
<P>
   Stuck in this predicament, the only way out is to fight each
other. That's what they will do when they square off in a 12-round
International Boxing Federation elimination bout here on Saturday
night. The bout is on the undercard of a 12-round title match
between Floyd Mayweather Jr., the World Boxing Council
super-featherweight champion, and Angel Manfredy, and it will be
broadcast on HBO's ``World Championship Boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tua and Rahman are in a group of heavyweights that could be
referred to as the young and the fightless. That group includes
Michael Grant, who many believe is the next heavyweight superstar,
Chris Byrd, Ike Ibeabuchi and Larry Donald.
</P>
<P>
   They have not had a fight against Evander Holyfield, Mike Tyson
or George Foreman, and they usually do not fight each other.
Ibeabuchi did score a controversial decision over Tua last year.
Shannon Briggs and Lou Savarese are supposed to fight on Feb. 27,
so things are getting better in the division.
</P>
<P>
   ``The division is better than most people are giving it credit
for,'' said Lou DiBella, HBO/TVKO's senior vice president for
programming. ``If you want to have a legitimate top 10, there are
enough good young heavyweights out there to do it. It's a pretty
healthy division. This is probably the best talent pool in the
heavyweight division in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tua-Rahman bout is one of the most compelling heavyweight
fights of the year, because it pits two boxers in their prime and
the winner will be the IBF's No. 1 contender, becoming the
mandatory opponent for whoever wins the March 13 heavyweight
unification bout between Holyfield and Lennox Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Botha, who was the IBF's No. 1 contender, took himself
out of the loop by agreeing to fight Mike Tyson on Jan. 16. Rahman
(29-0) is the IBF's No. 3 contender and Tua (32-1) is not ranked in
the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``When is the last time two guys have fought to be the mandatory
for the heavyweight championship?'' said Tua's promoter, Dino Duva
of Main Events. ``It hasn't happened in a while. But this new rule
that Bob Lee and the IBF have instituted that you have to fight to
be the No. 1 contender is one of the best things that has happened
to this sport. The winner will be No. 1 and will fight for the
title. That is how Fernando Vargas earned his right to be No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Vargas defeated Yory Boy Campas last Saturday for the IBF
junior-middleweight title.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the Tua-Rahman bout will have to wait before
receiving a crack at the world championship, because Henry
Akinwande, the World Boxing Association's No. 1 contender, has the
first shot, if he is free of hepatitis B.
</P>
<P>
   Tua and Rahman were scheduled to fight on Sept. 26 on the
undercard of Lewis' title defense against Zeljko Mavrovic. Rahman
pulled out of the fight, because he had signed an agreement with
the promoter Don King, and King had advised him against fighting
Tua.
</P>
<P>
   Rahman also was under contract with the promoter Cedric Kushner
when he entered the agreement with King. Kushner has filed a $12
million lawsuit against King for violating his contract with
Rahman, and Rahman has returned to Kushner.
</P>
<P>
   Tua fought on the undercard of that Lewis-Mavrovic card,
stopping Eric Curry on a first-round technical knockout. The last
time Tua fought in the Miami area, he scored a knockout 19 seconds
into the first round against Darroll Wilson in Miami Beach. That
solidified him as one of the hardest-hitting young heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if he wants to take that next step, he will have to take
out Rahman.

KOZLOV COULD FACE FUTURE PENALTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Colin Campbell, the NHL director of operations and
chief disciplinarian, was on hand last night when Red Wings winger
Slava Kozlov laid out Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk with an elbow to
the chin at the 18:12 mark of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Kozlov received a five-minute major penalty, meaning an
automatic review by Campbell, who is in charge of suspending
players for those types of infractions.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, who took over for Brian Burke, already has handed out
18 suspensions in his first season on the job _ a product of the
league's desire to crack down on hits that lead to head injuries.
</P>
<P>
   While Campbell wouldn't comment on whether there would be a
suspension, he did say the hit was ``stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a stupid elbow that was thrown at a time of the game
when it shouldn't have been thrown,'' Campbell said. ``The game was
out of reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk, who had just turned up ice in his own zone and had
passed the puck, was hit squarely across the jaw by Kozlov, who
doesn't have a history of cheap shots. Nieuwendyk was helped off
the ice, but was fine in the locker room after the game. CHAMBERS

</P>
<P>
   Stars defenseman Shawn Chambers last night returned from injured
reserve after missing seven games with a broken index finger on his
right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers wore a hard cast on his right hand and played a regular
shift with defensive partner Craig Ludwig.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little sore when I have to check and the cast is
awkward if the puck is at my feet and I'm trying to use my stick,''
Chambers said. ``But I'll live with it.'' BIG D
</P>
<P>
   Red Wings defenseman Larry Murphy and Stars defenseman Darryl
Sydor rank first and second, respectively, in the NHL in defensemen
scoring. Sydor assisted on Jere Lehtinen's second-period power-play
goal and has 23 points (eight goals, 15 assists). Murphy assisted
on Kozlov's third-period goal and has 24 points (4, 20).
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Stars and Red Wings have the top two teams in the
NHL in defenseman scoring. The Stars have 65 points among their
defensemen, while the Red Wings have 64.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making a conscious effort to get our D-man more
offensively involved this season,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
``They've got the green light.'' NEXT CLAUDE?
</P>
<P>
   Stars winger Dam Keczmer, who bloodied the face of Red Wings
captain Steve Yzerman the last time the two teams played in
Detroit, has been dubbed the new Claude Lemieux by Red Wings fans.
Lemieux is the Colorado Avalanche winger who started a bloody
rivalry between the Red Wings when his check in 1996 broke the jaw
of Red Wings forward Kris Draper.

   ``My friends are giving me a hard time,'' said Keczmer, who grew
up in Mount Clemens, Mich. ``C'mon, though, Claude Lemieux. That
guy has a history. I'm not like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yzerman said he felt the hit was clean. Keczmer was mostly left
alone last night. THREE STARS
</P>
<P>
   1. Jere Lehtinen, Stars _ Hard-working defense from the league's
top defensive forward and the back-breaking goal.
</P>
<P>
   2. Ed Belfour, Stars _ Despite losing the shutout, he was steely
calm when game was 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   3. Mike Keane, Stars _ Set up first goal and was a burr in the
saddle of Red Wings all night. X-FACTOR
</P>
<P>
   Stars defensemen Derian Hatcher and Richard Matvichuk were
dominating in front of the net. The Red Wings were impressive in
the neutral zone and on the perimeter, but they struggled to get to
rebounds. Hatcher and Matvichuk wouldn't let them.

   Howard Wolfe Chalk, an advertising executive, died on Dec. 12 at
Phelps Memorial Hospital Center in Tarrytown, N.Y. Chalk, a
resident of Cortlandt Manor, N.Y., was 76.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was lung cancer, his daughter, Robin Chalk
Levy, said.
</P>
<P>
   Chalk's clients were mostly fashion accounts, and included
Spring Mills, After Six, Pierre Cardin and British Knights. He
started several advertising agencies, beginning with Chalk, Nissen,
Hanft in 1968. He left that company when it was acquired in 1986,
and started Chalk &AMP; Partners. In 1995, he closed Chalk &AMP; Partners
and started Aerie Marketing.

<P>
   Chalk attended New York University, and served in the Army in
World War II. After the war, he joined Sterling Advertising. In
1955, he was hired by Altman Stoller as an account executive and
eventually became a partner. He left what was then called Altman,
Stoller, Chalk to start Chalk, Nissen, Hanft.

 STRUGGLING LONG ISLAND UNIVERSITY SEEKS NEW IDENTITY
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By RON DICKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are struggling to learn a new offense. They shoot free
throws as if the ball was a boulder. And the electricity that had
surrounded them the past two seasons has fizzled. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Long Island University Blackbirds (1-6, 1-3 Northeast
Conference) are not in the ideal position to play a difficult
stretch on the road against Florida on Sunday, South Florida on
Tuesday and Georgia on Dec. 28. But Ray Martin, the first-year
coach, is keeping his team's plight in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody died,'' he said earlier this week. ``We're going into
these three games as a challenge for us to get better. Now, getting
better may not necessarily mean we're going to win all three
games.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before returning to his native New York from an assistant's post
at Miami of Ohio, Martin knew that the Blackbirds had lost the
nation's leading scorer, Charles Jones, and his sidekick, forward
Mike Campbell. He knew that his predecessor, Ray Haskins, had left
him with just one new player, the Monroe Community College transfer
Virgil Smiley (9.9 points, 5.1 rebounds), because Haskins' other
recruits failed to qualify academically. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Martin, a proponent of the halfcourt game, also knew that most
of what the Blackbirds did under Haskins was run and gun. And they
ran successfully, compiling a record of 42-20 the previous two
years while reaching the National Collegiate Athletic Association
Tournament in 1997 and National Invitation Tournament last season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because of their high-flying, high-scoring act, the Blackbirds
developed a mystique. They packed the Schwartz Center and attracted
the curious on the road. Haskins' success was a return to coach
Claire Bee's teams in the 1940s, before a point-shaving scandal
killed the program from 1951 to 1957.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now the team is losing and attendance is dipping. Martin did not
anticipate how slowly the Blackbirds would adapt to a disciplined
offense. He wants them to focus on working the ball inside, then
resorting to the perimeter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us are not accustomed to playing that style, but
we're learning,'' guard Issiah Francis said. ``When we run the
plays through, they work.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However, the Blackbirds, who are averaging 19 turnovers a game,
sometimes do not get through the plays. Martin believes the
mistakes stem from carelessness, and from front-line players not
being used to handling the ball. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been times when you look out there and you say, `Does
anybody know how to play this game?''' Martin said. ``But there's
been times when it looks beautiful, too, and the guys are moving
the ball and getting good-percentage shots.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Blackbirds beat a Northeast Conference team, Robert Morris,
by 71-59 on Dec. 7 to give Martin his first victory, but they have
lost two since.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Martin has players pointing toward the end of the season,
especially the conference tournament, to give them time to adjust
to his controlled tempo. In the frenetic pace of the Jones/Haskins
era, players rarely worried about contesting shots and denying
offensive rebounds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing regular basketball, but that's what they would
have to do with the talent they have,'' said Wagner coach Tim
Capstraw, whose Seahawks defeated LIU by 82-72 on Dec. 5. ``They
can do well in the Northeast Conference.'' &QL;

JURY REJECTS DEATH PENALTY FOR MURDERER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SELWYN RAAB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After deliberating for three days, a Queens jury on
Friday spared the life of a 26-year-old man who was convicted of
murdering three women and trying to kill two others.
</P>
<P>
   Upon hearing the decision, the defendant, James Allen Gordon,
shook the hands of his lawyers and thanked them for persuading the
jury that there were sufficient mitigating factors in his
background to permit a sentence of life imprisonment without parole
instead of death by lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was overcome by relief,'' said Christopher Renfroe, one of
Gordon's three lawyers. ``Few people experience a moment when
people are announcing whether you live or die.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon had represented himself, with his lawyers acting as
advisers, during the first portion of the trial, at which he was
convicted. He was the first person in the state to defend himself
in a capital case since the death penalty was reinstated in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Dock Johnson and his wife, Eurilee, the parents of one
of the murder victims, left the courtroom with differing views. ``I
am opposed to the death penalty and I am satisfied and happy with
the verdict,'' said Johnson, assistant pastor of the Community
Baptist Church in South Ozone Park, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Johnson, whose eyes were damp with tears, said the
decision had dishonored the memories of her daughter, Darlene
Johnson, 28, and her daughter-in-law, Mary Mouzon, 33.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who lived across the street from Darlene Johnson in
Jamaica, Queens, was convicted in state Supreme Court in Queens on
Dec. 3 of invading Ms. Johnson's house in July 1996 and raping,
sodomizing and fatally shooting her, and stabbing and shooting to
death Mrs. Mouzon. He was also found guilty of killing Hadiyah
Holliman, 18, who was in the house, and of attempting to murder her
sister, Zakkiyah, and another person, Latisha Crite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darlene and Mary pleaded for their lives while he tortured
them,'' Mrs. Johnson said. ``If someone is found guilty of
committing such gruesome crimes and still escapes the death
penalty, then what sense does it make to have capital punishment?''
</P>
<P>
   In the punishment phase of the trial, Gordon's lawyers provided
a portrait of him as an abused, unwanted child. They said he was
born to a 14-year-old mother who was addicted to alcohol and drugs.
The jury was told that he grew up watching his mother inject heroin
and that he was beaten frequently by her.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives testified that Gordon's mother left him dirty, unkempt
and unfed and that he was forced to beg for scraps of food from
neighbors and strangers. The lawyers said that at the age of 7, he
tried to help his mother and two younger siblings by loading bags
at a supermarket and using the tips to buy groceries for the
family.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, in cross-examining Gordon's witnesses, noted that
his siblings, despite growing up in the same environment, turned
out differently, and are leading responsible lives.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Brown, the Queens district attorney, whose office
prosecuted Gordon, said the unanimous decision by the jury of eight
women and four men not to impose the death penalty was ``made after
much deliberation and soul searching.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept the jury's decision,'' he added.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Unlike many states in which murder victims' relatives are
allowed to testify about their own suffering, New York prohibits
the presentation of sentiments by families affected by the crime.
In calling for the death penalty, New York prosecutors may only
cite ``aggravating factors'' and remind jurors of the circumstances
of the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Renfroe, the defense lawyer, said that he and two other lawyers,
Russell Morea and and Susan Johnson, met briefly with Gordon before
he was returned to jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Susan gave him a kiss on the cheek and we promised him we
would visit him in prison,'' said Renfroe. ``We all know that 20
years from now we can look back and say we were successful in
saving a life.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. and Mrs. Johnson said that after the decision they laid
flowers at the grave of their daughter at a cemetery in Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went with tears flowing from my eyes to tell my daughter how
disappointed I am by the decision,'' Mrs. Johnson said. ``He had no
mercy for my daughter and my daughter-in-law and I can never
forgive him.''

SENATE EXPECTED TO RISE ABOVE FRAY 
</HEADLINE>
 BC- CLINTON-SENATE-AZR  (Resending to correct second graph on the president's removal from
office.) 
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It turned out to be one of the most intensely
partisan debates in memory, split almost precisely down party
lines.
</P>
<P>
   And if it continues to unfold that way, the president's removal
from office is not more likely, but less, and for an important
historical reason: The founding fathers intentionally made the
Senate a brake on one-sided efforts to remove a president from
office.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's impeachment authority over the House avoids
``making the same persons both accusers and judges, and guards
against the danger of persecution from the prevalence of a factious
spirit,'' wrote Alexander Hamilton in 1787.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, even when the House is full of fury, the Senate
is expected to rise above the fray and adopt a broad view.
</P>
<P>
   While the House requires a simple majority vote to pass
impeachment, the Senate mandates a two-thirds vote. The founding
fathers believed the Senate could afford to be somewhat detached
from their constituents' passions because they face the voters
every six years, compared with every two years in the House.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the House impeachment debate was at times raw and
emotional, just as the drafters of the Constitution might have
predicted. With the House poised to endorse impeachment articles
against President Clinton, the president's supporters may have
taken a small degree of comfort in Hamilton's words.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate trial would likely begin in January on any impeachment
article approved by the House. On most legislation _ not just
impeachment _ the Senate tends to move more deliberately than the
House, in part because its rules give members more stratagems for
bottling up bills they don't like than are available to their
counterparts in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Already, 1996 GOP presidential candidate Bob Dole is urging his
former colleagues to forgo a trial and agree instead to a harsh
condemnation of the president. It's far from certain that the
Republican-controlled Senate will go along with the plan, which
would require Clinton's signature.
</P>
<P>
   Months ago, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., pledged to keep the process as free from partisan strife as
possible. He said the founding fathers intended it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's efforts notwithstanding, Friday's debate was full of
bitterness and angry words from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said the impeachment effort was
characterized by ``unbridled hatred and meanness.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans countered that they were following the ``rule of
law.''
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere likely will be cooler in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the senators feel any less strongly about the
issue than their House colleagues. Rather, the Senate knows that
the Constitution confers upon it the burden of being the last fire
wall separating a chief executive from impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were expected to be a more mature, deliberative body,''
said constitutional scholar Alan Hirsch. &QL;

   Joseph Cavalieri
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One by one, they walked out onto the porch of Lt.
Joseph Cavalieri's home in Malverne, on Long Island, tugged at
their caps and wiped a hand across their contorted faces as if it
was some sort of rite.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and family who streamed into the home of his widow,
Deborah, Friday afternoon in this community several miles east of
his Brooklyn firehouse said that Cavalieri was a man of action, a
firefighter who had requested a busy assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they never planned to bury him this young. He was 42.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani spoke of Cavalieri in a subdued tone
Friday during his weekly radio show when he took a call from Pat
McDonald. She is the wife of police officer Steven McDonald, who
was left a quadriplegic in 1986 after he was shot in the neck in
Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lieutenant Cavalieri is not only one of the city's heroes, but
he is also a good friend of ours,'' Mrs. McDonald, who also lives
in Malverne, said.
</P>
<P>
   Others remembered Cavalieri, a 15-year veteran of the fire
department who stood a rugged 6 feet 5 inches tall, as a father of
two who placed God before family, and then family above all else.
He was also active in the community and a hero who died so others
would not, his mourners said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Cavalieri grew up in nearby Valley Stream and married
Deborah, his high-school sweetheart, 20 years ago. They brought up
two daughters in their Cape Cod home; one is now a 19-year-old
Fordham student and the other a 13-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   He started his career in the Bronx, spent a decade at Ladder
Company 150 in Hollis, Queens, then moved to Ladder Company 170 in
Canarsie two years ago after being promoted to lieutenant, said his
friend, Michael Farrell, a fire marshal.
</P>
<P>
   As ashen-faced firefighters were bringing supper and soda and
beer into Mrs. Cavalieri's home, Farrell stood on the porch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a hell of a Christmas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Bopp
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Bopp loved being a firefighter, friends and family
said, and he could barely contain his excitement about the prospect
of soon becoming a father. Friday, instead of coming together to
share in his good fortune, friends and relatives gathered at his
home in Midwood, Brooklyn, to mourn his loss and to try to help his
wife, Cori, face a future without him.
</P>
<P>
   Bopp lived just a few blocks from his childhood home and clearly
had earned the love and respect of his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the best guy that you could ever meet,'' said Ed
Gleason, 73, a neighbor and a friend, who said Bopp helped him
shovel snow and with other tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Gleason added that Bopp was good with children and was looking
forward to the birth of his first child, in July. He said that the
27-year-old firefighter always had time to ``talk hockey'' with
Gleason's 15-year-old grandson.
</P>
<P>
   Bopp's brother, John, said Christopher seemed to have found his
true calling when he became a firefighter three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved what he was doing and he loved the guys he did it
with,'' John Bopp said. ``He was one of the happiest men I ever
met.''
</P>
<P>
   James Bohan
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors on the street in Middle Village, Queens, where James
Bohan grew up and still lived with his parents remembered the
25-year-old firefighter as a polite boy who was inseparable from
his older brother, Maurice, and who grew up to be a thoughtful and
helpful neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time he was a boy, he was a real gentleman,'' said
Ann Jelley, who lived down the street from the Bohans until
recently and who frequently invited the two young brothers over to
play in her back yard with her granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jelley said that as a teen-ager and young adult, James
Bohan often made repairs at the homes of elderly neighbors. ``He
would go out of his way to help, painting and other repair work,
especially with neighbors where there was no man around the
house,'' she said. ``He and his brother both were good, good boys
for this day and age.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, other firefighters and friends and relatives
filed into the modest two-story attached brick house to pay their
respects to Bohan's family, some openly weeping.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Moreano, the Bohans' next-door neighbor, said James Bohan's
parents, John and Margaret, were devastated by their son's death.
``Especially his mother, she's having a hard time dealing with
this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucille Conte, another neighbor, said the Bohans were a
close-knit and devout Irish Catholic family. ``Every Sunday, it was
like seeing the mother duck and the father duck with two baby ducks
walking in front of them and they would all head off to church
together,'' she said. ``And the boys did this even as adults. It
was wonderful to see.''

PRIEST'S REMOVAL STUNS NEW JERSEY PARISHIONERS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANASQUAN, N.J. _ During nearly 20 years as a priest at St.
Denis Roman Catholic Church in this small seaside town, the Rev.
Robert J. Parenti built a bond with parishioners who appreciated
his compassion for the sick, his forceful demeanor and his brief
sermons.
</P>
<P>
   So a few quiet gasps echoed through the Gothic stone church last
weekend when a letter from Bishop John M. Smith was read aloud
during Masses announcing that Parenti had been removed from his
duties because of unspecified ``sexual misconduct'' with a minor 25
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The news was so stunning that some worshipers at Sunday's
service wept. Others remained sitting when the Mass resumed minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this sense of disbelief, of sadness,'' said Eileen
Shea, whose five grown sons served as altar boys during the last
two decades. ``You could just feel the pain everyone was going
through.''
</P>
<P>
   In the week since that surprise announcement, much of the
congregation's shock has turned to anger. But instead of focusing
their anger on Parenti and his alleged transgression, the
parishioners have directed the scorn at Smith for the way the
Diocese of Trenton had announced the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were so vague _ omitting the name, age and gender of
the accuser as well as any description of what sexual misconduct
allegedly occurred or what evidence supported the claims _ that
many of Parenti's supporters accused the church of McCarthyism,
saying it was impossible to determine whether the accusations were
true.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials said their actions were carefully calibrated to
inform the community while protecting the identity of the accuser.
Eileen C. Marx, a spokeswoman for the diocese who handled calls
about the issue for Smith, said she thought it was important not to
conceal the incident from the public because many Catholic churches
were criticized in the last two decades for hiding allegations of
sexual misconduct by priests.
</P>
<P>
   But the bishop's disclosure generated headlines up and down the
Jersey Shore and convinced many parishioners that Parenti's
reputation would be forever tarnished _ even if he was ultimately
cleared of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the charges are true, he should be hung from the highest
tree,'' said Marilou Finan, a parishioner. ``But how do we know
it's true if it's something that happened 25 years ago? And if it's
not true, nothing will remove the stain of these allegations. This
man has been smeared for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Manasquan's population swells to 25,000 during the
summer vacation months, the 5,300 year-round residents are a
close-knit group, the kind of community-minded neighbors who throw
a parade down Main Street before every high school football game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a death in the family or a medical emergency,
people here help each other,'' said Mayor John L. Winterstella.
``It's a very old-fashioned, loyal community.''
</P>
<P>
   Parenti was highly involved in community affairs, traveling to
one of the area hospitals every day to visit the sick and working
on interdenominational charities. He also expanded the parish Beach
Chapel, a small center originally designed to handle overflow
crowds of worshipers in the summer, and expanded St. Denis' size by
opening it year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Parenti, 59, also had a legendary sense of humor. During a
sermon delivered at a children's Mass a week before Christmas
several years ago, Parenti asked that anyone who had been bad
during the previous year raise his or her hand. Only one boy did,
and Parenti ordered him to the altar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Father reached in his pocket, gave the boy a $10 bill, and
told him, `You're the only honest person in the whole church,'''
Ms. Finan said.
</P>
<P>
   Such memories make it difficult for parishioners to imagine him
as being involved in any sexual impropriety, especially one
involving a minor. The bishop's letter said only that the incident
reportedly happened in the early 1970s, when Parenti lived at St.
Veronica Church in nearby Howell, N.J., and worked from a diocese
office in Trenton. The pastor at St. Veronica, the Rev. Brendan
Williams, said the unnamed accuser had no connection to his church.
</P>
<P>
   ``The diocese wouldn't take such a serious action if there were
any doubts,'' Williams said. ``And Father Parenti, when confronted
with the allegations, didn't try to defend himself. He accepted the
help they had offered him, the counseling.''
</P>
<P>
   Parenti, who is now undergoing a psychiatric evaluation, could
not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Shea, a parishioner at St. Denis for more than two decades,
said she went to the rectory Tuesday to deliver Parenti a Christmas
card and chocolates and was startled by the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``They usually leave the door open and welcome you in,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this time, they made me ring the bell and get buzzed in,
like I was going through security. It was so cold. It was like
being in New York City. You wonder, can things ever be the same
again?''

NEWS ANALYSIS: IOC BEGINS MENDING A POSSIBLE TEAR IN INTEGRITY 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There long have been allegations, suggestions and assumptions of
corruption among the International Olympic Committee, whose
oligarchic, undemocratic structure and penchant for choosing the
host city's finest hotel hardly has helped discourage such chatter.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC, after all, is one of the world's most exclusive and
visible clubs, and exclusive clubs have a habit of fostering
jealousy, even animosity among nonmembers. All the more reason for
the fortunate few to be above reproach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask athletes to compete with integrity, and we ask members
of the IOC to act the same way,'' said Anita DeFrantz, an IOC vice
president from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Not all athletes have answered the call, and neither have all
the members, which is no surprise in light of human nature but
certainly no excuse. The difference this time is that there appears
to be proof in the form of a scholarship and training-assistance
fund created by the bid committee from Salt Lake City that
benefited at least six relatives of IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, and I expect I speak for a huge majority of IOC
members, I don't like this to be out there but I'm glad it is,''
IOC Vice President Dick Pound had said last week. ``Because it
gives us an opportunity to look into it, and hopefully that
opportunity will put a chapter that appears to be somewhat
disagreeable behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound, a potential candidate for the IOC presidency if Juan
Antonio Samaranch ever sees fit to vacate the post, has a major
role to play in the weeks ahead as head of the special commission
appointed to investigate the scholarship fund and, more important,
its beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main concern is the members,'' Pound said.
</P>
<P>
   While it is somewhat reassuring that the IOC has appointed a
special commission brimming with lawyers, it would have been much
more reassuring if the IOC had uncovered the fund's existence on
its own, instead of relying on the journalistic work of a Salt Lake
City television station.
</P>
<P>
   That the IOC has found nothing rotten with the state of Olympic
bidding until now means that it could not have been searching hard
enough or sending the proper signals to candidate cities about the
benefits of candor. Yes, the IOC has changed its system, removing
some of the dining and wining and waste by having an evaluation
commission pare down the lists of candidates and by strictly
defining gift limits. Yes, the IOC has debriefed bidding teams
after votes in an attempt to monitor the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that information is limited,'' said Marc
Hodler, the Swiss IOC member who has alleged that corruption in the
bidding process is hardly confined to Salt Lake City and its
scholarship fund. He said winners never say anything because they
have a ``bad conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The losers only give information if they have decided never to
run again,'' Hodler had added.
</P>
<P>
   This, Pound insists, is the first time the IOC has a paper
trail. If the committee does not take full advantage, it will risk
doing further damage to the credibility of an organization that
will pick another Olympic city next June in Seoul when it votes for
the host of the 2006 Winter Games. Any reform in the electoral
process will come too late for that vote.
</P>
<P>
   The front-runner is Sion, Switzerland: a bid that Hodler
supports but did not necessarily help with his meandering, not
terribly cogent description of Gianni Agnelli's decision to give
Fiats to national federations during Sestrieres' successful bid to
host the 1997 Alpine Ski Championships.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Hodler seemed to be citing the gifts as a cautionary
tale, but he then shifted gears and began thanking Agnelli for
helping him combat the insidious influence of a Luxembourg-based
agent who was trying to sell blocks of votes to a rival bid.
</P>
<P>
   The Agnelli family essentially built Sestrieres, and Turin, the
Italian city which is one of Sion's leading rivals in the 2006
Olympic bidding is another Agnelli fief. Hodler insists that his
comments were never meant to sway votes for Sion.
</P>
<P>
   Hodler also was not maladroit on all counts in Lausanne. The
mystery is that he waited until after his 80th birthday to begin
speaking openly about his belief that corruption exists in the IOC.
He was president of the International Ski Federation for 47 years
without ever being quite so provocative. Hodler, who is now
president of the IOC coordination committee for the 2002 Games,
explained Monday that he spoke out because a recent conversation
with a friend made him realize that outsiders had begun to question
his own integrity and because he did not want Salt Lake City to
take all the blame when it was hardly alone and had been so quick
to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Where that cooperation leads or does not lead will be
fascinating to track, and the IOC surely must realize that if it
cannot police itself, outsiders will try to take over the policing.
Pound said that his committee hopes to complete its work by the end
of January. Then the executive board meets before a world
conference on doping begins in Lausanne. The timetable is
appropriate _ addressing one major problem in the Olympic movement
before moving on to the biggest.

THE COPS ON THE CAVIAR BEAT 
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: With NY-CAVIAR-RING) (DW) 
 By MOLLY O'NEILL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Special Agent 523 from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service flashed his gold badge at a security agent and wheeled his
dark blue Ford into the Northwest Airlines cargo area at Kennedy
International Airport. More than a thousand pounds of caviar
awaited his scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Inspector 248, his partner on a recent afternoon,
Special Agent 523 could barely contain his excitement. It was as if
their briefcases _ packed with test tubes, sample bags and latex
gloves _ were instead filled with mother-of-pearl spoons and the
duo were headed toward a caviar bacchanal.
</P>
<P>
   But their enthusiasm was purely scientific. The two are among
the force of caviar cops, so to speak, who monitor the rich supply
coming into New York City. The team, using DNA testing to determine
the origin of the eggs, was set up to enforce the tough new
international standards that now regulate caviar importing.
</P>
<P>
   Drafted by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, known as Cites, the regulations
seek to protect the dwindling supplies of sturgeon from the Caspian
Sea and elsewhere. The Fish and Wildlife Service of the Department
of the Interior is responsible for enforcing these standards.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two tons of imported caviar is now being held in the New
York region by the wildlife service. Some of it has flunked its DNA
testing and will be destroyed. Other shipments are waiting for the
results of DNA tests to verify that the fish eggs are, in fact,
what their traveling papers say they are _ for example, that a tin
labeled ``Caspian Sea Beluga'' really contains that premium grade.
</P>
<P>
   Inspector 248, Robert Rothe, who is 28 years old and has a
degree in wildlife biology, is like a patrolman on the beat. He
wears the department's uniform _ beige trousers, brown turtleneck
and brown fleece jacket stitched with a patch of the agency's seal.
He does not carry a gun.
</P>
<P>
   He carefully studies shipments of caviar in cold storage hangars
at the airport as well as in the suitcases of passengers on flights
from Russia, Eastern Europe and Scandinavia. On Oct. 28, Rothe
assisted Customs agents in discovering nearly 1,000 pounds of
caviar in the baggage of seven passengers on a Finnair flight from
Poland. In the case that developed from this finding, three people
were indicted Friday on smuggling charges in U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Special Agent 523, Edward Grace, is more like a detective. It
was Grace, for instance, who worked nearly 600 hours in the last
two months to connect the smuggled caviar to a supplier in
Connecticut _ and discovered at least four other instances of
caviar smuggling that the supplier has been charged with.
</P>
<P>
   In his green tweed L. L. Bean jacket, a .40-caliber SIG Sauer
pistol tucked into the band of his chinos, Grace sounds like an
assistant biology professor, which, with his master's degree in
biology, he could be.
</P>
<P>
   Sliding open the door of the Northwest Airlines 50-by-50-foot
cold storage unit last week, Grace and Rothe opened the airline
container and freed a cardboard box.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our first big shipment from China,'' said Grace, who
describes himself ``as the voice of the sturgeon which has no other
voice.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Rothe sliced open the box. The cans of caviar inside were
pristine, each bearing a hologram of all the information required
by the international regulations. Grace opened six tins. He used a
tongue depressor to remove a dab of caviar from one tin and gently
slide the sample into a clear plastic bag.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs were taken throughout the process, a total of six
snapshots per sample. The process took about 90 minutes. The
samples were sent to a laboratory in Ashland, Ore., for DNA
testing. The results would be ready in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   The tests have not yet been completed, but neither Grace nor
Rothe expected any problems in the case of the Chinese eggs. Its
papers were in perfect order. Its contents smelled fresh. Fish eggs
from the Amur River on the border of China and Russia are sold as
keluga or as ossetra caviar.
</P>
<P>
   Whether these Chinese sturgeon eggs are comparable to the
ossetra caviar harvested in the Caspian Sea is not something Rothe
or Grace would know.
</P>
<P>
   Grace does not like caviar. Rothe has never tasted the stuff.
``The more I see, the less I'm tempted,'' he said.

THE DEVILS LET THEIR DEFENSE SLIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ After scoring five or more goals in five
straight games, the Devils regressed on offense Friday night. They
played below their standard defensively, as well, and the result
was that their 10-game unbeaten streak at Continental Arena ended
in a 5-2 loss to the Calgary Flames.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the Devils' reaction indicated that a game like this
one was going to happen sooner or later. It happened sooner, and it
came on a night when the Devils were lackadaisical in their
approach to defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the games we won, we didn't play good defense,''
Patrik Elias said of the Devils' scoring binge in the previous five
games, which produced 28 goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave them too many chances,'' said Lyle Odelein, the
reliable defenseman. ``We got caught too many times.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Stevens and Bobby Holik scored for the Devils, who are now
18-8-3. The Devils dominated the game for the most part, but were
able to convert only two of the 38 shots they fired at
Jean-Sebastien Giguere.
</P>
<P>
   Although several Devils players agreed that the defensive effort
was not up to their standards, Coach Robbie Ftorek said he was
satisfied with his players' performance.
</P>
<P>
   Ftorek admitted, however, that his team's overall defense needed
to improve. ``We have to be a little bit tighter back there,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The chief victim of the poor defensive play was Chris Terreri,
who lost for the first time in his fifth start in goal. Terreri,
who played for only the second time in the last 15 games, allowed
two goals to Cory Stillman and one each to Clarke Wilm, Dave Roche
and Theo Fleury. The Devils were so loose on defense that
Stillman's second goal came on a two-on-none breakaway.
</P>
<P>
   Terreri was in goal when the Devils turned up their offense with
seven goals in a victory over the Islanders on Dec. 5, which
touched off the recent scoring burst. The Devils also allowed five
games that night, and a total of 20 during the five-game binge.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night Terreri did not face a shot until the midway point
of the first period as the Flames came out with very little spunk,
enabling the Devils to take control early.
</P>
<P>
   The slow start by the Flames could be attributed to fatigue
after their previous night's game in Philadelphia, when they earned
a 3-3 deadlock with the Flyers by scoring all their goals in the
third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils forged in front Friday when a shot by Stevens from
the right circle, just 57 seconds into the game, hit the inside of
the left post and landed in the net.
</P>
<P>
   Calgary capitalized on its first manpower advantage and tied the
game on Stillman's 11th goal of the season. It came at 13 minutes
43 seconds on a deflection from the low slot of a shot by Fleury.
</P>
<P>
   In an almost identical scoring manner, Holik earned a goal on
the Devils' first manpower advantage by deflecting Dave
Andreychuk's shot in the low slot to give New Jersey a 2-1
advantage at the first intermission. It was the sixth consecutive
game in which Holik scored a goal, tying the franchise mark shared
by Valery Zelepukin, Pat Verbeek and Kirk Muller.
</P>
<P>
   The Flames tied the score again 3:43 into the second period,
this time on Wilm's third goal of the season. Wilm got behind Denis
Pederson on the right and barely beat Terreri under the right
skate.
</P>
<P>
   Pederson was the center of the Devils' checking line because Bob
Carpenter missed his second game in the last four, this one with a
bruised foot that most likely will keep him out of the game at
Montreal on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Some loose checking by the Devils in their zone cost them when
Roche scored for Calgary with 4:46 left in the second period. He
beat Terreri from close range to put the Flames in the lead, 3-2.
They sealed the victory with third-period goals by Fleury and
Stillman. &QL;

   Player ruled ineligible on eve of contest
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By BRIAN McTAGGART &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
KATY _ One day before it was scheduled to play for the Class 5A
Division II state championship, Katy High School's football team
was disqualified Friday for using an ineligible player in its
victory over Clear Brook two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, imposed by University Interscholastic League
officials in Austin, came after Katy school officials reported that
a reserve player falsified grades so he could remain eligible
during the Tigers' bid for a second consecutive 5A title.
</P>
<P>
   With Katy's disqualification under the no-pass, no-play rule,
San Antonio MacArthur, which lost to the Tigers 14-6 in last week's
semifinals, now will play Midland Lee at noon today at Texas
Stadium in Irving.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a UIL rule is violated, sometimes there is a range of
penalties that can be involved,'' said Charles Breithaupt, the
UIL's athletic director. ``But when you're talking about no-pass,
no-play, there is no range, there is no interpretation, there is no
leeway.''
</P>
<P>
   Katy coach Mike Johnston, one year removed from a raucous
celebration of the Tigers' 1997 Division I state title, was somber
and shaken when he announced Katy's dreams of a repeat championship
would not come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, my feelings are for the seniors on the team,'' he
said. ``For this to finish our season is certainly the roughest
road I've ever traveled on as a coach. Our players are totally
dumbfounded.''
</P>
<P>
   The team was scheduled to leave for Irving at 10:15 a.m. Friday
and had boarded buses as the band played the school fight song when
Johnston received word of the UIL ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought they would let us play and then slap us hard for
next year,'' Johnston said. ``But the UIL told us that what had
happened was a violation of state law (the no-pass, no-play rule)
and that the UIL had to enforce state law.''
</P>
<P>
   The players were ushered from the buses to the field house where
they were informed by Johnston that their season was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have the door slammed in your face at the threshold of a
state championship game, I don't know of anything tougher,''
Johnston said. ``When you have a group of guys who don't know
anything but to do the very best, it no doubt hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   While Midland Lee scrambled to prepare for a new opponent,
MacArthur coaches reissued equipment before the team caught a
flight late Friday for Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unbelievable,'' MacArthur linebacker Joey Johnson
said. ``I still can't believe it. I was getting ready to watch the
game on TV and thinking about how that could've been us, and here
we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Katy's players were left to wonder what could have
been.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we ended practice (Thursday) at Rhodes Stadium, we had a
little deal with the seniors because that was the last time we were
going to be on that field in pads,'' said team captain Trey Moebes.
``It was sort of sad, because for most of the guys this was going
to be their last chance to play football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now our season's ended without us having a chance to do
anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Katy Principal Robert Blankinship said the school learned late
Thursday that a player falsified grades and forged a signature on a
three-week progress report the week after Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   The player, a senior whose name was not released, participated
in the final three plays of Katy's 40-0 win over Clear Brook but
sat out the Tigers' victory over MacArthur last week.
</P>
<P>
   UIL rules state the minimum penalty of forfeiture must apply if
a student is ruled ineligible under no-pass, no-play.
</P>
<P>
   The forgery came to light when a teacher of one of the two
classes the player was failing noticed he was preparing to make the
trip to Irving with the team. The teacher told an assistant
principal, who notified Blankinship, who informed the UIL.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he was passing, and I had the progress report in
front of me,'' Johnston said. ``These kids want to be Katy Tigers
in the worst way, and it's unfortunate when they have to do some
things to stay on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to pass judgment (on the player). It's not the
makeup of our football team, not the way they were brought up and
not the way I was brought up. We just have to hope for
forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the third time in a little more than two months that
Katy has been thrust into the spotlight over eligibility concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Katy's troubles began Oct. 9 when Johnston reported to the UIL
that the Tigers had used an ineligible player in the final seconds
of a 28-14 win over Fort Bend Austin on Sept. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Katy was ordered by the District 19-5A executive committee to
forfeit four more games Oct. 22 for violations of the UIL amateur
rule after players received free meals and a free T-shirt from a
parent group.
</P>
<P>
   The State Executive Committee restored the victories Oct. 27,
but not before issuing Katy a public reprimand and one year on
probation.
</P>
<P>
   Katy could find itself subject to further punishment from the
UIL for violating its probation. Penalties include disqualification
from next year's playoffs or a full-fledged suspension of the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said he understood the UIL's decision in this case, but
thinks the rule should be changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our understanding if a student forges grades it's a
violation of state law, and the UIL doesn't have any flexibility,''
he said. ``They have to enforce the state law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope in the future they review this in fairness to the team
and make adjustments so nothing like this happens to anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston, who is president of the Texas High School Coaches
Association, said he wasn't concerned about his program possibly
getting a bad image statewide.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a whole lot I can do for what people on the
outside think,'' he said. ``Everything we've done this year has
been the right thing to do by the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't hesitate to turn ourselves in the two times before
and we didn't hesitate this time. Right now the system is unfair to
disqualify a whole football team for the actions of one person.''
</P>
<P>
   Katy school Superintendent Leonard Merrell said he wasn't sure
what punishment, if any, the player would suffer for falsifying his
grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main concern as far as he's concerned is his emotional
well-being and making sure he has the help he needs to make it
through this,'' he said. ``The young man worked hard to be on the
team. He made a mistake, and many others will suffer from that.''

   ``I hope nobody does anything mean to him,'' Johnston said.
``He's not a bad kid. Being a part of this team was one of the most
important things in his life.''

   ``I've had the opportunity to live in this community 19 years
and have been involved in lots of things outside of school,''
Johnston said. ``I have a good handle on the spirit of the

time for the community. I feel they'll respond like our football

<P>
   Man of Steele flying high
</P>
<P>
   Ecstatic coach calls new Baylor home `perfect fit'
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WACO _ After he was introduced Friday as the new football coach at
Baylor, Kevin Steele couldn't help but reflect on what likely had
been the most emotional and dramatic week of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, sports fans across America saw TV replays of one
of the lowest moments in his 17-year coaching career. As the
linebackers coach for the Carolina Panthers, Steele was attacked by
Carolina linebacker Kevin Greene in a brief altercation on the
sideline.
</P>
<P>
   What no one knew at the time was Steele was about to get on a
plane headed for Waco to interview for a job and a chance he had
dreamed about most of this life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been an amazing week,'' Steele said. ``Make no mistake
about it, (Sunday's incident) was a disappointing thing. Nobody
likes for that to happen. But three hours later, I was on an
airplane headed for what was the greatest opportunity of my
coaching career. I went from pretty frustrated to an ultimate
high.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele found out four days later he was Baylor's choice to
replace Dave Roberts, who was reassigned Dec. 6 after back-to-back
2-9 seasons. Steele, 40, has reached his longtime goal of becoming
a head coach for a major-college program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wonderful time in my life,'' Steele told a gathering
of Baylor alumni Friday morning. ``The values this university has
in higher Christian education is conducive to the way Kevin Steele
tries to coach football and live his life. It was a perfect fit for
me and all the things I envision about being a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know all of you are here today to hear what I have to say,
because after (last) Sunday, you all know what I look like.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident wasn't an accurate representation of what Steele is
like or how players feel about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, that issue was put to rest three minutes after
it happened,'' Steele said. ``You didn't see that on camera, but
Kevin Greene and I hugged each other's neck right after it
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Respect of the men who play for him, ability to communicate with
people, a deep religious commitment and a firm belief in discipline
are some of the characteristics that enabled Steele to beat out the
other candidates for the Baylor job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin is the right man at the right time for the right
university,'' Baylor athletic director Tom Stanton said. ``Kevin is
a professional with integrity. He has a brilliant football mind,
and he represents and stands for the things Baylor stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanton admitted Steele became a front-runner for the job after
he interviewed with the advisory committee. When Gene Stallings
backed out Wednesday night, Steele was the man Baylor wanted.
</P>
<P>
   `We saw in him an outstanding individual and a man with
tremendous integrity,'' Stanton said. ``When you talk to Kevin, you
can't help but feel his commitment and his depth as an individual.
When the group saw Kevin's football knowledge and his charisma,
there was no doubt this was the man to lead our football program in
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. was on the advisory committee.
Steele spent Thursday in Houston with McLane at the Astros offices
in the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a communicator, which was the greatest asset I saw in
(Astros manager) Larry Dierker,'' McLane said. ``Larry knows how to
get his ideas over to the players, and Kevin will do that, also. He
spoke to (Astros president) Tal Smith for about 15 minutes, and Tal
told me Kevin was one of the most impressive sports people he had
ever met.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele, who played linebacker at Tennessee, has been an
assistant coach at Nebraska, Tennessee, New Mexico State and
Oklahoma State, along with four seasons in the NFL. But he never
has been a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no concern whatsoever about that,'' Stanton said.
``Kevin is the son of a coach and has worked under some outstanding
mentors. Kevin is a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Commitment is important to Steele, which is why he will do his
job for the Panthers in the last two games for the team this
season. Steele will be in Waco during the week, but join the team
on Sunday for its final two games. He said his top two priorities
are to start recruiting and fill his coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I will do is talk to the coaches here and see
if they fit into what we are trying to do,'' Steele said. ``Then we
want to look for coaches with Baylor ties that understand the
unique qualities of this university and have played at this school.
We also will look for coaches with Texas ties.''
</P>
<P>
   That would seem to indicate Highland Park High School coach
Scott Smith has a good chance of coming to Baylor. Smith, a former
Baylor player and assistant coach under Grant Teaff, was
interviewed for the head coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   Steele, an avid runner, talked about the type of offense and
defense he wants to employ, saying he likes an aggressive 4-3
defense and a power-I offense with ``quick-strike'' passing
capabilities.

THINGS ARE GOING FROM BAD TO BETTER FOR THE ISLANDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ When the Islanders embarked on a four-game
West Coast trip after losing seven straight games, their playoff
outlook was bleak and their collective attitude was bleaker.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before Zigmund Palffy, the Islanders' best player,
agreed to a long-term contract. Before the textbook victory over
the San Jose Sharks. And before the inspiring overtime victory over
the Los Angeles Kings on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With Palffy on his way back from Slovakia, the buzz that
permeated the Islanders' locker room early this season has also
returned, and with it the hope of making the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great player,'' Trevor Linden, the Islanders' captain,
said of Palffy. ``It's great for the team to have him back. Apart
from his goal-scoring ability, his play-making ability adds another
dimension. It's amazing what one player does for the whole team's
outlook.''
</P>
<P>
   Palffy, who agreed in principle to a five-year contract
averaging $5.5 million on Thursday, signed it Friday morning,
according to Petr Svoboda, who is an associate of Palffy's agent,
Paul Kraus.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy, who is a three-time 40-goal scorer, is expected to leave
his native Slovakia Friday and arrive on Long Island late Saturday.
He will make his season debut Tuesday against the St. Louis Blues
at Nassau Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely feel we can still make the playoffs at this
stage,'' said Steven Gluckstern, the Islanders' co-owner, who
attended Thursday's game against the Kings. ``We're going to have
to play better than .500 and this team is capable of that. And with
Ziggy, this team is more than capable of that.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders were visibly energized by the news of Palffy's
signing, which came just hours before they beat the Kings in a wild
shootout, 5-4, on an overtime goal by Bryan Berard at the Great
Western Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they showed that early,'' said Mike Milbury, the
Islanders' coach and general manager, referring to the effect the
news of Palffy's signing had on the team. ``I don't know how to
factor that in, but I'm sure it had something to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Islanders strayed from the tight defensive game
plan that earned them a 1-0 victory against the Sharks. But this
time, they got a break, that crucial late-in-the game bounce, the
one that so often has gone the other way this season.
</P>
<P>
   Berard's giveaway led to a momentum-killing goal by the Kings
earlier in the game. But two minutes into overtime, Berard picked
up a rebound off the post and beat a sprawled Jamie Storr under the
crossbar. The original shot was taken by Mariusz Czerkawski, who
set up a nifty pass from Robert Reichel.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's midnight holiday trade moratorium deadline is
expected to pass without Milbury pulling the trigger on a deal. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SLAP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   KENNY JONSSON, the Islanders' top defenseman, may have sustained
his second concussion in a month during Friday night's game against
the Mighty Ducks when TRAVIS GREEN clipped Jonsson's head with an
elbow in the first period. Green, a former Islander who was traded
to Anaheim late last season, was confronted by the Islanders'
captain, TREVOR LINDEN, as Jonsson lay motionless on the ice. After
the period, Green said, ``I was just trying to finish my check on
the play.'' Any injury to Jonsson would be crucial. Of the eight
games Jonsson missed with his first concussion, the Islanders lost
seven. &QL;

   Cowboys
</P>
<P>
   A solution &QL; 
the problem &QL; 
for Cowboys
</P>
<P>
   Numerous factors &QL; 
contribute to letdown
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JODY GOLDSTEIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So what's wrong with the Cowboys?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's easier to start with what's right.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys still need only one win or an Arizona loss to clinch
the NFC East title and have two of the losingest teams in the
league remaining on their schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback/punt returner Deion Sanders could return this week.
The Cowboys' 0-6 record with him out (over two years) should be all
the explanation necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Smith could return at cornerback this week. And though he
was an easy scapegoat early in the season, the alternatives have
been worse.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys scored a combined 65 points against these two
opponents in the previous meetings. The Eagles and Redskins got
into Dallas' end zone once.
</P>
<P>
   And the Cowboys finish up at home and have a chance to go 8-0
within their division for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been what's wrong that has stood out in recent weeks,
and it's the reason the Cowboys need to worry about the last two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a combination of both mental and physical,''
offensive lineman Mike Kiselak said. ``We have to come in wanting
it a little bit more and push a little harder through.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 22-3 drubbing by the New Orleans Saints, the Cowboys
spent a painful morning reliving the game film, but they thought
they figured out some things. It was the Saints' blitz that shut
down the Cowboys' ground game and stymied the once-potent air
attack. It was the Saints' quickness that led to so many
three-and-outs by Dallas that the Cowboys finished the game with a
season-low eight yards rushing and 128 yards overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any major problem,'' Kiselak said. ``We
just have to get together as a team and work a little harder, a
little longer at staying on our blocks and pushing that extra half
a step.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were prepared to protect against the blitz in the
Kansas City game, but they found the Chiefs to be more troublesome
in other areas. The Chiefs' defense took away the quick-passing
routes. The offense proved even more troublesome as brawny running
back Bam Morris shrugged off tackles to gain 134 yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in too many of his highlight films,'' Cowboys safety
Charlie Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The explanations are many. There have been injuries galore. The
three biggest offseason acquisitions were running back Chris
Warren, offensive lineman Everett McIver and wide receiver Ernie
Mills. The latter two are on injured reserve. Warren has spent his
share of the games on the sidelines nursing ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders can take away half the field from opponents who
generally try to stay as far away as possible from the seven-time
Pro Bowl selection. With Sanders gone for the past three weeks, and
Smith and even backup Kevin Mathis gone at times, offenses have had
a field day with the decimated Dallas secondary.
</P>
<P>
   But recognizing the problems doesn't seem to have escaped
Dallas' grasp. Just reacting and adjusting. The Cowboys overcame a
three-quarter drought and the loss of receiver Michael Irvin to
score two late touchdowns last week against the Chiefs. But two
weren't enough.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Emmitt Smith had rushed for 100 yards or more in
three of the last five leading up to the New Orleans game. He
gained 50 in the last two games combined and 92 total in the past
three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, everybody was gung-ho,'' Smith said. ``Now,
everybody's looking for answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensive lineman Larry Allen, who will make his fourth trip to
the Pro Bowl this year, has been uncharacteristically manhandled at
times the past two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to a point in a season where you think that all the
other linemen are scared of you,'' Allen said. ``Then they start
doing different things than they did on the tape. That's what I
have to expect from here on out. I can't expect them to do what
they did on film the week before. I just have to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The run should again be the biggest factor Sunday. The Cowboys
put themselves in too many third-down situations last week,
converting only 9-of-27. The absence of solid runs on first and
second downs is largely to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just vital, especially in the NFC, that we get a running
game going,'' guard Nate Newton said. ``That helps keep the
pressure off Troy (Aikman). We've just got to work harder and
concentrate a little better and execute.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a good formula, but the same one they spouted before the
Kansas City game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was one thing, you'd feel much better about it and
trying to work it out,'' coach Chan Gailey said. ``But it's a
combination of two or three things. In this game, you can never sit
down and fix one thing and then everything is OK. It doesn't work
that way.''

   Although he has been the honorary chairman of a number of
fund-raising benefits in the last several years, Michael D. Eisner,
who has been on the Forbes list of the wealthiest Americans since
1993, has not been known for megagifts to charity.
</P>
<P>
   That is likely to change.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Eisner reaped a stock-option windfall. He had 21.9
million options that were worth $460.8 million at the end of
Disney's fiscal year in September 1997. When he cashed them in late
that year, they were worth $550 million.
</P>
<P>
   During 1997, Eisner also put Disney shares worth about $116
million into his personal foundation. For Eisner, as for any donor
in his situation, the donation had two tax advantages: It reduced
his taxable income, perhaps by the full $116 million, and he did
not have to pay capital gains taxes on the donated shares.
</P>
<P>
   For the charitable world, the donation created an important new
benefactor. Like all foundations, his must give away about 5
percent of its net asset value annually _ millions of dollars, in
this case.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner has said his foundation would help needy children and
children with learning disabilities. No details of its giving are
yet known, but there are clues to the Eisner family's interests.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a decade, Eisner's wife, Jane, has been on the board
of the American Foundation for AIDS Research. ``They have always
taken the position that what they give is anonymous,'' said Jerome
Radwin, executive vice president of the organization. Eisner also
has contributed more than $1 million to Georgetown University, his
son's alma mater. The school's president, the Rev. Leo J.
O'Donovan, is on Disney's board.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner is president of Disney's foundation, but its giving does
not reflect a personal point of view. A company spokesman said:
``It gives in communities where we are physically located. We want
to be good neighbors.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Sanford I. Weill thinks about charity in the same way he thinks
about mergers: big.
</P>
<P>
   This year, big meant $100 million to Cornell University, which
renamed its medical school the Joan and Sanford I. Weill Medical
College and Graduate School of Medical Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Weill has been extremely coy about revealing the number
of years over which he is giving his money away, making the real
value of his gift hard to figure.
</P>
<P>
   Weill has been chairman of the board of overseers of the medical
school since 1996 _ and last year was an opportune year for giving.
Weill exercised stock options for a gain of $220 million. Giving
away $100 million or some portion of that figure in the same year
could have helped him reduce his taxable income.
</P>
<P>
   On April 30, the day he announced his gift to the medical
school, shares of Travelers, where he was then chairman, were
selling at $61.1875. ``When the market is up, you feel good about
giving,'' &UR;  &LR; Weill said. Five months later, the price had plummeted
to $31.75. On Friday, stock in Citigroup, the company formed from
the merger of Citicorp and Travelers, closed at $49.875.
</P>
<P>
   Weill has long been aware of the value of the corporate purse.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, he helped found the National Academy Foundation,
based in New York, a group that trains high school students for
jobs in the financial industry. American Express, where Weill was
then an executive, assisted with $100,000 to start the program. In
1996, when Weill was chief executive of Travelers Group, its
foundation gave the program $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Travelers foundation also gave to the Cornell medical school
and to Carnegie Hall, where the recital hall is named for Weill
because of a gift he made in 1983 and where he is chairman of the
board. Last year, Carnegie Hall was the site of the Travelers
annual meeting. &QL;

   Eugene M. Isenberg doesn't believe that his company should have
a corporate foundation. ``Basically, I think it is the
shareholders' money,'' Isenberg said. ``It's not for the executives
to make the decision. They should give the money to the
shareholders and let them make it.''
</P>
<P>
   What did Isenberg himself donate last year? A total of $2.5
million, he said, well above his usual giving of about $500,000
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Isenberg's prime cause is education, and the major beneficiary
has been his alma mater, the University of Massachusetts. Last
year, he pledged $6 million over five years, giving $2 million of
that sum in 1997. Separately, he gives $90,000 annually for
scholarships at the university in mathematics, engineering,
computer science and business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was time to give something back to education,'' Isenberg
said. ``I could afford to do it, and I did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Isenberg lives in Palm Beach, Fla., where he makes some
donations to the Palm Beach Opera and to a home for abused
children. He is sponsoring a fellowship in stroke prevention at the
Intercoastal Health Foundation in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The Isenberg family also supports New York's Parkside School for
children with learning challenges. This year, Isenberg pledged to
give $750,000 if the school could raise an additional $500,000.
``The headmistress is my daughter's best friend,'' Isenberg said.
``They came to me 10 years ago. I helped them do a business
plan.'' &QL;

   Eckhard Pfeiffer has been in Houston for just eight years, but
he is already a familiar figure at charitable events, where gossip
columns record his attendance at A-list functions, escorting the
socialite Caroline Farb.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that as one of Houston's most prominent
businessmen, he would be invited to join his adopted city's most
prominent boards, including those of the Houston Symphony, the
Greater Houston Partnership and the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. He
is also on the board of Southern Methodist University in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   But Pfeiffer, who was born in Germany and spent most of his
working life in Europe, does not appear to have embraced big-ticket
American philanthropy. Pfeiffer has not established a personal
foundation, so there is no public record of his giving, and he
declined to comment on his donations.
</P>
<P>
   Symphony officials confirmed that he gives to that organization
in the range of $7,500 to $10,000 a year, and Compaq says he is a
member of the Alexis de Toqueville Society of the United Way, which
requires a minimum gift of $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's corporate giving is being reassessed as the company
absorbs recent acquisitions: the Digital Equipment Corp. and Tandem
Computer. It gave away $4.2 million last year, primarily to
education, health, social services and arts programs, mainly in
Houston. &QL;

   Reuben Mark is a company man, having worked for
Colgate-Palmolive since he graduated from the Harvard Business
School in 1963. He became chief executive in 1984 and has grown
wealthy along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Mark declined to comment on his giving. But his philanthropic
interests seem to focus on education.
</P>
<P>
   Both Mark and his wife, Arlene, served a few years ago as
trustees of the I Have a Dream program. In that organization,
founded by Eugene Lang, a New York industrialist, benefactors adopt
classes of primary school students, work with them through junior
high and high school and then help them get into college.
</P>
<P>
   The project generally involves a financial commitment of
$500,000 to $1 million over seven years for each benefactor, and a
large commitment of personal time.
</P>
<P>
   Mark formerly was a trustee of Bank Street College of Education
in New York and is a director of New Visions for Public Schools,
which uses private funds to establish small new schools in the
city. Colgate-Palmolive is a corporate contributor to the program. &QL;

eager to talk about both his views on philanthropy and the size of
his gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Los Angeles we don't have a tradition of philanthropy,''
Broad said in a telephone interview. ``I don't mind being out
front, and hopefully others will follow.''
</P>
<P>
   The single largest beneficiaries of Broad's giving last year
were Pitzer College in Claremont, Calif., at $1.6 million; Michigan
State University, $1 million, and the new Disney Hall concert
facility in Los Angeles, also $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also give to United Jewish Appeal,'' Broad said. ``But I am
more interested in the community. Some people fault me for it. They
say how can you give to Michigan State and not to some Jewish
hospital? But I tell them that you have to do your own thing. I am
more a citizen of the city than I am of the Jewish community.''
</P>
<P>
   His giving is clearly structured with taxes in mind. Last year,
he said, his adjusted gross income was $38 million, between pay
from SunAmerica and investment income. Broad said he gave away
$11.6 million, or 30 percent of his adjusted gross income _ the
maximum a donor can deduct.
</P>
<P>
   Broad, an art collector, put $8 million of that sum into two
family foundations: one that provides grants for art students and
one that buys art and lends it to museums for exhibits. The two
foundations gave away $5.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   SunAmerica's corporate foundation, he said, gives primarily to
charities in the Los Angeles area, like the United Way, and makes
grants to local artists. &QL;

   When a fire badly damaged Central Synagogue in Manhattan last
September, Charles A. Heimbold Jr. quickly wrote a personal check
for $25,000 to help with restoration. Though Heimbold is Roman
Catholic, a spokesman for Bristol-Myers Squibb explained that he
``wanted to be a good neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to be interviewed about his giving, but a
surprisingly eclectic collection of charities benefited from the $5
million Heimbold &UR;  &LR; donated last year, primarily through his personal
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The largest gift was $2 million to the University of
Pennsylvania Law School, where Heimbold worked on the Law Review in
1960. Others were $1 million to Villanova University, where he
received his bachelor's degree; $500,000 to Phoenix House, a drug
treatment network, and $100,000 to the American Museum of Natural
History.
</P>
<P>
   Heimbold's wife, Monica, a social worker, is a trustee of the
American Scandinavian Foundation, and the Heimbolds have given
$500,000 toward the group's Child Center. They also gave $250,000
to a library in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The Bristol-Myers foundation gave about $28 million last year to
organizations aimed at furthering science, education and child
care. But a spokesman said Heimbold was careful that the
foundation's giving not mirror his own. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the gifts made last year by the personal charitable
foundation of John F. Welch Jr., his philanthropic passions are
education, religion and the United Way.
</P>
<P>
   The largest single gift from the $6.2 million foundation was
$25,000 to the Sankaty Head Foundation, which provides college
scholarships for young people who caddie at the Sankaty Head Golf
Club on Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the foundation gave away $134,156 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Welch also makes gifts other than those reported through records
of the foundation, but he does not like to talk about them, a GE
spokeswoman said. ``He does believe in charitable giving, but he
feels it is a private matter and he is not going to discuss it,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Welch foundation gave $19,381 to the Inner City Foundation
in Bridgeport, Conn. ``Jack Welch has been the guiding light behind
it for seven years, and his wife, Jane, is on the board,'' said
Bishop Edward M. Egan, president of the Inner City Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Welch's foundation also gave $15,000 to the Tri-State United
Way; $7,500 to his alma mater, the University of Massachusetts, and
$5,000 to the Bridgeport Hospital Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   GE's corporate foundation gave away about $40 million last year,
primarily to educational institutions. &QL;

   He is chairman of an Atlanta company, but Summerfield K.
Johnston Jr. has his heart and heritage in Chattanooga, Tenn.,
where his family's century-old bottling business was based before
it was bought by Coca-Cola Enterprises in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was chief executive of the Atlanta company for seven
years before easing into his current job last April, he ``is a real
mystery'' on the Atlanta charity scene, according to an executive
active in giving there who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston does serve on the board of the Morehouse School of
Medicine in Atlanta and has made contributions to the school and to
Spelman College, also in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In Chattanooga, he is on the board of the University of
Chattanooga Foundation and has given grants for research on the
blighted American chestnut tree and to endow professorships.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, his foundation also gave $50,000 to the Baylor
School, a Chattanooga preparatory school &UR;  &LR; that he, his father and
his son all attended.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the foundation, which had assets of $23 million in 1997,
gave away $1 million last year. Other beneficiaries included a
community foundation in Sheridan, Wyo., near where he has a home;
and his alma mater, Vanderbilt University. &QL;

   Some people want to change the world; Stephen M. Case wants to
connect it to the Internet. A founder of America Online, he now
hopes to use some of the same techniques in philanthropy that he
uses in business.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is entrepreneurship. In 1996, Case and his wife,
Jean, started the Computer Learning Center to put computers in
low-income housing projects in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise,'' Case said, ``kids go home from school and don't
have access to computers.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to enlist others to start similar centers elsewhere.
``This is the same way venture capitalists help create new
companies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Computers, of course, have made it possible for Case to become a
philanthropist. Six years ago, all of America Online was worth $70
million. Last year, his total pay, including unexercised options,
was more than $119 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1997, Case established a personal foundation with a
donation of America Online stock worth $981,250. His subsequent
contributions _ and the run-up in Internet stocks _ have increased
its assets to $50 million, according to the company.
</P>
<P>
   America Online started a corporate foundation last year, as
well, dedicated to helping the Internet have a positive impact on
society. The foundation gave away $400,000 in its first year. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

<P>
   It is likely that few chief executives have such large private
organizations to support as Lawrence A. Bossidy, the father of 9
and the grandfather of 20.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bossidy gives money to a number of institutions in which
he is personally involved, including religious and alumni groups.
</P>
<P>
   Bossidy worked at General Electric for 34 years, and, to an
extent, his giving mirrors that of his former boss, John F. Welch
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The largest gift last year from Bossidy's personal foundation,
which has $3.7 million in assets, was $50,914 to Faith in
the &UR;  &LR; Future, a Bridgeport, Conn., group that is headed by Bishop
Edward M. Egan and helps Catholic schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Sankaty Head Foundation, which gives scholarships for
caddies at a Nantucket golf club and is a favorite charity of
Welch, received $10,000 of the $206,962 that Bossidy's foundation
gave away. Bossidy also gave $40,000 to St. Mary's Roman Catholic
Church in Ridgefield, Conn., near his home, and $19,950 to the
Tri-State United Way.
</P>
<P>
   A Colgate University alumnus, Bossidy has been a steady
contributor to the school; last year, his foundation gave it
$24,590.
</P>
<P>
   Bossidy declined to be interviewed; Bishop Egan said he was very
generous, and another associate added that he sometimes preferred
to be quiet about his giving. &QL; 
 &QL;

   Louis V. Gerstner Jr. has long been a champion of education. And
while much of his philanthropy was financed until recently from the
corporate coffers of IBM, he has begun to make big gifts of his own
as his personal wealth has soared. This year, he has given away $2
million, partly through his personal foundation, according to an
IBM executive.
</P>
<P>
   Among the gifts were $1 million to Bishop Edward M. Egan's Faith
in the Future campaign for Catholic schools, for which he has
established a distinguished scholars program; $500,000 to the
Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, and
$300,000 to Chaminade High School, the Catholic school he attended
in Mineola, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Gerstner gave his foundation $1.1 million and it made
gifts totaling $118,000, including $34,460 to Faith in the Future;
$15,000 to the United Way of Greenwich, Conn., and smaller amounts
to various community, educational and religious organizations.
</P>
<P>
   IBMs corporate giving ``mirrors Gerstner's own commitments,''
according to Stanley Litow, a company vice president. IBM makes
grants to schools and state education departments to foster the use
of technology in the classroom. It donated $26.6 million cash and
$70.2 million in computers last year, about two-thirds to
educational projects. &QL;

   &UR; INTERNATIONAL _ (Moved in ``i'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-RDP (Washington) _ On the third day of the air assault on
Iraq, the Pentagon said Friday that it was able to confirm that
only 18 of its 89 targets had been severely damaged or destroyed,
despite waves of bombers and more laser-guided cruise missiles than
were hurled at Iraq during the gulf war in 1991. Saddam Hussein
showed defiance toward the United States in his first televised
address since the attacks began, calling his attackers ``the agents
of Satan.'' Ledeall. By Philip Shenon. (With photo and graphic)
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-SOLDIERS (Fort Steward, Ga.) _ Here at Fort Stewart,
headquarters for the Third Division's Second Brigade, President
Bill Clinton's decision to bomb Iraq has canceled the homecomings
of many, and will probably cause others to be shipped out to the
Persian Gulf over the next few days or weeks. By Rick Bragg.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-RUSSIA (Washington) _ Despite Russia's anger over the
bombing of Iraq and the recall of its ambassador from Washington,
Moscow's private conversations with U.S. officials reflect a desire
to preserve and protect the U.S.-Russian relationship, senior U.S.
officials said Friday. Officials noted that the most positive
conversation yet occurred Friday morning between Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. By
Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-INSPECT (United Nations) _ If Saddam Hussein is still in
control of Iraq when the bombing ends, arms-control experts say,
the Security Council should not abandon arms inspections but should
quickly reimpose rigorous monitoring in every area of weapons
development. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-MILITARY (Washington) _ As U.S. and British forces struck
Iraq for a third day, senior defense officials said the attack was
simply working its way through a ``tightly drawn'' list of military
and industrial targets. The strikes would end, they said, when the
cruise missiles and jets reached the end of the list. By Steven Lee
Myers.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-SAUDIS (Manama, Bahrain) _ More than half of the U.S.
strike aircraft in the Persian Gulf region have been kept out of
the attack on Iraq because of objections from Saudi Arabia, Western
military officers said Friday. By Douglas Jehl.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-RAMADAN (Undated) _ Ramadan, the holy month of dawn-to-dusk
fasting in the Islamic calendar, begins this weekend for Muslims
around the world. Its start depends on the sighting of the new
crescent moon. (No byline)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON _ (Moved in ``w'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH (Washington) _ For the first time since Feb. 24, 1868,
three years after the United States emerged from an awful Civil
War, the House of Representatives debated the impeachment of a
president Friday. It scheduled for Saturday a vote on four articles
of impeachment ``for high crimes and misdemeanors'' against William
Jefferson Clinton. By R.W. Apple Jr. (With photo and graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-SCENE (Washington) _ The strangest sound of all in the
debate to impeach President Clinton was the sudden roar of
shockingly bipartisan approval and applause erupting across the
House of Representatives when the plaintive cry came forth: ``The
politics of smear and slash-and-burn must end!'' For the briefest
moment in a day of bear-pit partisanship, Republicans and Democrats
cheered as one. The scene. By Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-CLINTON (Washington) _ Mindful as ever of his standing
in history, President Clinton is said by associates to feel
devastated about a scar he now regards as inevitable: a vote to
impeach him Saturday in the House of Representatives. But at the
same time, aides and friends of Clinton say, America's most tested
political fighter has steeled himself for the battle of his life.
By James Bennet.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-FLYNT (Los Angeles) _ It was, in some ways, inevitable
that Hustler publisher Larry Flynt would immerse himself in the
infidelities of President Clinton and other Washington politicians.
Raunchy, flamboyant, self-serving and defiant, Flynt was fully
enjoying his notoriety Friday just as he did more than 25 years ago
when he leveraged a string of Ohio strip clubs into the start of a
publishing empire that pushed _ and is still pushing _ the limits
of sexual tolerance. By Bernard Weinraub.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-RESIGN (Washington) _ The next battle the White House
will face is an anticipated campaign to pressure President Clinton
to resign. White House aides charge that Republicans are
orchestrating a resignation push, because House leaders expect
their impeachment drive to falter in the Senate. By Jill Abramson.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-MOOD (Washington) _ The president, some of his aides and
friends say, is devastated. He has withdrawn, they say, even
cutting off some of his usual circle of friends. One, who talked to
him daily, hasn't heard from him since Thanksgiving. Another tells
of calls among the inner circle about how to get Bill Clinton's
political fires burning again. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-LAMEDUCKS (Washington) _ They are the lame ducks in the
House, 21 Republicans and 17 Democrats, not including two
Republicans and one Democrat who won election to Senate seats. And
as the House took up impeachment Friday, they streamed back into
the Capitol to deal with what for many is the most momentous issue
of their careers in public service, one they variously view as
unfortunately necessary or just unfortunate. By Richard W.
Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-POLL (Washington) _ The Republican Party's standing with
the public dropped significantly this week, tying its lowest rating
in the past 14 years, as the House moved toward a vote on
impeaching President Clinton even as the United States launched a
military attack on Iraq, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll
shows. By Richard W. Stevenson. (With graphic)
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-TV-NOTEBOOK (Undated) _ The television screen showed the
House of Representatives more than three-quarters empty. And if
Congress wasn't watching, why should we? The House floor was meant
to be the site of history-making drama, but the action Friday was
all off-stage. It was definitely on camera, though, captured in the
talk of reporters and commentators who helped shape the political
spin and strategies. By Caryn James.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-VOICES (St. Louis) _ Back in the St. Louis suburbs to
talk to people about impeachment. By Rick Lyman.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-ASSESS (Washington) _ A news analysis: As the acrid,
rueful and righteous debate went through the hours Friday, the
House stood poised to do what even some of its own Republican
leaders once considered unimaginable _ to impeach a Democratic
president on a near party line vote against the will of the people.
This was not the way something as momentous as impeachment was
supposed to take place. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL _ GENERAL (Moved in ``a'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NY-CAVIAR-RING (New York) _ Uncovering what it called a black
market caviar scheme worth millions, the federal government
indicted three men who run a distributing company that supplies
much of the retail and restaurant market in New York City with the
precious fish eggs. The distributors were charged in federal court
with smuggling thousands of pounds of Russian sturgeon roe into the
United States from Poland. By Molly O'Neill.

   SCI-BALLOON (Undated) _ The eternal quest to become the first
balloonist to circumnavigate the globe begins anew: The ICO Global
Challenge, a 160-foot-high balloon piloted by an all-star team of
long-distance balloonists, rose from its launching pad at
Marrakesh, Morocco, on Friday to begin a voyage the balloonists
hope will take them around the world in 10 days. By Malcolm W.
Browne.

</P>
<P>
   PHILIPPINES-AIRLINES (Manila) _ With $2.2 billion in debt,
plunging revenues and losses of close to $1 million a day,
Philippine Airlines, Asia's oldest airline, is in desperate shape.
But Philippine Airlines is also the crown jewel in the empire of a
tycoon who is a leading supporter of the new president of the
Philippines. In the murky world of Asian business, where
friendships often count more than solvency, Philippine Airlines
would seem to be the classic candidate for a government bailout.
But that is not the case. By Mark Landler. (With graphic.)

<P>
   ALLTEL-ALIANT (Undated) _ Alltel Corp., a telecommunications
company based in Little Rock, Ark., said Friday that it had agreed

</P>
<P>
   RICH-COLUMN (Undated) _ Surreal, unreal, mind-blowing: these are
words of the '60s, and it's no wonder they returned to vogue this
week. Not since a tottering presidency, a divisive war,
assassinations, civic unrest and bitter partisanship overloaded the
American psyche in 1968 has there been a spectacle to match this
moment. ``Split-screen America'' we call it now. By Frank Rich.

   OLY-SALT-LAKE-CITY (Salt Lake City) _ At a closed meeting room
at the Salt Lake Organizing Committee's headquarters, the
five-member SLOC Ethics Committee met to discuss the bribery
allegations. Likely to be on the agenda was a $400,000 scholarship
whose 13 beneficiaries included relatives of IOC members; why those
scholarships were not reflected on tax documents; and $28,000 in
free medical service provided to three IOC members. The payments
appear to violate IOC rules limiting the value of gifts to members

   Clemens' agent wants &QL; 
a chance to re-evaluate
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
HOUSTON _ During a week that included a hastily called news
conference, one team bowing out of the Roger Clemens sweepstakes
only to re-enter, and a series of heated exchanges, one of the most
important responses has emerged: Timeout.
</P>
<P>
   That's the message Clemens' agent, Randy Hendricks, conveyed
Friday night as efforts to trade the only five-time Cy Young Award
winner from the Toronto Blue Jays have reached a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks said it's time to re-evaluate the events of the past
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to decide any time soon,'' Hendricks said.
``If it takes a month or two no more day-to-day, week-to-week mood.
We're going to take time and decide what makes the most sense in
the interest of Roger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want a low-key instead of a high-key environment.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't rule out a return to Toronto, the club he demanded
trade him Dec. 2 as part of an agreement with then-president Paul
Beeston.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it rule out a possible trade to his hometown Astros,
who called a news conference last weekend at baseball's winter
meetings to announce they were ``stunned outraged'' at the
financial demands of Clemens' agents and were no longer pursuing a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   At last count, at least five teams were interested in Clemens,
although Hendricks said that number is slightly higher.
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks said at the center of the drawn-out issue to grant
Clemens' contractual right for a trade is the impact it has had on
his client.
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks spoke with Clemens, who was in California playing in a
golf tournament Friday, and said he remains distressed about being
vilified nationally as interested only in a big payday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked with Roger and he asked, `Why should I think about
playing for Houston if they think this way about me and you,'''
Hendricks said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has gotten to the point where drastic action may
be necessary. You know those movies about Ebola virus outbreaks,
where the guys in sterile suits come in, seal off the area and
completely irradiate it?
</P>
<P>
   They may have to do that to Washington. Just eradicate us and
start from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday evening, we had the frightening scene of Republicans
so crazed with hatred of the president that they were railroading
through an impeachment even though the United States was at war
with Iraq, even though the House chamber was mostly empty, even
though Republicans were huddled in a glass house on the issue of
sex and lies, even though Americans were sensibly refusing to be
drawn into the madness, even though the White House was still
pitching a tent and planning sleigh rides for a Winter Wonderland
press party on Monday. (The White House was keeping the journalists
quarantined outside this year, but encouraged them to bring their
kids. To soak up some of that cozy family atmosphere, no doubt.)
</P>
<P>
   Why are the Republicans so hellbent, when everyone in his right
mind agrees that impeachment is an outlandishly over-the-top
punishment for Clinton and a self-destructive course for the
country?
</P>
<P>
   Because they genuinely hate the president. They think he's a
dishonest, immoral, issue-stealing, spoiled, selfish child of the
'60s. They don't think they're going to pay a political price for
this, and if they do, they don't care. A lot of Republicans have
made a calculation that, for their kinds of voters, they are better
off going along with Livingston, Delay, Hyde and the right wing.
</P>
<P>
   It might be a great time to see a lot of combovers, but it's not
a great time to see a lot of stature. The House debate was not
history. It was just a more hideous version of ``The McLaughlin
Group.'' No one's listening. Everyone's spewing.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has always bristled with hypocrisy. Now it's rotting
with hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the Republicans doggedly pursuing the nation's first
sexual impeachment have now been exposed as hounds.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Hyde, who worries about the American flag falling, has
confessed to falling into an adulterous temptation. And
Speaker-elect Bob Livingston just had to own up to multiple
extramarital affairs.
</P>
<P>
   When Livingston confessed his sins to Republicans, they gave him
a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Their justification for their double standard was that
Livingston had never lied under oath about his affairs. (I guess
the vow to his wife doesn't count as an oath.) While Republicans
tried to draw the distinction that Clinton had perjured himself,
they ignored that the president had been lured by the Starr-Jones
attorney team into testifying on Monica Lewinsky. Does anyone
seriously think that Livingston, or most pols, would have eagerly
fessed up when asked excruciating questions about their
extramarital sex lives?
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily one would feel sorry for Livingston being outed. But
the Republicans have brought on themselves this sexual doomsday
machine of Larry Flynt, Clinton investigators and journalists by
focusing so single-mindedly on Clinton's sex life.
</P>
<P>
   Even the looniest Democrat made far more sense Friday night than
the most ``judicious'' Republican. ``An impeachable offense should
be one that threatens liberty, not chastity,'' said James Traficant
of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans were so determined to do their high-tech
lynching that they engaged in wacky role reversals. Many Republican
hawks argued that Bill Clinton should not be bombing Saddam,
claiming the timing was suspicious, even though they had hammered
him for not bombing five weeks ago. In an incredibly unseemly
display, Trent Lott, the majority leader, and former Bush national
security adviser Brent Scowcroft and Bush Secretary of State
Lawrence Eagleburger chimed in on the attack.
</P>
<P>
   So here were Democrats standing strong on defense, arguing that
the Republicans put America in a weakened position internationally
by forcing through an impeachment vote during a military action.
And here were Republicans giving their newly elected Speaker a
standing ovation for his confession of serial adulteries.
</P>
<P>
   There's too much hate here. And I hate it.

COMMENTARY: HOUSE OF ARROGANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the end, the will of the people meant nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Livingston couldn't have been clearer about that.
</P>
<P>
   His mind and the minds of his followers were closed. Even as the
bombing continued in Iraq and Americans from coast to coast were
clamoring for an alternative to impeachment, even as his own
adulterous past was being flushed out in the grotesque invasions of
privacy that inevitably followed the relentlessly prurient pursuit
of the president, even as the country began to contemplate the
destructive effects of a lengthy and bitter Senate trial, the
speaker-designate arrogantly and stupidly proclaimed: ``Let us
disregard the outside influences.''
</P>
<P>
   The radicals on the Hill would hear nothing but the echoes of
their own fanaticism. Impeach! Impeach!
</P>
<P>
   Dismayed by the partisan stampede, Richard Gephardt, the
Democratic leader in the House, warned: ``In your effort to uphold
the Constitution, you are trampling the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   David Bonior, the Democratic whip, said: ``This is wrong. It is
unfair. It is unjust. At a time when events in the world and the
challenges at home demand that we stand united, censure is the one
solution that can bring us together. To my colleagues across the
aisle, I say let go of your obsession. Listen to the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   But the voices of reason would not be heard. Livingston and his
right-wing colleagues, the Tom DeLays, the Henry Hydes, the Bob
Barrs, were on a mission of destruction and would not be denied.
Ordinary Americans could cry out all they wanted. They could
protest and demonstrate, send faxes and e-mails. It didn't matter.
The right was on the march and democracy was on the run.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Thomas Barrett, D-Wisc., tried to remind his Republican
colleagues that the Constitution ``does not allow you to remove a
president from office because you can't stand him.'' He was, of
course, ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans will pay a huge price for their brazen, utterly
partisan attempt to drag a president from the White House in
defiance of the will of the people. The party's contempt for the
voters was arrogantly but quite adequately summed up by Alan
Simpson, the former senator from Wyoming, who said: ``The attention
span of Americans is which movie is coming out next month and
whether the quarterly report on their stock will change.''
</P>
<P>
   If the voters are the dopes that Simpson thinks they are, then
come 2000 everyone will have forgotten there was an impeachment
crisis. And maybe the extremist ticket of Tom DeLay and Bob Barr
could capture the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., was probably closer to the
truth when he said, ``I warn my colleagues that you will reap the
bitter harvest of the unfair partisan seeds you sow today.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the many strange events of the past couple of weeks was
the way in which virtually all of the previously undecided
Republicans, the so-called moderates, surrendered their
independence and lined up like lackeys to follow the right wing's
lead. All proclaimed loudly that they were voting on principle, but
in fact it was an exercise in mass cowardice, exemplified by Rep.
John McHugh of upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   McHugh announced on Tuesday that he would vote for impeachment.
But if his decision was based on principle, he had an odd way of
expressing it. The Washington Post said McHugh appeared to have no
stomach for a Senate conviction or removal of the president from
office. Of his colleagues in the Senate, McHugh said, ``I, for one,
would accept, even welcome, their mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, let the Senate do the heavy constitutional
lifting. McHugh may have wished out loud for mercy, but he clearly
was too frightened of the right-wingers in the House to cast a
compassionate vote himself.
</P>
<P>
   The zealots, for the time being, are having their way. The GOP
can no longer conceal that it is a party of extremists, of
right-wing absolutists. The party is dominated by ultraconservative
forces that are out of step with the political and cultural
orientation of most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Livingston's arrogant comment could serve as his party's
slogan. ``Let us disregard the outside influences.''
</P>
<P>
   Let us disregard the people.
</P>

   AIRPLANE-NOISE (Washington) _ Airplane noise has gotten a lot
softer, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, and a
10-year program with that in mind is approaching a pianissimo
finale. But some airlines will face a last-minute rush to fix or
retire old planes next year, and one, a cargo carrier in Miami,

   IRAQ-RDP (Undated) _ Ledeall on assessment of third day of
airstrikes, plans for future attacks. By Philip Shenon and Steven
Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-POLICY (Undated) _ An inevitable price of the United
States' and Britain's use of force in Iraq is that it arouses
considerable unease around the world, especially if it fails.
Although only Russia has publicly vented irritation at the U.S.
decision to punish President Saddam Hussein, many another
government, especially in the Middle East, has watched the attacks
with consternation, either from uneasiness about any nation that
would take on itself the role of global policeman, or from concern
about local repercussions, or from unanswered questions about what
the United States is trying to achieve. By Serge Schmemann.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-HIDE (United Nations) _ Dazzling television images of
rocket attacks and satellite photographs of ruined Iraqi buildings
have yet to convince some experts, including U.N. weapons
inspectors, that President Saddam Hussein has been decisively
undercut in his ability to make new weapons of mass destruction. By
Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-ENTERPRISE (Aboard the USS Enterprise) _ The bombs may be
sophisticated, but the sentiments are not. Just below the flight
deck, in a newly-dubbed Bomb Farm, the high-tech weapons had been
scrawled with Magic Markers, in that time-tested way, to send crude
messages to Iraq of what sailors really think. ``To Sadam, Mery
X-Mas, '' one of them said. ``Hold Onto Yer Butt,'' read another,
``Die, You Magets,'' said another, and yet another read: ``This is
Gunna Hurt.'' By Douglas Jehl.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-CULTURE (Jerusalem) _ On city streets and in their living
rooms Israelis are awash in American popular culture. McDonald's
restaurants, Tower Records stores and Blockbuster Video shops dot
the urban landscape, and MTV and ``Seinfeld'' reruns are on cable
television. But the Israeli Parliament is trying to turn the
cultural tide. By Joel Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   SWISS-RUSSIANS (Geneva) _ Since the fall of Communism, rich
Russians have frequented this country's ski slopes and luxury
boutiques, welcomed as free-spending guests but otherwise
attracting little notice. But two recent events have begun to focus
Swiss attention on whether this banking redoubt is becoming a prime
place to stow ill-gotten cash from the former Soviet Union and a
comfortable haven for rich Russian undesirables. By Elizabeth
Olson.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA-SCANDAL (Oklahoma City) _ Far from the impeachment
battle engulfing the nation's capitol, Oklahoma's lieutenant
governor is discovering that the American Bible belt is hardly
immune to sex-fueled controversy. A divorce between Lt. Gov. Mary
Fallin, 43, and her estranged husband has eroded into accusations
of adultery that threaten to cripple her political future. The
attorney for Fallin's husband suggested in a Dec. 4 divorce hearing
that the lieutenant governor had had an affair with one of her
bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   ATHEIST-AUCTION (Austin, Texas) _ The deepest secrets and
innermost thoughts of America's most famous atheist are for sale.
Madalyn Murray O'Hair, who founded the nation's leading atheist
group, American Atheists Inc., in the 1960s and vanished in 1995,
left behind a stack of diaries that will be sold next month to
satisfy a claim against her estate brought by the Internal Revenue
Service.

A TOUGH NEW GOAL IN IRAQ

<P>
   The scenes were gnawingly familiar: the video-gamelike
renderings of air strikes, the beribboned generals with their maps
and pointers, the unshaven Iraqis gaping into craters dug by U.S.
cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   It was so routine, in fact, that this latest act of war against
Iraq hardly delayed the debate in the House of Representatives over
impeachment of a sitting U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
   And yet because this U.S.-Iraqi contest of cat and mouse has
occurred so often in the past eight years without vexing, let alone
trapping, the mouse _ there, once again, was a smiling, sinister
Saddam Hussein clad in his natty foulards or his field marshal's
epaulets _ many are asking a broader set of questions this time
around.
</P>
<P>
   What is the endgame? What is the long-term strategy? How many
more times can this happen?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, while this bombing campaign has looked like a larger
version of half a dozen previous ones aimed at forcing Saddam to
abide by United Nations resolutions or to back away from allied
protected zones, President Clinton and Congress have called it
something much more significant. This, they say, is the first salvo
in a campaign to remove Saddam and install a government more
democratic and less dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   And while analysts and officials here and abroad applaud such
goals, they wonder whether such a policy shift goes beyond the
rhetorical. They are quick to point out that even if the Americans
are serious, the task is enormous not only because of Saddam's
continuing grip on power but because of the political culture of
the Iraq he has built over the last three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Any serious new government would have to come from Iraq's
professional and middle classes. Yet it is these people who have
been the direct beneficiaries of the universities, bridges, roads
and secular, modernized structure that Saddam has created. That
makes them, paradoxically, the ones with most to lose if he
departs.
</P>
<P>
   They are also the ones who have suffered most from U.S.-led
international sanctions against the country, watching their fixed
government salaries disappear and selling their artwork and
appliances for a pittance to feed their families.
</P>
<P>
   The urban poor are used to scraping by, and villagers can _ and
do _ turn back to farming. The urban middle class has truly felt
punished.
</P>
<P>
   And given the divided and ineffectual foreign-based Iraqi
opposition, the fierce mistrust of U.S. intentions felt across the
Arab world, and the fear of Iraqi middle classes that the first
result of any coup would be to bring the pent-up wrath of northern
Kurds and southern Shiites down on them, the challenge of
installing a new government becomes clear.
</P>
<P>
   Many people point to the continuing international trade
sanctions as the first problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sort of naivete about sanctions bringing democracy
to Iraq,'' said Denis Halliday, the Irish U.N. official who ran the
oil-for-food program in Iraq until quitting this year, declaring
that sanctions amounted to a ``declaration of war against the Iraqi
people.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Unicef officials say the lack of spare parts for the
electric, sewer and water networks are contributing to the deaths
of more than 6,000 infants a month there. While the West blames
Saddam for those deaths, most Iraqis, while not pleased with their
president, blame the West.
</P>
<P>
   Clovis Maksoud, a former Arab League ambassador to the United
Nations and now a professor at American University in Washington,
agreed, saying: ``There is a deep dissociation with Saddam in Iraq.
But when they are attacked by the Americans, they rally around the
flag, and he happens to be the flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Even analysts who urge the United States to actively promote a
coup against Saddam and consider the sanctions a useful form of
pressure on the regime say getting to the dictator will be
extremely difficult physically and politically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody admires him anymore, but most Iraqis still accept and
support him,'' said Amatzia Baram, an Israeli specialist on Iraq
from Haifa University who is spending the year in Washington. ``The
only hope is to separate him from his power base, prove to his
power base that life is more dangerous with him than without him.
That is part of the point of these bombings.''
</P>
<P>
   Others counter that the bombings have little effect on people
accustomed to suffering, that they view the missiles the way a
drowning man might see rain.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam's power base consists largely of portions of the Sunni
Muslim tribes and clans in central Iraq. And while it is true that
a majority of Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south
are sick of him and his rule, the chances of a rebellion even by
them are widely viewed as slim.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition groups do not exist in any organized fashion within
Iraq. Those on the outside have been heavily infiltrated by the
regime or are so splintered and inept as to offer almost no hope
for a coherent replacement regime.
</P>
<P>
   It is also entirely unclear how most Iraqis would respond to a
transparently U.S.-led putsch. One frequently heard criticism of
the Iraqi National Congress, the main umbrella opposition group
based in London, is that it is a spineless vassal of the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   ``No self-respecting Iraqi would stand up with the United States
when his country is being attacked in this fashion,'' asserted an
Iraqi businessman and intellectual who is known in Iraq as an
opponent of the regime and spoke on the condition of anonymity
since he continues to live there. ``How can you side with forces
bent on destroying not just the regime but a whole country?''
</P>
<P>
   For many Iraqis, relying on the United States to replace Saddam
would be the equivalent of Palestinians asking Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to save them.

</P>
<P>
   There is a widespread feeling not only in Iraq but across the
Arab world that U.S. policy is not anti-Saddam but something more
sinister, drawing its energy from the sheer savage vigor of
supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   According to this view, the United States cannot countenance the
prospect of a rich, powerful Arab country capable of challenging
U.S. and Israeli primacy in the region. Iraq, with its vast oil
reserves, ancient culture, fertile midlands and sophisticated
technology, is simply too threatening. So keeping Saddam weak and
in office is the best alternative; the United States would make
sure that any new government would serve U.S. interests first.
</P>
<P>
   Many Arabs also say they were grievously offended by all the
decorous talk of bombing before the onset of the holy month of
Ramadan this weekend, as if hurrying to bomb Muslims before Ramadan
was a way of showing respect.
</P>
<P>
   The result of all this suspicion, fueled by howls of ``double
standard'' regarding U.S. policy toward Israel and the Arabs, is
that even Iraqi opposition figures who believe that their hope is
in Washington worry about the appearance of that relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell the Americans, `Don't hug us too tight,' '' said
Ghassan Atiyyah, editor of the London-based Iraqi File, an
opposition publication.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Congress earmarked nearly $100 million for
opposition groups, a sum that seems princely until placed against
the hundreds of millions spent on military attacks this past week.
</P>
<P>
   Atiyyah met with U.S. officials some weeks ago to urge them to
finance the establishment of a new Iraqi opposition group in exile,
what he calls a ``council of wise men,'' that would draw on all
sectors of Iraqi society in exile.
</P>
<P>
   While the Iraqi National Congress has Kurds, Shiites and Sunnis,
Atiyyah said that ``the INC may have been an umbrella group, but it
is now an umbrella with too many holes in it that can't cover
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He says the opposition groups are missing the link to the Iraqi
center, both geographical and political. There is an acute need for
moderate, liberal and secular opposition figures, members of the
middle class, as well as Iraqis who come from the geographical
middle of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of such a group, he said, would be ``Iraqism,'' a
melting pot nationalism for all the country's ethnic and tribal
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The irony _ although it is perhaps also the strength _ of such a
goal is that it mirrors Saddam's own accomplishments. So even the
many Iraqis who despise their president worry that without him the
nation would fall apart, that Muslim fundamentalists, aided by
neighboring Iran, would gain undue influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Removing Saddam would only be a first step in dealing with
most of these issues, even if Saddam can be removed,'' argued
Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington. Any leader following Saddam, he said, would
have to maintain ``at least a quasi-authoritarian regime'' to
prevent deterioration into tribal bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the risk that assassination of Saddam would simply
lead to a takeover by one of his two brutish sons or by his chief
bodyguard and other close lieutenants, changing things not at all.
</P>
<P>
   Most Iraqis within the country lack any real sense of political
alternatives. Maksoud, the former Arab League ambassador, speaks of
their ``political illiteracy'' and Atiyyah, the London opposition
figure, asserts that ``almost anyone who can think clearly has left
the country already.''
</P>
<P>
   But others say this is untrue. Iraq is not an underdeveloped
country. Per capita, it has long had more engineers, scholars,
writers and professionals than any other Arab state. It is probably
not an accident that its scientists are the ones in the Arab world
who produced such an arsenal of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq is not Ethiopia or Somalia,'' said Radwan Abdallah, a
Jordanian political scientist. ``There is still an intelligentsia
and middle class there. It has enormous resources. To change things
requires a great deal of planning, energy and effort. You need a
strong outside hand. But it is a country with talent and
organizational skills. It is certainly not beyond hope.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ Scenario No. 1: The Jets clinch their first
divisional title in 30 years by defeating the Buffalo Bills here
Saturday afternoon, sweep their season series, and render all
arguments of a competition tainted by incompetent officiating
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Scenario No. 2: The Bills beat the Jets, tie them in the
standings but find themselves in position to lose the American
Football Conference East based on the divisional-record tie
breaker, thereby setting off another round of upstate umbrage and
making a stronger case for instant replay.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, given the presumption of honesty and
integrity, shouldn't officiating any game in any sport mean never
having to say you're sorry? Before it legislates anything else, the
National Football League should junk its unofficial policy of
apologizing to teams victimized by blown calls.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair about this, we checked in last week with George
Young, the league's director of operations, and he insisted that
the NFL does not call up teams to invoke the ``S'' word.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not say sorry, or apologize, to the teams,'' Young said.
``We simply encourage the coaches and general managers to send in
the plays they think should be reviewed. If I'm a coach, I want to
know why the penalty was called, so I can go to my player and say,
`This is what happened.' And if there was a mistake on the part of
the official, the coach should get the courtesy of explaining to
the player that what he did wasn't wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds fair, but what about the disputed sideline call that went
against the Bills at New England three weeks ago? That play had
nothing to do with defensive technique, or any rule beyond the one
that says a receiver must have his feet in bounds when he catches
the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The next play was a pass interference call in the end zone with
no time left that resulted in an extra play for the Patriots and
the winning touchdown, a better argument for Young's explanation,
but no more justification for calling the Bills to inform them of
anything.
</P>
<P>
   A recent newspaper photo of Amani Toomer's touchdown in the
Giants-Broncos game showed one official signaling that the catch
had been made out of bounds while another's arms were raised in
touchdown salute. The photo underscored the point that in most
disputed cases, officials are not missing calls based on
interpretation of the rules, but as a result of the angle from
which they make the call.
</P>
<P>
   The league, upon further review, then makes its phone call and
pours technical verbiage on a raw wound created by human error.
This combustible mix immediately produces what Young called ``a
breach of confidentiality.'' The team officials, still seething by
the middle of the week, are thrilled to spin this admission of
error by the league as one of guilt. Whatever its intention, the
NFL puts itself in the position of appearing to apologize for human
error, for the very officials Young calls ``the best in sports.''
</P>
<P>
   I can think of many more worthy causes of apologia, decisions
that embarrass the NFL far more than any botched coin toss, or
call.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody from the NFL ought to call the politicians in Oakland,
a struggling city that has already lined Al Davis' pockets, but may
apparently soon be held up at gunpoint for more.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody from the NFL owes every football fan in Baltimore an
apology for allowing Robert Irsay to steal their Colts and sticking
them with Art Modell's pitiful Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   Apologize to every player who has ever been tacitly encouraged
to destroy his internal organs with performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Apologize for the growing legion of players with police records
of assaulting women, and coaches like Bill Parcells who justify the
likes of David Meggett by blaming, in so many words, those seeking
fortune and thrills.
</P>
<P>
   Apologize to the country for Jerry Jones, for helping to make
the Bud Bowl part of American junk culture, for anything involving
the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders.
</P>
<P>
   My son suggested that the NFL apologize to American Indians for
the Washington Redskins. He's 9 years old, and gets it.
</P>
<P>
   What he doesn't get is the undercurrent of disrespect and
animosity directed at officials, and what a terrible precedent it
sets for kids. The first rule of sports _ as relearned the hard way
by Chuck Knoblauch not long ago _ is to accept the call, deal with
it, overcome it.
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh Steelers screamed they were robbed on
Thanksgiving Day, and haven't won a game since. The Patriots got a
gift in the Buffalo game but are nonetheless fighting for their
playoff lives. The Bills came into Saturday's game with a chance to
beat the Jets on the field, to give themselves a mathematical
chance for the division and a playoff berth to do further damage.
</P>
<P>
   Teams ultimately rise and fall to their qualitative level. The
season usually plays itself out. No apologies necessary for that.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE PARCELLS 10, DIFFERENT BUT THE SAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ On the Jets, there is the team within the
team. Call them the Parcells 10, those who had worked for Bill
Parcells with the New England Patriots or with the Giants or, in
the case of the latest member, David Meggett, who worked for the
coach with both the Patriots and the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10, no 2 are the same.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Meggett, are considered club pros _ Jumbo Elliott,
Pepper Johnson, Keith Byars, Otis Smith, Jerome Henderson. Two are
mostly on special teams, Corwin Brown and Mike Gisler. One is a
third-string quarterback, Ray Lucas. And one, Curtis Martin, is a
$36 million running back.
</P>
<P>
   Their positions and responsibilities vary. So do their salaries.
But to Parcells, the 10 have a common denominator. ``They like
football, they're willing to work, and winning means something to
them,'' he said. ``It's not about money.''
</P>
<P>
   It's mostly about understanding and appreciating what makes
Parcells such a successful coach. Meggett knows all about that.
</P>
<P>
   As the Jets awaited their opportunity to clinch first place in
the American Conference East with a victory over the Bills here
Saturday, Meggett explained why he enjoyed working for Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``The knowledge the coach brings to the game,'' Meggett said.
``The businesslike atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   As the most recent member of what is now the Parcells 10,
Meggett also enjoyed seeing familiar faces in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a feeling of home,'' he said. ``So many guys I played
with. That's a good feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   And those Meggett played with on the Patriots and earlier on the
Giants remember what Meggett did.
</P>
<P>
   Byars, now a Jets fullback, cited the Patriots' 23-22 victory
over the Giants in the 1996 season finale, when Meggett's touchdown
on a 60-yard punt return pulled the Patriots to within 22-17 in the
fourth quarter. That victory clinched first place and a playoff bye
for the Patriots on their way to Super Bowl XXXI.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how much they pay you,'' Byars said, ``it's not
going to make you make a play, make a catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, the offensive tackle, remembered several Meggett
moments when they were on the Giants together.
</P>
<P>
   ``David made big plays,'' Elliott said. ``Whether it was a
return or a run or a catch or throwing a pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Meggett twice threw option passes for Giant touchdowns against
the Redskins in 1993. As a Giant rookie in 1989, he took a short
pass from Phil Simms and scooted 57 yards in a swirling snowstorm
for the winning touchdown in a 14-7 victory in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   When Meggett was a free agent after the 1994 season, Parcells,
then in New England, quickly signed him to a five-year, $10 million
contract that included a $3 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Over his career, Meggett, now 32, who last Tuesday signed a
two-game contract for $60,000, has scored 27 touchdowns _ 11 on
pass receptions, 8 as a rusher, 7 on punt returns and 1 on a
kickoff return. He is the National Football League's career leader
in punt returns, 344, and punt-return yardage, 3,668.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, when Parcells was coaching the Giants, he had
resisted using a 1989 fifth-round draft choice on Meggett, who had
been the Division I-AA player of the year at Towson State. Although
a sturdy 180 pounds, Meggett was only 5 feet 7 inches, and Parcells
already had a &QC; 5-7 running back, Joe Morris.
</P>
<P>
   ``How else can I use him?'' Parcells asked the Giants' scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Use him, the scouts suggested, on a pitchout or a reverse.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you guys think this is, the Blue-Gray game?'' Parcells
snapped, but then he said, ``All right, let's take him, but I'm
telling you right now, if he can't return kickoffs and punts, I'm
going to cut him.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells not only didn't cut Meggett, he also brought Meggett to
the Patriots. And now Meggett is one of the Parcells 10 on the
Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all played for Bill,'' Elliott said. ``Football was
different when most of us started. You had to earn your way more.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, who joined the Giants in 1988, played three seasons for
Parcells; in the 20-19 victory in Super Bowl XXV, he blocked Bruce
Smith, the Bills' feared pass-rusher. Elliott joined the Jets as a
free agent in 1996; the next year Parcells was happy to inherit
him.
</P>
<P>
   But when Elliott was told about Parcells' reference to ``It's
not about money'' for the Parcells 10, he smiled. ``Winning means a
lot to us,'' the 308-pound, 6-foot-7-inch offensive tackle said,
``but we wouldn't do it for free.''

<HEADLINE>
NFL'S DIRECTOR OF OFFICIALS RESPONDS TO THE UPROAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the last eight seasons, Jerry Seeman has been the National
Football League's director of officiating. For 16 seasons before
that, he was a league official. And long before that he was a
quarterback, first with his high school in Fridley, Minn., and then
at Winona (Minn.) State University.
</P>
<P>
   Being inside the game helped Seeman develop an appreciation for
officiating. His final game was Super Bowl XXV, the Giants' victory
over Buffalo in Tampa, Fla., in 1991. He was on the field
officiating when instant replay was used in the NFL from 1986
through 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has dropped the idea of reinstituting replay for this
season's playoffs, but the proposal will be back on the table for
next season. With a clamor developing because of a spate of
game-swinging or game-ending bad calls, Seeman has had to keep his
group of officials united, focused and upbeat. He has at times
bluntly criticized them and passionately defended them.
</P>
<P>
   He discussed the uproar in an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What have the last few weeks been like?
</P>
<P>
   A. It seems historically that there has been a week or two in
the course of the season where judgment calls by the officials have
created a storm. That happened this year in Week 13 with the
Buffalo-New England game on the Hail Mary pass and in the Week 14
Seattle-Jets game and the Vinny Testaverde play at the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   The officials do everything they can to get it right.
Unfortunately, these things can and do happen. There are 2,300
plays in the 15 games each week. There are 155 plays in a game. The
problem can come on three or four plays. Other than that,
oftentimes, people don't even know we exist.
</P>
<P>
   Q. That is the problem, isn't it? Those three or four plays can
unfairly change the outcome of a game, right?
</P>
<P>
   A. The great official stays in the background. He enforces the
rules. But this is not a perfect world and football is not a
perfect game. Players aren't perfect. Coaches aren't perfect. But
officials are asked to be perfect the first game and then improve
every week. Their life is a fishbowl and it is then microscopic
within that fishbowl. But really, that is the beauty and the
challenge of being an NFL official.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So, what did you do or say to your officials after those
calls caused such a ruckus and negative attention on your group
nationwide?
</P>
<P>
   A. I shared with them the calls we made in those areas and the
corrections. I told them about the numbers involved in plays
throughout the course of the year and a game and told them to keep
everything in perspective. I reminded them it is not a perfect
game. I reminded them of the positives. I told them I think that
over all we do wonderful work. I told them we had to work even
harder.
</P>
<P>
   Q. There were reports that you were under fire, might even be
fired, and that the league would seek a quick remedy by coming
directly after you. Has your job been threatened?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. No truth to that whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Would you talk about what goes into the officials' year-round
preparation?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are 112 officials, all professionals _ lawyers,
dentists and educators among them. We begin preparing on April 1.
The 112 are taught the new rules implemented at the March owners'
meeting. There is a 275-item test. Then, on May 1, there is a
250-item test.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring they visit training camps and visit with coaches
and players. This is communication that puts a face on the
officials and their job and on the coaches and players and their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In July we have our clinic, and the officials are put through a
tough physical exam and stress test. They go out to training camps
with the different teams; more work with the players and coaches.
Officials communicate with them and among themselves, because that
is how you learn.
</P>
<P>
   In the preseason, they receive a 40- to 50-play training tape.
They are rated during the season and review tapes of their
performances each week during the season. The top 11 receive
post-season assignments. And then April rolls around and we start
again. It's pretty much a year-round thing. Plus, we scout the
colleges and sign college officials. We seek the best officials out
there.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some have called for officials to be truly year-round,
holding only the job of official. Isn't there a need for that?
</P>
<P>
   A. I truly do not believe that. We are doing everything humanly
possible right now in preparation and study. The problems that
primarily come up deal with things that happen in a millisecond or
things that are blocked from an official's view. I don't think a
year-round, officials-only job will solve that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. That sounds like an endorsement for instant replay, then,
right?
</P>
<P>
   A. Replay is an officiating tool. It could be there to help the
official. I'm not saying it's the answer to everything. On certain
plays it can help out. Right now the pace of the game is good.
We've got to be careful not to slow the game or break up the flow.
We have to move judiciously.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Then I guess you were relieved when the competition committee
voted, 7-1, against instituting replay for the playoffs and then
when the NFL commissioner, Paul Tagliabue, agreed?
</P>
<P>
   A. The owners voted, 21-9, against replay before the season. To
play the regular season one way and then the playoffs another could
have been a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Q.There is the notion that replay would make officials more
hesitant, even angry that Big Brother is watching from above, ready
to embarrass them. True?
</P>
<P>
   A. I was down on the field and used instant replay and did not
think anything like that. I don't think our other officials do,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So, what about the future? Do you see replay inserted for the
1999 season?
</P>
<P>
   A. The competition committee did vote, 7-1, recently against
replay for this year's playoffs. But it also voted, 6-2, for some
form of replay for next season. There is interest. Will it slow
down the game, though? Will it break up the pace? That is the
question. It is tough stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you take the scrutiny and criticism personally? Do your
officials right now feel hounded and hunted?
</P>
<P>
   A. Once you put on a striped shirt you are subject to criticism.
Sometimes we make an error and we deserve the criticism. We
understand the fans' allegiance to their teams. Sometimes the
attacks from all sides are very personal. But we must have the
personal fortitude and professionalism to stand in there.
</P>
<P>
   One of our officials, head linesman Terry Gierke, suffered a
severe knee injury in the Baltimore-Minnesota game last week. He is
out for the year. People don't think of the sacrifice and the pain
sometime. But we are professionals. And we have a conscience. And
that is the greatest attribute of these men.

<P>
   IRAQ-POLICY (Undated) _ An inevitable price of the United
States' and Britain's use of force in Iraq is that it arouses
considerable unease around the world, especially if it fails.
Although only Russia has publicly vented irritation at the U.S.
decision to punish President Saddam Hussein, many another
government, especially in the Middle East, has watched the attacks

X-Mas, '' one of them said. ``Hold Onto Yer Butt,'' read another,
``Die, You Magets,'' said another, and yet another read: ``This is

</P>
<P>
   SWISS-RUSSIANS (Geneva) _ Since the fall of Communism, rich
Russians have frequented this country's ski slopes and luxury
boutiques, welcomed as free-spending guests but otherwise
attracting little notice. But two recent events have begun to focus
Swiss attention on whether this banking redoubt is becoming a prime
place to stow ill-gotten cash from the former Soviet Union and a
comfortable haven for rich Russian undesirables. By Elizabeth
Olson.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-SPY (London) _ The British news media have always been
skeptical about the claims of Richard Tomlinson, the renegade MI6
agent who recently served a brief jail sentence for revealing
embarrassing secrets about the security service. But this week, the
newspapers found Tomlinson's latest disclosure too good to ignore:
he said that Dominic Lawson, the editor of the Sunday Telegraph,

   FRANCE-RWANDA (Paris) _ A parliamentary committee on French
military involvement in Rwanda before and during mass ethnic

governments in Paris made ``errors of judgment,'' but it has
absolved France of any responsibility for the killings. By Craig R.
Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   POLAND-AUSCHWITZ (Auschwitz) _ The adjacent camps of Auschwitz
and Birkenau have been at the center of repeated conflict in recent
years as divergent Polish and Jewish views of World War II have
clashed, envenomed by each people's sense of enormous _ even
incomparable _ loss. But the forthright recent anti-Jewish oratory
appears to mark an escalation in an atmosphere clouded by new
Polish fears of Jewish claims for restitution of property lost
during the war. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   NOVA-SCOTIA-ACQUIT (Toronto) _ The former premier of Nova Scotia
was acquitted Saturday of eight charges of rape, attempted rape and
indecent assault related to incidents that allegedly took place 40
years ago. The former Premier, Gerald Regan, now 70, led the
province's government from 1970 to 1978. He was also a member of
the federal Parliament and a Cabinet minister under Prime Minister
Pierre Trudeau. By Anthony DePalma.

</P>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA-SCANDAL (Oklahoma City) _ Far from the impeachment
battle engulfing the nation's capitol, Oklahoma's lieutenant
governor is discovering that the American Bible belt is hardly
immune to sex-fueled controversy. A divorce between Lt. Gov. Mary
Fallin, 43, and her estranged husband has eroded into accusations
of adultery that threaten to cripple her political future. The
attorney for Fallin's husband suggested in a Dec. 4 divorce hearing
that the lieutenant governor had had an affair with one of her
bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   ATHEIST-AUCTION (Austin, Texas) _ The deepest secrets and

USE OF DRUGS BY TEEN-AGERS DECLINES SOME, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After rising since the early 1990s, the use of marijuana and
other drugs by teen-agers may be ebbing, however modestly,
according to a new survey that is considered the most reliable
gauge of substance abuse among secondary school students.
</P>
<P>
   The annual survey of nearly 50,000 students around the country,
titled Monitoring the Future, was conducted at the Institute for
Social Research at the University of Michigan and released on
Friday. Though the levels of drug and alcohol use remain higher
than they were several years ago, the survey reported, all grades
that were studied showed a slight but often statistically
significant drop in overall drug use in the previous 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the institute's researchers found use of illicit
drugs declining only among eighth-graders. That trend continued
this year, and drug use declined slightly among 10th- and
12th-graders, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the best news we've had to bring the country
in some years,'' the principal researcher, Lloyd Johnston, said in
a telephone interview. ``Young people seem to be appreciating more
fully the dangers of various drugs, including alcohol and
cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming majority of adolescent drug use involves
marijuana, which remained widespread. This year, 49 percent of
12th-graders and 22 percent of eighth-graders sampled said that
they had tried marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of 12th-graders who smoked marijuana in the
previous month declined to 22.8 percent from 23.7 percent, while
the number of eighth-graders using it dropped to 9.7 percent from
10.2 percent. The decline in regular use was more noticeable among
10th-graders: 18.7 percent had smoked marijuana in the previous
month, compared with 20.5 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly are not back to levels at the beginning of the
'90s and it's too soon to trumpet victory,'' Johnston said, ``but
certainly it's very encouraging news that this upward trend has
finally begun to reverse.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of harder drugs, notably heroin and cocaine, remained
statistically small and appeared to level off or decline for most
groups surveyed. Among high school seniors, 2 percent acknowledged
experimenting with heroin, marginally down from 2.1 percent a year
ago. But 9.3 percent said they had tried cocaine at some point,
compared with 8.7 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about their use in the previous 30 days, 2.4 percent of
the seniors said they had snorted or smoked cocaine, compared with
2.3 percent a year ago. And 0.5 percent said they had used heroin
in the previous month, a statistic unchanged from last year.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol, primarily beer, remains the substance most frequently
abused by teen-agers, though even its use declined. Among
eighth-graders, 23 percent said they had drunk alcohol in the
previous month, compared with 24.5 percent last year. Among
10th-graders, monthly alcohol use dropped to 38.8 percent from 40.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But 8.2 percent of eighth-graders admitted getting drunk in the
previous month, a slight rise from the 8 percent who reported doing
so a year ago. Among high school seniors, 32.9 percent said they
had been drunk in the previous month, compared with 34.2 percent
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also showed tobacco use down slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston and his fellow researchers, Jerald Bachman and Patrick
O'Malley, attributed the changes in drug-seeking behavior to a
reassessment by teen-agers of the risks and to stronger expressions
of concern by parents and other adults.

   They were going to call it Desert Viper, but the second word had
to begin with an F. Desert Fiper? Generals do not like to sound
foolish.
</P>
<P>
   Well, what about Desert Ferret or Desert Flamingo? OK, maybe
those handles lack that certain something.
</P>
<P>
   But Desert Fox? That was the nickname of Erwin Rommel, the
fabled North African field marshal of Hitler's army.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon wanted to name the campaign against Iraq
desert-something-or-other to be consistent with names for other
operations in the Persian Gulf, like Desert Storm in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Desert Viper may have a ferocious ring, but under Pentagon
protocol, the military command planning the operation _ in this
case, the one based at McGill Air Force Base near Tampa, Fla. _ was
supposed to choose a name beginning with D or F.
</P>
<P>
   Enter a computer data base, known at the Pentagon, the world
capital of acronyms, as the Nicaa. (Don't even ask what that stands
for.) It decided that the second word should begin with an F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fiper'' is not in the dictionary, of course, and ``Desert
Fiper'' doesn't have the right ring. So high-level types at McGill
settled on fox. Eventually, Defense Secretary William Cohen
approved the name Desert Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Did anybody think of Rommel, who was portrayed by James Mason in
not one but two Hollywood films?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody,'' said Lt. Col. David Thurston, a spokesman for the
Joint Chiefs of Staff. ``That was not in the mix. I know that it's
been speculated on by various members of the media and others, but
that did not enter into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Schneier, president of the New York Board of Rabbis,
accepted that explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure the powers that be did not associate the name with
the Nazi general,'' he said. ``And as it happens, the choice could
be something positive, because in the aftermath of this campaign,
the term Desert Fox will no longer be associated with a Nazi
officer, but instead will be associated with a determined effort to
stop a mad dictator from acquiring weapons of mass destruction.''

SOCIAL INSECURITY: POOF! YOU CAN RETIRE RICH.

 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine you could save the Social Security system from
bankruptcy by raising every American's retirement check _ without
increasing taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the radical cure proposed by Martin Feldstein, a chief
economic adviser to President Ronald Reagan and a professor of
economics at Harvard University, who made his case earlier this
month at a conference sponsored by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees that the system needs to be fixed quickly,
because otherwise it will begin to run out of money early in the
next century as the baby-boom generation reaches retirement age.
But the obvious solutions _ reducing benefits, raising taxes and
postponing retirement _ are unappealing.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is privatization, which calls for part of the
current payroll tax to be steered into private retirement accounts
that would be invested in potentially high-yield stocks and bonds.
The income from these accounts could then ease the burden on the
existing Social Security system. But most privatization plans scare
politicians because they would expose retirees to the vagaries of
the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Feldstein, who proposes privatization with a clever twist.
His plan calls for keeping the existing Social Security system
intact. But he would also create private investment accounts for
all workers, equal to 2 percent of their Social Security earnings,
paid for with general government revenues. At retirement, workers
would hand over the accumulated balance in their accounts to an
investment or insurance company in exchange for a lifetime annuity:
a guaranteed annual income until death.
</P>
<P>
   Feldstein would pay for these private accounts by tapping about
a trillion dollars in projected federal surpluses over the next
decade. Also, workers would keep only 25 percent of the annual
income from their annuity. The balance would be returned to the
Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   The plan's major selling point is that workers come out ahead no
matter how poorly their investments fare. They will begin receiving
checks at retirement equal to the amount paid by the current system
plus 25 percent of the income from their retirement annuity. The
plan would thus sidestep the criticism of other privatization
plans, most of which rely on cutting benefits, raising taxes or
subjecting retirees to the risk that their checks will sink below
current levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan reflects the magic of compound interest,'' said Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas. (Gramm has proposed a similar idea.) Henry
Aaron and Robert Reischauer of the Brookings Institution have
called the plan ``imprudent,'' pointing to the large financial
risks and even larger political risks. Many of the House and Senate
onlookers at the session came away thinking more about magic than
imprudence, putting Feldstein's idea at the forefront of the
privatization debate.
</P>
<P>
   But do the numbers add up?
</P>
<P>
   According to the nonpartisan actuaries at the Social Security
Administration, the answer is sort of, kind of, maybe. In an
analysis completed this month, they concluded that the plan would
erase nearly all of the projected deficit using Feldstein's
optimistic assumptions about the profit that workers would earn on
their investment accounts and about the fees they would pay to
investment funds for administering their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But when the actuaries adopted more conservative assumptions _
estimates more in line with those of independent analysts _ the
Feldstein plan closes about two-thirds of the projected deficit.
Congress would need to close the remaining gap with tax hikes and
spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The actuarial report appears kind to Feldstein, but their
analysis also exposes the proposal's hidden pitfalls. The plan
would siphon trillions of dollars from the federal Treasury, money
that could otherwise have been used to pay off the federal debt. A
larger federal debt, in turn, requires the government to spend more
on interest payments. But Feldstein argues ``that there is no
chance that Congress would use those trillions to pay down the
debt.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Aaron and Reischauer point out, the money spent to
create private accounts is money that Congress can no longer spend
on other pressing needs _ including Medicare, whose financial
predicament is far more alarming.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also warn that if the projected surpluses disappear,
then the government would have made reckless promises to pay
pensions that it could no longer afford.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the issue of fairness. Feldstein maintains,
correctly, that virtually every retiree's income would rise under
his plan. But the increases would raise benefits more for high-wage
workers than for low-wage workers. Critics like Aaron and
Reischauer see no reason for Congress to risk increasing the
deficit decades into the future in the service of a plan that
primarily rewards the rich.
</P>
<P>
   For many critics, the most ominous threats are political.
Consider a middle-income worker 10 years after the plan takes hold.
He notes that 12 percent of his earnings are dedicated to a public
system that produces only a trickle at retirement. But the 2
percent of his earnings that go into his private investment account
grow at a gaudy 7 percent or more a year.
</P>
<P>
   The public account looks like a poor deal because, unlike the
private accounts, it is saddled with paying off the debt from the
early years of Social Security, when the system paid far more in
benefits than it collected from workers in taxes. But economists
note that if the private accounts paid their share of this debt
burden, they too would look like lousy investments.
</P>
<P>
   However misguided, many people will demand that more of their
payroll taxes go into the high-flying private accounts. But that
would whittle away at the public system _ the part of program that
makes disproportionately large payments to low-wage workers.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the decision about revamping Social Security depends
as much on politics as on economics. The country must decide how
much of its income it wants to transfer to retirees. Feldstein says
the elderly ought to collect more. Critics like Reischauer and
Aaron think that as the number of workers shrinks relative to the
number of retirees, as predicted, the work force can ill afford to
spend more. Once that question is resolved, the rest is financial
engineering.

early years of Social Security, when the system paid far more in
benefits than it collected from workers in taxes. But economists
note that if the private accounts paid their share of this debt
burden, they too would look like lousy investments.
</P>
<P>
   However misguided, many people will demand that more of their
payroll taxes go into the high-flying private accounts. But that
would whittle away at the public system _ the part of program that
makes disproportionately large payments to low-wage workers.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the decision about revamping Social Security depends
as much on politics as on economics. The country must decide how
much of its income it wants to transfer to retirees. Feldstein says
the elderly ought to collect more. Critics like Reischauer and
Aaron think that as the number of workers shrinks relative to the
number of retirees, as predicted, the work force can ill afford to
spend more. Once that question is resolved, the rest is financial
engineering.

   Sometimes past is prologue. As Iraqi officials in 1995 led U.N.
arms inspectors to a large cache of documents hidden on a chicken
farm near Baghdad, a red photograph album stood out. At first
glance, the album, like the half million pages of other papers in
the shed, seemed to cast light on Iraq's secret drive to obtain
germ, chemical and nuclear arms and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But closer scrutiny revealed huge gaps. The album's dozens of
pages, for instance, offered some insights into Iraq's germ
efforts. Photo after captioned photo showed not only flasks of
deadly agents like anthrax but animal test subjects small and
large, including sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the inspectors found that the album covered germ work only
through 1989 _ before Baghdad embarked on a crash program to turn
experimentation into weapons for the 1991 gulf war, in which it
deployed germ bombs and warheads at four sites, but did not use
them.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, something else was missing. The numbered pages were
interrupted where photos had been removed from the three-ring
binder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what was taken,'' one inspector said. ``My
guess? Pictures showing people'' central to building the arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Today, seven years after President Saddam Hussein promised to
come clean about his weapons of mass destruction, the book on Iraqi
arms is still full of holes.
</P>
<P>
   Military experts in Washington and at the United Nations say the
unanswered questions are serious and legion. Still unaccounted for
are hundreds of chemical arms, tons of nerve gas, more than 100
germ weapons and parts for up to four nuclear warheads, which are
said to lack only the uranium to fuel them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are vast areas of activity that are still unknown to
us,'' said Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on
Nuclear Arms Control in Washington and an expert on Iraq's arsenal.
``The uncertainties are so great that, as far as we know, Saddam
Hussein today could have both chemical and germ warfare agents in
warheads, ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Milhollin and his staff have prepared a list of some of the main
riddles about Iraq's unconventional weapons. Their chart, below, is
lengthy. Yet Milhollin and U.N. experts note that no such list can
be exhaustive. Given Iraq's evasiveness and defiance, its
stonewalling and lies, such listings can only suggest the depth of
the remaining questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not definitive,'' one inspector said of the chart,
adding that the goal was out of reach even of the U.N. and U.S.
intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for greater illumination are bleak, analysts say,
because of both the unknown consequences of the bombing that began
Wednesday and Baghdad's obstinacy. What evidence might have been
destroyed in the bombing was unknowable, but the inspection
process, most analysts agree, had all but collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Butler, chairman of the U.N. Special Commission in
charge of arms inspectors in Iraq, is more diplomatic. ``It must
regrettably be recorded again,'' he told the Security Council on
Tuesday, ``that the commission is not able to conduct the
substantive disarmament work mandated to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are potentially huge. Iraq has already confessed to
having made enough deadly microbes to kill all the people on Earth
several times over. And Saddam Hussein has used weapons of mass
destruction before.
</P>
<P>
   After losing the 1991 gulf war, Saddam, as a condition of
surrender, agreed to declare within 15 days all his nuclear,
chemical and biological arms and the missiles for delivering them,
and then to destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations set up a group to insure that he kept his
word. Until it verified destruction of the weapons, Iraq was barred
from selling oil. Later, the United Nations relented a bit and
allowed some oil exports to pay for food, medicine and war
reparations.
</P>
<P>
   To date, those sanctions have cost Iraq more than $120 billion.
Eager to escape them, Baghdad over the years has offered at least
five different ``full, final and complete'' disclosures, but the
U.N. officials have dismissed these as woefully incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   An example of Iraq's pale cooperation is demonstrated in the
1995 chicken-farm haul, which was one of the special commission's
greatest finds. While the documents were valuable, they had been
carefully culled and included nothing from the headquarters of the
Military Industrialization Corp. or the relevant archives of the
Ministry of Defense.
</P>
<P>
   Among the ugliest outstanding questions is whether Iraq tested
its germ weapons on people. Rumors and even some suggestive
photographs have come to light. But so far, there is neither proof
not admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the battle for truth about Iraq's armaments has been
crippled by diminishing returns.
</P>
<P>
   The latest round of inspections aimed at testing Iraq's
compliance with U.N. resolutions was an abject failure. In
interviews, inspectors told of astonishing Iraqi feints and what
one non-American inspector called a saga of ``lies and deception.''

   Mark Twain may well have said that history doesn't repeat
itself; it rhymes. Or maybe someone else did. In any event, in
early 1868, while awaiting publication of ``The Innocents Abroad,''
the 32-year-old writer found himself witness to a curious piece of
history that proves the point _ the first impeachment of a
president.
</P>
<P>
   Twain was working that winter as a journalist, filing dispatches
from Washington to newspapers around the country, when Andrew
Johnson's enemies in Congress finally found ammunition they thought
would remove the president from office.
</P>
<P>
   A Tennessee Democrat, President Johnson had been Lincoln's
running mate in 1864 on a ``National Union'' ticket but had run
afoul of the radical Republicans since succeeding Lincoln. He
fought them often over their efforts to harshly punish the South.
Congress repeatedly sought to strip him of power and radical
Republicans tried several times to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   The climactic battle came when the president fired his secretary
of war, Edwin M. Stanton, in the face of a law designed to give
Congress control over Cabinet officers' tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Twain's opinion of politicians in general wasn't high. ``The
political and commercial morals of the United States are not merely
food for laughter, they are an entire banquet,'' he once wrote.
Impeachment gave him a lot to dine out on.
</P>
<P>
   _ By MARC D. CHARNEY
</P>
<P>
   In the months before the Stanton crisis, the second attempt to
impeach the president on charges of misusing his power fizzled.
Twain responded with a mock obituary in a feature titled ``Mark
Twain's Letter'' in The Chicago Republican of Feb. 19. He cast
impeachment as a moribund patient and House Republicans, including
the radical Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania and the more moderate
John A. Bingham of Ohio, as nurses who had squabbled over whether
to let the patient die.
</P>
<P>
   Final Defeat of the Impeachment Project in the House
</P>
<P>
   DIED
</P>
<P>
   In this city, Feb. 13, at his lodgings in the chamber of the
House Reconstruction Committee, our beloved brother, IMPEACHMENT.
The malady of deceased was general debility. A short time ago his
health had improved so much that a bright hope cheered the land
that he would soon walk forth healthful and strong; but alas! we
know not what a day may bring forth. A great fear came upon his
physicians in the crisis of his disease. The weariness of watching
overpowered the nurses, so that they fell asleep and neglected him
_ and lo! a relapse! ...
</P>
<P>
   And so, these six, that were with Mrs. Bingham, being stronger
than they that were with Mrs. Stevens, called Thad, suffered not
the medicine to pass the lips of him that lay sick.
</P>
<P>
   And in the self-same hour he died.
</P>
<P>
   So endeth the second farce. The ancient school-boy phrase best
describes the position of the Congressional bodies in this matter:
``One's afraid and 't'other darsn't.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 21 President Johnson ignited the final impeachment
crisis by dismissing Stanton. On March 1, ``Mark Twain's Letter''
treated the event as a resurrection:
</P>
<P>
   LAZARUS IMPEACHMENT, COME FORTH!
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Feb. 24
</P>
<P>
   The past few days have been filled with startling interest. On
Friday the nation was electrified by the President's last and
boldest effort to dislodge Mr. Stanton. The wild excitement that
pervaded the capital that night, has not had its parallel here
since the murder of Mr. Lincoln. The air was thick with rumors of
dreadful import. Every tranquil brain, thrown from its balance by
the colossal surprise, magnified the creations of its crazed fancy
into the phantoms of anarchy, rebellion, bloody revolution! ...
</P>
<P>
   And out of the midst of the political gloom, impeachment, that
dead corpse, rose up and walked forth again! ...
</P>
<P>
   SCENE IN THE CAPITOL
</P>
<P>
   The next morning that one word, Impeachment, was upon every
tongue. ... Before 9 o'clock in the morning a multitude was
assembled in the Capitol grounds, and from all points of the
compass the clans were still gathering. ...
</P>
<P>
   The multitude of strangers were waiting for impeachment. They
did not know what impeachment was, exactly, but they had a general
idea that it would come in the form of an avalanche, or a thunder
clap, or that maybe the roof would fall in. Bye and bye a member
rose up solemnly, and every soul prepared to stand from under. But
it was a vain delusion _ he only had a speech to make about a
degraded cooking stove patent. The people were justly incensed. ...

   After an hour, Twain relates, Thaddeus Stevens rose to speak.
</P>
<P>
   All the faces were full of interest again in a moment. The
emaciated old man stood up and addressed the speaker ... and when
he finished, the profoundest stillness reigned in the House. Then
the one man upon whom all interest centered, read the resolutions
the multitude so longed to hear; and when he came to where it was
resolved that ``The President of the United States be impeached for
high crimes and misdemeanors,'' the prodigious words had something
so solemn and so awe-inspiring about them that the people seemed
inclined to think that the expected thunder-clap was about to crash
above the pictured ceiling! The strong lights and shadows, ... the
ghostly figure of the reader, the eager interest that marked the
sea of faces, the impressive silence and the historic grandeur of
the occasion, conspired to render the scene oe of the most striking
and dramatic that has ever been witnessed in the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Feb. 25.
</P>
<P>
   All day yesterday, the place was densely thronged; the people
wished to hear the all-important vote taken. ... They heard strong
speeches from the Republicans, and angry protests from the
Democrats _ but these latter were not confident in tone. The
Democrats had said, themselves, that the President had made an
ill-advised move and they felt that they were fighting for a lost
cause. The ``aye'' votes, in nearly all cases, came in a clear
voice, but many of the ``nays'' were inaudible in the reporters'
gallery.
</P>
<P>
   THE HUNTED CHIEF IN HIS CASTLE
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday was reception night at the White House and several of
us went there at 10 o'clock. I confess that I went out of a
thoughtless curiosity to see how the Chief Magistrate bore himself
under these untoward circumstances, but I did not enjoy the visit.
... He looked so like a plain, simple, goodnatured old farmer, that
it was hard to conceive that this was the imperious ``tyrant''
whose deeds had been stirring the sluggish blood of thirty millions

<P>
   After an hour, Twain relates, Thaddeus Stevens rose to speak.
</P>
<P>
   All the faces were full of interest again in a moment. The
emaciated old man stood up and addressed the speaker ... and when
he finished, the profoundest stillness reigned in the House. Then
the one man upon whom all interest centered, read the resolutions
the multitude so longed to hear; and when he came to where it was
resolved that ``The President of the United States be impeached for
high crimes and misdemeanors,'' the prodigious words had something
so solemn and so awe-inspiring about them that the people seemed
inclined to think that the expected thunder-clap was about to crash
above the pictured ceiling! The strong lights and shadows, ... the
ghostly figure of the reader, the eager interest that marked the
sea of faces, the impressive silence and the historic grandeur of
the occasion, conspired to render the scene oe of the most striking
and dramatic that has ever been witnessed in the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Feb. 25.
</P>
<P>
   All day yesterday, the place was densely thronged; the people
wished to hear the all-important vote taken. ... They heard strong
speeches from the Republicans, and angry protests from the
Democrats _ but these latter were not confident in tone. The
Democrats had said, themselves, that the President had made an
ill-advised move and they felt that they were fighting for a lost
cause. The ``aye'' votes, in nearly all cases, came in a clear
voice, but many of the ``nays'' were inaudible in the reporters'
gallery.
</P>
<P>
   THE HUNTED CHIEF IN HIS CASTLE
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday was reception night at the White House and several of
us went there at 10 o'clock. I confess that I went out of a
thoughtless curiosity to see how the Chief Magistrate bore himself
under these untoward circumstances, but I did not enjoy the visit.
... He looked so like a plain, simple, goodnatured old farmer, that
it was hard to conceive that this was the imperious ``tyrant''
whose deeds had been stirring the sluggish blood of thirty millions
of people. He was uneasy and restless; the smile that came and went
upon his face had distress in it; when he shook hands with a guest
he looked wistfully into the person's face, as if he sought a
friendly interest there, and yet hardly hoped to find it; he seemed
humbled _ the expression of his countenance could be made to
signify nothing else; when he ceased to smile for a moment, the

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Republican drive to impeach President
Clinton, in the face of considerable evidence that the American
public is firmly in Clinton's corner, would appear to be either
astonishingly principled or stunningly ill-advised. It is hard to
recall a moment in the nation's history when Congress so completely
defied public sentiment, disregarding warnings about the political
repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   But should the sight of the Republicans in the 105th Congress
rallying around impeachment really have come as a surprise? The
merits of the case against Clinton aside _ even many Democrats
acknowledge that most Republicans are acting out of genuine
conviction _ the outcome suddenly seems almost inevitable, given
the political dynamics that rule this city today (and despite all
those shrewd predictions to the contrary just a few weeks ago).
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the polls invoked by Democrats in arguing against
impeachment, and by pundits in predicting that it never would
happen, obscured rather than illuminated what was taking place on
Capitol Hill as the lawmakers began to cast their votes on
impeachment. The polls failed to account for the forces that shaped
the president's catastrophic week: the depth of Republican anger at
Clinton, the tepidness of the nation's support for him and, most of
all, the fact that when it comes to Congress, all politics really
is local.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the polls. There is a huge gap between the public and
congressional Republicans in their views both of Clinton and the
penalty he should pay for his attempts to cover up his liaison with
Monica Lewinsky. The public has been unwavering in its opposition
to impeachment _ two-thirds oppose it, according to the most recent
New York Times/CBS Poll, completed Thursday night. Clinton's
approval rating remains as robust as ever, and the public's view of
Republicans is as low as it's been in the 14 years that the
Times/CBS Poll has been asking the question.
</P>
<P>
   But these are national polls, and when it comes to the actual
districts that members of Congress represent, and where they have
to run, opinions about Clinton can be quite different.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you actually break it down, probably 180 Republican
districts _ 180 out of 228 _ are solidly Republican districts, and
they would be solidly anti-Clinton districts,'' said Rep. Peter
King, R-N.Y., who advocated censure instead of impeachment. ``In
those 180 districts, there's no damage in voting for impeachment.
In fact, it would be very popular.''
</P>
<P>
   David Moore, the managing editor of the Gallup Poll, said his
polls consistently found a sharp partisan division on impeachment:
Republicans, particularly conservative ones, and the people most
likely to actually vote, were the most vigorous advocates of
Clinton's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   That district-by-district variance with national sentiment
offers an explanation for the reaction of some Republican House
members to the notion they were defying public opinion. ``Please
don't let anyone suggest that public opinion wasn't weighed in the
final decision,'' said Rep. Sherwood Boehlert of New York, one of
the last of the moderate Republicans to come out in favor of
impeachment. ``I certainly gave public opinion from the people I
represent thought and consideration. But what do you do when public
opinion is evenly divided, give or take a few points? We do what we
were elected to do. Deliberate. Consult. Consider. Vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, for the Republicans who considered their decision
in purely political terms _ not something that anyone was publicly
admitting last week _ the case for impeachment was even more
compelling. Republicans who voted against impeachment were
explicitly defying the position of the congressional leadership.
They were inviting retribution from the domineering right wing of
the Republican party: a primary challenger in two years or a drying
up of campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   And this Democratic president was particularly ill-equipped to
counter those pressures. Clinton has throughout his career done
better with voters than with legislators, and he has had especially
bad relations with Congress. There are many Republicans in this
Congress, which has always been fiercely partisan, who think
Clinton has simply been caught doing before a grand jury what he
has been doing to Congress and the public for years. The Judiciary
Committee portrait of the president as fundamentally dishonest
simply gave legal force to their own view of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a deep animosity to Clinton,'' said the Rev. Robert
Drinan, a former Democratic congressman from Massachusetts who is a
law professor at Georgetown University. ``And more and more I think
it's cultural. These people say that Clinton is responsible for
abortion and homosexuality. They just dump on him.''
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse for Clinton, his own support seems, while
broad, perfunctory. There is no evidence of a fervor that may have
made Republicans think twice. ``They are firm in their view that he
should not go,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research
Center for People and the Press. ``But I do not think they are
emotionally involved with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowell Weicker, the former Connecticut senator who was one of
the first Republicans in 1974 to urge the impeachment of Richard M.
Nixon, and who supports Clinton's impeachment, said the president's
position in the polls was a testimony more to the way women and
minorities viewed the Republican Party than to Clinton himself.
``If you are women, if you are a minority, why would you want to
kick out a man that you perceive as your friend and put yourself in
the hands of a political party governed by the religious right?''
Weicker said.

   In this context, these countervailing forces _ House Republicans
on one hand and public sentiment on the other _ have produced a
political climate here that is very different from the one that
prevailed the last time impeachment proceedings were moving against
a president. By the summer of 1974, when the House Judiciary
Committee voted to recommend the impeachment of Nixon, the public
decisively supported that course of action. It was a bipartisan
removal; Republicans and Democrats alike had urged Nixon's
impeachment (in contrast to the more partisan impeachment of Andrew
Johnson in 1868).
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of that, when the House Judiciary Committee voted
for impeachment, and Nixon resigned, the country came together,''
said Kurt Lang, a political science professor who, with his wife,
Gladys Engel, wrote ``The Battle for Public Opinion'' (Columbia
University Press, 1983), examining the interplay of public opinion
and Watergate. ``Everybody felt good. There was real euphoria.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this instance, impeachment is unlikely to have the same
positive reaction. And it is likely to feed the cynicism of the
public, with regard to congressional behavior in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Elizabeth Holtzman, D-N.Y., who as a member of the
House Judiciary Committee voted to recommend Nixon's impeachment,
said the critical difference between now and then _ the absence of
public support for the removal of a president _ should give the
Republicans pause. ``Public sentiment is crucial in so far that you
really need public acceptance to go forward with the removal of the
president of the United States _ because of the disruption that's
entailed, and the ultimate trial,'' Ms. Holtzman said. ``You need
to have public support.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have heard all this for weeks. They have
responded by saying they were sent here to vote their principles.
``We can not govern this country by polls,'' Rep. Ed Bryant,
R-Tenn., said from the House floor on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant is not alone among Republicans in making that argument
(it is not exactly a new debate in Washington) and several
Republicans have predicted that public opinion will soon follow
them. Lawmakers have defied the polls before and survived the next
election as public views changed.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps by the end of this process, the Republicans will succeed
in convincing the American public that Clinton truly deserves to be
removed from office for his misdeeds, and that this was not a
partisan assassination orchestrated by the Republican Party against
a popular president.
</P>
<P>
   But as lawmakers prepared to adjourn and head home for the
holidays, there was no sign of that happening any time soon.

   JERUSALEM _ In city streets and in their living rooms Israelis
are awash in American popular culture. McDonald's restaurants,
Tower Records stores and Blockbuster Video shops dot the urban
landscape, and MTV and ``Seinfeld'' reruns are on cable television.

   But the Israeli Parliament is trying to turn the cultural tide.

   In a vote last month, lawmakers gave initial approval to a bill
that would require that half the songs on national radio stations

crossed party lines, was the first of three votes necessary for
passage, and the bill seems assured of final approval.

   ``We are putting up a protective wall against the flood of
foreign culture'' said Yona Yahav, a sponsor of the bill from the
opposition Labor Party. ``The country is 50 years old. Its culture
has yet to be formed, and we thought it should be protected.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill reflects the struggle here to mold the image of a
country whose culture is a work in progress. The legislation is
proceeding as cable television, the Internet and an increasingly
privatized economy are connecting Israelis more than ever to the
rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis listen avidly to American popular music, and
Israeli music itself is a melange of East and West, with heavy
Middle Eastern and Mediterranean influences that mix with
American-style rock. Immigrant groups like Russians and Ethiopians
listen to their own ethnic music.
</P>
<P>
   The two national, and most popular, radio networks, the Voice of
Israel and Army Radio, play foreign and Israeli songs. A host of
niche stations that have sprung up specialize in areas like
religious music or Arabic-style tunes by Sephardic Jewish singers.
</P>
<P>
   Yahav says his legislation is intended to promote original work
by Israelis and to counter the influence of foreign music on
teen-agers, many of whom are avid viewers of MTV.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're part of the global village, and the minute you bring up
the younger generation to listen only to foreign music the youth
won't have any relationship to Israeli music,'' Yahav said. ``Part
of the essence of setting up an independent state was to establish
our own culture here. The bill is a cultural statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing similar legislation in France, where 40 percent of the
songs on the radio have to be in French, Shaikeh Levy, chairman of
the Israel Union of Performing Artists, said his group had pushed
for the bill partly to help the music industry. Demand for Hebrew
songs is rising, Levy said, and there is a need to preserve Israeli
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Americanization in Israel,'' Levy said. ``We want to
prevent our culture from getting lost among others and we want to
encourage local productions.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the bill see it as a hopeless effort to legislate
cultural tastes.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Thank God Israeli culture is still unformed, and God save us
from a situation in which laws will mold culture,'' said Michael
Handelzalts, a former culture editor at the newspaper Haaretz who
now edits its book-review supplement. ``Frightened countries build
protective walls. It's provincial and stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   A prominent Israeli songwriter, Ehud Manor, said exposure to
foreign influences had enriched Israeli music. ``Israeli pop music
is not autonomous,'' he said. ``It is affected by what is happening
in the world, and I see that as a blessing. Trying to prevent
developments in the world from entering our cultural bloodstream is
a lost cause, and it will only spoil what is a natural process.''
</P>
<P>
   But the proposed requirement to broadcast Hebrew-language music
on the radio would not help artists who perform in languages like
Arabic, Yiddish or English. And the national networks have
responded in recent years to the demand for Israeli music. On Army
Radio, 60 percent of the songs are in Hebrew, and the Voice of
Israel has devoted one station entirely to Hebrew music.
</P>
<P>
   The Association for Civil Rights in Israel has criticized the
bill for Hebrew songs as infringing on the free speech guaranteed
under Israeli law. ``In matters of freedom of artistic expression
it is improper to intervene through legislation,'' said a lawyer
for the association, Anat Scolnicov.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to requiring Hebrew songs on national stations the
bill stipulates that licenses should be given to new local stations
``whose aim is to promote Israeli works and songs in the Hebrew
language.''
</P>
<P>
   The director of programming at Israel Radio, which specializes
in Hebrew songs, Menachem Granit, said he was against imposing such
music on other stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all for foreign influence,'' Granit said. ``We can't stay
shut up in our own little world. We're living in the 20th
century.''

<P>
   As holiday shoppers clogged the thoroughfares last week,
clutching glossy bags emblazoned with status names, one 59-year-old
lawyer confided her innermost feeling: guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a great year,'' said the woman, who worried that if she
gave her name, her clients would think they had paid her too much.
``In past years, I always went to Toys ``R'' Us and bought my
grandson some cheap thing. This year, I'm heading to F.A.O. Schwarz
and buying him one of those expensive motorized Legos. I don't care
how much it costs. And my daughter-in-law. She asked for a Polartec
robe. Well, I'm getting her cashmere! Then I'm going to Tiffany's
and buy my son Limoges.''
</P>
<P>
   How does she sound to you? Normal? Stressed? Over the edge? It
all depends on who's sizing up the situation. Psychiatrists who
specialize in ``shopping disorders'' might say she's at risk.
</P>
<P>
   A shopping disorder? That's when people spend more than they
should, for reasons they shouldn't. They are not the regular stripe
of holiday shoppers caught up in the wretched excesses of the
season. These problem consumers are engaged in compulsive shopping,
competitive shopping and revenge shopping (spending a loved one's
money to exact punishment, which may be seen as an indication of
caring).
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say these feelings, which reflect deeper psychological
disturbances, may intensify around Christmas, when people are
inundated with subtle and not-so-subtle messages to spend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The holidays are particularly difficult for some patients
because these ritualistic events resonate with memories of festive
and happy times,'' explained Dr. David Krueger, a Houston
psychiatrist who wrote a book called ``Emotional Business: The
Meanings of Work, Money and Success'' (Slawson Communications,
1992), which focuses on the way people handle money.
</P>
<P>
   Some people shop to compensate for feelings of intense
loneliness, Krueger said. ``Shopping becomes a proxy,'' he said,
but the the thrill doesn't last that long. ``It's like treating
appendicitis with morphine. It doesn't resolve the conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Belgray, the director of the Jewish Association for
Counseling and Psychotherapy in New York City, says patients seek
him out when ``they're to the point where they're in pain _ and the
charge cards are up to their limits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people want to get the most, give the most, get the
biggest present, give the biggest present,'' said Dr. Gail Saltz, a
clinical instructor in psychiatry at New York Hospital-Cornell
Medical Center in Manhattan. ``It's natural to want to say: `I love
you. You love me. Here's something special I picked out for you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's when you get carried away,'' she said. ``Then a lot of
resentment can build up. You've spent too much. And in your mind,
the people you gave the holiday presents to didn't pay you back
emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does anyone know if a loved one is a compulsive holiday
shopper, heading straight for a new year full of anger, resentment
and remorse?
</P>
<P>
   Krueger gives his patients a self-help quiz:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Do you go shopping to escape feeling bored, empty, angry or
scared?''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Do you use shopping or spending in a way that creates
conflicts for you, or between you and others?''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Do you buy things with your credit cards that you wouldn't
buy if you had the cash?''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``When you shop or make a purchase, does your mood change _ do
you feel euphoric or anxious?''
</P>
<P>
   (If the answer is yes to any of the questions, he writes,
patients could be using shopping as a way to regulate their
self-esteem. Not good.)
</P>
<P>
   Another hint from Krueger: If a shopper starts to feel that her
favorite salesclerk is her only friend, she might also be in real
trouble. Another psychiatrist, Dr. Mark Sehl, the director of the
Psychology Information Center in New York City, said a danger
signal was ``somebody bragging about how much they've spent and
then asking aloud: `Why did I buy that?'''
</P>
<P>
   Out of control? Sometimes it may not be your fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mother comes in to complain about her grown son, who's
been running her credit cards up to the limit,'' Belgray said.
``It's our job to separate who's the adult. Why does the adult
child have use of the parents' credit cards?''
</P>
<P>
   For those who simply want to curb their spending, Sehl
recommends that they pay attention to their mood when buying for
themselves or others. ``Check the impulse. Write it down on a piece
of paper after you either buy or don't buy. If you're not in
therapy, it could be therapeutic.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, if you bought a gift for all the wrong reasons,
there is another solution. You can always return it.
</P>
<P>
   What about the lawyer who felt so bad about years of being
cheap?
</P>
<P>
   ``She's trying to atone,'' said Sehl, who said he would need to
see if her spending patterns repeated. ``If she only does it one
year, she actually can atone. But if she keeps depriving, atoning,
depriving, atoning, then she probably has a problem.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As they consider the uncharted waters of the
impeachment trial of a modern president, senators are uncertain
about what lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Some think they could be in for a long ordeal on the Senate
floor that could last until next summer or even longer.
</P>
<P>
   Others think that President Clinton and the Senate would quickly
cut a deal in January and short-circuit a trial before it got
started in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Still others expect something in between _ a procedure short of
a full trial, that would last for some weeks but would then be
shelved.
</P>
<P>
   But all the senators and staff experts interviewed last week
agreed on an essential point: Unless unanticipated, damaging new
evidence against the president arises, the Senate would never
muster the two-thirds majority necessary to convict him and remove
him from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that there are not 67 votes against
him,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, one of the president's most
ardent Republican opponents but also a senator who usually has a
sure sense of where his colleagues stand.
</P>
<P>
   Another point to remember is that although it takes a two-thirds
majority to remove a president from office, a trial can be stopped
before it begins or at any time after it starts by a simple
majority vote of the senators. The Senate will have 55 Republicans
and 45 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, no one knows what may develop. There is no
reference book that spells out what an impeachment trial in 1999
would look like. There is no staff expert who has mastered all the
legal and political nuances.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the Senate has been out of session for two
months _ the senators scattered around the country _ so there has
not been the give and take necessary to reach political consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, the Republican leader, insists that he has made
no plans for how the Senate would proceed, and there is no evidence
to the contrary. Lott, who has stayed in Mississippi during the
House deliberations, said he did not want to appear presumptuous
while the matter was before the House.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott has said that he has no plans to call the Senate back
into session this year. And he leaves no doubt that he expects an
impeachment trial next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate will do its constitutional duty,'' he said last
week on CNN. ``We will go to a trial, and there won't be any
deal-making as we begin our job in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lott hinted that at some point after a trial began, the
Senate might decide to stop it. ``There are a number of votes on
procedures that may be demanded along the way, and we'll have to
work the will of the Senate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The best guess is that on Jan. 6, when the 106th Congress
convenes, the Senate would pass a resolution stating that it is
prepared to receive the articles of impeachment and the House
managers, as the small group of representatives selected to act as
official prosecutors of the case are called.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 7, if the schedule held, the managers would walk across
the Capitol to the Senate and read the articles on the Senate
floor. That day or the next, Chief Justice William Rehnquist would
be sworn in to preside over the trial, as the Constitution
requires. (The founding fathers realized that it would be a
conflict of interest to have the vice president, who also serves as
president of the Senate, manage the impeachment trial of a
president.)
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist's oath would probably be administered by Sen. Strom
Thurmond of South Carolina, the president pro tem. The chief
justice would then swear in the 100 senators as jurors in the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the Senate would vote to notify Clinton formally that the
proceedings had begun, and a schedule would be set. The president
would probably get a month or more to file a written response to
the impeachment charges, and the House would get time to prepare
its reply.
</P>
<P>
   During this hiatus the negotiations over a deal would begin.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is that the Senate would agree to stop the trial
in return for the president's acceptance of a stiff censure. A
trial could also end quickly if Clinton decided not to present a
defense at all _ like a defendant in a trial so confident of
victory that he rests his case without calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, is one who thinks that is the most
likely outcome. He explained: ``If I were the president, I would
want to get this thing over with as soon as you can. He knows there
are not 67 votes there. I don't know anybody who would argue
there's a chance to have 67 votes at this point. But who knows what
else might come up if he got into a trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm agreed with that assessment. ``Why would he want to have
an extended trial?'' Gramm asked. ``From his point of view, this is
all about damage control.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., said he thought that script was
unlikely. ``I think it goes nine innings, meaning we have a
long-drawn-out process,'' he said. Many other Democrats and some
Republicans agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the middle ground, Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, said he
expected the Senate to begin operating on two tracks, dealing with
legislation in the afternoon and with the trial either in the
morning or in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after ``a sufficiently legitimate period of time,''
Bennett said, the Senate could vote to end the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate can't just pass a motion right up front to stop the
trial,'' he said. ``That would be a terrible slap in the face of
the House institutionally. So we need to put some time in. If they
have gone through the seriousness of voting impeachment, we should
go through the seriousness of having a trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if after a while, we can say we have sifted through the
issues and have decided to suspend the trial, then there's
face-saving all around. The House can live with it. The president
can live with it. And we look like statesmen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the top Democrat on the Judiciary
Committee, has had his legal staff research impeachment issues and
has decided that the rules would require the new House that takes
office next month to vote to reappoint the managers who would
present the case to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy said it was possible that the new House, with a smaller
Republican majority than the current one, would vote against naming
managers. That would end the case, because there would be no
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Leahy said, ``we are in for a long, long, long
trial.''

</P>
<P>
   If there is a full-scale trial, it would bear no resemblance to
anything anyone alive has ever seen. It would be part legal and
part political, governed partly by arcane Senate rules that were
created for the trial of President Andrew Johnson in 1868 and
partly by rules of law.
</P>
<P>
   In all of American history, there have been only 13 such trials
and only seven convictions, all of federal judges. Johnson's trial
130 years ago was the only one of a president.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, the trial would be like one in a courtroom.
There would be opening statements, presentation of witnesses and
evidence by both sides, cross-examinations, rebuttals and closing
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Potential witnesses like Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp would
testify under oath, in public, presumably on television, no matter
how distasteful and embarrassing their testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The House would hire professional prosecutors and the president
would hire defense lawyers to question witnesses and argue their
cases. Because an impeachment trial would be part of the
president's official duties, his legal fees would be paid by the
government.
</P>
<P>
   But other elements would be quite different from a courtroom
trial. The senators, sitting as jurors, would be the judges not
just of facts but also of law. By majority vote, they could
overrule decisions of Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   In most impeachment cases, the rules allow the Senate to choose
a 12-member committee to hear evidence, sparing most senators from
the tedium of a trial. But Senate history makes clear that the
authority is not to be delegated in the trial of a president.
</P>
<P>
   The senators, who in normal circumstances think nothing of
talking for hours on the most routine matters, would not be
permitted to speak in public session during the trial. To question
a witness, they could pass a note to the chief justice, who would
pose the question.
</P>
<P>
   All the senators' deliberations would be in closed session with
no personal staff members or reporters present. And their time for
speaking in those sessions would be strictly limited _ 10 minutes
maximum for each senator on preliminary motions and 15 minutes on
the final verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference from a courtroom trial would be that the
verdict would not be based primarily on facts or law. Some senators
would doubtless decide on the basis of politics, others on their
personal judgment of what would be best for the country.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said he was in
this last category. He had no doubt, he said, that lying to a grand
jury, the first charge against Clinton, was an impeachable offense
that could justify removal from office. But he said he might not
vote that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to what is in the best interest of the American
people,'' Hatch said. ``Should we really throw the president out of
office for this kind of prevarication? I don't know. It's not an
easy question to answer. It's one I'm struggling with.''

SNAGS CONTINUE TO DELAY SCHOOL AIR CONDITIONING IN LOS ANGELES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- With the fast-track installation of air
conditioning now stalled in court, Los Angeles school district
officials are considering hiring individual contractors to do the
work -- a method critics said has resulted in slow and shoddy work
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The district had hoped to have a single consortium of companies,
led by Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric, complete the 150-school, $155
million job.
</P>
<P>
   But that plan now faces a court challenge, potentially tying up
the program until after a March 26 hearing. Rather than delay and
let students swelter through another summer, several Board of
Education members said it may make more sense to hire separate
companies to begin the second phase of installation at 58 schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the preference,'' board President Victoria
Castro said Friday. ``We don't want to wait until March.''
</P>
<P>
   The consortium would possibly be retained for the project's
third phase, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of using independent contractors strikes others as
an immense step backward. It was slipshod work by some contractors
on the first round of air-conditioning projects that drove board
members to give the job to the consortium, critics said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's where we started. It was unacceptable then, and it's
unacceptable now,'' said Steven Soboroff, chairman of the
Proposition BB Oversight Committee, which pushed for the fast-track
process. Voters approved the $2.4 billion bond measure in 1997 to
fund renovations at the district's aging schools.
</P>
<P>
   Soboroff said that regardless of the legal questions, the Los
Angeles Unified School District should go ahead and sign the
contract hammered out with the consortium to start work
immediately. A spokeswoman for one of the consortium companies,
PG&AMP;E Energy Services, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in fact willing to sign the agreement, as currently
drafted, tomorrow if the district is willing to move forward with
it,'' said spokeswoman Diane Sable.
</P>
<P>
   But district officials counter that should the judge rule
against them, schools would be left with half-finished
air-conditioning systems as summer approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Board members initially picked the consortium for the $155
million job in July, but did not sign a contract, waiting instead
for a judge to rule on the legality of the way the consortium was
selected. Although the district had discussed the project with
several firms, it bypassed the regular bidding process to save
time.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, led a longtime district contractor, the H.A.
Nichols Construction Co., to challenge the selection process in
court.
</P>
<P>
   Board members point out that both possibilities have potential
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The district relied on individual contractors for the initial
round of air-conditioning work, and in the project's first 15
months, systems were installed in just 16 of the 150 schools
targeted. That phase of installation is now about 80 percent
complete.
</P>
<P>
   District spokesman Eric Nasarenko said if officials choose to go
with individual contractors again, they would avoid some of the
mistakes that happened last time. For example, the district would
likely buy the needed air-conditioning units up front and warehouse
them to make sure there were no delays in getting them to
individual schools, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, board member David Tokofsky said he worried about the
potential speed and quality of the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's been stated to me that if the district takes on the
work, the students would have air conditioning before the Fourth of
July,'' said member David Tokofsky.
</P>
<P>
   If district officials sign a contract with the consortium to
begin the work, they risk having to stop in midstream if a judge
eventually rules against them in the court case. They would then
have to place the half-finished projects out to bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything would stop for six or eight weeks again while we
went out to bid,'' said board member Valerie Fields. ``It would be
a shame to give up on (the fast-track concept) -- I like the idea
-- but we've got to look at this unemotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Soboroff, however, argued that even such a worst-case scenario
carries little potential danger for the district. If the projects
were put back out to bid after the consortium already had ordered
equipment and started work, the consortium would logically be the
lowest bidder to complete installation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the risk to the district?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Board members said they hope to reach a decision on how to
proceed before the end of the year.

   (ITALICS ON)``It just makes sense to me. If I was a patient,
this is what I would want.'' -- Mitch Leichter, director of
recreational therapy for Sherman Oaks Hospital and Health
Center.(ITALICS OFF)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LOS ANGELES -- Me, too. Although I think I'd trade in the classical
music for some Sinatra, and the flutist for a sax player.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from that, everything else in Mitch Leichter's magical rec
room is exactly what you'd want if you were a hospital patient in
recovery trying to keep your mind off the pain and hospital food.
</P>
<P>
   Saltwater aquariums with beautiful fish swimming around,
cascading waterfall fountains, soft classical music playing in the
background, and special aromas filling your nostrils to help take
your mind a thousand miles away from your ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Add a strolling violinist, flutist, Zen garden and some pets.
Even some kids from nearby Notre Dame High School stop by after
school to visit. With any luck, Leichter said, they'll remind some
of the elderly patients in recovery of their grandkids and help put
their minds in a good, warm place.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, it's all there in Mitch Leichter's magical rec room -- all
except the standard hospital recreational stuff, like bingo, and
arts and crafts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not feeling well, the last thing you want is someone
bouncing into your room like a cheerleader and telling you it's
time for bingo,'' Leichter said. ``This isn't a cruise ship.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it's the transitional care unit at Sherman Oaks Hospital and
Health Center in suburban Sherman Oaks, Calif., where patients are
recovering from surgeries, hip replacements, pneumonia, respiratory
problems, you name it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first people they meet waking up is Leichter, who
walks in their room for a quick assessment. He doesn't carry a
notebook or a clipboard, just the gift of gab.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gently schmooze with them a little, ask them how they like
to spend their day and go from there,'' he said. ``A lot of them
are hurting and don't want to work hard at anything right now, so
you come up with a soft stimuli, something they can ease into.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to make it like taking them back to the favorite room
in their house. You don't feel compelled to do anything there, the
room does it for you.''
</P>
<P>
   For patients who miss their pets, Leichter brings in puppies and
kittens for them to hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty minutes of petting and stroking a puppy is 20 minutes
less they're thinking about and dealing with the pain,'' Leichter
said. ``It's a great diversion.''
</P>
<P>
   For people who love music, a violinist and flutist &UR;  &LR; come in a
few times a week and stroll the hallways of the facility in
Southern California's San Fernando Valley. Over the speakers, soft
classical music continually plays, as patients read the newspaper
or a book in front of cascading waterfalls.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular form of this environmental therapy, as it's
called, is aromatherapy -- the smells and senses that bring back
better times than now. The smells of flower gardens, apple pies
baking in the stove, pine needles in the forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aromas allow the patients to reminisce and give them
smells other than hospital smells,'' he said. ``It gets their mind
off why they're here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way most patients describe it to me is like closing their
eyes and flying. And that's what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   From all the positive feedback, Joan Jessop, the hospital's
director of patient care, has been getting over Leichter's
environmental therapy, that's exactly what patients want in
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   To close their eyes and fly, but not on medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have patients who have been in surgery before who will
request aromatherapy in their recovery room, and go off the
medication,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been amazing to see, the power smells, music and pets
have on the minds and bodies of these patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day, we had two 8-week-old puppies in, and an
elderly woman begged us to take them into her husband's recovery
room. He was having a tough time after surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have seen them. They each had a puppy cuddled under
one arm and were lying together in the bed, smiling and playing
with the puppies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get any better therapy than that,'' Jessop said.
``The patients love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, because it makes sense and beats the heck out of bingo.

AFTER ANXIOUS YEAR, YOUNG LEUKEMIA SUFFERER BATTLES BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Editors: Childrens Hospital Los Angeles in 7th graf is the
facility's correct name.) 
BY YVETTE CABRERA  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The candle Alejandra Navarro lighted when she
learned her firstborn had leukemia still flickers in her kitchen,
even though her desperate prayers for a cure have been answered.
</P>
<P>
   It's been one year since Amador Navarro, now 7, was transfused
with a lifesaving bone marrow transplant from an anonymous donor.
The search for a bone marrow match was arduous because there are so
few minorities registered to donate. For Amador, who is Latino, the
chances were one in a million.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to the transplant, not only will Amador have a chance
at the life that he dreams of, he is an example to others. Today,
chubby-cheeked Amador and his family will host a bone marrow drive
in their parish to encourage others to register as bone marrow
donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to live a happy life because I left the hospital,
and now I'm healthy,'' said Amador, who now wants to be a computer
technician when he grows up.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, Amador's completely cured,'' said Alejandra Navarro,
34. ``When we were searching for the bone marrow match it was an
eternity. Time passed by very slowly, but this year passed by
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Navarros, the hope that they would one day be able to
personally thank and meet the New Mexico woman who donated her bone
marrow to Amador may finally come true. The two families spoke last
week and are making plans to meet in Los Angeles this January.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a bout with graft-vs.-host disease, when the bone marrow
cells attack the body, Amador responded extremely well to the
transplant, said his doctor, Ken Weinberg of Childrens Hospital Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting to one year is a crucial milestone,'' Weinberg said as
he examined Amador last week at the hospital. ``It means you got
through the hardest part (of it).''
</P>
<P>
   ``It also means that as time goes by the chance of getting the
leukemia goes down and the chance of becoming cured goes up.'' said
Weinberg.
</P>
<P>
   Leukemia has recurred in patients seven or eight years after a
bone marrow transplant, so Weinberg said it will be another year
before he'll feel confident that Amador is safely out of harm's
way.
</P>
<P>
   Alejandra Navarro, meanwhile, said she will keep the flame
lighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me it's a tradition,'' she said. ``I got the candle for
him and I'll keep it lighted as long as I can whether he's healthy
or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Where once Amador used to tell his mother that God was going to
``take him away,'' Amador now says he's cured.
</P>
<P>
   He still remembers the painful shots during his hospital stay
last winter, but he also remembers the good friends he made, like
his primary nurse, Dawn Landery, of Childrens Hospital's bone
marrow unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dawn took care of me and would play Nintendo with me,'' said
Amador. ``And I would beat her.''
</P>
<P>
   In Alejandra's eyes, Amador is like a normal 7-year-old now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's happier, has more energy, gets tired less easily,'' said
Alejandra Navarro.
</P>
<P>
   Amador gained almost 15 pounds this year, due to the medications
he took which increase appetite. But the hours that he spends
outside his apartment playing soccer should remedy that, said his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   The only complication Amador had was a rash due to the
graft-vs.-host disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're in the same place next year in terms of the leukemia
not coming back then things are really going our way,'' said
Weinberg.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he gave Amador the green light to return to school in
January, where he will enroll in the first grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a chance that 1999 will be a lot easier year
than 1998,'' Weinberg told the Navarros. ``Hopefully the hard part
is behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the battle is behind them, the Navarros want to
encourage others to attend bone marrow drives so that children like
Amador are given a second chance at life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be an example to others to show that transplants
are successful,'' said Alejandra Navarro. ``We want to be there (at
the drive) so people can see that if the community collaborates
that it can be done.''

SWISS FEAR INFILTRATION BY RUSSIAN UNDESIRABLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Since the fall of communism, rich Russians have
frequented this country's ski slopes and luxury boutiques, welcomed
as free-spending guests but otherwise attracting little notice.
</P>
<P>
   But two recent events have begun to focus Swiss attention on
whether this banking redoubt is becoming a prime place to stow
ill-gotten cash from the former Soviet Union and a comfortable
haven for rich Russian undesirables. This month authorities
detained a former Ukrainian prime minister who entered Switzerland
on a Panamanian passport, and they tried a Russian accused as a
Moscow mob kingpin.
</P>
<P>
   Geneva prosecutors tried Sergei Mikhailov, reputed boss of a
major Moscow mafia family, on charges that he belonged to a
criminal organization. By Swiss standards the eight-day affair was
high-profile, complete with bulletproof vests in court. A former
FBI agent testified that Mikhailov was not the businessman he said
he was, but instead associated with a mafia group that had also
infiltrated the United States.
</P>
<P>
   What was even more disconcerting to some was the fact that
Mikhailov, 40, had settled quietly in a village outside Geneva. He
was living with his wife and two young daughters, and had gone
unnoticed until he was arrested at Geneva's airport. And all this
in a country that keeps careful tabs on foreigners, requiring them
to register and provide a valid reason for living and working here,
then renew the process annually for at least five years.
</P>
<P>
   While the trial was going on, Swiss police arrested Ukraine's
former prime minister, Pavlo Lazarenko, who was then indicted on
money-laundering charges. During his leadership, from June 1996 to
June 1997, he was accused of corruption. Ukrainian news
organizations accused Lazarenko, 45, a well-known opposition member
of Parliament, of seeking to withdraw money from secret bank
accounts, but Geneva prosecutors then released him on nearly $3
million bail, which freed him to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, despite dramatic trial testimony, Mikhailov was
acquitted on grounds of insufficient evidence to convict him on
three counts, including unlawfully residing in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities had been counting on a conviction, to send Russian
gangsters the message that Switzerland should not be their
preferred destination. A year ago the federal police department
warned that Russian organized crime was making headway here, not
only by stashing cash, but also by buying legitimate businesses and
property.
</P>
<P>
   There are no official figures, but authorities estimate that $40
million to $50 million in Russian capital has ended up in Swiss
banks. Federal police expect fresh figures and details on Russian
money stashes next year, said Folco Galli, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss federal prosecutor, Carla del Ponte, has expressed
concern about ``the penetration of our country's economy by dirty
Russian money.'' Last month she told a local newspaper she was
convinced that current inquiries into Russian mob influence ``were
only the tip of the iceberg.'' She visited Russia last spring to
strengthen ties between Swiss and Russian law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   In their annual report last year, federal police noted that it
is simple to transfer money ``from murky sources from the east to
Switzerland.'' Police pointed out that the sheer number of visitors
or short-term residents makes laundering money easier, noting that
the number of visas granted to residents of the former Soviet Union
soared to 70,000 in 1996, from 4,000 in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   To guard against money laundering and support Switzerland's
reputation as a safe haven for funds, a law took effect last April
making it mandatory not only for banks but also for insurance
companies and lawyers to report suspicious transactions. Some
reported so far involved the use of dubious Russian money to set up
companies in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. del Ponte's office also reported that suspicious money has
been used in attempts to start up banks and tourist offices. Her
efforts to track dirty money across borders have been hampered, she
said, by neighboring countries including Germany and France, whose
laws are not as strict as Switzerland's.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and Ukraine have both tried to seek out illegal funds
deposited in Switzerland. Last year Russia lodged requests for
legal assistance on 40 cases, Galli said. Ukraine entered 20 such
requests, although Lazarenko's name was not among those listed, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland may have a tough time getting rid of unwelcome money
and its owners. Immediately after Mikhailov was acquitted, his
lawyers requested political asylum for him on grounds that he was
in danger in Russia. Swiss officials have yet to rule on that
request.

BRITISH PRESS UNCOVERS SPY SCANDAL OF ITS OWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The British news media have always been skeptical about
the claims of Richard Tomlinson, the renegade MI6 agent who
recently served a brief prison sentence for revealing embarrassing
secrets about the security service. But last week the newspapers
found Tomlinson's latest disclosure too good to ignore: He said
that Dominic Lawson, the editor of the Sunday Telegraph, was a
British spy.
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers knew about the charge last weekend, but because
of libel laws and the strict Official Secrets Act, none could print
Lawson's name. That all conveniently changed on Wednesday, when
Brian Sedgemore, a Labor member of Parliament, rose on the Commons
floor and said he hoped Parliament would investigate Tomlinson's
claims that Lawson had been ``recruited as a paid MI6 agent.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``That seems a very odd thing. It would be very
damaging for the press if it were true.''
</P>
<P>
   Because they were subject to parliamentary privilege, and
therefore not to Britain's strict libel laws, Sedgemore's remarks
allowed everyone to rush them into print. For his part, Lawson
immediately said in a statement, ``I am not and never have been an
agent, either paid or unpaid, of MI6 or any other government
agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Lawson's relationship with MI6 _ and he said through an
assistant that he had no further comment _ his rivals at other
newspapers were clearly delighted at the chance to torture him in
print.
</P>
<P>
   They have run ample stories chronicling his high-society
connections, his history of printing awkward quotes from people who
later protested that they had spoken off the record, and his move
from a modest house in London to a more expensive one in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is everything wrong with an editor becoming part of the
security machine,'' the Times of London said in an editorial,
calling for an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   As several of his competitors were only too happy to point out,
Lawson's denial seemed carefully worded _ perhaps in order to leave
him some wiggle room.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he wasn't an agent, and I'll buy that, because I'm
sure that means something special,'' said an editor at a rival
newspaper, who spoke on condition of anonymity. But, the editor
pointed out, that left a lot of other possibilities open _
including a more informal, symbiotic relationship with MI6.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the charge is not as far-fetched as it would seem in
the United States. In Britain, journalists say, the intelligence
services have traditionally enjoyed cozy relations with a select
group of editors and reporters, who provide sympathetic coverage in
exchange for special access and exclusive stories.
</P>
<P>
   While the days of correspondents leading double lives as paid
spies abroad probably vanished at the end of the Cold War,
journalists say that some of their colleagues occasionally seem a
little too close for comfort to MI6 and its sister agency, MI5.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   People at competing newspapers say they have always had vague
suspicions about Lawson, who was editor of the Spectator magazine
before he took the Sunday Telegraph job. Lawson is an
ultra-Establishment figure whose father, Lord Lawson of Blaby, was
Margaret Thatcher's chancellor of the exchequer, and whose wife,
Rosa Monckton, the managing director of Tiffany's in London, was a
close friend of Diana, princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, they say, a number of articles in the Sunday
Telegraph and Spectator during Lawson's era have had, at best,
dubious provenance. For instance, according to the the Guardian,
two articles in the Spectator in 1994, purporting to be written by
a U.N. official, were in fact written by an MI6 agent using a false
name. The pieces, about the Bosnian civil war, were widely seen as
a chance for the agency to promote its own agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But Lawson insisted last week that he did not know who wrote the
piece. ``I have no means of knowing if you are right,'' he told the
Guardian, which asked him whether the author was indeed an MI6
agent. ``If you are, it is news to me.''

   WASHINGTON _ On one side of the aisle, dropping phrases like
``Christian country'' and ``the real America,'' lawmakers rued the
decline of absolutes in a permissive age. On the other side,
invoking images of ``lynch mobs'' and ``good old boys,'' they
warned of a right-wing coup.
</P>
<P>
   From one camp came allusions to Watergate that found
similarities between the transgressions of Presidents Nixon and
Clinton. From the other came gasps that such analogies were
ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans brought the country to the brink of impeachment
and Democrats fought to resist it, the debate encompassed more than
questions of whether Bill Clinton committed perjury and whether
lies under oath warranted impeachment. It exposed a cultural rift,
with people viewing each other suspiciously from across the divide.
The debate also quibbled over history and whether the crisis that
gripped the presidency almost a quarter of a century ago applied to
the situation now.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said that some Republicans who were
fighting for Clinton's removal from office were motivated in part
by his embrace of minorities, which they found threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think that America should look like they look _ white,''
Rangel said in an interview last week. He noted that the Republican
side of the House Judiciary Committee was all white with only one
woman, while the Democratic side had five blacks, three women and
an openly gay man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a political lynch mob,'' Rangel said of the Republicans
pushing impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said accusations of racial or sexual animus were
absurd. What propelled them, they said, was outrage over the
specific actions alleged in the articles of impeachment against the
president.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans' comments also reflected qualms about a
departure from traditional mores in society symbolized by Clinton,
who avoided military service, smoked marijuana and repeatedly
cheated on his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Inglis, R-S.C., used one of his speeches during the
House Judiciary Committee hearings to attack moral relativism,
which conservatives often attribute to liberals. ``One view is that
there is absolute truth,'' Inglis said. ``The other view is that
everything is relative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And really what we're seeing here in President Clinton, I
believe, is the culmination of that,'' he said. ``He is the perfect
embodiment of everything being relative.''
</P>
<P>
   For several Republicans, there were clear parallels between
Nixon's abuse of power in covering up the burglary of a Democratic
political office and Clinton's attempts to keep secret his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Livingston, who until Saturday had been designated as
the next speaker of the House, noted that Nixon tried to conceal
the actions of others but Clinton tried to conceal his own. ``So
why was impeachment the remedy for Nixon and not for Clinton?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., implied that Clinton's actions were
graver than Nixon's. ``In Watergate, the president did not commit
perjury,'' Bliley said during the impeachment debate Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats wondered aloud if Republicans were engaging in a
sort of payback for the 1974 House Judiciary Committee's vote to
send articles of impeachment against Nixon to the full House. Nixon
resigned before the House could vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to believe that Speaker Livingston has not gotten over
Watergate,'' Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., said in an interview
Wednesday, before the Louisiana congressman's announcement Saturday
that he would not accept the speaker's post. ``It appears that some
on the Republican side still feel that Richard Nixon got a bad deal
and that somehow the score needs to be evened.''
</P>
<P>
   The advocates and opponents of the impeachment process were
separated by cultural, racial and even regional rivalries and
suspicions, which were made clear not only in the back-and-forth
between lawmakers but also in the voices of Americans trying to be
heard.
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives' language reflected a desire to keep at bay
the hair-splitting, religion-flouting intelligentsia Clinton
sometimes turned to for counsel. Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., best
articulated that wish earlier in the month during a Judiciary
Committee hearing, taking on several lawyers and scholars who
testified on the president's behalf. Barr was not depressed by
their arguments, he said, because ``I think there are two Americas,
and there is a real America out there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And it is that America that I have great faith in, because
it's that America that understands what perjury is,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, spoke of America as a
``Christian country'' when announcing his support for impeachment,
it seemed to echo Barr's sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many of the people protesting the impeachment
process represented movements and groups demonized by
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent feminists marched on the office of Livingston last
week to demand a meeting, after which one of them, Betty Friedan,
called the leaders of the impeachment effort ``a bunch of dirty old
white men.''
</P>
<P>
   Writers like Toni Morrison and E.L. Doctorow spoke at
anti-impeachment rallies and, inevitably, Hollywood celebrities
added their voices, with actor Robert De Niro personally calling a
politician or two to sway their vote.
</P>
<P>
   Like their political opponents, they had come to see impeachment
as a referendum on something more than a series of actions by the
president, and their positions were informed by something larger
than party fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   The words of one Democratic congresswoman during the House
debate Friday captured their perspective well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is indeed a Republican coup d'etat,'' said Rep. Maxine
Waters, D-Calif. ``Republicans are the vehicles being used by the
right-wing Christian Coalition to direct and control our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Her audience, both inside and outside the U.S. Capitol, included
people who felt that she and some Democrats were trying to seize
the reins in just the same way.

<P>
   A week before Thanksgiving, while Americans were busy planning
turkey feasts, people in Havana were already showing off their new
plastic Christmas trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lights are twinkling everywhere,'' said a woman reached by
phone in November as she peered from a window in her fifth-floor
walkup in the Centro Habana neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   It took the Cuban government two more weeks to announce the
obvious: Christmas had returned to the island and Cubans were, once
again, free to observe the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas is back in Cuba at least in part because technology
has improved, the Cuban government says. A recent editorial in
Granma, Cuba's Communist Party newspaper, explained that
sophisticated machines are now capable of cutting sugar cane during
December, the busiest agricultural season in the tropics, so
workers can now be spared for a day off.
</P>
<P>
   And Christmas is back for good.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of Cuba, the re-emergence of Christmas has been viewed
as yet another concession to the Roman Catholic Church and, in
particular, to Pope John Paul II, who visited the island for the
first time last January.
</P>
<P>
   But some Cuba watchers and dissidents on the island say changes
had begun to occur even before the pope announced his decision to
go a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope's visit was a factor in a process, and we have yet to
see where and how it will end,'' said Marifeli Perez-Stable, a
professor of political sociology at the City University of New York
who is writing a book about Cuba in the 1950s. ``The visit itself
was possible because the government had already embarked on that
process.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes evident in Cuba this year are the result of a
re-evaluation of priorities that began in the early 1990s, when the
government, overwhelmed by world events and exhausted by its own
economic crisis, finally recognized that it was time to switch
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there has been a shift of power and attitude
that has enabled European countries, through the European Union, to
become more assertive about Cuba just when the United States had
begun to lose interest. An intelligence report released by the
Pentagon last May concluded that Cuba was no longer a threat to
U.S. security.
</P>
<P>
   All these elements have been present for a while, but it took
the Pope's visit to get the world's attention.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 11 months alone, the Spanish government named an
ambassador to Havana, and the King and Queen of Spain announced
they will visit next spring. Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien visited the island.
Guatemala and the Dominican Republic established full diplomatic
relations with Cuba. And Cuban President Fidel Castro embarked on
highly publicized tours of Portugal, Jamaica, Barbados, the
Dominican Republic and Grenada.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, President Clinton ordered a lifting of the ban
on direct flights to Cuba and increased to $1,200 the amount of
money Cubans here can send to relatives on the island each year.
And the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations voted down a
U.S.-sponsored resolution condemning Cuba's human rights practices.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government allowed the Associated Press to open a
bureau in Havana and granted exit visas to the family of the
baseball player Orlando (El Duque) Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 political prisoners were released and, while other
Cubans have been apprehended, the number of political prisoners is
now far lower than it has been in a long time. Two years ago, there
were about 1,000 political prisoners; today, there are anywhere
between 300 and 400, according to Elizardo Sanchez Santa Cruz, one
of the leading dissidents in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Dissidents, who have seen their work restricted inside and
outside Cuba for years, now have some freedoms. While street
demonstrations continue to be quashed, dissidents who are arrested
are likely to be released quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez said he is now able to speak on the telephone to
international human rights organizations without government
officials interrupting the calls.
</P>
<P>
   He is also able to travel. In the past year, he said, he
received six invitations to visit foreign countries. All were
denied until last month, when the government honored a request from
France. He is now in Spain and said he will soon travel to Miami
and Washington before returning to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Excessive repression, as it was defined in the first 30 years of
the Castro government, no longer seems necessary to keep tight
control of Cuban society, Sanchez said. Most people are so busy
struggling to put food on the table every day that they do not have
the time or the inclination to protest or rebel.
</P>
<P>
   But the pope's visit was successful on two other fronts: It gave
hope to the people of Cuba and it greatly improved the relationship
between the Roman Catholic Church and the Cuban government. A
cordial relationship is crucial because the church needs the
approval of the government to fulfill its mission of helping the
needy and ministering to the faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Paredes, a top church official in New York who advises
Cardinal John O'Connor on Cuban matters, said the benefits to the
Catholic Church in Cuba have been numerous. For the first time in
many years, groups of priests and nuns were allowed into the
country. Also for the first time, the church has been able to
distribute aid directly to the needy, without interference from the
government.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Cuba's cardinal, Jaime Ortega, was able to speak to
the nation by radio and television in March _ no small feat in a
country where the government controls all forms of communication.
The government has begun to allow the repair of old churches;
before, construction permits were routinely denied. Nuns and
priests are allowed to visit the ailing in government hospitals,
also a first.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a delegation of Catholic doctors from New York flew
to Cuba to assess how it could lend a hand in the country's medical
crisis. Earlier, the minister of health had visited Catholic
hospitals in New York. The Italian and French churches are pouring
million of dollars into Cuban universities to conduct various types
of research, and Catholic professionals are now free to attend
conferences abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But in other ways, life remains the same in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The government shows no willingness to introduce democratic
reforms and many people still go to bed hungry and disheartened.
Just like everywhere else, those who have dollars live relatively
well; those who do not must struggle every day.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Christmas decorations are a permanent fixture in the
country, the differences are more noticeable than ever. With
Christmas tree prices that range from $7 to $60, most Cubans cannot
even afford a little holiday cheer.

Guatemala and the Dominican Republic established full diplomatic
relations with Cuba. And Cuban President Fidel Castro embarked on
highly publicized tours of Portugal, Jamaica, Barbados, the
Dominican Republic and Grenada.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, President Clinton ordered a lifting of the ban
on direct flights to Cuba and increased to $1,200 the amount of
money Cubans here can send to relatives on the island each year.
And the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations voted down a
U.S.-sponsored resolution condemning Cuba's human rights practices.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government allowed the Associated Press to open a
bureau in Havana and granted exit visas to the family of the
baseball player Orlando (El Duque) Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 political prisoners were released and, while other
Cubans have been apprehended, the number of political prisoners is
now far lower than it has been in a long time. Two years ago, there
were about 1,000 political prisoners; today, there are anywhere
between 300 and 400, according to Elizardo Sanchez Santa Cruz, one
of the leading dissidents in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Dissidents, who have seen their work restricted inside and
outside Cuba for years, now have some freedoms. While street
demonstrations continue to be quashed, dissidents who are arrested
are likely to be released quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez said he is now able to speak on the telephone to
international human rights organizations without government
officials interrupting the calls.
</P>
<P>
   He is also able to travel. In the past year, he said, he
received six invitations to visit foreign countries. All were
denied until last month, when the government honored a request from
France. He is now in Spain and said he will soon travel to Miami
and Washington before returning to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Excessive repression, as it was defined in the first 30 years of
the Castro government, no longer seems necessary to keep tight
control of Cuban society, Sanchez said. Most people are so busy
struggling to put food on the table every day that they do not have
the time or the inclination to protest or rebel.
</P>
<P>
   But the pope's visit was successful on two other fronts: It gave
hope to the people of Cuba and it greatly improved the relationship
between the Roman Catholic Church and the Cuban government. A
cordial relationship is crucial because the church needs the
approval of the government to fulfill its mission of helping the
needy and ministering to the faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Paredes, a top church official in New York who advises
Cardinal John O'Connor on Cuban matters, said the benefits to the
Catholic Church in Cuba have been numerous. For the first time in
many years, groups of priests and nuns were allowed into the
country. Also for the first time, the church has been able to
distribute aid directly to the needy, without interference from the
government.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Cuba's cardinal, Jaime Ortega, was able to speak to
the nation by radio and television in March _ no small feat in a
country where the government controls all forms of communication.
The government has begun to allow the repair of old churches;
before, construction permits were routinely denied. Nuns and
priests are allowed to visit the ailing in government hospitals,
also a first.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a delegation of Catholic doctors from New York flew
to Cuba to assess how it could lend a hand in the country's medical
crisis. Earlier, the minister of health had visited Catholic
hospitals in New York. The Italian and French churches are pouring
million of dollars into Cuban universities to conduct various types
of research, and Catholic professionals are now free to attend
conferences abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But in other ways, life remains the same in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The government shows no willingness to introduce democratic
reforms and many people still go to bed hungry and disheartened.
Just like everywhere else, those who have dollars live relatively
well; those who do not must struggle every day.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Christmas decorations are a permanent fixture in the
country, the differences are more noticeable than ever. With
Christmas tree prices that range from $7 to $60, most Cubans cannot
even afford a little holiday cheer.

IN HIGH-TECH WAR, CNN AND E-MAIL FROM HOME CANNOT MASK THE BASE
INSTINCTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD U.S.S. ENTERPRISE, in the Persian Gulf _ The bombs may be
sophisticated, but the sentiments scribbled on them are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hold Onto Yer Butt,'' read one. ``Die, You Magets,'' said
another. Warned a third: ``This is Gunna Hurt.'' There is something
about warfare that brings out the very basic.
</P>
<P>
   In this most modern of combat operations, targeting orders
arrive by e-mail, crew members watch the war unfold on satellite
television and every bomb this aircraft carrier has dispatched
toward Iraq was guided by laser.
</P>
<P>
   And in a first for the U.S. Navy, women have been flying combat
missions, taking off from this command post, the main staging area
for what have been three nights of dusk-to-dawn operations.
</P>
<P>
   But just below the flight deck, in the ``Bomb Farm,'' the
high-tech weapons had been scrawled with Magic Markers in that
time-tested way, to send crude messages to Iraq of what sailors
really think. ``To Sadam, Mery X-Mas,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bomb Farm messages are among a number of jarring contrasts
aboard this jarring ship, where stockings have been hung beneath
the admiral's Christmas tree just a few doors away from the deck
where crew members load 2,000-pound bombs onto Navy warplanes in
preparation for a fourth night of attacks. The attacks, by American
and British forces, resumed after sunset, the Pentagon announced in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Since the strikes began early Wednesday here, the televisions
perched all over the ship have been tuned to CNN, allowing nearly
everyone aboard to track both the impeachment debate in Washington
and the impact of the air strikes launched from here.
</P>
<P>
   On the first night of the attack, crew members watched from an
observation deck as warplanes took off from the carrier and cruise
missiles were fired from here, then hurried inside to watch on
television as the rest of the world learned what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   And because the Enterprise is fully wired, most of the crew have
made time during the operation to check their e-mail and to assure
loved ones that everything is all right.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bizarre _ really strange,'' said Lt. Randy Miller, an
F-18/A pilot who has sent an electronic ``I'm OK'' note to his
wife, at home in Chesapeake, Va., after returning from each of the
three bombing missions he has flown against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   There had been speculation that the attacks might end Saturday,
the first day of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month. But Capt. Tom
Hagan, commander of the carrier's air wing, said Saturday afternoon
that the missions would continue into a fourth night, and that his
aircraft were still ``working down the target set'' provided by the
Pentagon at the outset.
</P>
<P>
   A second carrier, the Carl Vinson, entered the Persian Gulf
Saturday, doubling to 92 the number of Navy attack planes here and
adding hundreds more cruise missiles to a stock greatly depleted in
the first three nights. Rear Adm. James Cutler Dawson Jr.,
commander of the naval task force in the gulf, said both carriers
would take part in the attack planned for tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters aboard the Enterprise were told that to maintain the
security of the operation, they would not be permitted to file any
information after 4 p.m. local time (10 a.m. ET.)
</P>
<P>
   On each of the last three nights, the 46 F-14 and F-18/A
fighters on board the Enterprise have launched 90 bombing missions
in a tempo that for most crew members has left little time for
sleep. They have dropped hundreds of bombs on targets in Iraq,
ranging from 500- to 2,000-pound bombs, cutting deep into what had
been stored in magazines beneath the deck.
</P>
<P>
   Admiral Dawson told reporters Saturday, ``We have sufficient
ordnance to sustain us for quite some time.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ship's commanding officer, Capt. Evan Chanik, said in a
message to the crew late Saturday afternoon, ``Very truthfully, I
don't know what's going to happen here into the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilots include three women, two of whom took part in the
first wave of attacks early Thursday morning. The change in
Pentagon policy allowing women to fly combat missions was not made
until after the Persian Gulf war, and officers aboard the ship
acknowledged that the women had made Navy history.
</P>
<P>
   But one of them, Lt. Kendra Williams, 26, of Anchorage, Alaska,
described that fact as ``not a huge deal.'' A 1994 graduate of the
Naval Academy, Lieutenant Williams has flown her F-18/A on two
bombing missions, but insisted on her own behalf and that of the
two other women, ``None of us is really out for that kind of
recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   All the pilots have returned unscathed, and none of the planes
have been hit by Iraqi fire, one officer said. But some pilots said
that at some points they had encountered heavy antiaircraft fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to Baghdad last night and it was pretty intense,''
said an F-18/A pilot who asked that his name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   Deep in the bowels of the ship Saturday, crew members were
assembling laser-guided bombs to precise specifications to hit the
particular weapons bunkers, barracks and other sites on Saturday
night's target list. In general, commanders said they were pleased
with the damage achieved, with most strikes recorded and later
reviewed on videotape taken from cameras mounted on each aircraft.
But they suggested that nerves and inexperience might have slowed
the operation in its early stages.
</P>
<P>
   Hagan said the attacks on Thursday night ``in particular were
very satisfying in terms of our ability to take out the targets
that we've been assigned,'' adding that there had been ``less
anxiety and more experience'' than in the first two nights.

LAWMAKERS SEEK $100 MILLION IN AID FOR NEW ENGLAND FISHERMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (mk) 
 By JULIE FLAHERTY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A group of Massachusetts lawmakers has asked the
federal government for $100 million in aid to help thousands of
fishermen threatened by the collapse of cod stocks in the Gulf of
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent last week, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and
four other members of Congress urged the administration to include
in the federal budget for 2000 an emergency relief package for
fishermen and cities that rely on the cod stocks economically.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators voted last week to bar fishing in several spawning
grounds off the coast of New England in an effort to stop the
collapse of the cod supplies. Scientists announced this month that
cod stocks in the Gulf of Maine, already known to be depleted, had
dropped to a 30-year low.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 2,500 fishermen, many of them small-boat owners who
cannot travel far off-shore to the open fishing grounds, will be
affected by the closures. Cities like Gloucester, Mass., which has
long depended on fishing, have already been hit hard by the
industry decline and government restrictions in recent years to
protect fishing stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need an 80 percent reduction in current fishing levels in
order to start rebuilding the Gulf of Maine cod stock,'' said
Patricia Fiorelli, spokeswoman for the New England Fishery
Management Council, which voted for the closures.
</P>
<P>
   As dismayed as they are by the new restrictions, fishermen are
already bracing for more regulation next year, which might include
further limiting fishing trips or closures beyond the spawning
period.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Brancaleone, president of the Gloucester Fishermen's
Association, has already sold his boat and gone into
semi-retirement at age 56.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been frustrated for 20 years, but not like now,''
Brancaleone said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers ask in the letter that the aid go toward health
care for fishermen and their families, boat buybacks, career
counseling for those who must stop fishing and projects to
diversify the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of fishing people who are suffering a
significant economic setback, not unlike farmers in some parts of
the country,'' said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., one of the signers of
the letter. ``There we've made an effort to soften the blow. Now we
have to begin to understand our responsibilities to these
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Reps. Barney Frank, Bill Delahunt and John
Tierney, all Democrats, also signed the letter to the budget office
director, Jack Lew.
</P>
<P>
   Brancaleone, like many of the fishermen, is skeptical of the
scientists' data and says the cod stocks are not lower. He would
rather see the government lift the restrictions than offer money to
buy fishermen's boats. ``Fishermen are proud people and they like
to make their own living,'' he said. ``No one here wants a
handout.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has given $80 million to the New England
fishing industry since 1994, including $25 million for boat
buybacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time the clear message was, `This is the last time,'''
said Peter Shelley, director of the Marine Resources Project at the
Conservation Law Foundation. ``I'm fairly skeptical that a majority
of Congress knows enough about the pain that a fishing closure can
bring to want to help in this kind of situation. I hope I'm
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But without relief now, fishermen might be tempted to fish
stocks beyond the point of recovery, he said.

IN LATIN AMERICA, THE STRONGMAN STIRS IN HIS GRAVE

<P>
   MIAMI _ All across Latin America, presidents and party leaders
are looking over their shoulders. With his landslide victory in
Venezuela's presidential election on Dec. 6, Hugo Chavez has
revived an all-too-familiar specter that the region's ruling elite
thought they had safely interred: that of the populist demagogue,
the authoritarian man on horseback known as the caudillo.
</P>
<P>
   A cashiered army colonel, Chavez is to be sworn into office for
a five-year term on Feb. 2, the eve of the anniversary of a bloody
but failed military coup he led in 1992. Chavez, a 44-year-old
former paratrooper, maintains that only a ``social revolution'' can
be ``the salvation of the country,'' and has vowed to convene a
constitutional assembly that would rewrite Venezuela's charter and,
in all likelihood, do away with the democratic two-party system
that has prevailed for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running scared; we have sweaty palms,'' said Gonzalo
Sanchez de Lozada, a former president of Bolivia who went to
Caracas as part of an international delegation of election
observers. ``Venezuela is something that will have a great
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of Chavez resonates far beyond Venezuela's borders
for reasons both symbolic and practical. Venezuela was the
birthplace of Simon Bolivar, the father of South American
independence, and Chavez has presented himself as Bolivar's heir
and disciple _ despite his past disregard for the rule of law. In
addition, the overthrow of the dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez in
1958 ushered in the modern cycle of civilian democratic rule in
Latin America and made Venezuela a sort of political laboratory for
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly alarming to the political establishment is that
Chavez achieved his victory by going outside the traditional party
system and running as the independent candidate of a loose-knit
coalition called the Patriotic Pole. Discredited by years of deeply
entrenched corruption and partisan nepotism, both parties _ one
slightly left of center, the other on the right _ united at the
last moment behind Chavez's main opponent, only to find themselves
made virtually irrelevant by the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's triumph augurs ``the total disintegration of the
strongest party system in Latin America,'' according to Arturo
Valenzuela, director of the Center for Latin American Studies at
Georgetown University. ``It really is an extraordinary lesson: that
you cannot over a period of time run a political system with an
explicit or even implicit pact to divide up the spoils and rule the
country on the basis of patronage.''
</P>
<P>
   In place of the parties _ which for all their flaws have
demonstrated respect for democratic institutions _ Chavez seems
inclined to govern on the basis of a mystical bond he claims to
have established with Venezuela's 23 million people. He has also
implied that his new ``people's government'' will not need a
Congress or other institutions to interpret the popular will and
has said he prefers direct consultation with voters to the
give-and-take of building a legislative coalition through
compromise and negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trend towards government by referendum and plebiscite _
that's not democracy, and that's what worries me the most,'' said
Eduardo Gamarra, director of the Latin American and Caribbean
Center at Florida International University here. ``People in power
who are having difficulties and want to forget the niceties of
presidential democracy will be very attracted by this model of
closing down Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the gradual disappearance of military dictatorships in the
early 1980s, the basic assumption of Latin America's civilian
politicians, as well as their patrons in Washington, has been that
democracy works in tandem with open markets, privatization and free
trade. But Chavez's resounding triumph in a country with the
largest oil reserves outside the Middle East suggests a basic flaw
in that thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is growing frustration, anger and anxiety throughout
Latin America because of the unrealized promises from increasing
involvement in the global economy,'' said Jennifer Schirmer, a
Harvard University professor who is an expert on Central American
military regimes. ``If the upper classes and the elite have grown
richer, most people, including the middle class, are experiencing
economic loss, greater instability and an exponential growth in
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   In that context, she added, Chavez's emergence can be seen as
``the first salvo in a class revolt'' that may not always seek
expression at the ballot box. Or as Luis Vicente Leon, head of the
Venezuelan polling firm Datanalisis, put it, Chavez's followers
``vote for him out of rage'' _ a state of mind that exists in
abundance from Guatemala to Brazil in nations whose governments
have favored policies that generate wealth but do not distribute it
equitably.
</P>
<P>
   By sending contradictory signals, Chavez has done little to calm
concerns about his intentions. Following his triumph, he disavowed
earlier statements that he would ``fry the heads'' of his
opponents, described himself as ``a man of peace,'' promised to
respect the rights of foreign investors and pledged ``a new
democracy'' free of corruption and patronage.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he has also invoked the spirit of Juan Peron of Argentina
and other populist dictators of the past. ``I am not the Peron of
Venezuela, I am the Chavez of Venezuela,'' he has said. ``But if
Peron worried about social justice and equality, then I agree with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Chavez could end up taking the same path as Carlos
Menem, who was elected president of Argentina in 1989 as a Peronist
but has governed as a textbook enthusiast of open markets. Then
again, he may follow the course of Alberto Fujimori of Peru, who
made good on threats to bypass the traditional political system and
has transformed himself into a strongman.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, a wake-up call to the perils of cronyism and growing
income disparity has clearly been delivered to the region's
leaders. What remains to be seen is who, if anyone, will heed the
sobering message.

Menem, who was elected president of Argentina in 1989 as a Peronist
but has governed as a textbook enthusiast of open markets. Then
again, he may follow the course of Alberto Fujimori of Peru, who
made good on threats to bypass the traditional political system and
has transformed himself into a strongman.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, a wake-up call to the perils of cronyism and growing
income disparity has clearly been delivered to the region's
leaders. What remains to be seen is who, if anyone, will heed the
sobering message.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the holy month of Ramadan began in the Islamic
world, the United States and Britain on Saturday began a fourth day
of strikes on Iraq after what they said had been a thunderous
overnight assault that focused on President Saddam Hussein's
Republican Guards.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset of the bombing on Wednesday, President Clinton
said the United States was sensitive to carrying out strikes
against an Arab state during the monthlong period of fasting and
religious study.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon's commanders also said that the start of
Ramadan would not be a barrier, and as night fell in Iraq,
Baghdad's air-raid sirens sounded once again and anti-aircraft fire
burst in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has said the strikes are intended to
diminish Iraq's ability to produce weapons of mass destruction and
threaten its neighbors. And the Pentagon said it has methodically
been hitting, in wave after wave, targets designated for that
purpose. But it has given little indication of what would define
success and has not said when the raids would stop.
</P>
<P>
   A day after disclosing that the first strikes had severely
damaged or destroyed only a portion of their targets, the Pentagon
said Saturday that U.S. and British forces had struck roughly 100
targets with more than 400 sea- and air-launched cruise missiles
and thousands of tons of bombs from fighters and bombers.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address, delivered as the House deliberated
his impeachment, Clinton said the attack was ``going well,'' but he
gave no indication of when the strikes would end.
</P>
<P>
   He also indicated that even after the current strikes ended, the
United States would again attack Iraq if Saddam's government tried
to rebuild the chemical and biological weapons at the heart of its
dispute with the U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do we go from here?'' he said. ``We stand ready to use
force again.''
</P>
<P>
   A second aircraft carrier, the Carl Vinson, entered the Persian
Gulf and moved into position to participate in a fourth day of
strikes, joining the carrier Enterprise, whose F-14, F-18 and EA-6B
jets have pounded Iraq for three days. Accompanying the Carl Vinson
are six cruisers and destroyers able to fire still more Tomahawk
cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the attacks resumed, officials at the Pentagon said
the assault was winding down pretty much according to plan.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials insisted Saturday that the preliminary
assessments did not accurately portray the success of the attack.
Many of the targets that received little or no damage have been
struck again, a military official said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that several of the targets that were not
entirely destroyed were moderately damaged, including many barracks
and headquarters of the Republican Guards, one of the primary
targets of the latest mission. The Guards, Saddam's elite troops,
are considered a key element of his ability to maintain tight
control over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. cruise missiles also hit the headquarters of Saddam's
Ba'ath Party in Baghdad, badly damaging it, Pentagon and British
officials said. Iraq's refusal to allow U.N. weapons inspectors to
inspect the building, suspected of containing documents and other
materials related to Iraq's chemical and biological weapons, was
one of the reasons the United States and Britain cited for
targeting it.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, there were signs of destruction after the third night
of the attack unleashed the most punishing strikes yet in Baghdad.
Saddam's government again denounced the strikes and said they had
shot down 23 of 60 cruise missiles fired into Baghdad overnight, a
claim that the Pentagon discounted.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the diplomatic sensitivity of continuing the attack
during Ramadan, a period of dawn-to-dusk fasting, Clinton prepared
a videotaped address to be broadcast in the Arab world Saturday,
explaining the U.S. rationale for striking Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring the ``most profound admiration for Islam,'' Clinton
said Saddam's regime had disregarded the United Nations, other Arab
states and his own people.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the days ahead, I hope all Muslims will consider Americans'
sincere desire to work with all people in the Middle East to build
peace,'' Clinton said in the videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's address was issued after the swelling anger in the
region. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, one of the closest U.S.
allies in the Arab world, called for an immediate halt to the
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   In Syria, protesters attacked the U.S. and British embassies and
the residence of the U.S. ambassador, Ryan Crocker. Marine guards
at the U.S. Embassy in Damascus, largely emptied of staff, fired
tear gas to disperse stone-throwing protesters, but three of them
managed to scale the building, tear down the American flag and burn
it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In London, George Robertson, Britain's defense secretary, said
that the attacks, which included strikes by British Tornado jets,
had hit 100 military and industrial targets and had caused
``substantial damage'' to Iraq's biological and chemical weapons
programs and to the Republican Guards.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and British jets also struck an oil refinery near Basra, in
the south, that U.S. officials said was generating illicit profits
for Saddam despite U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States and Britain have said overthrowing
Saddam is not an objective, Robertson made it clear that the
strikes on the Republican Guard were meant to weaken Saddam's
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Republican Guard ceases to support Saddam, his brutal
regime is under immediate threat,'' Robertson said. ``We want the
Republican Guard to know that the cozy life they have led under
Saddam is under attack, and we think they have got that message
very clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair said he could not guarantee that the
air assault would topple Saddam. But he added, ``It would be
wonderful if Saddam could be removed from power.''

   Netanyahu Threatens To Force Elections
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened to call new
elections to avoid the humiliation of being tossed out of office by
Parliament. But he said he would try one final time to get a
majority of Parliament to stand behind his tough posture toward the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   During a three-day summit with President Clinton and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, Netanyahu had made clear that he was unlikely
to abide by the timetable of the Wye peace accord for another troop
withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   It was a disappointment for the Palestinians and the visiting
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Clinton pronounced the trip a success in putting the
derailed peace effort ``back on track.''

   Hudson Foods Indicted In Meat Contamination
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury in Omaha indicted Hudson Foods Inc. and two
employees for lying to investigators about the contamination of
hamburgers produced at Hudson's beef plant in Columbus, Neb., last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the tainted hamburgers, which are believed to
have sickened 16 people in Colorado and Kentucky in August 1997,
prompted the recall of 25 million pounds of ground beef.
</P>
<P>
   The plant manager and the director of customer relations and
quality control falsely told investigators from the U.S. Department
of Agriculture that the company had been able to trace the infected
beef to a single lot of hamburgers even though they knew that the
problem was more widespread, according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The company has denied the charges, as did a lawyer for the
plant manager. The other employee's lawyer has declined to comment.

   Questions About Truth Of Nobel Winner's Book
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the 1992 Nobel Peace Prize, Rigoberta Menchu of
Guatemala, has had her reputation tarnished a bit as a result of a
new book, written by an American anthropologist, that questions the
truthfulness of the autobiography that made her famous.
</P>
<P>
   David Stoll of Middlebury College spent nearly a decade
researching Ms. Menchu's account, and found that the Nobel laureate
fabricated the circumstances in which some relatives died, received
an education she claimed not to have and comes from a family that
owned land she claimed it never possessed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Menchu responded angrily to the accusations, saying, ``This
is my testimony and I will defend it.''

   Koreans Clone Human Cell

   South Korean scientists said they had cloned a human cell from
an infertile woman, creating an embryo that theoretically could
have grown into an identical replica of the woman. But because of
the legal and ethical implications of their work, they said, they
stopped the experiment and did not try to create a human clone. The
research has already caused controversy. Korean groups are calling
for a ban on such experiments.

   In Puerto Rican Vote, None of the Above
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in six years, Puerto Ricans rebuffed their
Governor's efforts to win statehood. In a referendum, ``None of the
above'' was their top choice, a selection promoted as a protest by
those who want to maintain the current commonwealth relationship
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The other options were commonwealth, ``free association'' (a
form of independence that delegates certain powers by treaty to the
United States), statehood and independence. The winning option got
50.2 percent of the vote, compared with 46.5 percent for statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Historically divided over whether to seek a closer association
with the United States through statehood or to remain distinctly
self-governing, the electorate this time was split among options
that confused some voters and angered many others. The small vote
for the option to maintain commonwealth status was evidence of
this, reflecting a boycott by the pro-commonwealth Popular
Democratic Party, which claimed the definition of that option was
misleading.

   Sante Kimes, 64, and her son Kenneth, 24, carried out a
sophisticated scheme to defraud Irene Silverman of her ornate Upper
East Side Manhattan mansion, according to an 84-count indictment.
And they left a detailed paper trail, including notes about the
scheme and a forged deed transferring the mansion to a corporation
they control, according to the charges.

   Happy Christmas, Merry New Year
</P>
<P>
   In China, a growing passion for things Western has in recent
years meant a special interest in Christmas, especially among
fashion-conscious young people.
</P>
<P>
   Friends exchange gifts, stores force sales clerks to wear Santa
suits _ young women are often persuaded to wear the miniskirt
version _ and there is a lively trade in Christmas cards.
</P>
<P>
   With such a large cultural divide between East and West, perhaps
it is inevitable that something gets lost in translation. A typical
card reads: ``Wish you all the luck in the Uorld!'' and the
accompanying message says: ``You're here, There's nothing I fear,
And I know that my heart will go on, We'll stay forever this way,
You are safe in my heart, And my heart mill go on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   In another card, Santa is pictured on the Western side of the
Earth exchanging gazes with a Chinese god of fortune in the East,
with the message: ``As the world is round, the far end of East is
West and vice versa.''
</P>
<P>
   A card entitled ``Friendship,'' displays champagne and flowers,
with the message, translated from Chinese: ``Time is like flowing
water _ once passed it cannot be recovered. Friends are like old
wine; getting better with age.''

   There is nothing about Christmas or the New Year on this card,
but hey, it's the thought that counts.

   Lord Lloyd Webber for the Defense
</P>
<P>
   Does it often seem that Andrew Lloyd Webber is everywhere? Well,
it's more serious than you thought.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do his musicals _ so many of them! _ hang around
Broadway just about forever, but he could recently be found in a
New York courtroom giving a piano rendition of a snippet from
``Phantom of the Opera.''
</P>
<P>
   A little moonlighting, perhaps? A midday gig to soften jurors'
hearts? No, it turns out that nearly a decade ago _ a mere blip in
the typical run of a Lloyd Webber blockbuster _ a composer named
Ray Repp was listening to a ``Phantom'' CD and said: ``Holy Cow! He
stole my song.''
</P>
<P>
   Or so he asserted near the end of an eight-year legal battle to
prove that Lloyd Webber stole a passage from his 1978 song ``Till
You'' (sales: $75.87) and made it the main theme of ``Phantom''
(sales: $1 billion or so).
</P>
<P>
   So Lord Lloyd Webber took to the keyboard himself as he gave his
version of the birth of the song.
</P>
<P>
   On Repp's behalf, two music professors testified to the
compositions' similarities. But with composers great and small
routinely borrowing phrases, the whole notion of tracing musical
lineage is frightfully slippery _ DNA evidence is no help whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Webber, in fact, countersued in 1991, saying Repp had in
fact stolen one of HIS tunes. He lost, as did Repp this time. In
little more than an hour, the jury bestowed originality on Lloyd
Webber.

   Lloyd Webber, in fact, countersued in 1991, saying Repp had in

IRAQIS ARE CALLED MASTERS OF CONCEALMENT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Even the smartest bombs have trouble
undercutting Saddam Hussein's ability to make new weapons of mass
destruction because the Iraqis are masters at hiding their assets,
United Nations weapons inspectors and other experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years of inspections in Iraq have taught experts that the
Iraqis have extremely well-developed plans for moving weapons and
factory machinery out of the way of bombs, said Scott Ritter, the
American concealment expert who resigned from the United Nations
Special Commission in August.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis have also fine-tuned the ability to reconstitute
programs quickly, an Iraqi exile with knowledge of these projects
said, citing this as a sign of the high priority Hussein places on
keeping prohibited arms at any cost to the Iraqi nation.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter said in an interview that Iraq's Military Industrial
Commission had an emergency dispersal plan, which U.N. inspectors
have seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Military Industrial Commission has an evacuation plan for
each facility,'' Ritter said. ``In fact, they run an emergency
operation center that makes the call. This emergency operation
center is linked in with an organization called the joint committee
that's run by the presidential secretary. The joint committee makes
these calls at national level.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts who study Iraq's evasion techniques said that an
announcement on Wednesday in Baghdad that the country was being
divided into four military regions was a signal that a plan for
nationwide evasive action was in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The joint committee is the one that ordered Iraq broken up
into four sectors and set up regional headquarters,'' Ritter said.
``In addition to evacuating MIC facilities, for example, the joint
committee will order the Republican Guard to disperse.'' The
Republican Guard, Hussein's elite army, has been a major target of
the American strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Khidhir Hamza, an Iraqi nuclear scientist who has lived in exile
in the United States since 1995, said that in the past, the Iraqi
government has moved material all around the country to conceal it,
at one point parking valuable equipment in date-palm groves near a
technical college.
</P>
<P>
   Other exiles, who asked not to be identified because they still
have relatives in Iraq, said that Hussein's regime could foist
military equipment on the homes or businesses of ordinary Iraqis at
will. Civilian neighborhoods become temporary ammunition or weapons
dumps, they said, and no dissent is possible.
</P>
<P>
   When people are killed, the Iraqi government can use them again,
for propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, U.N. arms inspectors were able to watch an
evacuation in process at some sites, after arms teams were
withdrawn but video cameras kept running. When teams returned,
cameras showed empty spaces where suspect equipment had been,
Charles Duelfer, deputy executive chairman of the Special
Commission reported at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually noticed the Iraqis removing material away from our
cameras,'' Ritter said. ``The reason they were removing those
materials was that they were implementing their evacuation plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They move all the equipment out of a building to evacuation
sites, and these sites change all the time, and they are designed
to minimize damage that will occur from air strikes,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most graphic examples of this was in 1993, when the
United States fired cruise missiles into Iraq and hit the
Zafaraniya complex,'' he said. The complex contained a factory
called Al Rabiyah, where machinery for the Iraqi nuclear industry
was installed. ``We completely destroyed it,'' Ritter said.
``Impressive hits. But it was totally evacuated. Within eight weeks
they had rebuilt the facility and reinstalled the equipment. All
the personnel were back to work and they were doing what they were
doing beforehand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1993, they've had five years to refine their capability,
and its almost a certainty that the high-value items Iraq wants to
keep have been evacuated and hidden _ not hidden from inspectors,
but hidden from the air strikes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will be put into forests, covered with tarpaulin,'' he
said. ``They will be put into civilian housing areas, along the
streets. In some cases the Iraqis just move them next door. These
are precision air strikes, so they hit the site, blow it up. But
nothing's there.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the Center for Strategic and International Studies in
Washington, Anthony Cordesman, a Middle East expert, has studied
how Iraq disperses valuable weapons programs to private sites all
over the country to make these stashes of components virtually
impossible to locate, and therefore almost immune from surprise
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, even if the United States military knew where these
sites were, hitting them would involve large civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Pentagon officials said they had not targeted
biological and chemical weapons sites to avoid the potential for
contaminating the population. But inspectors wonder how it could be
that years of sleuthing by the Special Commission failed to find
such sites, while American military officers seemed to know where
they were.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter, who said that during his seven years on the Special
Commission he had inspected some of the sites hit this week, said
that some of the target buildings may have been evacuated by the
end of October, when Hussein stopped cooperating with arms
inspectors and hunkered down for a possible attack, which almost
came on the weekend of Nov. 14-15.
</P>
<P>
   When inspectors resumed their work in Iraq after Hussein backed
down to avoid attack, they found that some buildings had been
completely cleaned out, as Richard Butler, the executive chairman
of the Special Commission, wrote in his report made public on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have aircraft hitting Republican Guard sites,'' Ritter
said. ``I can tell you my experience with the Republican Guard in
times of crises. They don't park their tanks in nice neat lines so
bombers can come in and blow them up. They distribute their tanks
across miles and miles of territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Last February, reporters covering Secretary General Kofi Annan's
trip to Baghdad landed at the Habbaniyah air base northwest of the
Iraqi capital and saw military aircraft under camouflage also
scattered over a wide area of scrubland.
</P>
<P>
   At Pentagon briefings, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen and
Gen. Henry H. Shelton, Chairman of the Joints Chief of Staff,
acknowledged that results from the bombing were mixed and that it
might not be possible to know exactly what was in a building that
had been hit. They showed a photo of Republican Guard barracks that
had been destroyed, but were unable to say whether there had been
soldiers inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Guard barracks were empty,'' Ritter said. ``I
inspected those barracks. The ones they destroyed contained old
uniforms, expired ammunition, food supplies, derelict bedding,
smelly latrines. The troops are elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In news conferences this week, the Iraqis also said that some
buildings hit were empty. Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz sneered
at American claims that the Defense Ministry had been hit, saying
that it was an old building with nothing in it. Reporters in Iraq
are not allowed to look at military sites, so independent
confirmation of claims made anywhere is impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also hit buildings at the Military Industrial
Commission headquarters and the Special Security Organization's
headquarters. Butler's report, which served as the American
justification for military action, said that inspections of those
buildings was called off because they were found to be cleared not
only of suspect material, but also of the furniture.

<P>
   IMPEACH-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Should congressional
Republicans' rush toward impeachment despite a lack of public
support really have come as a surprise? The merits of the case
against President Clinton aside, the outcome might well have been
inevitable, given the political dynamics that rule Washington
today. By Adam Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-CULTURE-REVIEW (Washington) _ The impeachment debate
encompassed more than questions of whether Bill Clinton committed
perjury and whether lies under oath warranted impeachment. It
exposed a cultural rift, with people viewing each other
suspiciously from across the divide. The debate also quibbled over
history and whether the crisis that gripped the presidency almost a
quarter of a century ago applied to the situation now. By Frank
Bruni.

<P>
   IMPEACH-TWAIN-REVIEW (Undated) _ Mark Twain's opinion of
politicians wasn't high. ``The political and commercial morals of
the United States are not merely food for laughter, they are an
entire banquet,'' he wrote. The impeachment of President Andrew
Johnson gave him a lot to dine out on.

   SHOPPING-DISORDERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some holiday shoppers
spend more than they should, for reasons they shouldn't. These
problem consumers are engaged in compulsive shopping, competitive
shopping and revenge shopping. Doctors say these feelings, which
reflect deeper psychological disturbances, may intensify around
Christmas, when people are inundated with subtle and not-so-subtle
messages to spend. By Tracie Rozhon.

<P>
   SOCSEC-REVIEW (Undated) _ Imagine you could save the Social
Security system from bankruptcy by raising every American's
retirement check _ without increasing taxes. Such is the radical

   IRAQ-ARMS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Seven years after Saddam Hussein
promised to come clean about his weapons of mass destruction, and
days after yet another military confrontation with the West over
his continuing refusal to do so, the book on Iraqi arms is still
riddled with holes. Military experts say the unanswered questions
are serious and legion. Still unaccounted for are hundreds of
chemical arms, tons of nerve gas, more than 100 germ weapons and
parts for up to four nuclear warheads, which are said to lack only

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As defiant as on the day she blamed the Monica
Lewinsky scandal on a ``vast right-wing conspiracy,'' Hillary
Rodham Clinton went to Capitol Hill on Saturday morning and blasted
an unfair, politically motivated impeachment process that she said
the president would continue to fight.
</P>
<P>
   In a closed meeting with House Democrats, Mrs. Clinton said she
was there in part as ``a wife who loves and supports her husband,''
and charged that Republicans were impeaching her husband _
``hounding him out of office,'' she said _ because they opposed his
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said this is as much about ending his agenda on health
care and other things as about hounding him out of office,'' said
Rep. Bob Menendez of New Jersey. ``She said there would be no
resignation and we should not and cannot allow them to hound him
out of office.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is extremely popular among congressional Democrats
_ far more so than her husband _ and came to inoculate him against
the possibility that Democrats could be persuaded that resignation
might be best for the country. Two House Democrats, Rep. Louise
Slaughter of New York and Rep. William Lipinski of Illinois, had
already said they would urge resignation if he were impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was determined and defiant,'' said Rep. Jerrold Nadler of
New York. ``Her message was that they've been pursuing him since
the day he came into office.''
</P>
<P>
   In what several members called a ``pep rally,'' she thanked
Democrats for their support and asked them to keep it coming,
receiving half a dozen standing ovations. After the meeting,
members stood in line to give her a hug. And as they left, several
House Democrats referred at least obliquely to Mrs. Clinton's own
political prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's probably the most popular person in the country with
Democrats, period, and that's also true of us in the caucus,'' said
Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, where Mrs. Clinton has been mentioned
as someone with the potential to succeed Daniel Patrick Moynihan in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's continued support for her husband has been seen
as crucial to his popularity with the public, cited again and again
by those who say they will stick with him, too, in statements along
the order of ``If Hillary doesn't mind, why should I?'' or ``That's
between him, his God, and Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Mrs. Clinton got generous credit for campaigning in
congressional races before the November elections, some Democrats
had still expressed nervousness that she had not offered fresh
support for the president in recent weeks. (Friends said she was
annoyed by the inference: Was she supposed to announce her
continued support every day? Or lobby Republicans who wince at the
mention of her name?)
</P>
<P>
   And her appearance on Saturday, following supportive remarks she
made on Friday, definitively ended a week of speculation that Mrs.
Clinton had decided to distance herself from her husband, in the
hour of his greatest political need, in order to keep her own
options open.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That the Clintons held hands rather less on their recent trip to
Israel than on earlier trips, and that Mrs. Clinton seemed to pull
away from her husband at one moment, were reported on CNN, NBC and
a number of newspapers as evidence that Mrs. Clinton was no longer
on the team. The headline on the page one story that ran in the
Washington Times on Wednesday was ``Hillary shows signs of
relinquishing role as the defender in chief for her husband.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday she said she had come to the Hill as ``a wife
who loves and supports her husband,'' a Judiciary Committee staff
member during Watergate who knows firsthand how the process should
work, and an American who feels proud of the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Members said that the first lady's demeanor had been serious but
that she never stopped smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio said he felt pumped up by the
meeting with Mrs. Clinton: ``It's a campaign all over again. This
needs to be a fight every step of the way, and we're going to wake
the town and tell the people.''
</P>
<P>
   And he suggested that at this late date, the two-for-one
presidency has new life: ``She's so terrific,'' he said. ``It's
lucky for America we have a woman with the strength to lead the
nation right now. And everybody understands she is one of the
leaders of the nation right now, as much as the president.''

<P>
   An inevitable price of the United States' and Britain's use of
force in Iraq is that it arouses considerable unease around the
world, especially if it fails.
</P>
<P>
   Although only Russia has publicly vented irritation at the
United States' decision to punish President Saddam Hussein, many
other governments, especially in the Middle East, have watched the
attacks with consternation, either from uneasiness about any nation
that would take on itself the role of global policeman, or from
concern about local repercussions, or from unanswered questions
about what the United States is trying to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   However justified the attacks might appear to the
administration, and even to most Americans, newspaper commentaries
in much of the rest of the world have speculated extensively on a
potential link to President Clinton's impending impeachment. Beyond
that come assertions that the United States is abusing its
unchallenged global power and reach. Although Russia's pique seemed

   ``In dealing with rogues, a purist American approach is
dangerous,'' said Richard Haass, director of foreign policy studies
at the Brookings Institution. ``It stimulates a backlash and all
sorts of ripple effects that are counterproductive. It's not
something that will happen overnight, but we are beginning to see a
growing resentment factor. We see it with China, Russia, some
Europeans, in what we used to call the third world.''
</P>
<P>
   Such reactions may be unavoidable, experts say, adding that most
critics would be silenced if the United States achieved some
demonstrable success, like the replacement of Saddam's dictatorship
with some benign and defensible new government.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not seem likely anytime soon, and according to the
experts, most any other outcome would have its own problems,
especially for the United States' allies in the Middle East. The
concern is not only strategic; with the spread of satellite
television in the Middle East, images of Iraqi civilians bloodied
by American bombs are certain to rouse anger on Arab streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a deepening problem in the Arab world if our
campaign does not end in a significantly chastened and punished
regime in Baghdad,'' said Robert Satloff, executive director of the
Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ``The leaders will
become more nervous, more likely to tiptoe around the Iraq issue if
we end too precipitously, if we end before our real goal has been
met.''
</P>
<P>
   The main goal publicly proclaimed by the Clinton administration,
that of ``degrading'' Iraq's capabilities for deploying weapons of
mass destruction, is ``Washington-speak,'' Satloff said.
</P>
<P>
   What the Arab leaders need to know, he said, is whether the
United States is truly undermining Saddam's power, whether the
attacks are setting-off revolts and by whom, and whether any
potential leaders of a coup against Saddam would be assured of
support.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``There is certainly great concern in the Arab world about these
developments,'' agreed Hussein Hassouna, the representative of the
Arab League to the United Nations. ``The first and foremost concern
is whether this bombing will lead to more loss of life, more
destruction of property among innocent Iraqi people, who have been
suffering since 1991 under a very harsh system of sanctions. There
are certainly strong feelings of solidarity with the Iraqi people
in the Arab world.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the reaction of the streets, Hassouna said, the bombings
opened many troubling uncertainties. They meant the effective
demise of the U.N. Special Commission created to monitor Iraq's
weapons program, which for all its weaknesses at least represented
an international consensus. And they reopened the perennial sense
among the Arabs that the United States displays a double standard,
bashing Iraq for developing weapons of mass destruction while
keeping silent about Israel's suspected nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Hassouna said, there is the old concern about what
would happen if Iraq broke up, potentially setting off civil war
and floods of refugees to neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bombings open the way to so many uncertainties, which
don't make the future seem much brighter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The attitude reflected the fact that for many Middle Eastern
governments, the situation before the bombing was basically not
bad. The United States maintained a military umbrella over the
gulf, and Iraq's arms programs and oil exports were effectively
limited. It is another question, though, whether the status quo was
tenable, given Saddam's open defiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is that this was a no-win situation,'' said Geoffrey
Kemp, director of regional strategic programs at the Nixon Center
in Washington, ``We were taking a huge risk by not acting, and
we're taking a huge risk with these bombings.''
</P>
<P>
   Most experts agreed that many of the anxieties of Middle Eastern
governments would be lifted if the operation ended successfully.
But failure, Satloff said, ``would be seen to carry the seeds of an
even worse situation.'' ``It all depends how this thing turns
out,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   This venerable principle of international affairs, that nothing
succeeds like success, was cited by many experts in Near Eastern
affairs. But one problem with it, said Anthony Cordesman, a senior
fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in
Washington, is that the administration has not really spelled out
what success would entail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no doctrine, no ground rules,'' he said. ``We have not
set out what were doing beyond degrade, we haven't defined what
success is to the rest of the world. One of our problems is that
we're so self-obsessed that we have not dealt with the rest of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Haass, who worked on the National Security
Council during the Bush administration, and the other experts said
there was no lingering doubt that Saddam was a rogue, and that none
of the questions about the military operation suggested any support
for him, nor any question that it was time for him to exit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would withhold judgment until we know the impact, until we
know how much damage this has done to his power structure, or
psychological damage to those around him,'' said Kemp. ``In other
words, this may be a more effective strike than it appears, and we
could be lucky, and hasten his demise. On the other hand, if this
is not the case, and Saddam is still there, and he has a lot of
physical damage he can exploit, and he still has his weapons of
mass destruction, we would begin to see a significant erosion of
support.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The raw passions were such that the House Democrats
did not to hesitate to bellow ``You resign! You resign!'' at
Speaker-elect Robert Livingston when he called from the House floor
for President Clinton to quit the White House in the face of
certain impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Shockingly, stunningly, Livingston did just that.
</P>
<P>
   He quit in one breathtaking utterance, as if flicking a trump
card onto the heap of impeachment angst festering before his eyes
in the debating chamber.
</P>
<P>
   In his one and only strategem in leading his fellow House
Republicans, Livingston's decision struck Congress like a verbal
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned Democrats saw their fury vaporized upon the instant.
They had to stand, almost staggering to their feet, to join the
Republicans in a prolonged, emotional ovation for Livingston and
his undeniable self-sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   As they stood, the Democrats sensed Livingston had most suddenly
closed a trap on the president and his defenders. For, with the
impeachment issue set to move to the Senate, Livingston, whose own
marital indiscretions were now before the public to his obvious
misery, chose to show how the question of a political leader's
resignation was very much in play in this tumult-tossed city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must set the example that I hope President Clinton will
follow,'' Livingston declared, flabbergasting all attending the
impeachment debate and the nation watching beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston walked off the floor like the sheriff in some
bullet-pocked political ``High Noon,'' discarding the leadership
badge he had wrested from the earlier speaker-casualty, Newt
Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   In the corridor just beyond, a doorman shouted to a police
officer: ``Livingston just resigned!''
</P>
<P>
   ``What? What?'' came the reply from the officer, who obviously
thought the momentous announcement would be about Clinton's
impeachment, not Livingston's political self-immolation.
</P>
<P>
   Just so, the Democrats, already deep into bone-raw exhaustion
after their long fight to save the president, grasped for bearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a surrender to a developing sexual McCarthyism!''
declared Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., a leading presidential
defender trying to rally Democrats around the argument that
Livingston should not resign any more than President Clinton should
quit under fire.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans were surging to the fore on the strength of
Livingston's announcement, fighting tears as they rose to salute
him as the ultimate political role model in the grueling
impeachment process as it roared into the final minutes of debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some it is no longer good enough to make a mistake, to
confirm that mistake and take the consequences of that mistake,''
said Tom DeLay, the Republican whip, his hands shaking, his eyes
tearing as he addressed the House and sought to drive the example
of Livingston all the way down Pennsylvania Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understood what this debate was all about _ honor, duty,
integrity and the truth,'' said DeLay arguing that in one swift
blow, Livingston had demonstrated himself to have been a far better
speaker than Clinton has been a president.
</P>
<P>
   With something of the political elan the president showed in
initiating the Iraq attack as his own impeachment loomed, House
Republicans, battered in public opinion polls, had found a rocket's
red glare of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have hurt you all deeply and beg your forgiveness,''
Livingston told the House, the nation and his family as he
announced retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Only moments before, Democrats openly hissed the man as
Livingston firmly read his own judgment upon the president: ``Sir,
you have done great damage to this nation over the past year.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidential resignation was in order, he continued, and then
came the shouts of ``You resign! You resign!''
</P>
<P>
   And as Livingston closed the circle on his career, he stunned
the place into a collective breath of disbelief and somehow almost
threatened to reduce the dark historic issue before the House _ the
impeachment of the president _ into a matter of anticlimax.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must not succeed,'' David Bonior, the Democratic whip
said of the Republicans as he was given the task of refocusing the
day on the misdeeds of the president, not the departure of the
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here to debate impeachment and should not be distracted
from that,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way we can stop this vicious cycle,'' Bonior cried
out from the floor, ``is if we refuse to give into it, whether it
is Bill Clinton or Bob Livingston.''
</P>
<P>
   But the House was still reeling through the frenzied day as the
fateful vote on the presidency approached and the notion of
resignation licked about the capital city like a flame in a forest.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Bob Livingston, who confessed to his
colleagues Thursday night that he had had adulterous affairs,
stunned the House chamber Saturday morning by saying in the
impeachment debate on President Clinton that he would not serve as
speaker and would quit Congress in six months. He urged the
president to follow his example and quit, too.
</P>
<P>
   But at the White House, where calls for Clinton's resignation
are derided as a Republican strategy, the president sent a
spokesman into the driveway to urge Livingston to reconsider his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston stood in the well of the House he has served for two
decades and called on Clinton to resign his office rather than
force a trial in the Senate, drawing boos from his colleagues and
cat-calls that he should quit instead.
</P>
<P>
   He then did just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must set the example that I hope President Clinton will
follow,'' Livingston announced to a shocked and silent chamber in
an act that left the Republican Party in total chaos just hours
before the vote to impeach Clinton. The decision also left the
party leaderless on the eve of the opening of the 106th Congress,
when Republicans must govern with one of the narrowest majorities
in history.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans, including Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the
majority whip, somberly welcomed the news, suggesting it relieved
them of an excruciating embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   In lauding Livingston's move, DeLay said, ``He understood what
this debate was all about _ it's about honor and decency and
integrity and the truth, everything we honor in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats said they were aghast, and many _ including
Clinton _ called on Livingston to reconsider his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Livingston's resignation was wrong,'' declared Rep.
Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. ``It is a surrender to a developing sexual
McCarthyism. Are we going to have a new test if someone wants to
run for public office _ are you now or have you ever been an
adulterer?'' He called on the country to distinguish between sins
and crimes.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton was
``disappointed'' at the news of Livingston's plans and wished that
he would reconsider. Lockhart said the president ``firmly believes
that the politics of personal destruction in this town and this
country has to come to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   He reaffirmed that Clinton would not resign, saying: ``The
president is going to do what's in the best interest of the
country. It would be wrong to give in to this insidious politics of
personal destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's announced resignation was all the more stunning for
its disclosure in a process that could result in the president's
removal from office. The speaker is second in line to the
presidency, after the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich, the outgoing speaker, who was driven from the
post after Republicans lost five seats in the November election,
technically remains speaker until Jan. 6, when Livingston's
election was to be ratified by the new Congress. But Gingrich has
removed himself from the daily operations of the House at this
extraordinary session and has begun to dismantle his office.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's decision was said to be driven in part by the anger
of a group of about a dozen conservatives in his party who were
disillusioned that he had withheld news of his affairs from them.
They had threatened to withhold their votes for him in the election
in January that would formally make him speaker. He was also
concerned about the pain caused to his family by further
disclosures, some members said. They added that, not lost on many
in his party, was the example he would set for the president by
offering to resign his post now.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, No. 3 in the House Republican leadership, is expected to
fill the power vacuum at least temporarily, in deed if not in
title, while the party regroups to find a new speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Many members quickly rallied around Rep. Dennis Hastert of
Illinois. Hastert, one of DeLay's deputy whips who is well
respected among his colleagues, had been promoted as a candidate
for majority leader last month, but never mounted a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Armey of Texas only precariously held on to his
majority-leader post last month and was not considered a likely
candidate for speaker. He is expected to manage the reorganization,
which Republican leaders have set for Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston met privately with his closest advisers Friday as the
impeachment debate unfolded. Some of his colleagues believed he had
made a mistake in disclosing Thursday night _ just as the House was
moving into the divisive debate over impeachment _ that he had ``on
occasion strayed from my marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   He told Republican leaders late Thursday afternoon that Hustler
magazine was going to expose his affairs early next year. Some
leaders urged him to keep quiet, but his wife, Bonnie, encouraged
him to tell his colleagues immediately, despite the momentous vote
that was nearing on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   At that point Thursday night, Roll Call, a newspaper on Capitol
Hill, reported on its Web site that Livingston was going to admit
to the affairs and was going to offer to resign. In a closed-door
meeting with his fellow Republicans, he did admit to the affairs
but made no offer to step down, receiving three standing ovations
instead.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Hustler publisher Larry Flynt told a news conference
in Los Angeles that his investigators had found four women who said
they had been sexually involved with Livingston over the last 10
years. Flynt, who said he wanted to expose the ``hypocrisy'' on
Capitol Hill, had offered $1 million to anyone who could prove
sexual indiscretions by members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Livingston stated that he would ``not be
intimidated by these efforts'' to exploit his past. But Friday he
removed himself from public action and that night drew his closest
advisers into his confidence. His aides said Saturday that they had
no clue what was he was contemplating, and few other members were
aware of his plans.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had any advance word, Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, a
newly elected member of the Republican leadership, said: ``I had no
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there had been internal party pressure on Livingston to
resign, Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., said: ``I didn't know about it
if there was,'' but added, ``There were some members who were
critical of it.''
</P>
<P>
   As the leaders tried Saturday to hold the party together on and
off the House floor, most Republicans stuck to their prepared
scripts on the floor in favor of impeaching the president. But some
began expressing their anguish.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who admitted to his own adulterous
affair earlier this year, said after Livingston's resignation:
``Those of us who are sinners must feel wretched today. Something
is going on repeatedly that has to be stopped, and that is a
confusion between private acts of infidelity and public acts.''
</P>
<P>
   To much applause, Hyde declared: ``Congress has no business
intruding into private acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, indeed Livingston himself, had made this same
distinction between Clinton's sexual indiscretions and
Livingston's, saying that Clinton lied about his private acts and
therefore abused the legal system and his powers. As Livingston
said in his statement Thursday: ``These indiscretions were not with
employees on my staff and I have never been asked to testify under
oath about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats hoped that Livingston's seemingly drastic action would
wake up the House to how poisoned the atmosphere had become and
might prompt Republicans to reconsider the impeachment of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., said, ``We are now starting to offer
up sacrificial lambs to whatever terrible disease this is.''
</P>
<P>
   In a stirring speech applauded even by some Republicans, Rep.
Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, praised
Livingston as a ``worthy, good and honorable man'' and said his
resignation was a grave mistake. ``It's a terrible capitulation to
the negative political forces that are consuming our political
system and our country,'' Gephardt said, adding that the events of
the last few days showed ``life imitates farce.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to stop destroying imperfect people at an unattainable
altar of public morality,'' he said, urging his colleagues to
``step back from the abyss'' and reject resignation, impeachment
and ``vicious self-righteousness.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The only thing certain now is uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   The smart money shouts that President Clinton will never resign,
and he concurs. The smart money argues that the Senate could not
muster the 67 votes that would be needed to remove the wounded
president from office, which would require the defection of 12
Democrats if all the Republicans stand against him. The smart money
insists that someone will cut a deal to end all this.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But the smarter money whispers, ``Remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember that everyone in Washington, including Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said the House would
never, ever, treat impeachment as a partisan issue. Wrong. Remember
that all the pundits predicted Democratic losses in the midterm
elections, and when the opposite happened, they said impeachment
was dead. Twice wrong.
</P>
<P>
   And remember that in the New Year the nation may travel down a
road it has never traveled before. One other president, Andrew
Johnson of Tennessee, has been tried by the Senate, of course. But
that happened in a different country _one with only 37 states, with
primitive communications, with a simple economy based largely on
agriculture, with only minimal commitments abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In the toxic politics of century's end in Washington, the
inconceivable has become the commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   The wholly unanticipated announcement Saturday morning by Rep.
Robert Livingston, R-La., that he would not serve as speaker and
would resign from Congress, following his equally unanticipated
disclosure on Thursday night of several extramarital affairs, only
deepened the capital's profound sense of insecurity. The deadly
sweep of the scythe of neo-puritanism appears unstoppable, at least
for the moment, and Livingston's forthcoming resignation will
increase the pressure on the president to do likewise.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've set before us an example,'' the leader of House
Republican majority, Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, told Livingston
Saturday. ``The example is that principle comes before power.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats made the opposite point, arguing that the
Livingston case showed how very wrong it was to savage people for
personal pecaddillos.
</P>
<P>
   One transcendently important thing remains the same: Although
surrounded by judicial trappings and presided over by the chief
justice, trials of presidents are political processes, with power
residing in the hands of elective politicians. In addition to
narrow legal issues of guilt or innocence, they can weigh
considerations of party, the nation's future, their own individual
political well-being and almost anything else they care to weigh in
reaching a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The longer they took, the more numerous the call for resignation
would probably be. Even before Saturday's epochal roll-calls, four
of ten Americans interviewed in the latest New York Times/CBS News
Poll said they thought the president should step down if he were to
be indicted, despite the fact that a large majority voiced
disapproval of the impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   What lies behind that seeming contradiction, of course, is the
fear that Clinton, and the country with him, would be
incapacitated. No one took Andrew Johnson very seriously after he
escaped conviction by a single vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, a man of powerful will whose whole life has been a
series of comebacks, has already embarked on an effort to show that
he can do the nation's business. Richard Nixon clawed his way back
to respectability after leaving the White House when no one thought
he could; Clinton intends to re-establish his authority while still
in office. He has one great advantage: Two-thirds of the American
public continues to voice its approval of his political
stewardship, whatever it thinks of him as a man.
</P>
<P>
   The president will press hard, despite his much-reduced
leverage, for a deal on censure. Indeed, in as fine a piece of
political irony as one could ask for, he has already sought to
enlist former Sen. Bob Dole, the Republican he defeated in 1996, as
an emissary to the Senate majority. The numbers are not
unpromising: with the help of six Republicans, the 45 Democrats
could end the trial at any time and pass a censure resolution that
the House would surely take up.
</P>
<P>
   There are enough Republican moderates and sometime party-buckers
to make that a plausible target. But the Republican leader in the
Senate, Trent Lott of Mississippi, who has made his unwillingness
to take the president's word plainly evident in recent days, is
determined to fight such a trial-aborting arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that Clinton's reputation has been stained forever,
no matter what the Senate does. The spot will not out. History will
remember this man who so coveted a glowing legacy not as an
impresario of economic growth, not as the Moses who pointed the way
to the 21st century, but as the second president ever to be
impeached, if not as the first to be ousted.
</P>
<P>
   That harsh word, ``impeachment,'' will cling to his name as
surely as ``Teapot Dome'' clings to Harding's and ``Depression'' to
Hoover's.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But he is not alone in having suffered grievous injury in the
political avalanche that was shaken loose by the disclosure of
Clinton's sexual relationship with a former White House intern,
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' public support has shriveled to 40 percent in
the new Times/CBS News poll, its lowest level in 14 years, and it
could go lower once the fact of impeachment sinks in. Journalists
are seen by many as jackals, indifferent to whatever personal
suffering or national angst they may cause as long as they get the
story, and none too concerned about accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the whole political culture of the 1990s, with its
criminalization of political conduct and its seeming indifference
to important national and international issues, has fallen into
disrepute with ordinary Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The last week seemed to crystallize the long-term decline in
political civility. Republicans called Clinton a liar, even as he
was committing American pilots to the skies over Iraq, and
Democrats accused their rivals of conducting a political lynching
or a political coup d'etat.
</P>
<P>
   Bipartisanship may have been the biggest victim of all. Party
lines on Saturday's rolls calls held as firm as leg irons. Almost
all of the Republicans who opposed impeachment did so not
exclusively on legal principle but at least partly because of
special political circumstances _ the Democratic majority in Rep.
Constance Morella's district in the Maryland suburbs of Washington,
for example, and the gratitude of Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., for
Clinton's peacemaking in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to see who has emerged from it with reputation
enhanced, except perhaps Hillary Rodham Clinton, staunch in the
face of deception.
</P>
<P>
   If some of the threats and dire predictions uttered by House
Democrats in recent days are to be taken at face value, the nation
is entering upon an Era of Bad Feelings, the polar opposite of a
second Era of Good Feelings, similar to that of the 1820s, that
Clinton had hoped to preside over.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Sawyer, D-Ohio, compared Clinton on Friday to Sir
Thomas More, executed for treason in 1535 because of his religious
beliefs. He quoted More's words as an admonition for today: ``What
you have hunted me for is not my actions but for the thoughts of my
heart. It is a long road you have opened. God help the statesmen
who walk your road.''
</P>
<P>
   But amidst all the loose talk about permanent damage to this
institution or that, remember: Things change with startling speed
in modern American politics, and the institutions of American
government have proved extraordinarily resilient. President Nixon,
it was almost universally agreed in 1974, had weakened the American
presidency for many decades to come. Nobody said that after eight
years under Ronald Reagan, and that was only 15 years later.

 IN SMALL MEASURE OF VINDICATION, B-1s SEE COMBAT  
(See also IRAQ-RDP, IRAQ-HIDE, IRAQ-POLICY, IRAQ-ENTERPRISE,
IRAQ-U.S.-ARABS.) (jt) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After three decades of controversy, $30 billion and
a series of mishaps, one of the nation's most costly and most
troubled combat aircraft _ the B-1 bomber _ flew into combat for
the first time this week.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the four B-1 bombers based in Oman since November joined
in the second day of attacks against Iraq on Thursday, striking a
military complex near Baghdad with a torrent of 500-pound bombs
before flying back safely to their base with at least a small
measure of vindication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, vindication might not be the right word,'' said Col.
Tony Przybyslawski, commanding officer of the Air Force's 28th Bomb
Wing at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, where two dozen
B-1s are based. Nonetheless, he continued, ``Everyone here is
really thrilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Combat is a milestone that few thought the B-1 would ever reach.
Never before in the nation's military-industrial history, it is
fair to say, has so much energy been expended to build so many
bombers that have accomplished so little. President Nixon first
approved the development of the B-1 in 1970 to replace the nation's
aging fleet of B-52s, which served as the mainstay of any nuclear
strike against the Soviet Union. (Today's fleet of B-52s came off
the assembly line in 1961 and 1962 and are expected to fly well
into the 21st Century.)
</P>
<P>
   By 1977, with the B-1 program beset with design flaws and cost
overruns, President Carter killed the bomber. President Reagan gave
it new life in 1981 after using its demise during his election
campaign to attack Carter as weak on defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force rolled out the first of 100 B-1s in 1986, but
problems had only just begun. In a little more than a year, three
crashed. One went down over Colorado when a bird pierced its
fuselage and ripped its hydraulic lines apart. In 1991, a study
concluded it could not fly in the snow. It sat out the Persian Gulf
war because of engine problems.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, some question whether the 92 B-1s left have much of a
mission. The long, sleek bombers, with swept-back wings for
supersonic flight at low or high altitudes, was designed to
penetrate Soviet airspace to deliver nuclear weapons, but President
Bush ordered it refitted to carry conventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The B-1s first combat mission underscored its ongoing evolution.
In a campaign that has been dominated by laser- and
satellite-guided missiles and ``smart'' bombs, the two bombers
dropped old-fashioned ``dumb'' ones in what is traditionally known
as ``carpet bombing.'' Over the next few years, all the B-1s will
be adapted to carry the ``smart'' weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Vice Adm. Scott Fry, director of operations for the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, said Saturday that the Pentagon had not yet been able to
assess the damage done by the bombers' strikes, which continued on
the third night of the attack on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the pilots, Stephen Wolborsky, himself on his first
combat mission, left little doubt there was a sense of
accomplishment. ``The adrenaline was pumping,'' he said on the
phone from Oman after his flight on Thursday. ``There was a certain
amount of excitement for myself, our crew and the two ships.''

EDITORIAL: A TRIAL FOR THE SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Dec. 20:
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' drive for a partisan impeachment based soley on
party-line voting power rather than any sense of proportion
produced an unexpected sideshow in the resignation of Rep. Bob
Livingston from his role as future speaker of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts on both sides of the struggle over President Clinton's
future will point to Livingston's downfall as evidence of a
generalized breakdown in legislative civility on Capitol Hill.
Democrats will see a moral symmetry, depicting Livingston as a
victim of the sexual puritanism he was wielding against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the one thing that no one should fall for is Livingston's
invitation to use his resignation as a model for resolving the
crisis at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's statement rocked Congress, but it should not shake
the foundations of the somber constitutional process now underway.
By lying under oath, Clinton made it necessary for the House to
consider impeachment. The evidence convinced most Americans that
the president should be censured, but not removed from office.
Livingston allowed GOP partisans to block censure in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that after Saturday's expected impeachment vote,
after Livingston's unexpected announcement, the mission of the
Senate remains the same. It must resist those Republicans who want
to short-circuit the constitutional process with demands for
resignation, and it must use the upcoming Senate trial as a forum
for finding a censure commensurate with the president's personal
dishonesty and offenses against the law.
</P>
<P>
   These require stern punishment but not removal from office. In
undertaking this work, the Senate must also reassure the American
people that a decisive wisdom at the core of our messy-looking
political system has not melted down.
</P>
<P>
   In such distempered times, this is a shining opportunity for the
Senate. Its members pride themselves on being the Republic's fire
wall against presidential excess and the popular or partisan
passions that sometimes seize the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   No one can predict whether Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
will rise to the defining challenge of his career or whether he
will surrender to the mean streak he acquired during 16 grumpy
years as a minority member of the House. We would like to see Lott
reach for a starring role in history.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's growling response to questions about censure is not
encouraging. He may be right that the Constitution requires him to
convene a trial, but nothing in that document prevents him from
speedily guiding the Senate toward censure negotiations. Indeed, a
simple majority vote _ 45 Democrats plus 6 cooperating Republicans
_ can end the Senate trial at any time, clearing the way for
introduction of the kind of censure resolution suggested by former
Sen. Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   In an intriguing report on NBC, Tim Russert described
discussions among a bipartisan group of senators about a censure
that would involve some form of presidential confession, a fine and
a joint congressional request that Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr not prosecute Clinton in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   If Lott refuses to allow a bipartisan search for censure, the
burden will fall upon respected members like Joseph Lieberman on
the Democratic side and Orrin Hatch for the Republicans. Through
cooperation, they can guide the Senate toward a punishment that
fixes Clinton in history as a president who lied under oath, but
avoids the taint of partisan vengeance associated with the House
impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's historic reputation for prudence requires it to
find appropriate punishment for a personally weak president who has
damaged the rule of law, but not threatened the stability of the
government.

DEARBORN, MICH.: A HEAVILY ARABIC CITY DIVIDED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)   (See also IRAQ-RDP, IRAQ-HIDE, IRAQ-POLICY, IRAQ-ENTERPRISE,
IRAQ-B1-BOMBER.) (jw) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ The latest American attack on Iraq has divided
this city, which has the nation's largest concentration of
Arab-Americans, for while Saddam Hussein is almost universally
loathed, opinions differ on whether renewed air strikes will do any
good.
</P>
<P>
   At the Baghdadi Restaurant here in Detroit's western suburbs,
the mere mention of the American raids draws the owner and a
handful of customers into an angry discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Even though all of them fled southern Iraq after Saddam, the
country's president, suppressed a rebellion at the end of the
Persian Gulf War in 1991, none have anything good to say about the
American attack and all are convinced that Iraqi civilians will
suffer more than their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about every Iraqi knows that this operation is directed
toward the Iraqi people,'' said Mohammed Al-Alawi, a retired
transportation company manager. ``The infrastructure being
destroyed, the hospitals being destroyed, does not hurt Saddam, it
hurts the Iraqi people.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the Cedarland Restaurant, a popular Lebanese-American
gathering place a few blocks away, opinions of the attack were more
favorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good idea,'' said Sam Sobh, the restaurant's owner,
adding that while he worried about the suffering of the Iraqi
people, he was also concerned about reports of Iraq's weapons
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the United States bombs Iraq, many Arab-Americans find
themselves asked for their reactions. But the nation's
Arab-American population is far from monolithic.
</P>
<P>
   James Zogby, the president of the Arab American Institute, said
noted the differences of opinion, but said that a consensus still
existed among Arab-Americans on some issues. There is a consensus
that Saddam should be removed, and yet general agreement too that
economic sanctions are ineffective and cause excessive hardship for
the Iraqi people, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On military action, he acknowledged, ``There is a range of
opinion, there's no doubt about it.'' Still, Zogby insisted that
``a majority view would not support the bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   That is particularly true here in Dearborn, where auto factory
jobs began attracting Arab immigrants in the 1920s. Further waves
of immigrants have been lured by the hundreds of businesses in the
city with Arabic signs and Arabic-speaking staffs.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Iraqis have fled to the Detroit area since the end
of the Gulf War, joining an already large Iraqi-American
population. But while sentiment among them is vehemently critical
of Saddam, there has been little support for another round of
American air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   An Iraqi-American gas station owner paused while buying baklava
at a pastry shop here to express his dismay. ``This conflict
against Saddam, it is hurting the people, not Saddam,'' he said,
insisting on anonymity because he still has relatives in Iraq.
``Saddam is hard to catch, it's hard to find Saddam. Will America
go after him house to house? It's a loser.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Iraqi-Americans at the Baghdadi Restaurant, a 40-seat diner
nearby with a large, open grill, were also upset that the American
strategy seemed to be aimed more at destroying Iraqi weapons of
mass destruction than at removing Saddam from power. The strong
sentiment was that President Clinton was less interested in
bringing democracy to Iraq than in avoiding impeachment, and was
risking the lives of Iraqi civilians in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Mahb, the restaurant's owner, expressed the common
suspicion that the United States could use satellite reconnaissance
to find Saddam and could figure out a way to remove him, but chose
not to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to get rid of Saddam Hussein, they can do it in
two hours,'' Mahb insisted. ``Whenever they want to keep the news
busy, away from their problems, they take Saddam off the shelf.''
</P>
<P>
   This city's large population of Lebanese-Americans, many of
whose families have been here for several generations, have been a
little more willing to accept military action. But many are also
worried that Arab lives could be lost while Saddam might escape
unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you bomb the city, you're not going to kill him because
he's in hiding,'' said Mark Shiblaq, an automotive purchasing
manager, as he paid for his shish kebab at the Cedarland
Restaurant. ``I have a real problem with smart bombs that are not
so smart.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the House voted on impeachment, President
Clinton had already worked out a strategy to govern as no president
has for 130 years, under impeachment and in the glare of Senate
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is planning a much more aggressive defense of
Clinton's conduct before the Senate than it presented to the House,
alongside a blaze of campaign-style events early next year to
promote his policies around the country.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, his senior aides spent more than two hours
discussing proposals for his State of the Union Message next year,
even as they monitored the turbulent debate before the impeachment
votes on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating Republican resistance to any legislation backed by
Clinton, his aides are prepared to argue that the Republicans are
in effect shutting down the government for partisan reasons, once
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans run a risk if they pursue a strategy that puts
America's interest last,'' warned Joe Lockhart, the White House
press secretary. ``The public has a certain amount of tolerance for
partisan politics, and they've had just about enough.''
</P>
<P>
   But even some of the president's loyalists wonder if this
approach _ versions of which he has used time and again to battle
back from political reversals _ will work now, in the untried,
complex political environment he enters with Saturday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way he's going to be able to get anything done,''
said Leon Panetta, the former chief of staff. ``It's very tough to
get anybody's attention when there's a train going by behind you.
They'll see your lips moving, but they won't hear anything.''
</P>
<P>
   White House aides as well as outside experts argue that Clinton
will retain a stronger hand in foreign policy, where the chief
executive is always freer to act. The real question, they say, is
whether he can promote his ideas domestically, against contemptuous
opposition in the legislative branch.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been acting on a lesson he has repeated to his aides
since he first confronted national scandal as a candidate in 1992:
``If I make this about their life, rather than mine, we'll all be
better off,'' as one Clinton adviser recalled it on Friday. But
Republicans will try to make it about him, the White House expects,
arguing that he should resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not resigning,'' one of Clinton's closest advisers said.
``It's just not in his nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment and the Senate trial, together with the venom
coursing through Washington, could guarantee legislative stalemate
well into 1999, in the view of White House aides and other
political experts.
</P>
<P>
   But the president will be ready to present himself as bursting
with ideas. For weeks now, Clinton has been meeting behind closed
doors at the White House to pick budget priorities for next year
and to tote up his annual laundry list for the State of the Union
address. He will promote those ideas, many of which are poll-tested
for popularity, in a trip around the country immediately after the
speech, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Topping that list this year is a plan to fix Social Security,
which the White House is still formulating. For years, Clinton has
counted on achieving entitlement reform as a lasting
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is also planning to push for more spending for
school construction, tax cuts for scientific research, and
regulation of managed care plans. The president wants to present a
plan to cut smoking among children, and to revive a call to tighten
the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   In foreign affairs, Clinton can also expect challenges to
authority, which began even before he ordered strikes on Iraq last
week. But the United States _ and the executive branch _ still
wields so much clout in foreign affairs that Clinton is likely to
keep more room to maneuver overseas. With the continued support of
leaders like Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain also giving
Clinton some shelter, the White House is sketching out foreign
travel for him next year.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over, Clinton's aides in recent conversations recalled
the battles fought and won over the last six years, when the
``chattering classes'' _ as they uniformly refer to almost anyone
on the margins of professional politics _ counted them out: The
health care debacle of 1994; the budget shutdowns of 1995; and even
1998, when Clinton managed to achieve many of his budget priorities
despite the furor over his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of Bill Clinton,'' said Don Baer, a former senior
aide, ``is that when he does come back _ as I think he will again _
he's always stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahm Emanuel, another former adviser with close ties to Clinton,
provided a preview of the likely White House line of attack: ``One
way or another, they've determined to have another lockdown of the
government, and you can't allow that kind of political carelessness
to govern.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the argument that the Republicans are obstructionist may not
work after the House of Representatives has branded Clinton unfit
for office.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Clinton were a Franklin Roosevelt, and if his agenda were,
say, Roosevelt's agenda of 1935 _ with Social Security and rural
electrification and aid to farms _ then that argument on Clinton's
part would be much more persuasive,'' said William Leuchtenburg, a
professor of history at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill. ``But this is a man who ended the welfare system, who said
the era of big government is over, who has been advocating programs
such as putting school children in uniforms. There's not a lot of
Clinton program to rally around.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than simply block the president's program, Republicans,
with new leadership in the House, may try to push their own
proposals through, to capitalize on and underscore his weakness.
But a larger House Democratic minority in the next Congress and an
infuriated White House are likely to block any such move.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said they would welcome any ensuing debate.
``We'd like nothing better,'' said one senior adviser. ``It's the
reason why we cleaned house in '98.''
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton's strategy works, and he survives the Senate trial,
his own urge to score some legislative achievements may cause
dissension within the Democratic Party. Congressional Democrats
will be more interested in storing up frustrated goals to run on in
2000 than in passing legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see a very delicate situation between the president
and the Democrats,'' Panetta said.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton is pushing his policy proposals, an expanded team
of presidential defenders will be fighting conviction by the
Senate. White House aides said the model would be the two days of
defense before the House, rather than the many weeks of White House
complacency about accusations against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being frustrated at their own lackluster defense
after the midterm elections, Clinton's aides are very angry.
``We're going to fight it aggressively,'' said Douglas Sosnik,
Clinton's senior adviser. ``The vote in the House was not on the
level, and people know that. And our people are motivated, they
know that the president was not treated fairly. This was not about
facts or the law, it was about politics and trying to get the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   While the White House had only weak links to the House
Democrats, four of Clinton's senior aides have strong ties to the
Senate, including to such prominent Republicans as Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Judiciary Committee. John Podesta,
the chief of staff; Gregory Craig, the special counsel; Steve
Ricchetti, the deputy chief of staff, and Sosnik have all worked as
Senate aides.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also trying to recruit George Mitchell, the former
Senate majority leader, to help with his defense.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to tap a vein of discontent over the House's action, the
White House, perhaps through the Democratic party, plans to
encourage public pressure on the Senate not to convict. ``We're
going to take this thing to the country,'' said one aide to
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And James Carville, the longtime Clinton strategist, said he
would form a political organization _ perhaps a political action
committee _ to hold Republicans accountable for their impeachment
votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to get the blame for doing this,'' he said.
``They've put something into motion, and they're going to have to
live with the consequences of it.''

MALAYSIA'S LEADER RIDES OUT TURMOIL, HELPED BY ANGER AT GORE
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
appears to be serenely back in control of events in his country
after three months of political turmoil that included a public
scolding by Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Street demonstrations that sought to duplicate the protests that
brought down Indonesia's president, Suharto, have petered out.
Public enthusiasm for the protests did not seem strong enough to
overcome a general political apathy and an aggressive reaction by
the police.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, whose
dismissal and imprisonment in September touched off the
demonstrations, has degenerated into an undignified soap opera of
lurid sexual charges and cat fights among lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   All this is not to say that Mahathir's troubles are over. He has
embarked on an experiment of economic nationalism that many outside
experts say could bring ruin to both the nation and its leader. He
has created, by his treatment of Anwar, a reform backlash that
still festers and could flare again. And his actions have opened
the way for a variety of possible challenges, from democrats to
radical Moslems to political opportunists.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar is charged with five counts of sexual misconduct and five
counts of corruption. Most of the corruption charges involve
accusations that he tried to cover up sexual indiscretions. The
week before last, one of the main witnesses against him, his wife's
former driver, appeared to contradict earlier testimony that Anwar
had sodomized him. But there was a possibility that the driver,
Azizan Abu Bakar, had misunderstood a question and Anwar's lawyer
was careful to drop the matter and let the confusion remain.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the high point of the trial came when the prosecution
dragged a queen-sized brown mattress into court, asserting that it
was used by Anwar for trysts with the wife of his former secretary
and that it was stained with his semen. Prosecutors said DNA tests
were being conducted. Anwar, in the dock, responded by smiling,
folding his hands beside his head and making a gesture of sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   As the humiliation of Anwar, his protege, proceeded, Mahathir
made a show of rising above the fray.
</P>
<P>
   He has not commented recently on the trial and he has brushed
aside Gore's remarks. During a meeting of Asian leaders in Kuala
Lumpur last month, Gore offended many Malaysians by speaking
bluntly about the harsh treatment of Anwar and praising protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir also seemed pleased to be the target of an attack by
international financier George Soros, who suggested that the prime
minister should step down for the good of his country. ``Soros can
speak until he is blue in the face,'' Mahathir said. ``It makes no
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir, who has ruled Malaysia for 17 years, will turn 73 this
month. Until he turned against his deputy and heir apparent,
Malaysia had been respected as one Asian nation where the question
of succession was not an issue.
</P>
<P>
   But differences over economic policy and a veiled challenge in
June by supporters of Anwar for leadership of the government party
appear to have caused Mahathir's angry reaction against him.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister said Thursday that he was thinking of naming
a replacement for Anwar before a party congress set for next year.
Asked what qualities he might be looking for in a deputy, Mahathir
replied with what appeared to be a joke, ``An exact replica of
myself, if it is possible.''

SALE PLANNED FOR DIARIES OF MISSING ATHEIST LEADER
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The deepest secrets and innermost thoughts of
America's most famous atheist are for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Madalyn Murray O'Hair, who founded the nation's leading atheist
group, American Atheists Inc., in the 1960s and vanished in 1995,
left behind a stack of diaries that will be sold next month to
satisfy a claim against her estate brought by the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   The handwritten diaries, more than a thousand pages long, begin
in 1953 and end abruptly, just seven weeks before Mrs. O'Hair
disappeared along with her son Jon Garth Murray and granddaughter,
Robin Murray-O'Hair. The three have not been seen or heard from
since Sept. 29, 1995. And despite a worldwide search, no
substantive clues to their whereabouts have been found.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Ingalls, a lawyer and bankruptcy trustee who was
appointed to oversee the liquidation of Mrs. O'Hair's estate, said
he had ``no idea'' of the worth of the diaries and other personal
documents offered for sale, which include Mrs. O'Hair's birth
certificate, military service record and marriage license. But he
said he hoped to get enough money to pay a $250,000 claim the IRS
has lodged against Mrs. O'Hair's estate.
</P>
<P>
   Ingalls, who is storing the 2-foot-high stack of diaries at a
downtown Austin bank, has not set a date for the auction.
</P>
<P>
   A quick survey of the diaries reveals a woman very much
concerned with money, power and her waistline. On Jan. 6, 1973,
Mrs. O'Hair wrote her goals for the new year: ``Begin a Bible chair
at U. of Texas. Get a mink coat and a Cadillac car. Humiliate Billy
Graham, for money.'' There are several entries about her weight. On
April 23, 1976, she wrote: ``I am gaining weight like mad. I don't
feel well from it at all. Drastic, Madalyn, Drastic.''
</P>
<P>
   From a historical perspective, the diaries may be disappointing,
because there are no entries from 1959 to 1972, a period that was
perhaps the most intriguing one in Mrs. O'Hair's life. In 1960, she
filed a lawsuit against the Baltimore school district in an effort
to remove prayer from public schools. In 1963, she was a secondary
plaintiff in a case heard by the Supreme Court that resulted in a
ban on prayer in public schools. That same year, Mrs. O'Hair fled
to Mexico to evade charges of assaulting Baltimore policemen.
</P>
<P>
   However, the diaries contain several interesting historical
passages, including several about Larry Flynt, the publisher of
Hustler magazine. In 1984, when Flynt was sent to prison for
contempt of court, Mrs. O'Hair persuaded him to sign a power of
attorney that gave her control over all his assets, including
Hustler. But Mrs. O'Hair's gambit was thwarted by Flynt's brother.
</P>
<P>
   On March 16, 1984, Mrs. O'Hair wrote in her diary: ``I can't
believe the perfidy over the Larry Flynt deal. The whole gawd-dam
world is made up of liars, cheats &AMP; swindlers whose single driving
force is greed. Everyone sells out. Everyone can be bought.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Shaw, the vice president in charge of books and
manuscripts at Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield, a Los Angeles auction
house, said putting a value on the diaries was difficult because no
other historical figures could be compared to Mrs. O'Hair. But he
said he thought the diaries would not be worth more than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although the diaries may contain clues regarding the
disappearance of the three atheists, the final entries appear
rather pedestrian. On Aug. 1, 1995, while on vacation in Virginia
with her son and granddaughter, Mrs. O'Hair complained about the
cost of travel.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, the diaries may reveal Mrs. O'Hair's passion
for discord. ``What is the matter with hating?'' she wrote on Oct.
9, 1956. ``It is treated as a leper among the emotions. Why in the
hell should we go exuding sweetness &AMP; light?''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rejecting a last-minute Democratic attempt to
soften its action to censure, the House of Representatives moved to
impeach President William Jefferson Clinton for perjury on Saturday
and to call on the Senate to try him, convict him and remove him
from office.
</P>
<P>
   But even before the vote, Republicans pressed another line of
attack, demanding Clinton's resignation. Rep. Robert Livingston,
nominated for speaker last month by his party, startled the House
when he announced he would not run for speaker and would resign
from the House after 21 years of service.
</P>
<P>
   He urged the president to ``heal the wounds that you have
created. You, sir, may resign your post.'' Angry Democrats booed
and shouted, ``You resign!'' Livingston continued, ``I can only
challenge you in such fashion if I am willing to heed my own
words.''
</P>
<P>
   Apologizing again for extramarital affairs revealed two days
ago, he said, ``I believe I had it in me to do a fine job. But I
cannot do that job or be the kind of leader that I would like to be
under current circumstances.'' Then he bolted from the House
chamber, nearly knocking reporters and members down.
</P>
<P>
   (The House voted 228-206 to approve the first article of
impeachment, accusing Clinton of committing perjury before a
federal grand jury. The vote was announced at 1:24 p.m. EST,
leaving the 42nd president to face trial in the Senate on whether
he should be removed from office.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton rejected the advice immediately. His spokesman, Joe
Lockhart, said, ``The president has no intention of resigning.'' By
calling on Livingston to reconsider, the president argued more
broadly against resignation under fire. Perhaps speaking to both
cases, Lockhart said, ``It would be wrong to give in to this
insidious politics of personal destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless Clinton changes course, this would be only the second
impeachment of a president in the 209-year history of the Republic,
and the first since Andrew Johnson was acquitted in 1868. Sen.
Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, has insisted that
no bargaining over censure can prevent it from starting. But the
Senate could halt a trial later as part of a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the degree of partisanship displayed Saturday,
assembling the two-thirds majority required under the Constitution
for conviction is most unlikely. Sixty-seven votes would be
required, and there are only 55 Republicans in the Senate, along
with 45 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Four articles of impeachment before the House charged Clinton
with perjury in lying about his affair with Monica Lewinsky to a
federal grand jury here on Aug. 17. He was also charged with
perjury in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit, obstruction of
justice and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican argument, over and over, was that Clinton had
lied in denying having sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky. Rep.
Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, said, ``A nation of laws
cannot be ruled by a person who breaks the law.'' Rep. Nancy
Johnson of Connecticut said: ``There can be no justice without the
truth. That is just profoundly so, and that is why perjury
matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gerald Kleczka of Wisconsin began the Democrats' arguments
by saying, ``What the president did was wrong, both personally and
morally, but his acts did not threaten our democracy and thus do
not rise to the level of impeachable offenses as defined by our
founding fathers in our Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Schumer, New York's senator-elect, said: ``The rule
of law requires that the punishment fit the crime. Allow us to vote
for censure.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's votes were the penultimate step in the most serious
conflict between Congress and a president since Richard M. Nixon
resigned in the face of impeachment and certain conviction on Aug.
9, 1974.
</P>
<P>
   But while that case spun out from a 1972 break-in at Democratic
headquarters in the Watergate complex, this one began with a murky
land deal in Arkansas in 1978. Through the efforts of Kenneth
Starr, the independent counsel under the law enacted in the wake of
Watergate, the investigation spread to examine Clinton's affair
with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   All year it has preoccupied the capital despite an immense
disconnect with public opinion; since the scandal became public in
January, polls have shown that the public opposed impeachment and
wanted the inquiry brought to an end. Even on Friday night, after a
13-hour debate, a CBS News Poll of 548 people showed that only 38
percent wanted their representative to vote for impeachment; 58
percent wanted a no vote.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict now enters uncharted seas, since the Nixon
resignation cut the matter short and the Johnson trial occurred in
a different America, with no nuclear weapons or cable television or
public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   But the capital was still rife with confident speculation. Some
guessed, or hoped, that the results of the recent poll, which
showed increases in support for resignation as a way to spare the
nation a trial in which Ms. Lewinsky and Linda Tripp would be star
witnesses, would weaken Clinton's resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Others thought the Republicans, seeing dismal numbers in polls
about their party's standing in the United States, would be the
first to blink. With a majority in the Senate, they have the power
to end a trial at any time after the Senate receives notice of
impeachment on the day it convenes, Jan. 6, or the next day.
</P>
<P>
   But while Clinton has focused on the polls, and the CBS News
survey showed that 64 percent still approve of his handling of his
job as president, resignation could almost immediately subject him
to criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   And Republicans have steadfastly ignored the polls all year, and
confronted them directly on Saturday. Representative J.C. Watts of
Oklahoma, newly elected as chairman of the Republican caucus, said:
``What's popular isn't always right. You say polls are against
this. Polls measure changing feelings, not steadfast principle.
Polls would have rejected the Ten Commandments. Polls would have
embraced slavery and ridiculed women's rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``You say we must draw this to a close. I say we must draw a
line between right and wrong, not with a tiny fine line of an
executive fountain pen, but with the big fat lead of a No. 2
pencil. And we must do it so every kid in America can see it. The
point is not whether the president can prevail, but whether truth
can prevail.''

</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, when the Judiciary Committee recommended the four
articles of impeachment, Clinton's side still hoped to prevail with
the help of 20 to 30 Republican moderates who were uncommitted. As
the week wore on, almost all of them broke against the president.
</P>
<P>
   One who did not, Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut, said
Saturday: ``After Judge Starr's report to Congress in September,
and his presentation to the Judiciary Committee in November, I
concluded that impeachable offenses were not proven, and that the
proven offenses were not impeachable.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the president's continued failure to come to grips with
his actions, the sincerity and arguments of members of the
Judiciary Committee from both sides of the aisle, the change of
heart and conviction by members on my side of the aisle who
originally opposed impeachment and who now support it, and the
strong and powerful opinion of so many of my constituents who
oppose my position and who wanted the president impeached caused me
to rethink my position.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Yesterday morning, before I visited with the
president, I concluded that my original position was the correct
one, for me. I believe that the impeachable offenses have not been
proven, and that the proven offenses are not impeachable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, who has led the Republican effort
to force Clinton from office, dismissed his and other arguments as
moral relativism.
</P>
<P>
   He began by praising Livingston: ``There is no greater American
in my mind, at least today, than Bob Livingston, because he
understood what this debate was all about. It was about honor and
decency and integrity and the truth; everything that we honor in
this country. It was also a debate about relativism vs. absolute
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``The president's defenders have said that the
president is morally reprehensible, that he is reckless, that he
has violated the trust of the American people, lessened their
esteem for the office of president and dishonored the office which
they have entrusted him, and that _ but that doesn't rise to the
level of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jose Serrano of New York said, ``My constituents don't hate
Bill Clinton; they love him and they're praying for him right at
this very moment. You may have the votes today to impeach him, but
you don't have the American people. And let me tell you something,
I grew up in the public housing projects of the South Bronx. I can
see a bunch of bullies when I see them. The bullies get theirs, and
you're going to get yours, too.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the Judiciary Committee chairman
who brought the charges to the House floor, said the Congress and
the American people needed to distinguish between private acts of
infidelity and public acts by public officials. In Clinton's case,
he said, the House was dealing with ``a serial violator of the oath
who is the chief law-enforcement officer.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the Senate could be ``innovative and creative'' in
deciding how best to punish Clinton, but that the House was bound
by the Constitution to move ahead with articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice is so important to the most humble among us,'' Hyde
said. ``Equal justice under the law _ that's what we're fighting
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, reading from the same Constitution, voiced
diametrically opposite conclusions, and attacked the fairness of
the proceedings that culminated Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're losing track of distinction between sins and crimes,''
said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. ``We're lowering the standards of
impeachment. What the president has done is not a great and
dangerous offense to the republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also criticized Republicans for impeaching Clinton at
the very moment that U.S. troops waged war against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six days before Christmas our troops are in battle, and a
lame-duck Congress is rushing to overthrow the commander in
chief,'' said Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the second-ranking
House Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The ghosts of Watergate hung over the House chamber.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican cited the parallels between the charges the House
Judiciary Committee brought against Nixon 25 years ago, and the
counts that the same committee brought to the House floor for
affirmation on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nixon cheated. He cheated the electoral system,'' said Rep.
Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican on the Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Graham said, the full House is voting to impeach
Clinton ``because we believe he committed crimes that result in
cheating our judicial system.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of the day's debate was firmly rooted in Clinton's
effort to conceal his sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, a Georgia Republican on the Judiciary Committee
who is one of Clinton's fiercest critics, held up copies of the
U.S. Criminal Code, the Judiciary Committee's report on the
impeachment inquiry and, finally, the Constitution, in defending
his decision to impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we rely on the three pillars of our society: the law
itself, evidence and the Constitution,'' said Barr.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no joy in upholding the law,'' Watts said. ``If we
cannot see lawlessness, our children cannot recognize it. How can
we tell our children honesty is the best policy when we don't
demand it as a policy?''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats assailed the very premise on which the Republican
majority built its impeachment case against Clinton. Rep. John
Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary
Committee, assailed the four articles of impeachment, count by
count, as unfounded by evidence and failing to rise to impeachment.
He saved his most savage scorn for the final count, abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority has simply tried to dress up the perjury counts
in the Watergate abuse-of-power language,'' Conyers said.

AIRLINES MEETING DEADLINE TO GROUND NOISIEST PLANES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   (jw) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Airplane noise has gotten a lot softer, according
to the Federal Aviation Administration, and a 10-year program with
that in mind is approaching a pianissimo finale.
</P>
<P>
   But some airlines will face a last-minute rush to fix or retire
old planes next year, and one, a cargo carrier in Miami, will
ground some planes in January, until they can be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Under a law passed by Congress in 1990, the airlines have had to
steadily reduce the number of the noisiest airplanes they fly,
called Stage 2 planes; generally, by 1999, those planes must make
up less than one-quarter of the airlines' fleets, and by 2000, they
must be eliminated entirely. The first 25 percent cut was in 1994,
and the next in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The noise in and around all these airports we live near is
going to change a lot in the next 12 1/2 months,'' said James
Erickson, director of the FAA's office of environment and energy.
Steps so far have been helpful, he said, but ``phasing out that
last noisy airplane makes a tremendous difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The replacement planes, called Stage 3, are much quieter;
Erickson said that a Stage 2 McDonnell-Douglas DC-10, for example,
made as much noise as nine new Boeing 777s.
</P>
<P>
   Stage 2 planes include McDonnell Douglas DC-9s and older Boeing
727s and 737s; Stage 3 planes include newer models of the 727 and
737.
</P>
<P>
   The rules cover all planes over 75,000 pounds, including small
commuter planes but not some small corporate jets. The rules affect
about 7,500 planes registered in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Some airlines have already met the requirements for 2000. United
Parcel Service, the first to eliminate all its Stage 2 planes,
replaced the engines on its 727s to do so. UPS flies mostly at
night and often into small airports, and said it was eager to be a
good neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers lower engine noise by reducing the maximum speed at
which the engines move air. To get more thrust, newer engines move
more air than old ones.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are selling old planes overseas or retiring them, or
installing ``hush kits.'' American Airlines plans to make its 727s
comply with a system that limits engine thrust and flap settings.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA estimates that in 1975, 7 million people were exposed to
a noise level of 65 decibels from planes, considered undesirable.
By 1995, the number was down to 1.7 million, and by 2000, it will
be 600,000 people, the agency said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Erickson said that the agency had had 16 requests for
exemptions, and had turned down 15; one is still under
consideration. He added that his office was in regular contact with
all of the approximately 260 airlines that fly in the United
States, to ensure that they had plans to meet the rules.
</P>
<P>
   One, Fine Air Services Inc. of Miami, however, has had a
problem. The airline had counted in its fleet some Stage 2 planes
that it shared with other airlines. When the FAA said it could not
do so, Fine Air found that it was behind the required quota. So the
airline signed a consent decree in September, promising to convert
six of its old DC-8s by Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Two have been outfitted with hush kits, and equipment is on hand
to do four more, said John Zappia, the airline's chief operating
officer. The other four will be grounded on Dec. 26, after the busy
cargo season, and stay on the ground until work is finished,
sometime in January.

PARLIAMENTARY REPORT CITES FRENCH ERRORS IN RWANDA 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A parliamentary committee on French military involvement
in Rwanda before and during mass ethnic killings in 1994 has
concluded that successive governments in Paris made ``errors of
judgment,'' but it has absolved France of any responsibility for
the killings.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, led by former Defense Minister Paul Quiles, a
Socialist, was made up of legislators from both government and
opposition parties. It was formed this year, after Paris newspapers
charged that French military advisers had helped train the Rwandan
government forces and paramilitary militias that did much of the
killing.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps least surprising was its criticism of the United Nations
for delaying military action to stop the deaths of at least 500,000
people, most members of the minority Tutsi ethnic group, once
militias of the Hutu majority began the killing in April 1994.
French troops provided the backbone of a U.N. force that went in to
try to protect civilians in late June.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's report pinned blame for the delay on the
international community, led by the United States, which was
traumatized by the killings of American soldiers in Somalia the
previous year. Nor was Washington eager to approve expensive
military operations that would add to its mountain of unpaid U.N.
dues, the committee said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no whitewash of what it described as numerous French
failures. Neither Socialist nor conservative governments
appreciated the seriousness of the situation, the committee found,
after the first 30 French military advisers went in to train
Rwandan police and army forces in 1991. This involvement followed
attacks in 1990 by Tutsi rebels using bases in neighboring Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   The training detachment had strict orders not to participate in
Rwandan government military or security operations, according to
the report, which drew on classified documents and 110 hours of
testimony by 88 military and civilian witnesses and experts,
including Americans. (The document is available on the Internet at
http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/2/2rwanda.html.)
</P>
<P>
   But President Juvenal Habyarimana of Rwanda had convinced
himself that France ``would be behind him no matter what happened,
that he could do anything he wanted on the military and political
level,'' the committee reported, quoting Herman Cohen, the State
Department official responsible for Africa policy from 1989 to
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also told the committee that the United States had trained
some rebel commanders but had not provided aid to their
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting that testimony, the legislators poured cold water on
the idea that the United States had somehow been trying to edge the
French out of Rwanda, a former Belgian colony.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no American plot with the object of supplanting
French influence in Rwanda,'' the report read.
</P>
<P>
   While looking over their shoulders for American plots, the
committee suggested, French authorities failed to see how military
aid to help combat the Tutsi rebellion was strengthening Hutu
backers of Habyarimana's regime for the final slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   From 1990 to April 1994, France sold 137 million francs' worth
of arms to Rwanda, about $24.5 million worth at current exchange
rates. This provided more than 10,000 mortar rounds, a million
bullets and three Gazelle helicopters. France also gave the Rwandan
authorities three more Gazelles and more ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If France did not participate in battle,'' the report read,
``nevertheless on the ground it was extremely close to the Rwandan
armed forces. It continuously participated in the working out of
battle plans, provided advice to the general staff and to sector
commanders, proposing redeployments and new tactics. It sent
advisers to instruct the Rwandan armed forces in the operation of
advanced weapons. It taught mining and ambush techniques,
suggesting the most appropriate emplacements.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, authorities in Paris disregarded
occasional warnings from French advisers in the field that some of
their advice could be put to bad use.
</P>
<P>
   As violence mounted in early 1993, ``France in no way incited,
encouraged, aided or supported those who orchestrated the genocide
and began it in the days that followed the assassination,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   But, it added, ``France maintained its presence and developed
its military cooperation against a background of ethnic tensions,
massacres and violence, as if impervious to a context whose
seriousness it underestimated.''
</P>
<P>
   Mass killings began after a plane carrying Habyarimana and
President Cyprien Ntaryamira of neighboring Burundi was shot down
from the ground by a SAM-16 missile near the Kigali airport on
April 6, 1994. The plane, an executive jet, was flown by a
three-man French military crew.
</P>
<P>
   The committee did not resolve the question of who shot down the
plane _ Tutsi rebels or Hutu opponents of Habyarimana's negotiating
strategy. It found plausible evidence that either group could have
obtained SAM-16s from Uganda. It also called for further
investigation to resolve the mystery of the crash, which unleashed
the catastrophic killings.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSCHWITZ, Poland _ Crosses large and small are mushrooming
outside the Auschwitz death camp, filling a field just beneath its
barbed-wire-topped wall and driving a new wedge between Poles and
Jews.
</P>
<P>
   In light wood, in dark wood, some straight, some listing, the
240 crosses have been placed by Catholic zealots over the last five
months. They now form a spreading Christian sea overlooked by a
watchtower of the camp that formed the industrial nexus of the Nazi
attempt to annihilate European Jewry.
</P>
<P>
   The crosses have a self-styled guard, Kazimierz Switon. A former
member of Poland's Solidarity Union, he arrived here on June 14. In
a now squalid tent, he took up residence, declared he had come to
defend Polish soil against the Jews, planted a cross and _ with
conspicuous success _ invited sympathizers to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not tell the Jews what to do in their country, and they
have no right to tell us what to do on our Polish soil,'' said
Switon, 67. ``I will not leave until I have a written assurance
from the church that these crosses which pay tribute to the Polish
victims of Auschwitz will stand forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The adjacent camps of Auschwitz and Birkenau have been at the
center of repeated conflict in recent years as divergent Polish and
Jewish views of World War II have clashed, envenomed by each
people's sense of enormous _ even incomparable _ loss.
</P>
<P>
   But the forthright anti-Jewish oratory of Switon and his
vociferous followers appears to mark an escalation in an atmosphere
clouded by new Polish fears of Jewish claims for restitution of
property lost during the war.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the inability of the center-right Polish
government of Prime Minister Jerzy Burek to remove the crosses _ or
even to stop their proliferation _ has illustrated the enduring
sensitivity of religious and nationalist issues in a deeply
Catholic country still grappling with the divisive legacy of more
than 40 years of Communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Switon represents a lunatic fringe, but perhaps not such a
narrow one,'' said Jerzy Ledlicki, a historian. ``The Communists
removed crosses from public places, so to remove a cross today is
to be an enemy of the nation. The government therefore finds itself
in a tight spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Burek has promised several times to remove the crosses, most
recently in a letter to Miles Lerman, chairman of the U.S.
Holocaust Memorial Council.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, dated Nov. 30 and made available to The New York
Times, says that ``all new crosses'' will be removed and that ``the
government of Poland is determined to do it as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   However, up to now, as legal battles boil, no attempt has been
made to take the crosses down or to evict Switon. Even the Polish
episcopate's formal condemnation of the new crosses in August has
failed to break the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crosses are deeply offensive,'' said Kalman Sultanik, vice
president of the World Jewish Congress. ``For many Jews, they
symbolize persecution, and 90 percent of those murdered in
Auschwitz-Birkenau by the Germans were Jews. Why can the crosses
not be removed by police, and then let Switon fight the decision in
court if he wants?''
</P>
<P>
   There have been repeated provocative issues in recent years. A
26-foot-high so-called ``papal cross'' erected in 1989 and still
standing at the center of the new crosses, a Catholic convent that
abutted the camp until its Carmelite nuns left in 1993, and the
presence until their removal last year of crosses and Stars of
David near the Birkenau gas chambers have all caused bitter
exchanges between Polish authorities and Jewish groups.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of the friction lie starkly divergent senses of
history. Many people in Poland have the sense that the 3 million
non-Jewish Poles who died during the Nazi occupation, of whom close
to 100,000 were killed at Auschwitz, are somehow invisible to the
Jews because of the scale of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Jews, by contrast, see an unspeakable affront in the placing of
Christian symbols at the place that stood at the heart of the Nazi
extermination program, are troubled by enduring expressions of
anti-Semitism in Poland and point to the fact that more than 1
million of the victims of the Auschwitz-Birkenau complex were Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't stop competing over suffering,'' said Wanda
Rapaczinski, a Warsaw newspaper publisher who is Jewish. ``And now,
with these American lawyers combing Europe chasing restitution
money for the Jews, and the fear that Jews may come back to Poland
to claim property, I feel a new tension in the air. The property
issue is explosive.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, until the crosses began spreading, significant progress
appeared to have been made in Polish-Jewish relations through an
ongoing dialogue between the government and several Jewish groups,
including the American Jewish Committee, Yad Vashem and the U.S.
Holocaust Memorial Museum.
</P>
<P>
   In November, under a government commitment to return communal
property to Poland's small remaining Jewish congregations (there
are no more than 20,000 Jews in Poland), three synagogues were
reopened in Wroclaw, Opole and the town of Oswiecim, adjacent to
the Auschwitz camp.
</P>
<P>
   But the spreading Auschwitz crosses have now become a stumbling
block to any further progress. ``The Jewish people want to abuse
us, they want to have power in Poland,'' Switon said, as he gazed
down on the crosses. ``But these Christian symbols show we will not
bow to their blackmail.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Switon has found critical local support from a wealthy
real-estate dealer and former Communist security services agent,
Zbigniew Janosz, who has veered from communism to nationalism since
1989, heads an association of Polish war victims and leased the
land on which the crosses now stand from the departing Carmelite
nuns in 1993. His lease runs until 2033.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem is a legal one,'' said Agnieszka
Magdziak-Miszewska, the prime minister's special adviser on Jewish
issues. ``We have brought a court case against Janosz, but it could
drag on for a long time. And we cannot violate the laws of
Poland.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears certain that any government attempt to remove the
crosses by force without firm legal backing could provide much
ammunition for Switon's supporters _ essentially radical elements
in the Catholic Church whose mouthpiece is called ``Radio Maria,''
and Polish nationalists increasingly convinced of various Jewish
conspiracies.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalists were already encouraged earlier this year when
Sultanik of the World Jewish Congress suggested during a visit to
Poland that Auschwitz should be made an ``extra-territorial''
entity to insure respect for the site. That term is explosive in
Poland because Hitler demanded an ``extra-territorial'' road link
from Berlin to Gdansk before invading in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   ``That comment was a disaster because it allowed Switon to
portray himself as a defender of Polish land against the ever
predatory Jews,'' said Mrs. Magdziak-Miszewska. Sultanik later
apologized and said he was misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   The Polish government has now drafted a law to be submitted to
Parliament in the next few weeks that would put all former
concentration and death camps and the land around them in the
control of the state. The law would override all previous property
claims; land would be bought out at market prices.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Magdziak-Miszewska said she expected the law to pass and
provide the basis for a resolution of the Auschwitz problem. ``The
new crosses will go, quite soon,'' she said. ``But the papal cross
is another matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Polish officials say privately that the depth of national
feeling about the papal cross, which commemorates a papal Mass at
Auschwitz in 1979, is such that only a public request from the
pope, who is scheduled to visit Poland next summer, could open the
way for its removal.
</P>
<P>
   Even the fate of the 240 new crosses appears certain to be
bitterly contested. ``We gave up the Carmelite church and the Jews
still want more,'' said Witold Urbanski, 68, as he wandered in the
field of crosses. ``Not only Jews died in Auschwitz, and they have
to realize that we Catholics have the same rights as them.''
</P>
<P>
   Switon says the crosses will soon double in number. On many of
them, a slogan is written: ``Only under this cross, only under this
symbol, Poland is Poland and a Pole is a Pole.''

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA SEEKS ACTION ON SUIT FOR VOTE IN CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The District of Columbia has requested immediate
action on a lawsuit against the federal government seeking voting
representation in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In September, 57 district residents and the district's Office of
Corporation Counsel filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court arguing
that they were being denied their constitutional right to vote in
elections for members of the House of Representatives and the
Senate. The district is represented in Congress by only a nonvoting
member of the House.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel consisting of a federal appeals court judge
and two district court judges was formed last month to hear the
case, but no hearing date was set. In its latest courting filing,
the district asks that the panel immediately rule in its favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a completely intolerable anomaly that must be dealt
with,'' said Eleanor Holmes Norton, the district's delegate in the
House and a constitutional lawyer. ``This is a serious challenge to
the purgatory status of our citizens, and I am focused on
maximizing representation and government. I'll never let up; it is
a clear case.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Norton noted that district residents voted overwhelmingly
for President Clinton, but were being denied the right to protect
that vote because they have no representative who can cast a ballot
in the House on articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The corporation counsel, John Ferren, is a former judge on the
district of Columbia Court of Appeals who assumed the post last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress impacts community life in the district in myriad
ways,'' Ferren wrote in a 28-page brief filed in U.S. District
Court, ``through its control over the appropriation of local
revenues (which, in turn controls the activities and services of
district government); through its power to override locally enacted
laws, and through its power to legislate directly for the district.
Absent voting representation in Congress for district citizens, the
district as a community is subject to hardships and indignities at
the hands of the national government that no other represented
jurisdiction must endure.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress appointed a financial control board in 1995 to manage
the city's government. It recently passed laws requiring
congressional approval for all capital improvement projects as well
as locally financed health and welfare programs.
</P>
<P>
   The district's City Council, encouraged by arguments developed
by Jamin Raskin, a professor of constitutional law at American
University's College of Law in Washington, in March unanimously
passed a resolution supporting litigation that would challenge the
constitutionality of denying voting representation in Congress for
district residents.
</P>
<P>
   On July 4, the office of corporation counsel submitted a formal
petition of redress of grievances to Congress, thus invoking the
First Amendment right to petition the federal government for the
500,000 residents of the district.
</P>
<P>
   Congress handed down its response to the petition and to the
lawsuit in October by adopting a rider to the 1998 appropriations
bill prohibiting the district from using its money to pursue voting
representation in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The rider, as understood by Ferren, requires lawyers for the
district to work on the lawsuit only outside normal working hours
and without the use of district resources _ no government supplies,
law books, computers, office space or telephones.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington law firm of Covington &AMP; Burling is representing
the district, taking on the considerable work load and costs
involved in developing and presenting the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a substantial legal effort,'' said Thomas Williamson,
a lawyer with Covington &AMP; Burling. ``It addresses the fundamental
right of citizens to be represented in a democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Voting representation in Congress has long been sought by
residents in the district. Early residents of the city voted for
congressional representatives in Maryland and Virginia, from which
the district was carved, but around 1800 the states stopped this
practice, asserting that Congress had the responsibility of
representing the population. In 1875, residents of Washington won
the right to send a nonvoting delegate to the House.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, 150 resolutions for fuller representation have
been introduced and all have failed.

SALT LAKE CITY AND THE PRESSURE TO BE ACCOMMODATING 
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
 By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ When this city lost by only four votes to
Nagano, Japan, to play host to the 1998 Winter Olympics, it became
a heavy favorite to win the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City's advantages were plentiful: it would be the
largest city to be host of a Winter Games. Many of its sports
facilities were already under construction. The airport was 15
minutes from downtown, and major highways would carry spectators to
every event in no more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, all the city had to do was protect a big lead.
</P>
<P>
   It did, winning in a landslide, but the manner of Salt Lake
City's victory has become the focus of an investigation into
charges of bribery and corruption that have further damaged the
credibility of an Olympic movement already staggered this year by
an unprecedented series of doping scandals.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake City scandal has provided the most unsparing
glimpse yet of the tectonic grinding between purist ideals of the
Olympics and the economic reality that the Winter and Summer Games
are billion-dollar businesses. The 2002 Winter Games have an
operating budget of $1.45 billion and are expected to have an
economic impact of $2.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The process for obtaining an Olympics has been revealed in
great, troubling detail by the scandal. Attracting the Games
involves far more than simply building stadiums, hotels and
highways. It also involves the providing of lavish gifts and favors
to members of the International Olympic Committee and their
relatives, and the hiring of consultants to make introductions and
assert influence with IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   This process, according to Olympic officials, has frequently
extended beyond expensive wining and dining into a murky area where
the lines are blurred between proper hospitality and improper
inducements.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was the saying in Atlanta? `It's a dirty business, I hope
it all washes out after it's over,''' said John Ruger, a member of
the Salt Lake Olympic organizing committee's board of trustees and
a prominent member of the U.S. Olympic Committee. ``The process
needs to be cleaned up, no question.''
</P>
<P>
   Voting on cities to host the Olympics is the most important
function for many of the IOC's 115 members. When they came to visit
Salt Lake before the 1995 vote that determined the host city for
the 2002 Winter Games, Salt Lake offered such gifts as shotguns and
skis, hunting trips, free medical care and college scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Welch, who was president of the bid committee that won the
2002 Winter Games for Salt Lake City, said this courting of IOC
members was part of a necessary, long-established ritual to build
trust and friendship with people of varying cultures and
backgrounds. Salt Lake City spent $14 million in its attempts to
win the 1998 and 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not uncomfortable with the way we handled it,'' Welch
said. ``The process works.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Hodler of Switzerland, the second-most senior member of the
IOC, has another word for Salt Lake City's actions: bribery.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Hodler made incendiary charges that vote-buying
had influenced the selection of Atlanta, Nagano and Salt Lake City
as Olympic cities, as well as Sydney, Australia, which will host
the 2000 Summer Games. Salt Lake officials have acknowledged
spending about $400,000 on scholarships and athletic training for
13 people, including six relatives of IOC members, most from
Africa. They have classified the spending as humanitarian aid, not
bribery.
</P>
<P>
   Hodler has offered only hearsay, not proof, of his claims of
vote-buying, according to Dick Pound, the IOC member from Montreal
charged with investigating the Salt Lake City scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday night, Pound said that Hodler had
produced no direct evidence to support his contention that Salt
Lake City was the victim of extortion by so-called agents who offer
to deliver blocs of votes for up to $5 million and that as many as
25 IOC members sold their votes in various Olympic-city elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``He offered no names, nothing, only what he heard other people
say,'' Pound said of Hodler, who could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many in Salt Lake City have expressed shock and anger
upon learning that such extravagant _ some say inappropriate _
services must be performed to attract what is billed as the world's
most unsullied form of sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympics have become a business,'' said Ken Bullock, a
populist member of the Salt Lake City organizing committee who has
often said that money spent on limousines would be much better
spent on youth programs. ``They're not about athletes and people.
It's an international business.''
</P>
<P>
   No city was more eager to attract the Olympics than Salt Lake
City. It had been seeking the Winter Games since 1966 as the most
persuasive way to demonstrate that great skiing existed in the
Rockies in places other than Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Because the European vote for 2002 would likely be divided
between Sion, Switzerland, and Ostersund, Sweden, Salt Lake
officials appear to have settled on a strategy of shoring up IOC
votes in Africa and South America. At that time, Africa accounted
for 17 of the IOC's approximately 110 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Favors to African officials included providing free treatment
for hepatitis to Jean-Claude Ganga, an influential IOC member from
Congo Republic, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. Richard
Anderson, a Salt Lake City plastic surgeon, told The Associated
Press that Welch had cajoled him into performing free cosmetic eye
surgery for another unnamed IOC member. Welch did not return a call
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to sensationalize this and see it in black and
white, but it's more blurred than that,'' Charlie Battle, who
served as head of international relations for the Atlanta Olympic
organizing committee, said of providing gifts and favors to IOC
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's great pressure to be accommodating,'' Battle said.
``I'm not talking about scholarships or envelopes of money, I'm
talking about being nice. Sometimes, with hospitality, you feel
like you're doing more than is necessary for something like this.
But you feel like you have to be as nice as you can. It's a
competitive situation, and you want to keep hanging in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Under these circumstances, a kind of ethical vertigo can occur,
Battle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you doing this for humanitarian reasons or are you doing
it to sway votes?'' Battle said. ``It becomes difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Welch said that no one had tried to extort him and that he did
not deal with agents who promised they could deliver votes.
However, the Salt Lake City bid committee paid an Egyptian native
living in Canada, Mahmoud Farnawani, $58,000 for consulting
services in 1994. He told The Toronto Sun in 1995 that he had
``assured'' the Arab vote to Salt Lake officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to take this opportunity to clean house and recapture
the ground we hope to occupy,'' Pound said. ``We have to show that
we set a standard of conduct that is high.''

FORMER PREMIER OF NOVA SCOTIA CLEARED IN RAPE TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The former premier of Nova Scotia was acquitted
Saturday of eight charges of rape, attempted rape and indecent
assault related to incidents that allegedly took place 40 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The former premier, Gerald Regan, now 70, led the province's
government from 1970 to 1978. He was also a member of the federal
Parliament and a Cabinet minister under Prime Minister Pierre
Trudeau.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long, long ordeal,'' he said after hearing the
jury's decision. ``We've lived and died with this for the last five
years.''
</P>
<P>
   A jury of six women and four men deliberated about eight hours
before returning the not guilty verdict in a Halifax courtroom
Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But it was only after the jury had been sequestered Thursday
night that it became known that besides the three women who had
testified during the trial, 19 other women had told investigators
they had been sexually assaulted or harassed by Regan years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Michael MacDonald, blocked attempts by prosecutors to
allow some of the other alleged victims to testify, and limited
this trial to just the charges brought by three women. The judge
also issued a publication ban, which prevented any information
about the other cases from being reported during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of Regan, a respected public figure in Nova Scotia,
was one of the most sensational proceedings in Canada in recent
years. It brought calls from some quarters for a statute of
limitations on criminal charges. The trial also forced Canadians to
try to reconcile two starkly different images of a man who had
spent most of his adult life in public service.
</P>
<P>
   Regan, a tall, stately man, was always formal and polite as he
marched into and out of the Halifax courthouse. Inside the
courtroom, however, the prosecution and three alleged victims
portrayed him as a brutal rapist and sexual predator who enjoyed
watching his victims cringe in fear.
</P>
<P>
   It came down to Regan's word against the moving testimony of the
alleged victims. The accusers, now middle-aged women, said they
were teen-agers when the attacks took place, often after Regan had
parked his car in an isolated area. The women all said they knew
him then but not intimately.
</P>
<P>
   Regan steadfastly denied making advances to the women.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trial, his wife, Carole, 62, defended him against
the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   The crown prosecutor, Adrian Reid, told the jury that despite
Regan's gentlemanly demeanor and public reputation, he had ``a dark
side'' that led him to prey on young women.
</P>
<P>
   The jury's acquittal was a stinging loss for the prosecution,
which had spent five years on the case. ``If there are grounds for
appeal, we'll consider them,'' Reid told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But Regan's lawyer, Edward Greenspan, said that prosecutors had
been off base from the moment the investigation was launched. ``If
he had not been the former premier of this province they would
never have spent millions of dollars pursuing him,'' Greenspan
said. ``It just wouldn't have happened to an ordinary citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   Regan's troubles have not ended. He is scheduled to appear in
court again next February as proceedings begin on another sex
complaint.

<P>
   BONUSES FOR BLOCKERS
</P>
<P>
   Besides being a great athlete and one of the nicest Jets
players, Curtis Martin is something else: a smart man. Why? He
takes care of his linemen.
</P>
<P>
   Martin is continuing a tradition he started when he played for
the New England Patriots, financially rewarding his linemen for
opening up those large holes he rumbles through.
</P>
<P>
   Martin gives each lineman $100 after every game in which he
rushes for at least 100 yards. Before the game against the Buffalo
Bills Saturday, he had seven 100-yard games, which amounted to
$3,500 divided five ways. There is one more regular-season game and
the playoffs still to go, and he may also give the linemen some
sort of other gift at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offensive line is the key,'' Martin said earlier this
season. ``Those guys do a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin has had a solid season. Entering the Bills game, he was
fourth in the American Football Conference in both rushing yardage
with 1,146 yards and in rushing touchdowns with eight. He came to
the Jets with a reputation as a player who often got hurt, and
though he missed some time this year with leg injuries, he spent
most of the year on the field and not in the trainer's room.
</P>
<P>
   What Martin has provided the Jets is an explosive running
threat. If opponents try to stop the passing game, he breaks loose.
If they use eight-man fronts to try and stop him, wide receivers
Keyshawn Johnson and Wayne Chrebet have big days.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's running and pass blocking have helped quarterback Vinny
Testaverde have a great year. Testaverde had a gaudy quarterback
rating of 128.3 and had thrown 133 consecutive passes coming into
the Bills game without getting sacked. He was the only quarterback
in the NFL who had not thrown an interception on third down.
</P>
<P>
   Although the linemen have done a nice job of pass protecting and
run blocking, none of them will be starters in the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The linemen _ center Kevin Mawae, guards Todd Burger and Matt
O'Dwyer and tackles Jumbo Elliott and Jason Fabini _ enjoy blocking
for Martin because he is sincere in his appreciation of them. But
Martin remains a mystery in the locker room. Few players know him
well because he rarely opens up about himself to teammates. He is
not aloof, but is extremely quiet and private.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some running backs, however, Martin understands that a
handshake, a thank you and a little cash can go a long way.
</P>
<P>
   ON- AND OFF-FIELD REBELLION
</P>
<P>
   Carolina Panthers linebacker Kevin Greene shoved his assistant
coach on the sideline. Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Kordell
Stewart screamed at Coach Bill Cowher. Ugly, ugly, ugly _ and these
incidents were just from last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans may not realize these kinds of incidents are common,
but most of them are not caught on tape.
</P>
<P>
   A more subtle form of disagreement also occurs: ignoring a play
that is called by the coaches. That happened during the Detroit
Lions' loss to the San Francisco 49ers Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, the Lions' coaches called a play that was
supposed to go to someone other than Herman Moore, the Pro Bowl
wide receiver, who has been frustrated this season by what he
perceives as a reduced role.
</P>
<P>
   Moore did not like the call. While in the huddle, according to
several Lions, Moore told quarterback Frank Reich, who was in for
the injured Charlie Batch, to ignore the called play and simply lob
the ball to him in the end zone. That was what Reich did, and the
Lions scored on a 24-yard pass.
</P>
<P>
   Defying a called play would normally anger coaches. But when
Moore went to the sideline, he was congratulated for the touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   UNION SAVING FOR HARD TIMES
</P>
<P>
   What has made Gene Upshaw a respected union leader among NFL
players is that he is always prepared and a step ahead. That may be
why the union, spurred on by the NBA lockout, is taking steps to
guarantee that its players have a large financial war chest in case
there is labor strife when the collective bargaining agreement
expires in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   In the NBA, there is concern among players and agents that some
of the lower-paid players may be feeling a financial squeeze with
the lockout nearing its 200th day. The football union wants to make
sure at least some money is available for players if they too wind
up in a dispute.
</P>
<P>
   According to agents and union officials, most of the money being
invested for the players is coming from the union's licensing arm,
which earns millions each year from merchandise sales. Some agents
believe that by 2005 the union will have emergency funds of at
least several hundred million dollars, and maybe much more.
</P>
<P>
   Would that be enough to support each player for, say, one year
if there was a strike? Probably not, but it would help ease the
pain and give players some security and leverage.
</P>
<P>
   BRONCO BRAGGING
</P>
<P>
   Were the Denver Broncos too cocky before they lost to the Giants
last weekend? Some Giants believe they were.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos are normally chatty, and it is not unusual for them
to talk trash to opponents during a game. That is what happened at
Giants Stadium. Tight end Shannon Sharpe, some Giants have said,
was screaming about how he could not be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants took all the talk personally.
</P>
<P>
   Especially quarterback Kent Graham, who played one of the best
games of his career. Late in the final period, Broncos linebacker
Bill Romanowski, never afraid to do or say almost anything on the
field, told Graham to shut up when he was speaking to several
officials about a call. Graham, one of the classiest of players,
lost his temper and yelled a few choice words at Romanowski.
</P>
<P>
   The back-and-forth seemed to energize Graham. Soon after the
exchange, he launched the game-winning bomb to wide receiver Amani
Toomer. Graham got the last word.
</P>
<P>
   AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE?
</P>
<P>
   One reason the NFL's competition committee rejected instant
replay for the playoffs was because of possible unfairness.
Indianapolis Colts General Manager Bill Polian, among others,
believed coaching staffs who worked with replay when it was in use
from 1986 to 1991 would have had an advantage over the staffs that
did not. . . . Now that Denver quarterback John Elway has his Super
Bowl ring, who would he like to see win one? Miami quarterback Dan
Marino, whom Elway faces tomorrow night. ``If we can't get it this
year,'' Elway said, ``then I'd like to see him win one.''

   CLINTON-IMPEACH (Washington) _ Following a divisive day of
debate, the House of Representatives votes on impeachment for only
the second time in American history. By JOHN C. HENRY.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-REAX (Washington) _ President Clinton, vowing to fight
rather than resign, stages a rally of Democrats at the White House
following the historic House vote that sets the stage for a Senate
trial on his removal. By STEWART M. POWELL.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-ANALYSIS (Washington) _ The last time the House
impeached a president, it was an indirect result of the Civil War.
This time it came as the indirect result of cultural wars. In many

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican-controlled House's impeachment of
President Clinton, in the face of considerable evidence that the
American public is firmly in Clinton's corner, would appear to be
either astonishingly principled or stunningly ill-advised. It is
hard to recall a moment in the nation's history when Congress so
completely defied public sentiment, disregarding warnings about the
political repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   But should the sight of the Republicans in the 105th Congress
impeaching the president really have come as a surprise? The merits
of the case against Clinton aside _ even many Democrats acknowledge
that most Republicans are acting out of genuine conviction _ the
outcome suddenly seems almost inevitable, given the political
dynamics that rule this city today (and despite all those shrewd
predictions to the contrary just a few weeks ago).
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the polls invoked by Democrats in arguing against
impeachment, and by pundits in predicting that it never would
happen, obscured rather than illuminated what was taking place on
Capitol Hill as the lawmakers began to cast their votes on
impeachment. The polls failed to account for the forces that shaped
the president's catastrophic week: the depth of Republican anger at
Clinton, the tepidness of the nation's support for him and, most of
all, the fact that when it comes to Congress, all politics really
is local.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the polls. There is a huge gap between the public and
congressional Republicans in their views both of Clinton and the
penalty he should pay for his attempts to cover up his liaison with
Monica Lewinsky. The public has been unwavering in its opposition
to impeachment _ two-thirds oppose it, according to the most recent
New York Times/CBS Poll, completed Thursday night. Clinton's
approval rating remains as robust as ever, and the public's view of
Republicans is as low as it's been in the 14 years that the
Times/CBS Poll has been asking the question.
</P>
<P>
   But these are national polls, and when it comes to the actual
districts that members of Congress represent, and where they have
to run, opinions about Clinton can be quite different.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you actually break it down, probably 180 Republican
districts _ 180 out of 228 _ are solidly Republican districts, and
they would be solidly anti-Clinton districts,'' said Rep. Peter
King, R-N.Y., who advocated censure instead of impeachment. ``In
those 180 districts, there's no damage in voting for impeachment.
In fact, it would be very popular.''
</P>
<P>
   David Moore, the managing editor of the Gallup Poll, said his
polls consistently found a sharp partisan division on impeachment:
Republicans, particularly conservative ones, and the people most
likely to actually vote, were the most vigorous advocates of
Clinton's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   That district-by-district variance with national sentiment
offers an explanation for the reaction of some Republican House
members to the notion they were defying public opinion. ``Please
don't let anyone suggest that public opinion wasn't weighed in the
final decision,'' said Rep. Sherwood Boehlert of New York, one of
the last of the moderate Republicans to come out in favor of
impeachment. ``I certainly gave public opinion from the people I
represent thought and consideration. But what do you do when public
opinion is evenly divided, give or take a few points? We do what we
were elected to do. Deliberate. Consult. Consider. Vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, for the Republicans who considered their decision
in purely political terms _ not something that anyone was publicly
admitting last week _ the case for impeachment was even more
compelling. Republicans who voted against impeachment were
explicitly defying the position of the congressional leadership.
They were inviting retribution from the domineering right wing of
the Republican party: a primary challenger in two years or a drying
up of campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   And this Democratic president was particularly ill-equipped to
counter those pressures. Clinton has throughout his career done
better with voters than with legislators, and he has had especially
bad relations with Congress. There are many Republicans in this
Congress, which has always been fiercely partisan, who think
Clinton has simply been caught doing before a grand jury what he
has been doing to Congress and the public for years. The Judiciary
Committee portrait of the president as fundamentally dishonest
simply gave legal force to their own view of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a deep animosity to Clinton,'' said the Rev. Robert
Drinan, a former Democratic congressman from Massachusetts who is a
law professor at Georgetown University. ``And more and more I think
it's cultural. These people say that Clinton is responsible for
abortion and homosexuality. They just dump on him.''
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse for Clinton, his own support seems, while
broad, perfunctory. There is no evidence of a fervor that may have
made Republicans think twice. ``They are firm in their view that he
should not go,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research
Center for People and the Press. ``But I do not think they are
emotionally involved with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowell Weicker, the former Connecticut senator who was one of
the first Republicans in 1974 to urge the impeachment of Richard M.
Nixon, and who supports Clinton's impeachment, said the president's
position in the polls was a testimony more to the way women and
minorities viewed the Republican Party than to Clinton himself.
``If you are women, if you are a minority, why would you want to
kick out a man that you perceive as your friend and put yourself in
the hands of a political party governed by the religious right?''
Weicker said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In this context, these countervailing forces _ House Republicans
on one hand and public sentiment on the other _ have produced a
political climate here that is very different from the one that
prevailed the last time impeachment proceedings were moving against
a president. By the summer of 1974, when the House Judiciary
Committee voted to recommend the impeachment of Nixon, the public
decisively supported that course of action. It was a bipartisan
removal; Republicans and Democrats alike had urged Nixon's
impeachment (in contrast to the more partisan impeachment of Andrew
Johnson in 1868).
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of that, when the House Judiciary Committee voted
for impeachment, and Nixon resigned, the country came together,''
said Kurt Lang, a political science professor who, with his wife,
Gladys Engel, wrote ``The Battle for Public Opinion'' (Columbia
University Press, 1983), examining the interplay of public opinion
and Watergate. ``Everybody felt good. There was real euphoria.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this instance, impeachment is unlikely to have the same
positive reaction. And it is likely to feed the cynicism of the
public, with regard to congressional behavior in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Elizabeth Holtzman, D-N.Y., who as a member of the
House Judiciary Committee voted to recommend Nixon's impeachment,
said the critical difference between now and then _ the absence of
public support for the removal of a president _ should give the
Republicans pause. ``Public sentiment is crucial in so far that you
really need public acceptance to go forward with the removal of the
president of the United States _ because of the disruption that's
entailed, and the ultimate trial,'' Ms. Holtzman said. ``You need
to have public support.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have heard all this for weeks. They have
responded by saying they were sent here to vote their principles.
``We can not govern this country by polls,'' Rep. Ed Bryant,
R-Tenn., said from the House floor on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant is not alone among Republicans in making that argument
(it is not exactly a new debate in Washington) and several
Republicans have predicted that public opinion will soon follow
them. Lawmakers have defied the polls before and survived the next
election as public views changed.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps by the end of this process, the Republicans will succeed
in convincing the American public that Clinton truly deserves to be
removed from office for his misdeeds, and that this was not a
partisan assassination orchestrated by the Republican Party against
a popular president.
</P>
<P>
   But as lawmakers prepared to adjourn and head home for the
holidays, there was no sign of that happening any time soon.

   PANAMA-CANAL-$ADV20 _ PANAMA CITY, Panama _ The year is 1977,
when mood rings and platform shoes are hot, and a soft-spoken
president named Jimmy Carter signs two very controversial treaties
with his pistol-packing friend from Panama, Gen. Omar Torrijos. The
treaties are a milestone in U.S.-Latin American relations,
requiring the United States to relinquish control of the Panama
Canal _ long a symbol of American domination and Yankee ingenuity _
to Panama by high noon on Dec. 31, 1999. In 1977, the turn of the
century seemed eons away. But now the sun is finally setting on
this strategic outpost, a presence the United States has enjoyed
for 95 years. But like a husband and wife headed for an amicable
divorce, both sides are suffering a rush of last-minute doubts. In
the United States, there are misgivings over whether Panama, a
small country with no military and only 2.8 million people, can
successfully oversee one of the world's most valuable waterways.

just north of this Pacific coastal city. And why should he? The
all-American enclave boasts nightlife, tennis courts, a movie
theater, a bowling alley, appealing housing _ even dirt-cheap boat
rentals. But the base's days are numbered and Thomas must steel
himself, like thousands of other Americans, for relocation to
another U.S. base next year outside of Panama. Under the Panama
Canal treaties signed in 1977, the United States promised a gradual
pullout from Panama, slowly relinquishing pieces of the Canal Zone

other countries, too, are offering fresh proposals to challenge the
Panama Canal. But whether any of them fly remains to be seen.

President Clinton launched a fight to save his administration. In a

GUGLIOTTA SAYS PLAYERS ACCEPT NEW ECONOMICS OF HIGH-END CONTRACTS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. _ For the past two years, fans of the
Minnesota Timberwolves could not help but dream. They saw one of
the league's best young point guards playing with two All Star
forwards _ one in his prime, the other with gigantic potential _
and envisioned playoff run after playoff run, with at least a few
of them ending in championships.
</P>
<P>
   But one of those players, Tom Gugliotta, did not share that
dream. It's not that Gugliotta was a prima donna, interested only
in individual statistics, or even a hater of Minnesota who could
not wait to leave the cold. It's just that after a couple of
tumultuous years in the league, he realized the National Basketball
Association is a business, one that would likely rip apart the
young nucleus of the Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke Friday at a news conference for ``The Game on
Showtime'' Saturday night, Gugliotta, one of the league's most
coveted free agents, all but confirmed that the ripping had begun.
While he did not say he would never again wear a Timberwolves'
uniform, he did not say he would wear one, either. or even that he
wanted to. And the 6-foot-10-inch forward showed little remorse
when asked about the probability of never again playing beside
point guard Stephon Marbury and small forward Kevin Garnett.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of what happened to me earlier in my career with the
trades, I don't feel as attached to one particular team,'' said
Gugliotta, who has been traded from Washington to Golden State to
Minnesota in his six-year career. ``Maybe that's unfortunate but
that's what my experience has been. I learned quickly that this is
a business and that you have to look out for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the lockout threatens to wipe out the entire season,
many are learning that the NBA is a business. Because Gugliotta
already knew that, he never counted on playing the rest of his
career with Marbury and Garnett. Of course, the trio could still
end up together, but that is as unlikely as the players and owners
settling their differences before Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
   The problem in Minnesota is that Marbury, Garnett and Gugliotta
are all big-money players. Under the old collective bargaining
agreement, Marbury would have commanded well over $100 million for
six years either this summer or the next, and Gugliotta would
probably have signed a $70- to $80-million contract. With Garnett
having signed his historic six-year, $126-million deal two years
ago, it would be hard for the Timberwolves the keep all three
players.
</P>
<P>
   That's a shame because Minnesota, which was terrible during its
first eight seasons in the league, deserves a winner, and Marbury,
Garnett and Gugliotta would have been fun to watch. But as soon as
Garnett signed his deal, Gugliotta began thinking that his days in
Minnesota might be numbered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin was fortunate,'' said Gugliotta, who averaged 20.1
points and 8.7 rebounds last season. ``That's what was available at
the time that his contract came up. I think a lot of players
recognized that having the high-end guys making as much money as
they're making would be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta added that, contrary to the public's presumption, the
players have accepted that the highest-paid players will not make
as much money as they used to, and that the union is fighting in
negotiations for the so-called middle class of players. If he is
correct, that could enable teams to hold on to more than one or two
stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things the players have been willing to concede is
the high-end player, so you're not going to see any more contracts
like Kevin Garnett's,'' Gugliotta said. ``So I think it's more
feasible to keep a team together now.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gugliotta did not sound hopeful about returning to
Minnesota. ``I was happy there and I played for a good team,'' he
said. ``But I'd like to see what my options are before I make a
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta, who lives in Denver during the off season and
mentioned the possibility of signing with the Nuggets, is one of
almost 200 free agents in the league. But he was the only one among
the 16 players who were planning to compete in Saturday's game at
the Boardwalk Convention Center, meaning that he was the only
player who ran the risk of becoming a casualty of the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   An injury such as the ruptured Achilles' tendon to the free
agent Christian Laettner last summer could have crushed Gugliotta's
value and left him staring at a seven-digit contract rather than an
eight-digit one. In that case, his probable departure from the
Wolves would not have been the only sad episode with which he was
associated.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rejecting a last-minute Democratic attempt to
soften its action to censure, the House of Representatives voted to
impeach President William Jefferson Clinton for perjury and
obstruction of justice on Saturday and to call on the Senate to try
him, convict him and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   But even before the vote, Republicans pressed another line of
attack, demanding Clinton's resignation. Rep. Robert Livingston,
nominated for speaker last month by his party, startled the House
when he announced he would not run for speaker and would resign
from the House after 21 years of service.
</P>
<P>
   He urged the president to ``heal the wounds that you have
created. You, sir, may resign your post.'' Angry Democrats booed
and shouted, ``You resign!'' Livingston continued, ``I can only
challenge you in such fashion if I am willing to heed my own
words.''
</P>
<P>
   Apologizing again for extramarital affairs revealed two days
ago, he said, ``I believe I had it in me to do a fine job. But I
cannot do that job or be the kind of leader that I would like to be
under current circumstances.'' Then he bolted from the House
chamber, nearly knocking reporters and members down.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton rejected the advice immediately. His spokesman, Joe
Lockhart, said, ``The president has no intention of resigning.'' By
calling on Livingston to reconsider, the president argued more
broadly against resignation under fire. Perhaps speaking to both
cases, Lockhart said, ``It would be wrong to give in to this
insidious politics of personal destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 228-206 to approve the first article of
impeachment, accusing Clinton of committing perjury before a
federal grand jury. The vote was announced at 1:24 p.m. EST,
leaving the 42nd president to face trial in the Senate on whether
he should be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   The House then voted:
</P>
<P>
   _ 229-205 to reject a second article, accusing Clinton of
committing perjury in the Jones suit. More than two dozen
Republicans defected to join Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   _ 221-212 to approve a third article, accusing Clinton of
obstruction of justice in the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   _ 285-148 to reject a fourth article, which alleged abuse of
power.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Clinton changes course, this would be only the second
impeachment of a president in the 209-year history of the Republic,
and the first since Andrew Johnson was acquitted in 1868. Sen.
Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, has insisted that
no bargaining over censure can prevent it from starting. But the
Senate could halt a trial later as part of a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the degree of partisanship displayed Saturday,
assembling the two-thirds majority required under the Constitution
for conviction is most unlikely. Sixty-seven votes would be
required, and there are only 55 Republicans in the Senate, along
with 45 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Four articles of impeachment before the House charged Clinton
with perjury in lying about his affair with Monica Lewinsky to a
federal grand jury here on Aug. 17. He was also charged with
perjury in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit, obstruction of
justice and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican argument, over and over, was that Clinton had
lied in denying having sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky. Rep.
Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, said, ``A nation of laws
cannot be ruled by a person who breaks the law.'' Rep. Nancy
Johnson of Connecticut said: ``There can be no justice without the
truth. That is just profoundly so, and that is why perjury
matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gerald Kleczka of Wisconsin began the Democrats' arguments
by saying, ``What the president did was wrong, both personally and
morally, but his acts did not threaten our democracy and thus do
not rise to the level of impeachable offenses as defined by our
founding fathers in our Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Schumer, New York's senator-elect, said: ``The rule
of law requires that the punishment fit the crime. Allow us to vote
for censure.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's votes were the penultimate step in the most serious
conflict between Congress and a president since Richard M. Nixon
resigned in the face of impeachment and certain conviction on Aug.
9, 1974.
</P>
<P>
   But while that case spun out from a 1972 break-in at Democratic
headquarters in the Watergate complex, this one began with a murky
land deal in Arkansas in 1978. Through the efforts of Kenneth
Starr, the independent counsel under the law enacted in the wake of
Watergate, the investigation spread to examine Clinton's affair
with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   All year it has preoccupied the capital despite an immense
disconnect with public opinion; since the scandal became public in
January, polls have shown that the public opposed impeachment and
wanted the inquiry brought to an end. Even on Friday night, after a
13-hour debate, a CBS News Poll of 548 people showed that only 38
percent wanted their representative to vote for impeachment; 58
percent wanted a no vote.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict now enters uncharted seas, since the Nixon
resignation cut the matter short and the Johnson trial occurred in
a different America, with no nuclear weapons or cable television or
public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   But the capital was still rife with confident speculation. Some
guessed, or hoped, that the results of the recent poll, which
showed increases in support for resignation as a way to spare the
nation a trial in which Ms. Lewinsky and Linda Tripp would be star
witnesses, would weaken Clinton's resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Others thought the Republicans, seeing dismal numbers in polls
about their party's standing in the United States, would be the
first to blink. With a majority in the Senate, they have the power
to end a trial at any time after the Senate receives notice of
impeachment on the day it convenes, Jan. 6, or the next day.
</P>
<P>
   But while Clinton has focused on the polls, and the CBS News
survey showed that 64 percent still approve of his handling of his
job as president, resignation could almost immediately subject him
to criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   And Republicans have steadfastly ignored the polls all year, and
confronted them directly on Saturday. Representative J.C. Watts of
Oklahoma, newly elected as chairman of the Republican caucus, said:
``What's popular isn't always right. You say polls are against
this. Polls measure changing feelings, not steadfast principle.
Polls would have rejected the Ten Commandments. Polls would have
embraced slavery and ridiculed women's rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``You say we must draw this to a close. I say we must draw a
line between right and wrong, not with a tiny fine line of an
executive fountain pen, but with the big fat lead of a No. 2
pencil. And we must do it so every kid in America can see it. The
point is not whether the president can prevail, but whether truth
can prevail.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, when the Judiciary Committee recommended the four
articles of impeachment, Clinton's side still hoped to prevail with
the help of 20 to 30 Republican moderates who were uncommitted. As
the week wore on, almost all of them broke against the president.
</P>
<P>
   One who did not, Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut, said
Saturday: ``After Judge Starr's report to Congress in September,
and his presentation to the Judiciary Committee in November, I
concluded that impeachable offenses were not proven, and that the
proven offenses were not impeachable.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the president's continued failure to come to grips with
his actions, the sincerity and arguments of members of the
Judiciary Committee from both sides of the aisle, the change of
heart and conviction by members on my side of the aisle who
originally opposed impeachment and who now support it, and the
strong and powerful opinion of so many of my constituents who
oppose my position and who wanted the president impeached caused me
to rethink my position.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Yesterday morning, before I visited with the
president, I concluded that my original position was the correct
one, for me. I believe that the impeachable offenses have not been
proven, and that the proven offenses are not impeachable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, who has led the Republican effort
to force Clinton from office, dismissed his and other arguments as
moral relativism.
</P>
<P>
   He began by praising Livingston: ``There is no greater American
in my mind, at least today, than Bob Livingston, because he
understood what this debate was all about. It was about honor and
decency and integrity and the truth; everything that we honor in
this country. It was also a debate about relativism vs. absolute
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``The president's defenders have said that the
president is morally reprehensible, that he is reckless, that he
has violated the trust of the American people, lessened their
esteem for the office of president and dishonored the office which
they have entrusted him, and that _ but that doesn't rise to the
level of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jose Serrano of New York said, ``My constituents don't hate
Bill Clinton; they love him and they're praying for him right at
this very moment. You may have the votes today to impeach him, but
you don't have the American people. And let me tell you something,
I grew up in the public housing projects of the South Bronx. I can
see a bunch of bullies when I see them. The bullies get theirs, and
you're going to get yours, too.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the Judiciary Committee chairman
who brought the charges to the House floor, said the Congress and
the American people needed to distinguish between private acts of
infidelity and public acts by public officials. In Clinton's case,
he said, the House was dealing with ``a serial violator of the oath
who is the chief law-enforcement officer.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the Senate could be ``innovative and creative'' in
deciding how best to punish Clinton, but that the House was bound
by the Constitution to move ahead with articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice is so important to the most humble among us,'' Hyde
said. ``Equal justice under the law _ that's what we're fighting
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, reading from the same Constitution, voiced
diametrically opposite conclusions, and attacked the fairness of
the proceedings that culminated Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're losing track of distinction between sins and crimes,''
said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. ``We're lowering the standards of
impeachment. What the president has done is not a great and
dangerous offense to the republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also criticized Republicans for impeaching Clinton at
the very moment that U.S. troops waged war against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six days before Christmas our troops are in battle, and a
lame-duck Congress is rushing to overthrow the commander in
chief,'' said Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the second-ranking
House Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The ghosts of Watergate hung over the House chamber.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican cited the parallels between the charges the House
Judiciary Committee brought against Nixon 25 years ago, and the
counts that the same committee brought to the House floor for
affirmation on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nixon cheated. He cheated the electoral system,'' said Rep.
Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican on the Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Graham said, the full House is voting to impeach
Clinton ``because we believe he committed crimes that result in
cheating our judicial system.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of the day's debate was firmly rooted in Clinton's
effort to conceal his sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, a Georgia Republican on the Judiciary Committee
who is one of Clinton's fiercest critics, held up copies of the
U.S. Criminal Code, the Judiciary Committee's report on the
impeachment inquiry and, finally, the Constitution, in defending
his decision to impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we rely on the three pillars of our society: the law
itself, evidence and the Constitution,'' said Barr.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no joy in upholding the law,'' Watts said. ``If we
cannot see lawlessness, our children cannot recognize it. How can
we tell our children honesty is the best policy when we don't
demand it as a policy?''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats assailed the very premise on which the Republican
majority built its impeachment case against Clinton. Rep. John
Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary
Committee, assailed the four articles of impeachment, count by
count, as unfounded by evidence and failing to rise to impeachment.
He saved his most savage scorn for the final count, abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority has simply tried to dress up the perjury counts
in the Watergate abuse-of-power language,'' Conyers said.

has been impeached)   (The Week in Review)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On one side of the aisle, dropping phrases like
``Christian country'' and ``the real America,'' lawmakers rued the
decline of absolutes in a permissive age. On the other side,
invoking images of ``lynch mobs'' and ``good old boys,'' they
warned of a right-wing coup.
</P>
<P>
   From one camp came allusions to Watergate that found
similarities between the transgressions of Presidents Nixon and
Clinton. From the other came gasps that such analogies were
ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans brought the country to a presidential impeachment
and Democrats fought to resist it, the debate encompassed more than
questions of whether Bill Clinton committed perjury and whether
lies under oath warranted impeachment. It exposed a cultural rift,
with people viewing each other suspiciously from across the divide.
The debate also quibbled over history and whether the crisis that
gripped the presidency almost a quarter of a century ago applied to
the situation now.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said that some Republicans who were
fighting for Clinton's removal from office were motivated in part
by his embrace of minorities, which they found threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think that America should look like they look _ white,''
Rangel said in an interview last week. He noted that the Republican
side of the House Judiciary Committee was all white with only one
woman, while the Democratic side had five blacks, three women and
an openly gay man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a political lynch mob,'' Rangel said of the Republicans
pushing impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said accusations of racial or sexual animus were
absurd. What propelled them, they said, was outrage over the
specific actions alleged in the articles of impeachment against the
president.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans' comments also reflected qualms about a
departure from traditional mores in society symbolized by Clinton,
who avoided military service, smoked marijuana and repeatedly
cheated on his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Inglis, R-S.C., used one of his speeches during the
House Judiciary Committee hearings to attack moral relativism,
which conservatives often attribute to liberals. ``One view is that
there is absolute truth,'' Inglis said. ``The other view is that
everything is relative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And really what we're seeing here in President Clinton, I
believe, is the culmination of that,'' he said. ``He is the perfect
embodiment of everything being relative.''
</P>
<P>
   For several Republicans, there were clear parallels between
Nixon's abuse of power in covering up the burglary of a Democratic
political office and Clinton's attempts to keep secret his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Livingston, who until Saturday had been designated as
the next speaker of the House, noted that Nixon tried to conceal
the actions of others but Clinton tried to conceal his own. ``So
why was impeachment the remedy for Nixon and not for Clinton?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., implied that Clinton's actions were
graver than Nixon's. ``In Watergate, the president did not commit
perjury,'' Bliley said during the impeachment debate Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats wondered aloud if Republicans were engaging in a
sort of payback for the 1974 House Judiciary Committee's vote to
send articles of impeachment against Nixon to the full House. Nixon
resigned before the House could vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to believe that Speaker Livingston has not gotten over
Watergate,'' Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., said in an interview
Wednesday, before the Louisiana congressman's announcement Saturday
that he would not accept the speaker's post. ``It appears that some
on the Republican side still feel that Richard Nixon got a bad deal
and that somehow the score needs to be evened.''
</P>
<P>
   The advocates and opponents of the impeachment process were
separated by cultural, racial and even regional rivalries and
suspicions, which were made clear not only in the back-and-forth
between lawmakers but also in the voices of Americans trying to be
heard.
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives' language reflected a desire to keep at bay
the hair-splitting, religion-flouting intelligentsia Clinton
sometimes turned to for counsel. Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., best
articulated that wish earlier in the month during a Judiciary
Committee hearing, taking on several lawyers and scholars who
testified on the president's behalf. Barr was not depressed by
their arguments, he said, because ``I think there are two Americas,
and there is a real America out there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And it is that America that I have great faith in, because
it's that America that understands what perjury is,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, spoke of America as a
``Christian country'' when announcing his support for impeachment,
it seemed to echo Barr's sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many of the people protesting the impeachment
process represented movements and groups demonized by
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent feminists marched on the office of Livingston last
week to demand a meeting, after which one of them, Betty Friedan,
called the leaders of the impeachment effort ``a bunch of dirty old
white men.''
</P>
<P>
   Writers like Toni Morrison and E.L. Doctorow spoke at
anti-impeachment rallies and, inevitably, Hollywood celebrities
added their voices, with actor Robert De Niro personally calling a
politician or two to sway their vote.
</P>
<P>
   Like their political opponents, they had come to see impeachment
as a referendum on something more than a series of actions by the
president, and their positions were informed by something larger
than party fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   The words of one Democratic congresswoman during the House
debate Friday captured their perspective well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is indeed a Republican coup d'etat,'' said Rep. Maxine
Waters, D-Calif. ``Republicans are the vehicles being used by the
right-wing Christian Coalition to direct and control our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Her audience, both inside and outside the U.S. Capitol, included
people who felt that she and some Democrats were trying to seize
the reins in just the same way.

   From one camp came allusions to Watergate that found
similarities between the transgressions of Presidents Nixon and
Clinton. From the other came gasps that such analogies were
ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans brought the country to a presidential impeachment
and Democrats fought to resist it, the debate encompassed more than
questions of whether Bill Clinton committed perjury and whether
lies under oath warranted impeachment. It exposed a cultural rift,
with people viewing each other suspiciously from across the divide.
The debate also quibbled over history and whether the crisis that
gripped the presidency almost a quarter of a century ago applied to
the situation now.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said that some Republicans who were
fighting for Clinton's removal from office were motivated in part
by his embrace of minorities, which they found threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think that America should look like they look _ white,''
Rangel said in an interview last week. He noted that the Republican
side of the House Judiciary Committee was all white with only one
woman, while the Democratic side had five blacks, three women and
an openly gay man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a political lynch mob,'' Rangel said of the Republicans
pushing impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said accusations of racial or sexual animus were
absurd. What propelled them, they said, was outrage over the
specific actions alleged in the articles of impeachment against the
president.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans' comments also reflected qualms about a
departure from traditional mores in society symbolized by Clinton,
who avoided military service, smoked marijuana and repeatedly
cheated on his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Inglis, R-S.C., used one of his speeches during the
House Judiciary Committee hearings to attack moral relativism,
which conservatives often attribute to liberals. ``One view is that
there is absolute truth,'' Inglis said. ``The other view is that
everything is relative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And really what we're seeing here in President Clinton, I
believe, is the culmination of that,'' he said. ``He is the perfect
embodiment of everything being relative.''
</P>
<P>
   For several Republicans, there were clear parallels between
Nixon's abuse of power in covering up the burglary of a Democratic
political office and Clinton's attempts to keep secret his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Livingston, who until Saturday had been designated as
the next speaker of the House, noted that Nixon tried to conceal
the actions of others but Clinton tried to conceal his own. ``So
why was impeachment the remedy for Nixon and not for Clinton?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., implied that Clinton's actions were
graver than Nixon's. ``In Watergate, the president did not commit
perjury,'' Bliley said during the impeachment debate Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats wondered aloud if Republicans were engaging in a
sort of payback for the 1974 House Judiciary Committee's vote to
send articles of impeachment against Nixon to the full House. Nixon
resigned before the House could vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to believe that Speaker Livingston has not gotten over
Watergate,'' Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., said in an interview
Wednesday, before the Louisiana congressman's announcement Saturday
that he would not accept the speaker's post. ``It appears that some
on the Republican side still feel that Richard Nixon got a bad deal
and that somehow the score needs to be evened.''
</P>
<P>
   The advocates and opponents of the impeachment process were
separated by cultural, racial and even regional rivalries and
suspicions, which were made clear not only in the back-and-forth
between lawmakers but also in the voices of Americans trying to be
heard.
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives' language reflected a desire to keep at bay
the hair-splitting, religion-flouting intelligentsia Clinton
sometimes turned to for counsel. Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., best
articulated that wish earlier in the month during a Judiciary
Committee hearing, taking on several lawyers and scholars who
testified on the president's behalf. Barr was not depressed by
their arguments, he said, because ``I think there are two Americas,
and there is a real America out there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And it is that America that I have great faith in, because
it's that America that understands what perjury is,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, spoke of America as a
``Christian country'' when announcing his support for impeachment,
it seemed to echo Barr's sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many of the people protesting the impeachment
process represented movements and groups demonized by
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent feminists marched on the office of Livingston last
week to demand a meeting, after which one of them, Betty Friedan,
called the leaders of the impeachment effort ``a bunch of dirty old
white men.''
</P>
<P>
   Writers like Toni Morrison and E.L. Doctorow spoke at
anti-impeachment rallies and, inevitably, Hollywood celebrities
added their voices, with actor Robert De Niro personally calling a
politician or two to sway their vote.
</P>
<P>
   Like their political opponents, they had come to see impeachment
as a referendum on something more than a series of actions by the
president, and their positions were informed by something larger
than party fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   The words of one Democratic congresswoman during the House
debate Friday captured their perspective well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is indeed a Republican coup d'etat,'' said Rep. Maxine
Waters, D-Calif. ``Republicans are the vehicles being used by the
right-wing Christian Coalition to direct and control our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Her audience, both inside and outside the U.S. Capitol, included
people who felt that she and some Democrats were trying to seize
the reins in just the same way.

CITIZENS OF BAHGDAD MAINTAIN ROUTINE DESPITE BOMBING ONSLAUGHT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ Soon after the air raid sirens sounded, the
antiaircraft fire began booming Saturday evening from batteries
around the city.
</P>
<P>
   Then, evidently in a sign of defiance, a small caravan of cars
drove down the main streets, honking horns, blaring music from
speakers mounted on their roofs and symbolically daring British and
American bombers to hit them.
</P>
<P>
   The fighter jets had reportedly taken off from a base near the
Iraqi border to carry out bombing missions, but by mid-evening none
had been heard over Baghdad and there had been no audible bombing
in or around the capital. The jets may have been striking targets
in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Before dawn Saturday, orange explosions lit up the sky over
Baghdad as targets here were hit. The series of explosions lasted
about 15 minutes, and afterward the wail of ambulance sirens could
be heard.
</P>
<P>
   Later, during a daytime lull in the strikes, a somber procession
wound through the city. Cars and taxis bore the white-draped
coffins of 68 people whom the government said had been killed in
the first three nights of bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today Baghdad mourns 68 martyrs who fell due to the criminal
military action committed against our peaceful country,'' Sultan
al-Shawi, a member of Iraq's National Assembly, told several
hundred people gathered at a square where the procession ended.
</P>
<P>
   The government-controlled Iraqi press continued to call for
solidarity and resolution in the face of bomb attacks. One
newspaper quoted President Saddam Hussein as saying that the
attacks would not force Iraq to ``compromise or kneel.'' Another
reminded Iraqis that they are ``the people of a great
civilization'' and urged them to ``fight and resist the
aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, the Iraqi vice president, Taka Yassin
Ramadan, asserted that his country was determined to ``fight until
the last citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you all that Iraq will continue to defend its land,
policy and dignity,'' Ramadan said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that ``the number of martyrs amongst civilians is
tens of times higher than that of military personnel,'' though he
gave no casualty figures. And he bristled at questions about
whether Iraq should take some initiative to end the raids. ``There
are no conditions,'' he said. ``We accept no conditions, and all
that was in the past is behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   For a city facing bombardment by some of the world's most
sophisticated missiles, Baghdad appeared remarkably calm. Auto
traffic was light but uninterrupted, and although most people chose
to remain inside after dark, those who walked the streets did not
seem concerned, even when air raid sirens blared.
</P>
<P>
   Street lights, as well as those in shops and homes, are burning
normally. An enormous statue of President Saddam Hussein in
downtown Baghdad remains brilliantly illuminated, towering more
than 50 feet above a park, an arm stretched high into the air as if
taunting the bombers.
</P>
<P>
   Shoe stores, supermarkets and clothing stores were open and
doing business Saturday evening, as were other establishments from
butchers to florists. As two barbers sat sipping tea and awaiting
customers, a young couple leaned against a car parked outside,
talking softly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are used to it by now,'' said a building custodian,
shrugging as he went about his work after air raid sirens sounded
this evening. ``You cannot run away and hide.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: RED-INK FEARS BRING PINK SLIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington may be focused on only one thing, but in Corporate
America the concern now centers on profits. Just in time for
Christmas, a host of companies have been announcing plans to cut
employment in the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Those cutbacks have had little effect on the unemployment rate,
and are not likely to mar a truly joyful Christmas for the
country's retailers. But they may be a harbinger of a weaker
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Americans feel flush for the same reason that many companies are
worried. The good news for consumers has come from falling
commodity prices, which over all are at a 20-year low. Oil has led
the way, but everything from wheat to copper is down. For users of
such things, the declines have the same economic effect as a tax
cut.
</P>
<P>
   But those who rely on these commodities for income _ or who rely
on the people who rely on them _ are starting to suffer. There are
layoffs by farm equipment makers, as well as by energy companies.
Financial-service companies are worried about loans to countries,
companies and individuals that are dependent on commodity sales.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies have found they cannot raise prices because of
competition _ some of it from companies whose usual markets in Asia
and Latin America are in recession _ but the tight labor market in
this country is forcing them to pay more for workers. Real wages
are rising at the fastest rate in decades, while corporate profits
are beginning to fall. There are signs of overcapacity in many
industries, so companies are cutting back on the high rate of
investment in new plants and equipment that was seen in 1996 and
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Asian crisis began in the summer of 1997, forecasts
about imminent trouble for the American and Western European
economies have been consistently wrong. But next year could be a
time when problems start to be felt more widely. The price of crude
oil is now $11 a barrel, less than half the nearly $27 of two years
ago. To get that much economic stimulus in 1999 and 2000, oil would
have to plunge to $5, which seems unlikely. Nor will strong
corporate investment continue to fuel growth.
</P>
<P>
   Few now fear recession, in large part because of faith in the
Federal Reserve's economic omnipotence. The consensus may be right,
but a recession in 1999 or 2000 would not be the first one to
surprise economists.
</P>
<P>
   A rule of thumb in politics is that the president gets the
credit or the blame for the economy whether or not he deserves
either. A corollary is that it is far better for a president to
take a recession early in a term, and thus get credit for the
ensuing recovery, than it is to have a downturn that is fresh in
voters' minds. Jimmy Carter and George Bush seemed to have weak
economies when they sought re-election, and lost. Ronald Reagan
took a severe recession early in his first term, but the economy
was doing well by the time he faced re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon probably would have won in 1960 if the economic
outlook had seemed brighter, and a recession in the next two years
would, by that reasoning, be very bad news for Al Gore's hopes in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, that is, President Clinton and Gore can find someone
else to take the fall. If the battle to remove Clinton winds
through a good part of 1999 and coincides with economic and
stock-market reversals, the Democrats will no doubt blame
Republicans for putting the nation through such a spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   There is no guarantee that would work, but it might. If so, the
Republicans in Congress would have accomplished a rare feat: by
trying to throw out a popular president, they would have insulated
his administration from blame for bad economic news that arrived on
that president's watch.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than 6 inches of snow will fall along the Front Range of
the Colorado Rockies on Sunday as cold, moist winds from the east
glide up the sloping terrain. The developing snowstorm in the
Colorado Rockies is just one facet of a large incursion of Arctic
air into the contiguous states over the past few days. With a
subcenter of Arctic high pressure bivouacked near the
Canadian-Washington border, the brunt of the Arctic air mass will
continue to be borne by the Rockies and the Plains.
</P>
<P>
   While Arctic air tightens its grip on the West and parts of the
Middle West, the cold front marking the leading edge of Arctic air
will stall from southeast Canada to the eastern Great Lakes and
just north of the Ohio Valley as upper-level steering winds from
the southwest blow nearly parallel to the front.
</P>
<P>
   Broken areas of light to moderate snow will fall near the upper
Mississippi Valley and western Great Lakes as a jet stream
disturbance passes west of the stalled front. Snowfalls will be
enhanced across Michigan's upper peninsula as cold air is moistened
in transit over Lake Superior.
</P>
<P>
   Patches of freezing rain will develop just west of the Arctic
front from the middle Mississippi Valley northeastward, where a
weak area of low pressure produces precipitation in a zone where
only a shallow layer of Arctic air will be present.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a few clusters of showers will dampen parts of the
Gulf states as a jet stream disturbance that brought high clouds to
the Southwestern states Saturday summons moisture northward from
the Gulf of Mexico. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Blizzard
</P>
<P>
   Blizzard warnings were issued for northeast North Dakota and
northwest Minnesota on Friday as an invading Arctic air mass
blasted into the upper Middle West. There is a technical and a
colloquial definition of a blizzard. Technically, winds must be
sustained for 35 mph or more for three consecutive hours, all the
while with visibility below one-quarter of a mile in snow or
blowing snow. At one time, temperatures were required to be lower
than 20 degrees Fahrenheit, but the condition was removed several
years ago. Colloquially, a blizzard refers to any snowstorm with
high winds.

THERE MAY BE GOLD IN AN OLD TACKLE BOX 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Maine, Conn.)  (mk) 
 By KEN SCHULTZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps this weekend you ought to rummage through the attic.
Dust off the rusty old metal tackle box. Poke through the pockets
of that mouse-chewed fly-fishing vest. And don't overlook that
yellowed stack of papers, catalogs and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   You may not find some musty old Bell Telephone stock
certificates, but the right Creek Chub catalog may be worth a lot
more than its weight in gold. An old Wheatley fly box may be worth
more than the dozens of salmon flies that it still holds. A
slightly tarnished antique reel may be worth enough to buy a
hundred shares of the latest high-flying Internet stock. And if you
happen to find a Haskell Minnow plug, take it directly to your safe
deposit box.
</P>
<P>
   Collecting, selling and investing in antique fishing tackle is
booming, as was evident last month in Boxborough, Mass., at North
America's foremost auction of fishing tackle and accessories.
Nearly a thousand items were on the daylong agenda, some 300 people
were in attendance and almost 200 others bid by telephone or had
submitted absentee bids.
</P>
<P>
   In the evaluation period before the auction, attendees pored
over the items, which included about 250 lures and groups of lures,
nearly 200 reels and more than a hundred rods, plus prints, creels,
books, nets, catalogs, signs and all types of antique
fishing-related esoterica. The mood was library-like, with people
speaking in hushed tones while studiously examining merchandise,
some using measuring tapes to verify the dimensions of reels and
the lengths of rods.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Salimeno, a collector from Wurtsboro, N.Y., asked to see a
small reel. A brass winch multiplier reel of the mid-1800s, and one
of perhaps only five known from the British maker Ustonson, it was
engraved with the words, ``Makers to His Majesty Temple Bar Ld'n''
and was estimated to be worth $5,000 to $7,500.
</P>
<P>
   Salimeno inspected the 1 3/4-inch-diameter reel, which the
auction catalog called ``historically important,'' but he was just
looking. ``Reels are getting to be fantastically expensive,'' he
said. ``They especially draw people who want investments.''
</P>
<P>
   That view was confirmed by Bob Lang of Raymond, Maine, who is
one of the foremost authorities on sporting collectibles and was
the sponsor of the auction, one of two he conducts annually. ``Last
year, prices skyrocketed,'' he said. ``We set a new record in the
spring of '97 when a reel similar to the Ustonson one, but made
around 1820 by the famed Kentucky maker George Snyder, sold for
$31,350.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the reels today will fetch similar money, but there's
a lot of good ones, and they've brought some of my best phone
bidders here to see the reels and to bid in person. Even still, I
have people from 12 countries who will be phone bidding on reels,
and, for the first time ever, two bidders from Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Those interested in antique tackle are private collectors,
dealers of new and used sporting equipment or antiques, and pure
investors. The good stuff, Lang said, usually goes to collectors,
who will pay more. ``A lot of buyers now were not around 10 or 15
years ago and don't have a sense of what it used to be like,'' he
said. ``Older collectors know a $100 lure and can't bring
themselves to pay $200 for it, but a new guy has no hesitance.''
Indeed, the audience reflected a lot of collectors in their 30s and
40s. ``It's like the stock market,'' Lang said.
</P>
<P>
   Salimeno, who may have one of the best antique lure collections
in the United States, concurred. ``A lot of people overbid because
they don't know the real value of an item,'' he said. ``They want
it and they've got the bucks.'' Yet he was still lamenting having
passed up a Haskell Minnow at auction when the top bid was $7,000.
It went back on auction and fetched $12,000. Then it reappeared at
auction and sold for $22,000, the current record for an antique
lure.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers were not reached in Boxborough, only because, as
Salimeno put it, the merchandise was good but in general of
interest to the midlevel collector. Nevertheless, when the Ustonson
reel went off early in the afternoon, the bidding was brisk. In
addition to people bidding in person, there were seven telephone
bidders; one of them landed the reel for $9,500.
</P>
<P>
   Later, an antique leather-trimmed rattan creel by Turtle fetched
$2,000, also from a phone bidder. An elegant Hardy Brothers walnut
chest with about 175 salmon flies sold for $2,700 in spirited
bidding between an attendee and a phone bidder, with the former
prevailing. At least 10 bamboo rods, by such famous makers as
Thomas &AMP; Thomas, Payne, Garrison and Gillum, sold for $2,000 to
$3,500,
</P>
<P>
   Salimeno reserved his interest for a rare ink blotter making its
first appearance at an auction. Issued by Orvis of Vermont in what
is believed to be about 1880, it was an unusual item that
advertised merchandise and contained an illustration of a leaping
trout in one corner. It was never used to blot ink, and Lang
estimated its value at $300.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding started low among several interested parties, but at
$150 only Salimeno and a phone bidder were left. Salimeno was
willing to pay $400 to $450. The rapid-talking auctioneer pointed
to the representative of the phone bidder and then to Salimeno.
Each raised the bid again and again, and within seconds it topped
$400. Salimeno dropped out at $550 to what he later learned was a
determined collector from Connecticut _ the same person who earlier
bought the Ustonson reel and who an observer later calculated had
spent $40,000 on the day.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed, Salimeno bid on an extremely rare $5 note from
Derby Fishing Co. dated 1808. Its value was estimated at $125; he
obtained it for $25.
</P>
<P>
   The profit of the day fell to one of Lang's helpers, a woman who
last summer bought a rare 12-page 1942 Creek Chub catalog at a yard
sale for 25 cents. It was auctioned for $225.

<P>
   Since the Giants have played 999 regular-season games, maybe it
is no surprise they have played so many games remembered by quirky
and theatrical nicknames or for the weather conditions or their
peculiar endings.
</P>
<P>
   History takes root in many forms across 74 seasons, and for the
Giants it is a grand time line: from Jim Thorpe to Jim Fassel, from
Red Grange to John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe it is no surprise that as the Giants approach
regular-season game No. 1,000 Sunday against Kansas City at Giants
Stadium, one of their more memorable games is recalled for a
last-minute field goal of an utterly indeterminate length. To this
day no one knows exactly how far Pat Summerall kicked the ball
through the snow, putting the Giants in the 1958 playoffs and on
their way to the championship remembered as the Greatest Game Ever
Played.
</P>
<P>
   Wellington Mara, the Giants' co-owner, has two pictures of the
Summerall kick on the wall of his office, but they are of no help.
The snow covers the yard markers.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, maybe it is no surprise that the Giants once scored
41 points and still lost by 31.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is no surprise that they played a game known for the
Fumble. No Giants fan is ever confused enough to ask which fumble.
When quarterback Joe Pisarcik and fullback Larry Csonka misplayed
the handoff in the final minute of a 1978 game to turn certain
victory into defeat, there would forevermore be one fumble in
Giants history that stood alone from all the rest.
</P>
<P>
   By the same standard, it may have snowed at countless Giants
games since 1925, but mention the Snowball Game, and there will be
instant understanding that it was the Giants Stadium game three
years ago when fans pelted both the Giants and the San Diego
Chargers with snowballs. Afterward, New Jersey officials started a
manhunt to identify and arrest certain high-profile snowballers
pictured in news photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Giants have won far more of their regular-season games
(529) than they have lost (437) _ there have been 33 ties _ there
are many milestone victories that represent the rise of both the
franchise and a particular generation of Giants. In many ways, the
Giants' legacy chronicles a significant portion of National
Football League history.
</P>
<P>
   As Mara, whose father, Tim, bought the New York franchise of the
fledgling NFL for $500 in 1925, said this week: ``Longevity is its
own reward.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-three years of rewards were harder to discern in the
fall of 1925, however, when the Giants were 0-3, their star player,
the renowned Jim Thorpe, had been released, and they had drawn a
meager crowd for their first home game _ a 14-0 loss to the
Frankfort Yellow Jackets.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants did win their fourth game that season, the first of
seven consecutive victories, and on Dec. 6, 1925, more than 70,000
packed the Polo Grounds for what Mara still calls the Red Grange
Game.
</P>
<P>
   Mara remembers being allowed to sit on the bench as a
9-year-old. He recalls a coach turning to a player and saying:
``Get in there and give 'em hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Mara said, ``I thought, `Man, this is a tough game.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mara, 82, has since seen about 900 Giants games.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants lost to Grange's Bears, 19-7, but the huge crowd that
day encouraged Tim Mara to give his Giants a little longer to catch
on in a sports climate dominated by boxing, baseball, horse racing
and college football.
</P>
<P>
   By 1927, the Giants had won their first NFL title and by 1929,
they were averaging 25,000 fans a game. In 1934, an 8-5 regular
season led to another championship when the Giants changed into
basketball shoes at halftime for better traction on an icy Wrigley
Field in Chicago. A 13-3 deficit was turned into a 30-13 victory:
thus the Sneakers Game.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Giants continued to win regularly in the 1940s, it
wasn't until the 1950s that they again had powerhouse teams. In
1956, they moved to Yankee Stadium, a suitable setting for their
first NFL championship since 1938.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, Summerall kicked his field goal _ officially estimated
at 49 yards. Mara called the kick ``the biggest play in Giants
history.''
</P>
<P>
   It put the Giants in a playoff with the Jim Brown-led Cleveland
Browns, which the Giants won. Then the Giants played the Colts at
sold-out Yankee Stadium and Baltimore's Alan Ameche scored his
sudden-death touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't call it the Greatest Game Ever Played,'' Mara said
with a smile. ``But I understand, from the point of view of one
game's impact, with the television audience and it being in Yankee
Stadium, then it is significant.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other big games in Yankee Stadium during the next 15
years, most of them disappointing to the home crowd.
</P>
<P>
   And the suffering was not always experienced at home. In a game
at Washington in 1966, Coach Otto Graham's Redskins called a
timeout in the waning seconds to kick a field goal and extend their
lead to 72-41. It was the most points scored by one, or two teams,
in a regular-season game in league history, one of several
indignities befalling the Giants in a 1-12-1 season.
</P>
<P>
   By 1981, the Giants had overcome the Fumble to upset the Dallas
Cowboys on the final weekend of the regular season, Joe Danelo's
field goal putting the Giants back in the playoffs for the first
time in 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   By 1986, on their way to their first Super Bowl, the Giants won
a memorable Monday night game at San Francisco, with tight end Mark
Bavaro carrying five defenders on a 31-yard catch-and-run up the
middle as the Giants rallied from 17 points down. The victory
foreshadowed the Giants pre-eminence in the playoffs to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, after squandering some golden opportunities to
advance to their second Super Bowl, the Giants were 7-1 at home
during a 13-3 season that set the stage for another league
championship.
</P>
<P>
   And last year, on Dec. 13, the Giants won their first division
title since 1990 with a stirring home victory over Washington. One
year to the day later, in regular-season game No. 999, they upset
the unbeaten Denver Broncos with a dramatic 86-yard drive in the
final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Mara said a number of people approached him last week, asking
for his perspective on the 1,000th game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them it's a long time,'' he said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   But Percy Ellsworth, a Giants safety for three seasons, said the
occasion would motivate him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to have a ball from the 1,000th game up in the
showcase,'' Ellsworth said, ``and it reads Chiefs 20, Giants 17.
That's no good.''

 &HT;    Moot or not, interracial marriage still an issue
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Next year's session of the Alabama Legislature may be
outlined in black and white as lawmakers debate whether to repeal a
97-year-old passage in the state constitution that bans interracial
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   While Article IV, Section 102 of the Alabama Constitution lacks
the force of law _ U.S. Supreme Court rulings have held states
cannot establish racial requirements for marriage _ some state
legislators still want the law repealed.
</P>
<P>
   The interracial marriage ban may be the nation's last of its
kind. In November, South Carolina voters agreed to delete a similar
prohibition from their constitution.
</P>
<P>
   When South Carolina's constitution was written in 1895, Gov. Ben
Tillman ran his administration based on the belief that white
people should keep control of state government.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, the current constitution was ratified in 1901. A
constitutional amendment requires a three-fifths vote by the state
House and Senate. It must then be approved by a majority of voters
in a statewide referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn University history Professor Wayne Flynt said the push
for a repeal will be backed by black legislators eager to remove a
symbol of racism and by business leaders who opposed the stubbornly
evangelical Christian stands of outgoing Republican Gov. Fob James.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be the business community, not the Legislature, that
pulls the plug on this one,'' Flynt predicted. ``Alabama has been
embarrassed by four years of Jamesism.''
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional passage under scrutiny says, ``The
Legislature shall never pass any law to authorize or legalize any
marriage between any white person and a Negro, or a descendant of a
Negro.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Alvin Holmes, a black Democrat from Montgomery, tried
last session to get the law repealed, but his bill was killed in
committee. He says he'll try again this session and predicts an
easier path after the November defeat of some incumbent
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes, known to stir up racial politics in the state House,
helped get the Confederate flag removed from the Alabama Capitol.
In a state ``pregnant with racism,'' and one where only one-quarter
of the state representatives are black, Holmes said ``you have to
use all the pressure tactics you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes called the marriage prohibition ``a symbol of racism.''
He predicted many legislators wouldn't vote against it but
``they'll have to go to the restroom when it comes up for a vote.
That will be the same as voting against it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two out of every three people polled by the Alabama
Education Association in November favored removing the ban against
interracial marriages. The survey of 569 registered voters showed
almost one in four respondents wanted the ban left in place.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 131 black poll respondents, 71 percent favored removing
the ban. Of the 405 whites surveyed, 62 percent favored ending the
interracial marriage ban.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Johnson, pollster for the Alabama Education Association,
said it was the first time the group had conducted a poll on
interracial marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to expect from that,'' Johnson said,
``since we've had such a long history of racial tensions of one
sort or another.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Chris Pringle, a Mobile Republican and former House
minority leader, said he gave Holmes the idea for the bill. ``I
drafted it last session but didn't put it in,'' Pringle said.
</P>
<P>
   Pringle doesn't see a problem with the bill passing out of the
House, and, in fact, may offer his own bill to repeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you defend something that is flagrantly
unconstitutional?'' Pringle said. ``Nearly every legislator I've
seen quoted on this said (a repeal) should be passed.''
</P>
<P>
   One colleague, though, appeared to favor the interracial ban
when first drawn into the debate during a radio interview but has
since clarified his stand.
</P>
<P>
   On the air with WTNM-AM, a Mobile news-talk station, state Rep.
Phil Crigler didn't bring up the topic but responded when asked
about his views on interracial marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``He argued against (interracial marriages) on a personal basis
for himself,'' said Chris Smith, the radio host who interviewed
Crigler. ``He didn't see it as taboo, and he didn't strongly oppose
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Crigler, who originally appeared on the station to talk about
the November elections and the push for an Alabama lottery, was
invited back by Smith to clarify his views.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will support the effort to remove the ban even though it is
a moot point,'' Crigler said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an exercise in futility. What if it fails (in a
referendum)? That doesn't change the legality,'' he said, because
of U.S. Supreme Court rulings.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the end, the will of the people meant nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Livingston couldn't have been clearer about that.
</P>
<P>
   His mind and the minds of his followers were closed. Even as the
bombing continued in Iraq and Americans from coast to coast were
clamoring for an alternative to impeachment, even as his own
adulterous past was being flushed out in the grotesque invasions of
privacy that inevitably followed the relentlessly prurient pursuit
of the president, even as the country began to contemplate the
destructive effects of a lengthy and bitter Senate trial, the
speaker-designate arrogantly and stupidly proclaimed: ``Let us
disregard the outside influences.''
</P>
<P>
   The radicals on the Hill would hear nothing but the echoes of
their own fanaticism. Impeach! Impeach!
</P>
<P>
   And that continued even after the stunning announcement Saturday
morning that Livingston would quit the House.
</P>
<P>
   Dismayed by the partisan stampede, Dick Gephardt, the Democratic
leader, warned during the impeachment debate on Friday: ``In your
effort to uphold the Constitution, you are trampling the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   David Bonior, the Democratic whip, said: ``This is wrong. It is
unfair. It is unjust. At a time when events in the world and the
challenges at home demand that we stand united, censure is the one
solution that can bring us together. To my colleagues across the
aisle, I say let go of your obsession. Listen to the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   But the voices of reason would not be heard. Livingston and his
right-wing colleagues, the Tom DeLays, the Henry Hydes, the Bob
Barrs, were on a mission of destruction and would not be denied.
Ordinary Americans could cry out all they wanted. They could
protest and demonstrate, send faxes and E-mails. It didn't matter.
The right was on the march and democracy was on the run.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Thomas Barrett, a Democrat from Wisconsin, tried to remind
his Republican colleagues that the Constitution ``does not allow
you to remove a president from office because you can't stand
him.'' He was, of course, ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans will pay a huge price for their brazen, utterly
partisan attempt to drag a president from the White House in
defiance of the will of the people. The party's contempt for the
voters was arrogantly but quite adequately summed up by Alan
Simpson, the former senator from Wyoming, who said: ``The attention
span of Americans is which movie is coming out next month and
whether the quarterly report on their stock will change.''
</P>
<P>
   If the voters are the dopes that Mr. Simpson thinks they are,
then come 2000 everyone will have forgotten there was an
impeachment crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., was probably closer to the
truth when he said, ``I warn my colleagues that you will reap the
bitter harvest of the unfair partisan seeds you sow today.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the many strange events of the past couple of weeks was
the way in which virtually all of the previously undecided
Republicans, the so-called moderates, surrendered their
independence and lined up like lackeys to follow the right wing's
lead. All proclaimed loudly that they were voting on principle, but
in fact it was an exercise in mass cowardice, exemplified by Rep.
John McHugh of upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   McHugh announced on Tuesday that he would vote for impeachment.
But if his decision was based on principle, he had an odd way of
expressing it. The Washington Post said McHugh appeared to have no
stomach for a Senate conviction or removal of the president from
office. Of his colleagues in the Senate, McHugh said, ``I, for one,
would accept, even welcome, their mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, let the Senate do the heavy constitutional
lifting. McHugh may have wished out loud for mercy, but he clearly
was too frightened of the right-wingers in the House to cast a
compassionate vote himself.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP can no longer conceal that it is a party of extremists,
of right-wing absolutists, a party out of step with the political
and cultural orientation of most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Livingston may be leaving, but his arrogant comment can
still serve as his party's slogan. ``Let us disregard the outside
influences.''
</P>
<P>
   Let us disregard the people.

 &HT;    A fall from grace
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Less than two years ago, Dom Capers took a fledgling
franchise to the brink of a Super Bowl, and the Carolina Panthers
coach was the toast of the NFL. Less than two weeks from now,
shortly after the Panthers conclude a season that has been a
disaster on and off the field, Capers instead will be roasted by
owner Jerry Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   The plunge from the penthouse to the outhouse for Capers, a
decent man whose early success raised the bar too high too fast in
Charlotte, is one of the most dramatic falls in the recent history
of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   That it could occur to Capers, a guy so meticulous he has
maintained a leather-bound journal every year of his coaching
career and can detail what he did every hour of every working day,
makes it all the more sobering.
</P>
<P>
   What has occurred since the Panthers lost to the Green Bay
Packers in the conference championship game Jan. 12, 1997, however,
lends a new connotation to the term Carolina Blue.
</P>
<P>
   Not since they defeated Dallas in the '96 NFC semifinal round
have the Panthers beaten a team with a winning record. And since
the middle of the '97 season, Carolina is 5-17 overall, the worst
mark in the NFL during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even watching if from afar, it's painful,'' said Athens native
Willie Green, the wideout who had such a key role in the Panthers'
meteoric rise and now plays in Denver. ``That it could all fall
apart so fast _ no one could have predicted that. From talking to
people there, hearing some things, it sure seems like it's a mess.
Someone will be a fall guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The fall guy will be Capers, given that the perception is he has
lost the respect of his players, as well as too many games. While
he could not have forgotten in two seasons how to coach, it would
take selective amnesia not to find Capers at least partly culpable
for his own demise.
</P>
<P>
   When general manager Bill Polian hied off to Indianapolis in the
spring, Capers demanded and was granted more control over
personnel. In an offseason when Richardson opened his checkbook
wide and set a league record for free-agent spending, Capers
lobbied hard for the acquisitions of defensive end Sean Gilbert and
cornerback Doug Evans.
</P>
<P>
   For their '98 investment of $11 million in Gilbert, the Panthers
have gotten 47 tackles and four sacks. Playing against Washington
last week, his previous employer and a club he harbors a grudge
against, Gilbert had zero tackles. Evans earned $9.5 million this
season, surrendered seven touchdown passes, had two interceptions,
then went on injured reserve at midseason.
</P>
<P>
   Off the field, quarterback Kerry Collins decided that it wasn't
finer to be in Carolina. Tailback Fred Lane was suspended for a
game after making an obscene gesture to New York Jets fans.
Linebacker Kevin Greene tried to choke assistant coach Kevin
Steele.
</P>
<P>
   In a confrontation last Sunday that somehow escaped the cameras,
Winslow Oliver and special-teams coach Brad Seely had a heated
exchange on the sideline. That came after a holding penalty by
Oliver nullified a 97-yard kickoff return for a score by Michael
Bates. When it was suggested to Bates that the Panthers suddenly
looked like a team bankrupt of discipline, he indicted Capers,
saying, ``And where does that start?''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, there has been a disquieting unrest in the
Carolina locker room and, far worse, an apparent schism along
racial lines. Cornerback Eric Davis, one of the team's leaders and
normally a standup guy, claimed he had ``no opinion'' when asked if
Capers should be retained.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 the Panthers were being hailed as the model franchise, a
paradigm for success that was the envy of long-suffering Atlanta
fans. Two years later, the Falcons are into the playoffs, and
Carolina is into the dumper. ``It can be,'' former Carolina safety
Pat Terrell said, ``a cruel league.''
</P>
<P>
   Dom Capers will second that motion.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has gotten to the point where drastic action may
be necessary. You know those movies about Ebola virus outbreaks,
where the guys in sterile suits come in, seal off the area and
completely irradiate it?
</P>
<P>
   They may have to do that to Washington. Just eradicate us and
start from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   In a few, short days we have managed to make the terms
``surreal,'' ``bizarre,'' ``split-screen America,'' ``shocking,''
``runaway train'' and ``politics of personal destruction'' useless
cliches.
</P>
<P>
   We no longer govern here. We just roll around in the gutter
wondering who's next in this sexual auto-de-fe.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, we had the surreal, shocking, bizarre,
split-screen image of Bob Livingston, the speaker-elect, stepping
down after his marital infidelities were revealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all pawns on the chessboard,'' Livingston said, before
asking the president to resign and then resigning himself.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's rabid pursuit of the president, even as he hoped to
hide his own dirty laundry, made him an avatar of hypocrisy in a
capital rotting with hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, when Livingston first confessed his sins to
Republicans in hopes of keeping his hold on his post, his
colleagues gave him a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   And after he made his surprise announcement Saturday, the
Republicans gave him another ovation and stepped up to deliver
encomiums to their lost speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``One's self-esteem gets utterly crushed at times like this,''
sighed Henry Hyde, another tormenter of the president who also had
to admit that he had succumbed to temptation.
</P>
<P>
   Tom DeLay, the jagged-edge exterminator who may next-up in the
speaker roundelay, was choked up, praising the greatness of
Livingston for understanding that this was ``a debate about
relativism versus absolute truth.''
</P>
<P>
   What could be more relative than a Republican who has hidden a
lot of affairs trying to impeach a president for lying about his?
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by Larry Flynt's bounty for sinnuendo, the city was
braced for more craziness.
</P>
<P>
   The Ship of Fools reached cruising speed on Friday evening, when
we had the frightening scene of Republicans so crazed with hatred
of the president that they were railroading through an impeachment
even though the United States was at war with Iraq, even though the
House chamber was mostly empty, even though Republicans were
huddled in a glass house on the issue of sex and lies, and even
though the White House was still pitching a tent and planning
sleigh rides for a Winter Wonderland press party on Monday. (The
White House was keeping the journalists quarantined outside this
year, but encouraged them to bring their kids. To soak up some of
that cozy family atmosphere, no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Why are the Republicans so obsessed, when everyone in his right
mind agrees that impeachment is an outlandishly over-the-top
punishment for Clinton and a self-destructive course for the
country?
</P>
<P>
   Because they genuinely hate the president. They think he's a
dishonest, immoral, issue-stealing, selfish child of the '60s. They
don't think they're going to pay a political price for this, and if
they do, they don't care.
</P>
<P>
   It might be a great time to see a lot of combovers, but it's not
a great time to see a lot of stature. The House debate was not
history. It was just a more hideous version of ``The McLaughlin
Group.''
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans tried to draw the distinction that Clinton had
perjured himself, they ignored that the president had been lured by
the Starr-Jones attorney team into testifying on Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily one would feel sorry for Livingston. But the
Republicans have brought this sexual doomsday machine on themselves
by focusing so single-mindedly on Clinton's sex life.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans were so determined to do their high-tech
lynching that they engaged in wacky role reversals. Many Republican
hawks argued that Bill Clinton should not be bombing Saddam,
claiming the timing was suspicious, even though they had hammered
him for not bombing five weeks ago. In an incredibly unseemly
display, Trent Lott, the majority leader, and former Bush national
security adviser Brent Scowcroft and Bush Secretary of State
Lawrence Eagleburger chimed in on the attack.
</P>
<P>
   There's too much hate here. And I hate it.

EDITORIAL: IMPEACHMENT AND BEYOND 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Subs for updating and rewriting throughout) (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Dec. 20:
</P>
<P>
   Since the House of Representatives mirrors the best and worst in
the American political system, it was perhaps fitting that Saturday
was such a tumultuous and unpredictable day.
</P>
<P>
   It saw an orderly, if misguided use of the constitutional
process. It brought passage of two articles of impeachment against
President Clinton on a brutal party-line vote that defied the will
of the American people. It brought the abrupt resignation of Rep.
Robert Livingston, a Republican leader who had failed to seize his
opportunity to lead his party from the thicket of blind
partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, with both the White House and the majority party in
Congress locked in a crisis of leadership, one element remained
unchanged. The way back to stability is adoption of a censure
resolution that condemns Clinton for lying under oath, but allows
him to remain in office.
</P>
<P>
   The task of securing that outcome passes dramatically to the
Senate, a body that prides itself on being the American
government's citadel of balanced judgment in the midst of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As the magnifying lens of history fixes upon the Senate, we will
see whether its majority leader, Sen. Trent Lott, can carry the
burden that crushed Livingston. The latter will be viewed in the
short term as a victim of the sexual puritanism he had wielded as a
weapon against Clinton. But in the longer view, Livingston will be
remembered for allowing the hard-liners in his party to rush the
country to an unnecessary impeachment showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's first challenge is to block the move by House Republicans
to force Clinton to follow Livingston's example by resigning. The
attempt to force the president to resign would be a repudiation of
the public will. Moreover, it would threaten the rule of law by
showing that Congress cannot define and enforce an appropriate
penalty for a president who has failed in his duties, but whose
misconduct does not meet the constitutional standard for removal.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's second challenge, then, is to guide the Senate to the
stern, bipartisan resolution of censure that has already been
endorsed by many Republican elders. Tim Russert of NBC News has
reported that discussions are already underway among a bipartisan
group of senators about a censure that would involve some form of
presidential admission about false testimony, a heavy monetary fine
and an effort to restrain Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr from
further prosecution of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   If Lott refuses to allow this kind of flexible, bipartisan
search for censure, the burden of his abdicated leadership will
fall upon respected members like Joseph Lieberman on the Democratic
side and Orrin Hatch for the Republicans. Through cooperation, they
can guide the Senate toward a punishment that fixes Clinton in
history as a president who lied under oath, but avoids the taint of
partisan vengeance associated with the House impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the senators behave responsibly, they and the
country face the problem of dealing with a battered president whose
calculated strategy of lying over the airways and under oath has
prolonged this crisis for a full year. If Clinton clings to his
deluded effort to make Congress and the American people endorse the
insulting fiction that he did not lie under oath, he will feed the
Republican efforts to force his resignation. He will also invite a
showdown at his Senate trial on the strong evidence behind the
impeachment article charging him with grand-jury perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Under Senate rules, the 45 Democratic members need only 6
Republicans for the simple majority that can adjourn the trial at
any time and open the way to a censure resolution. But these votes
cannot be purchased with more lies from Bill Clinton.

 &HT;    Defense is Tech's biggest recruiting need
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With a little more than six weeks left until national
signing day, Georgia Tech will use its final 10 football
scholarships to go after some of the top athletes in the South.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yellow Jackets are looking mainly at defense, as they
try to bring in the best recruiting class yet under fifth-year
coach George O'Leary.
</P>
<P>
   With 17 commitments so far, recruiting analyst Jamie Newberg of
Border Wars magazine says Tech is well on its way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're really doing well, especially in-state,''
Newberg said. ``(Pepperell running back) Sidney Ford is a great
player. (Stone Mountain defensive end) Leslie Williams is the best
commitment thus far, for the fact that they need defensive linemen.
That will be the key to the end of their class.''
</P>
<P>
   Two scholarships will count toward last year's total, O'Leary
said, so the Yellow Jackets can sign 27 players on Feb. 3.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked about needs to be filled, O'Leary mentioned tight
end first. ``They're all still out there (uncommitted),'' he said.
``A number of them are set for visits. Defensive end is still a
concern. We'd like to bring in another offensive lineman, a couple
defensive backs, linebackers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets are itching to get tight end Gary Godsey,
Tech backup quarterback George Godsey's younger brother, a 6-2,
245-pounder out of Jesuit High in Tampa. But if Godsey chooses Ohio
State or Notre Dame, then Eran Landry of Pass Christian (Miss.)
High is a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   If Tech is able to sign the defensive linemen all giving Tech
serious consideration, the Yellow Jackets can feel good about
filling their most critical need, Newberg said. They are Campbell's
Shomari Chism, Greg Gathers out of East St. John's High (La.) and
Marist's Hugh Reilly, whom Newberg considers widely underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   The top defensive backs Tech has a good shot at, Newberg said,
include Parkview's Jeremy Muyres, who's brother Jon Muyres is a
receiver at Tech, and Cory Collins from Egg Harbor Township (NJ).
</P>
<P>
   Tech needs another kicker/punter in addition to Walton's Phillip
Newman, who has committed, and is eyeing Nick Setta of Lockport
(Ill.) Township High.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets are still in the running for Washington
quarterback Latrez Harrison, who is deciding between Tech and
Auburn, and Willie Simmons of Shanks (Fla.) High. To land either or
both of those, Newberg said would be ``icing on the cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech had 18 recruits on campus this weekend and expects another
18 the weekend of Jan. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're well on our way to filling our needs,'' O'Leary said,
``but there are a lot of good players still out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech's accomplishments on the field this season should make
getting them easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, they've got in the final stages with some of the
special kids and lost them,'' Newberg said. ``When you go 9-2, beat
Georgia and make it to a major bowl to play Notre Dame, and
probably beat Notre Dame, that helps you. This year, they'll get
those kids instead of just missing out.''

 &HT;    Running backs top Bulldogs' wish list
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ With more than a month to the national signing day
for college football, Georgia already has 17 commitments.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs seem to have addressed two of their concerns _
secondary and wide receivers. But Georgia coach Jim Donnan still is
courting several players at his biggest need _ running back.
</P>
<P>
   LaGrange High running back Bruce Thornton, a preseason Super 11
choice by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, remains near the top of
Georgia's list. Thornton, 6-feet-2, 185 pounds, has scheduled four
official visits during January_ Georgia, Notre Dame, Florida and
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Derrick Watson of Palmetto High in Williamston, S.C.,
the state's player of the year, also will visit Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, who rushed for 2,534 yards and 44 touchdowns as a
senior, says he is wide open among Georgia, Tennessee, South
Carolina and Clemson. Watson has scheduled official visits to all
four schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs also are involved with Nick Maddox of A.L. Brown
High in Kannapolis, N.C., rated the No. 3 running back nationally
by SuperPrep. Maddox reportedly has Florida State, Florida and
Tennessee as his favorites, followed by Georgia and North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia also is recruiting tailback Michael McConnell of
Adairsville, who reneged on a commitment to Michigan State, and
Shaud Williams of Andrews, Texas, who favors Texas Tech and the
Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville's DeJuan Green and Arkansas' Cedric Cobbs also are
possibilities for the Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan got four commitments after Georgia's biggest recruiting
weekend so far. Defensive backs Dantra Clements of East Coweta High
and Stanford Simmons of Hargrave Military in Virginia, wideout
Damien Gary of Clarke Central High and defensive end Johnathan
Sullivan of Griffin all chose the Dogs last week.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons, a 6-foot-1, 195-pound cornerback, was a Parade
All-American in 1996 at Clay County High in Ashland, Ala. He signed
with Auburn each of the last two years but enrolled at Hargrave
after failing to academically qualify. Simmons is expected to
enroll at Georgia in January, along with former Carrollton
defensive back Jamie Henderson. Both could be eligible to
participate in spring practice.
</P>
<P>
   Terrence Edwards of Washington County and Reagan Torbert of
Peach County, both of whom signed with Georgia last February, also
are scheduled to enroll in January. Edwards already has joined the
Bulldogs' basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, a 6-foot-4, 270-pound Super 11 choice, was perhaps the
state's most dominating lineman this season. He had 50 tackles, 47
assists and 13 sacks, leading Griffin to an 8-4 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's as good as advertised,'' LaGrange coach Steve Pardue
said. ``He could play for any team in the state right now, and that
includes Georgia Tech, Georgia and the Falcons.''

 &HT;    Courting stress, NBA coaches get off lucky
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Falcons coach Dan Reeves underwent coronary
bypass surgery Monday, the news jolted his peers in the NFL and
sent a reminder to all the NBA coaches who are chafing to return to
the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Beware, the message said, stress can kill you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at what they do in football and, if anything, we have
more of it,'' the Hawks' Lenny Wilkens said. ``Maybe it helps that
we don't dwell on one game because there's always another one
around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'd have to say that as a group we've been very fortunate.
Thank God. I know the coaches in our sport are in pretty good
shape, but still we've been very fortunate it hasn't happened as
often with us as it seems in football.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been a few cases of heart trouble. Bill Fitch had
open-heart surgery during his tenure with the Los Angeles Clippers,
and Scottie Robertson and Johnny Bach had problems while working as
assistants. But NBA coaches have remained remarkably healthy given
the pace of the game on the court and the rigors of travel with
back-to-backs and sets of four games in five nights that require
irregular eating and sleeping patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens said he learned to manage stress after being
hospitalized with a life-threatening blood clot following surgery
on his Achilles' tendon when he was in Cleveland in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clot had nothing to do with my overall health, but it made
me realize how vulnerable you can be,'' he said. ``When that
happened I came to realize that even though I will work as hard as
I can to get the job done, at the end of the day I've got to turn
things loose. That was a wake-up and it had nothing to do with
coaching, but something like that makes your realize your own
mortality.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawks general manager Pete Babcock says, ``I think coaching in
any sport at any level is stressful. But the stress in professional
sports is all relative. Real stress is having to pay the utility
bill, having to make a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawks still generous
</P>
<P>
   This is the time of year when Hawks players would make a number
appearances on behalf of children. With the lockout in force, the
team's staff is picking up the slack. Babcock, Wilkens and others
will appear at CASA Kids, 52 Avondale Road, at noon today. Monday
evening, the staff will be hosts at Jocks and Jills, CNN Center,
for children of the Grace Home of Waiting Children of Georgia.
Wilkens will read ``Twas the Night Before Christmas.'' Tuesday
afternoon, the staff will make its annual visit to Scottish Rite
Children's Medical Center on Johnson Ferry Road. ... On Monday, the
Hawks will announce their gift of 2,300 uniforms to the city's 170
youth basketball teams. The scheduled Dec. 12 start of city leagues
for girls and boys was delayed by the city's dispute with a
sporting goods company.
</P>
<P>
   They also talk a lot
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hardaway ripped Miami teammate Alonzo Mourning and the
Knicks' Patrick Ewing after they begged public sympathy by saying,
sure, NBA players make a lot of money, but they also spend a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have a gag order on some of our players,'' Hardaway
said. ``Some people are not saying the correct things. They're
blah, blah, blahing this out and that out and, man. ... They should
be quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Needy NBA players?
</P>
<P>
   Jayson Williams said he refused to be part of Saturday's
exhibition in Atlantic City until the players removed themselves
from the proceeds, belatedly agreeing to give all the money to
UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only 5 percent of America makes $275,000 a year,'' Williams
noted. ``If you mismanage your money, you get a job. I'm not going
to hold a game for somebody making $275,000. For `needy' NBA
players? There's no such thing. When I found out (proceeds were)
going to charity, my marketing firm said OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker has to wait
</P>
<P>
   It appears Antoine Walker will stay with the Celtics, because
his $100million contract demand will be stymied by any new working
agreement. When Walker hits the market next summer, the league says
the cap will be at $35million per team and a player with 0-to-six
years experience will be able to max out at an average of about
$11million per year for the six, with a 10 percent raise for the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Ehlo on employees
</P>
<P>
   Former Hawk Craig Ehlo, who retired last season after 14 years
in the league, said current players have lost all proper
perspective of the game. ``I think the thing that we had going for
us was we understood that we were still an employee of an
employer,'' Ehlo said. ``I think they've lost that now. The players
think because of the way salaries are that they are the show. We
understood that there was an owner who put up all the risk for us
to play.

 DESPITE FUROR OVER BOOK, MULTICULTURALISM THRIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like most children, the second-graders in room 205 at
Public School 116 in Murray Hill love to see images of themselves
in the stories they read, their teacher said last week.
</P>
<P>
   They love the story about how people of every shade rally to
help a Hispanic mother and daughter who lost everything in an
apartment fire. They love to read about how children come in ``All
the Colors of the Earth.'' They especially enjoy a book about an
African-American father who leaves home to find work, only to
return when the seasons change.
</P>
<P>
   These are tales that most of the 27 students in Virginia
Lockwood's class can relate to, Ms. Lockwood said on Thursday. They
are mostly children of employees at the United Nations, and come
from Vietnam, the Caribbean, Japan and other places, as well as
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In a setting so dizzyingly diverse, race and ethnicity are
beside the point, Ms. Lockwood said. Multiculturalism _ a
flashpoint for so much recent tension and bitterness in the city's
public schools _ is no big deal in Ms. Lockwood's class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't say, `Look, children, here's a story about a little
African-American boy, or here's a story about a Vietnamese girl,'''
Ms. Lockwood said. ``Instead, I say: `Look, children, here's a
great story about feelings.' Let's read it together. The characters
might happen to be black, Hispanic or Asian, but that's not the
point.''
</P>
<P>
   But not every classroom in the city is so relaxed. Last month, a
white third-grade teacher was driven from a school in Bushwick,
Brooklyn, by black parents angry over her use of a book called
``Nappy Hair,'' a coming-of-age story about a black girl. The
parents _ whom Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew later criticized as
misguided _ denounced and threatened the teacher after concluding
that the book was offensive.
</P>
<P>
   In a school system where 66 percent of the 70,000 teachers are
white and 70 percent of the 1.1 million school children are black
and Hispanic, having white teachers teaching black history and
culture can hardly be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Bushwick incident resonated throughout the city, it
did not dampen the enthusiasm of teachers like Ms. Lockwood. If
anything, it only strengthened their resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lockwood integrates multiculturalism into her classroom
mostly through reading and writing, rather than introducing it as
something separate _ a trap that many people fall into, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lockwood's strategy seems to work. While reading a story
last week about American children picking on an Asian girl because
of her native clothes, a Vietnamese student said emphatically that
the outfit was ``dress-up clothes, not pajamas.'' An
African-American boy then offered to have his mother sew the
outfits for all the students in the class.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have children sharing information about their culture in a
relaxed setting, rather than setting it up as a day for this
culture or that culture,'' Ms. Lockwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Wesson Spivey, a black librarian at Public School 198 in
East Flatbush, and Teri Gray, a white Jewish second-grade teacher,
help each other avoid culturally insensitive material by running
books by each other.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spivey also relies on parents. Last week, she asked a Muslim
mother to read a book about Ramadan to see if it was culturally
sensitive. The parent approved the book and Ms. Spivey added it to
the library.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not, `Mother, may I use this book?''' Ms. Spivey
said. ``It was more like, `What do you think?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spivey is certain that she would have been driven out of
Public School 75 in Bushwick right alongside the teacher, Ruth
Sherman, over the use of ``Nappy Hair.'' She has been recommending
it to white colleagues since it was published last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets on my nerves that this is something that people still
have to figure out,'' Ms. Spivey said. ``I've spent a lifetime
being a voracious reader and none of the books were about me. When
`Nappy Hair' came out, I was ecstatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sherman transferred from Public School 75 to Public School
131 in Jamaica, Queens, about two weeks ago after some black
parents threatened her at a public meeting. They said the book, a
critically acclaimed story by a black scholar, was racist.
</P>
<P>
   They were angered by black-and-white photocopied pages of an
illustration from the book that were left in mailboxes around the
community. The fliers showed a dark-skinned black child complaining
about having kinky hair. Taken out of context, the illustrations
can appear jarring and the text insensitive.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Crew lashed out at the disapproving parents, saying
their actions could cause white teachers to shy away from a
multicultural curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sherman, however, has said in interviews that she would not
be deterred and planned to use the book at her new school.
</P>
<P>
   With the approach of Black History Month in February, Evelina
Barker, a Hispanic parent who lives in Bushwick, wondered aloud
whether teachers were going to fear teaching children about
historic black figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going to happen here?'' Ms. Barker said recently on a
windswept sidewalk outside Public School 75 on Grove Street. Her
8-year-old daughter, Amani Coleman, was a student in Ms. Sherman's
class. ``If a teacher teaches something in Spanish, are they going
to be called racist?''
</P>
<P>
   Isoke Nia, a black instructor at Teacher's College at Columbia
University, said she has seen white teachers teach black history
better than some black teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't let the words come out of my mouth that only black
teachers can teach black kids,'' Ms. Nia said. ``We as a people,
who have had a less than pleasant relationship with America, need
to sit down together and shake out some of the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anyone banning any Asian books or stories about
the Holocaust,'' Ms. Nia continued. ``In books about the Holocaust,
Jewish people aren't referred to kindly in every sentence. It's the
knowledge of the teacher. The question is do they have the
sensitivity to teach it. In most cases, the answer is yes.''

 UNION SCANDAL COULD PRODUCE A TOUGHER NEGOTIATING STANCE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Against all expectations, the corruption scandal at
New York City's largest municipal union could end up transforming
the union into a more formidable adversary in coming contract
negotiations with the city, labor experts say.
</P>
<P>
   While the scandal has in some ways hobbled District Council 37,
Lee Saunders, the man sent in by the parent union to run the
council, has promised to take a more aggressive negotiating stance
than that adopted by Stanley Hill, who was forced out last month as
executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Hill was widely seen in the city's labor movement as having an
accommodating approach toward Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in negotiating
the union's five-year contract, which included a much-disliked
two-year pay freeze. In contrast, Saunders has put Giuliani on
notice that he will bargain hard on workfare and other issues about
which Hill was largely docile.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see a more militant union, more progressive,
more aggressive,'' Saunders said in an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   The council's current five-year contract, which covers 120,000
workers, expires in 2000, but many union leaders predict that
negotiations for a new contract will begin next year.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders has talked about invigorating the union to get members
more engaged _ in part to help put more pressure on the city. Under
Hill, the district council's membership was largely passive, except
in a few of the locals, most notably the hospital workers' local,
which has repeatedly demonstrated against the mayor's plans to
privatize or close city hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the union could be weaker than it was,'' said
Greg Tarpinian, president of the Labor Research Association, a New
York consulting group. ``The reality is nobody is talking about a
more conciliatory D.C. 37. If you had gone from something that was
a fighting force to something that was in crisis, that would be one
thing. But that's not the reality. Lee Saunders now has something
to prove to the membership.''
</P>
<P>
   Other unions are also spoiling for a fight. Many of their
leaders say they are angry that District Council 37's contract was
ratified with the help of vote fraud and that the city pressured
them into accepting contracts. They say they are ready to demand
extra money for their members _ if not as a Christmas bonus, then
in a future contract.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 30, the council's parent union, the American Federation
of State, County and Municipal Employees, took control of its
affairs. The parent union's president, Gerald McEntee, put Saunders
in charge as the Manhattan district attorney broadened his
investigation into allegations of embezzlement, kickbacks and vote
fraud.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There is still no consensus about who might become the union's
next executive director. Some union officials have suggested that
Saunders might take the job after his trusteeship ends in a year,
but Saunders says he is not interested.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if Saunders was interested _ and labor experts say it
would be unwise for him to admit that now _ he could be expected to
talk tough about future negotiations to gain support of the
membership.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Randy Levine said the city was eager to begin talks
even though more than a year remains in the current pact. ``We
would love to meet and start negotiations early because there are
many productivity steps and other concessions that we'd like to
obtain,'' he said. ``There aren't going to be any wage increases
without the continuation of serious productivity gains.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``I don't believe you're going to see any of them
choosing to come to the table with us. They all think that they
would do much better with the next mayor, whoever that is, than
with Rudy Giuliani.''
</P>
<P>
   The negotiating landscape has already changed. Hill had been
chairman of the Municipal Labor Committee, which coordinates
bargaining strategy for nearly 100 municipal unions, but he has
been replaced by Randi Weingarten, president of the United
Federation of Teachers. In the past few years, she has taken a more
combative stance toward the city than Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weingarten suggested that the vote fraud had made many other
union leaders hungry to challenge the mayor. ``More and more unions
are saying that in light of the fraud, the mayor has a moral
obligation to come up with something more for the workers,'' Ms.
Weingarten said.
</P>
<P>
   But Levine said: ``Nobody's entitled to any bonus. None of these
unions are going to get any advantage from that malfeasance.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s and '70s, District Council 37, then led by Victor
Gotbaum, was able to win innovations in its contracts that other
municipal unions sought to copy. Some labor experts predict that
McEntee will push District Council 37 and Saunders to play such a
role again.
</P>
<P>
   ``D.C. 37 used to be a pattern setter for other municipal
employees nationwide,'' said Carol O'Cleireacain, who at one time
was the district council's chief economist. ``Gerry McEntee
certainly understands that a more aggressive pattern from this
council is going to benefit government employees nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Hill was forced to take an unpaid leave on Nov. 30,
intrigue has swirled over who will run the council once the
trusteeship ends.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal has left a leadership vacuum: Hill is gone; the
union's associate director, Martin Lubin, and another top official,
Mark Shaplo, have resigned over their role in rigging the contract
ratification vote. Charles Hughes, president of the largest local,
has been expelled after a union panel found that he had embezzled
more than $1.7 million. And Albert Diop, president of the second
largest local, is a target of the district attorney's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   There is also general agreement that two dissenters who have
pushed hardest for reform _ Ray Markey, president of a librarians'
local and Mark Rosenthal, president of a motor vehicle operators'
local _ will not become the next executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal rules himself out. ``I'm not qualified,'' he said.
``I'm just a worker.''
</P>
<P>
   Markey also denies interest, insisting that the next executive
director should be Charles Ensley, a longtime Hill critic who heads
a local representing 14,000 social workers. But Ensley, who has
made enemies in his years battling Hill, also said he was not
interested, and said he was thinking of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials say Hill has told them he would like to return
as executive director, but he is under investigation and some union
leaders predict that he will be disqualified from returning.
</P>
<P>
   In such a case, Hill's supporters may rally around James
Tucciarelli, a Hill ally who heads a local representing 1,000
sewage treatment workers. Tucciarelli denies interest, and several
union officials said they doubted he could be elected because of
his identification with Hill. Another name often mentioned is
Zachary Ramsey, assistant director for research and negotiation at
the council.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As defiant as on the day she blamed the Monica
Lewinsky scandal on a ``vast right-wing conspiracy,'' Hillary
Rodham Clinton went to Capitol Hill on Saturday morning and blasted
the impeachment process as unfair and politically motivated. She
told House Democrats that the president would continue to fight and
that they should, too.
</P>
<P>
   In a closed meeting with the House Democrats, Mrs. Clinton said
she was there in part as ``a wife who loves and supports her
husband,'' and charged that Republicans were impeaching her husband
_ ``hounding him out of office,'' she said _ because they opposed
his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said this is as much about ending his agenda on health
care and other things as about hounding him out of office,'' said
Rep. Bob Menendez of New Jersey. ``She said there would be no
resignation and we should not and cannot allow them to hound him
out of office.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's continued support for her husband has been seen
as crucial to his popularity, cited again and again by those who
say they will stick with him, too, in statements along the order of
``If Hillary doesn't mind, why should I?'' or ``That's between him,
his God and Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   She had been credited with saving his political skin at least
twice before, appearing at his side on ``60 Minutes'' as he denied
a long affair with Gennifer Flowers, and going solo on the
``Today'' show to complain about a ``vast right-wing conspiracy''
after Clinton's denial of ``sexual relations with that woman, Miss
Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   And though Mrs. Clinton got generous credit for campaigning
before the November elections, some Democrats had expressed a
little nervousness lately, wondering why she hadn't offered fresh
support for the president.
</P>
<P>
   Her staff has insisted that she did all she could, consulting
constitutional scholars and regularly discussing the issue with the
president. Friends said she had been annoyed by suggestions to the
contrary: Was she supposed to issue daily statements of support? Or
lobby Republicans who wince at the mention of her name?
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, though, her mission was clear. Mrs. Clinton is
extremely popular among congressional Democrats _ far more so than
her husband _ and she came to inoculate him against the possibility
that Democrats could be persuaded that his resignation might be
best for the country. Two House Democrats, Rep. Louise Slaughter of
New York and Rep. William Lipinski of Illinois, had already said
they would urge resignation if he were impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was determined and defiant,'' said Rep. Jerrold Nadler of
New York. ``Her message was that they've been pursuing him since
the day he came into office.''
</P>
<P>
   The president has not always enjoyed warm relations with
congressional Democrats, many of whom disagreed with him on welfare
and thought at times that he worked rather too cozily with their
Republican counterparts. On Saturday, Mrs. Clinton reminded them
that her husband was not the real issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said this goes beyond her husband, to the Constitution and
the presidency,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, who has himself been
critical of the president at times. Not on Saturday, though:
``Resign? We say, `Hell, no.'''
</P>
<P>
   In what several members called a ``pep rally,'' Mrs. Clinton
thanked Democrats for their support and asked them to keep it
coming, receiving half a dozen standing ovations. Afterward,
members stood in line to give her a hug. And as they left, several
House Democrats referred at least obliquely to Mrs. Clinton's own
political prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's probably the most popular person in the country with
Democrats, period, and that's also true of us in the caucus,'' said
Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, where Mrs. Clinton has been mentioned
as someone with the potential to succeed Daniel Patrick Moynihan in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Her appearance on Saturday, following supportive remarks she
made on Friday, did seem to end a week of speculation that Mrs.
Clinton had decided to protect her political future by distancing
herself from her husband, in the hour of his greatest political
need.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That the Clintons held hands rather less on their recent trip to
Israel than on earlier trips, and that Mrs. Clinton seemed to pull
away from her husband at one moment, were reported on CNN, NBC and
a number of newspapers as evidence that Mrs. Clinton was no longer
on the team. The headline on the page one story that ran in the
Washington Times on Wednesday was ``Hillary shows signs of
relinquishing role as the defender in chief for her husband.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday she said she had gone to the Hill as ``a wife
who loves and supports her husband,'' a Judiciary Committee staff
member during Watergate who knows firsthand how the process should
work, and an American who feels proud of the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio said he felt pumped up by the
meeting with Mrs. Clinton: ``It's a campaign all over again. This
needs to be a fight every step of the way, and we're going to wake
the town and tell the people.''
</P>
<P>
   And he suggested that at this late date, the two-for-one
presidency has new life: ``She's so terrific,'' he said. ``It's
lucky for America we have a woman with the strength to lead the
nation right now. And everybody understands she is one of the
leaders of the nation right now, as much as the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the question is whether Mrs. Clinton's pep talk will
sustain Democrats in the days ahead, amid a steady succession of
jaw-dropping events on Capitol Hill. Less than an hour after the
meeting _ after Rep. Bob Livingston made the surprise announcement
that he won't become speaker _ Rep. Jane Harman of California said
the meeting with the first lady had been quite emotional, but then
added, ``It seems like we've lived a century since then.''

 &HT;    Hockey's huge deals go bust
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The number of $5 million-a-year NHL players doubled
this season from seven to 14. The average salary has jumped to $1.2
million _ from $271,000 in 1990-91. And Detroit forward Sergei
Federov ($14 million) earns more than the entire roster of the
expansion Nashville Predators ($13.6 million).
</P>
<P>
   As we enter the holiday season, several NHL executives are
learning the hard way that you can get burned for paying full
retail.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Blackhawks, who aren't close to competing for a
Stanley Cup, gave unrestricted free-agent forward Doug Gilmour a
three-year contract worth $18million. Through 29 games, Gilmour had
grossed $2,121,951, scored three goals and netted a rating of
minus-14.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other fizzled investments:
</P>
<P>
   _ Los Angeles, needing an offense-minded defenseman, gave Steve
Duchesne a three-year, $11.25million deal. Result: one goal, eight
assists.
</P>
<P>
   _ San Jose guaranteed defenseman Gary Suter $10million over
three seasons. The return has been one game and a torn triceps
muscle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Brett Hull, who signed for $17million over three years with
Dallas, has missed nine games because of injuries, pouted at times
over not getting enough ice time and scored eight goals and 17
points in 18 games.
</P>
<P>
   _ Carolina, which made a run at Federov last year, only to have
the Red Wings match the offer, this year settled on Pittsburgh
free-agent center Ron Francis for a staggering $20.8million over
four seasons. But Francis, who doesn't have nearly the supporting
cast with the Hurricanes that he did in Pittsburgh, has managed
only five goals and a rating of minus-seven in 29 games.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Toronto Maple Leafs can't complain about the four-year,
$24million deal they threw at goalie Curtis Joseph. Or can they?
Through 23 starts, Joseph was 12-9-2 with one shutout, a 2.64
goals-against average and .903 saves percentage. But Carolina
goalie Arturs Irbe, the free-agent bargain of the millennium at
$550,000, is 9-7-3 with three shutouts, a 1.95 GAA and .932 saves
percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a risk signing one of these guys,'' Los Angeles
general manager Dave Taylor said. ``The majority of these players
don't reach unrestricted status until they're 31, 32, 33. And in
order to get these guys, you have to overpay, and you put too many
years on the contract, so you pay for it down the road. There's
competition for them, and teams feel if they don't sign one they're
going to fall behind.''
</P>
<P>
   NHL players cannot become unrestricted, or Group III, free
agents until they are 31 or have 10 years experience.
</P>
<P>
   Thrashers general manager Don Waddell agreed that ``age becomes
a big factor'' when pursuing unrestricted free agents, although he
doesn't support the contention of some that veterans let up after
landing a major deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like after they sign a contract that there's a lack
of effort,'' Waddell said. ``But there's so few real top guys who
become unrestricted free agents that they get a lot of attention.
Consequently, they make a lot of money, and the expectation level
is very high, maybe higher than it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Signing a goalie tends to be less risky, because they mature
later in their careers. Conversely, Gilmour is 35, missed 18 games
last year in New Jersey and has seen his production tail off. This
year, he plays for a team that can't get out of last place, despite
the presence of the NHL's top goal scorer, Tony Amonte.
</P>
<P>
   Amonte said he thinks ``it's been tough'' for Gilmore to live up
to the contract, although he added, ``I do think he's helped our
power play. We needed another centerman. His points are down a
little bit from when he was in his heyday in Toronto and Calgary.
But it's not just up to him. He has linemates and teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said the results with Duchesne ``have not been what we
expected,'' but he attributed the player's struggles in part to the
absence of his defense partner Rob Blake, who has been injured most
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Next season's likely unrestricted free agents include goalies
Patrick Roy (Colorado) and Guy Hebert (Anaheim), forwards Theo
Fleury (Calgary) and Pat Verbeek (Dallas) and defenseman Brian
Leetch (N.Y. Rangers).
</P>
<P>
   Nobody will be marked down.

TEAMSTERS LOCAL ELECTION SEEN AS VOTE AGAINST CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A candidate running on a platform of fighting corruption has
been elected president of a New Jersey Teamsters union local long
considered to be one of the most corrupt labor organizations in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The 4,400-member unit, Local 560 of the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters, has been under federal trusteeship since
1986, and last had an election in 1988. It represents truck
drivers, warehouse workers and factory employees.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Brown, a onetime truck driver who had been serving as the
local's president by designation of its board until he won Friday's
election, said, ``This tells the mob and their cronies to get out
and keep on going.''
</P>
<P>
   The election took place after the court-appointed trustee, Edwin
Stier, spent years trying to weed out officials and members with
mob ties and to encourage honest workers to move into leadership
positions.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1950s through the '70s, Local 560, based in Union City,
was run by the Provenzano family, especially by Anthony ``Tony
Pro'' Provenzano, who was convicted of racketeering, extortion and
murder.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Local 560 became the first Teamsters local in the
nation to be taken over by the federal government as the result of
a civil racketeering suit charging leaders with being close to
mobsters.
</P>
<P>
   Many members of the local have complained about being under
federal control for 12 years, but Stier said rooting out all the
corrupt elements had been difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Stier said Brown's victory, achieved with a turnout of 46
percent of the membership, was an important step toward ending the
era of mob influence. He said he would soon make a recommendation
about the trusteeship to the federal judge who oversees the union,
but did not say what he might recommend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election,'' Stier said in an interview, ``confirms my
belief that the membership has rejected domination by organized
crime and has created new independent leadership that has fought
against the racketeer element in the union.''
</P>
<P>
   Stier was badly disappointed the last time he organized an
election at Local 560. That election, held in 1988, was won by
Michael Sciarra, who was later expelled from the union after he was
found to have associated with the Genovese crime family.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has served as president of the local for the last 13
months, having been elected by the local's seven-person board. The
board's composition has changed in recent years as Stier repeatedly
ousted members found to have connections to organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, whose seven-member slate swept the election, said his
board was like that of many other unions, dedicated to negotiating
good contracts, recruiting new members and fighting for its
members' grievances.
</P>
<P>
   According to official results, Brown received 55 percent of the
vote, easily outdistancing his two rivals. One was Daniel Sciarra,
nephew of the ousted former president. The other candidate was Al
Laurie, who was business manager under Sciarra. Brown received
1,049 votes, Laurie 476 votes and Sciarra 376 votes.

 &HT;    Devils' good fortune starting to irk Gretzky
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wayne Gretzky of the Rangers is starting to become
irritated with the New Jersey Devils' success this season, and for
good reason. When the Devils dumped their border rivals 6-3 the
other night, it extended their unbeaten streak over New York to 12
games (8-0-4). New Jersey also was unbeaten in eight overall
(6-0-2) going into Montreal on Saturday and was averaging 5.6 goals
per game in the previous five. This team used to be the master of
the 2-1 win under coach Jacques Lemaire but has become more wide
open under Robbie Ftorek. Goalie Martin Brodeur is not having a
great year, but says, ``I think I felt sorrier for myself when we
were only scoring one goal.'' Gretzky calls the Devils ``a good
team,'' but he did not want to go overboard in his praise.
``They're a solid team, the team we're all chasing at this point,''
he said. ``But I've been in this game a long time, and I've yet to
see a team win the Stanley Cup in December.''
</P>
<P>
   Say what?
</P>
<P>
   This must go down as one of the all-time U-turns in the history
of negotiating contracts. Ziggy Palffy, a three-time 40-goal
scorer, finally came to terms with the New York Islanders on a
five-year, $24.8 million contract. He signed the deal just hours
before he was about to sign with a team in Slovakia. After coming
to terms, Palffy denied his comments from the week before, when he
said he would never play for the Islanders again and now wanted to
play for the Rangers. ``I always wanted to be a New York
Islander,'' he said. ``I want to make it clear that I didn't say I
wanted to be a New York Ranger. I said I wanted to beat the
Rangers.'' What Palffy really wanted, and received, is a $1 million
signing bonus and base salaries escalating from $3 million to $6
million.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.:
</P>
<P>
   Felix Potvin remained a goalie without a team after trade talks
broke down between Toronto and Tampa Bay. The Lightning, which was
offering forward Mikael Renberg, gave up on the deal and sent
Renberg to Philadelphia, where he started his career. Renberg has
been reunited with linemates Eric Lindros and John LeClair. ...
Scalpers reportedly are getting as much as $3,500 for a ticket to
the final game at Maple Leaf Gardens, Feb. 13. Toronto is moving
into the new Air Canada Centre the following week. ... Although the
Southeast Division, future home of the Thrashers, remains weak,
Carolina went 6-1-2 after a 8-10-3 start to expand its first-place
lead over Florida. The streak included consecutive 3-0 wins over
Detroit and Edmonton. ... Nobody else has to say the Florida
Panthers are underachieving. Team captain Scott Mellanby will say
it for them. ``What we've got now is some guys who have to realize
that their skill isn't enough. You've got to work your tail off in
this league to score.'' ... Poor Washington. Already wracked by
injuries, the Capitals learned left wing Chris Simon will require
shoulder surgery, sidelining him for the season.

 &HT;    The last laugh rests with Chicago's Amonte
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Chicago forward Tony Amonte would like to believe it's
kismet that he's having one of his best seasons the same year
Vancouver coach Mike Keenan is desperate for a scorer. Amonte, who
scored a league-high 21 goals in the Blackhawks' first 29 games,
began his career with the New York Rangers and played for Keenan in
the 1993-94 season. But the two often feuded and Amonte was traded
in March of that year, missing the Rangers' Stanley Cup run. Amonte
had two 30-goal seasons before Keenan's arrival and scored 31, 41
and 31 in the last three years with the Blackhawks. But under
Keenan, he scored only 16 in 72 games. Keenan's Canucks are
averaging 2.8 goals per game. ``He didn't like me very much and I
didn't like him,'' Amonte said last week. ``I still don't like him.
He said (the trade) was just business at the time. He said I wasn't
any help to the club, and he had me believing I wasn't any help.
But as Mike Keenan says, that's life and life's not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   No deal
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Keenan, his continued attempts to pressure general
manager Brian Burke into trading the rights to holdout Pavel Bure
have gone for naught. Los Angeles general manager Dave Taylor, who
resisted making trades and dealing young talent during the Kings'
awful start, said, ``We're not dealing with (Vancouver). I don't
expect anything to happen with Bure.'' The Kings and Rangers, two
big-market teams looking for scoring help, were believed to be the
likely candidates for a trade. The Rangers recently swung a trade
with Pittsburgh for another holdout, Petr Nedved, and might not be
as desperate. Bure, meanwhile, is spending Christmas in Moscow. His
current contract technically expires after this season, but agent
Mike Gillis can forget about any thoughts of claiming that his
client is an unrestricted free agent should Bure sit out the entire
year. Burke said he has been assured by league officials that Bure
would still owe the team one year. ``But I don't expect it to come
to that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the eight wingers for the Dallas Stars are
right-handed, and some players have had difficulty getting shots
off in recent games. It remains to be seen if the situation will
require a trade a become a problem in the second half and during
the playoffs. ``The angles they approach passes and their
forechecks are different,'' coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``It's a big
adjustment, and it takes a smart player to play there.'' ...
Phoenix finally might be ready to land. After a 17-3-4 start, the
Coyotes were winless in their last three games, went 0-13 on the
power play during a four-game trip and lost center Keith Tkachuk to
a groin injury.

UNDERSTANDING THE INDEX FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Resending; please ignore any other file bearing this
slug.)  
 (For release Sunday, December 20, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. You mentioned that the average domestic stock fund had a
year-to-date gain of only 6.5 percent. This seems rather low. I
have one fund, Oppenheimer Growth, Class A, which has had a
year-to-date gain of only 7 percent and I consider that poor
performance. My other equity mutual funds range from 7.85 percent
to 26 percent year-to-date gains. Our total portfolio, which
includes several professionally managed investment accounts, has a
year-to-date gain of 15.3 percent, with an allocation of 62.6
percent in stocks, 30 percent in bonds and the rest in cash
equivalents. Since the stocks are mostly large cap companies and
the Standard and Poor's 500 has a year-to-date gain of 21.26
percent, this seems like a reasonable gain. So if the average
domestic stock fund has gained only 6.5 percent this year, I would
consider the average fund poorly managed. Is this correct?
</P>
<P>
   R.B., Anaheim, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, things have improved a bit since I wrote that, with the
average domestic stock fund having a 7.20 percent year-to-date gain
as of Dec. 10. But when you look at such figures, you should
remember that many of the funds that go into the calculation are
required by their charters to operate in market segments that are
currently unpopular. Thus while growth funds showed the highest
year-to-date average, at 14.22 percent, the figure for all domestic
stock funds was dragged down by the 7.59 percent average loss for
small company growth funds, and the meager 2.65 percent gain for
mid-cap funds.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these statistical glitches, your point is well taken,
and it goes far to explain the mushroom popularity of index funds.
A lot of apologists for the mutual fund industry have spent a lot
of time explaining that the terrific performance of the big index
funds in the past few years will probably prove an anomaly over the
longer run -- that the past few years have seen the large-cap
stocks that dominate the indexes move ahead almost in lockstep,
thus driving the index funds to their strong results. I think this
is a reasonable argument to explain the dramatic outperformance of
the last three years, when the average domestic stock fund produced
average annual returns of 16.19 percent, compared to 25.98 percent
for the Standard and Poor's 500 Index. But note also that if you go
back a full decade, the average annual figure posted for the
average domestic stock fund was 14.34 percent, which compares to
17.87 percent for the S&AMP;P 500 (and 17.70 percent for the largest
S&AMP;P fund, Vanguard Index 500). Perhaps something in the
neighborhood of half of the difference between the S&AMP;P 500 results
and those of the average domestic stock fund can be ascribed to the
fees and expenses which mutual fund owners bear. An additional part
of the variance can, as above, be tied to results of some funds
which are required to be in a particular market segment, no matter
how unpopular it is. But in the end, I'm afraid, there's yet
another element, which is that some mutual fund managers seem to
try too hard; the competition for the investor's dollars lead some
mutual fund managers to turn their portfolios too often, and to
take some short-term risks, attempting to bump their star ratings
from Morningstar Mutual Funds. Morningstar, which supplied the
long-term figures I cited above, no longer uses categories such as
aggressive growth or capital appreciation. But Lipper Analytical
Services Inc. still uses the Capital Appreciation category to
denote funds which take the most aggressive investment stance. As
of Lipper's report of Dec. 3, for the last five years the Capital
Appreciation group average showed a 97.76 percent gain. In the more
sedate growth group, the average total return was 124.41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But to complete the tortoise-and-hare portrait, in those same
five years the average growth and income fund posted 125.34 percent
returns, while the average S&AMP;P 500 fund posted a 171.57 percent
total return. During those five years, only the Science and
Technology and Financial Services segments topped those of the S&AMP;P
index funds, with figures of 178.16 percent and 177.95 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   So I think the answer to your question takes two parts. One,
obviously, is that you and your advisors have done a good job of
building your portfolio. But it also seems true that the portfolio
has been at the right place at the right time -- and if you don't
change your investment mix as the market focuses change, ultimately
the markets will focus in other segments than the large caps, and
you'll find the comparative results less attractive than you do
now.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In September of 1997 my son invested an IRA account of
$90,000 in Vanguard funds, with 50 percent in Vanguard Index Value,
20 percent in Vanguard Specialized Health Care, and 15 percent each
in Vanguard International Growth and Vanguard International Value.
This IRA will have 23 years before he must make his initial minimum
withdrawal. While I am satisfied with the composition of the funds,
I wonder if he wouldn't be better off by using something more
aggressive -- such as Vanguard Index 500 or Vanguard Index Growth
-- instead of Index Value.
</P>
<P>
   H.N., Dedham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, if your son were required to maintain the same
portfolio for 23 years, I would be inclined to agree with you. But
while I've never been much of a believer in market timing, I do
like the idea of periodically switching among Vanguard's three
funds that track the Standard and Poor's 500 Index and its subsets.
If you are willing to look at broad market trends and are confident
in your judgment of the status of market trends, you might decide
that you will hold Index 500 in a neutral market, use Index Growth
in a market with low PEs and high dividends, and use Index Value
when stocks are expensive and dividends low. If you're going to use
this approach, I don't advocate frequent switches, but rather
setting a schedule that requires a reassessment of the portfolio
allocation no more than once a year -- and perhaps even once every
other year.
</P>
<P>
   If your son were to adopt such a strategy, I think the current
market fully justifies holding the position in Index Value, so I
would make no change there right now -- or for the foreseeable
future.
</P>
<P>
   But I would suggest one fairly minor change. To achieve broader
market diversification, why not suggest your son reduce the
positions in International Growth and International Value by 5
percent each, putting the proceeds of those sales into Vanguard's
Small Cap Index fund?

   WASHINGTON _ Moments before impeaching President Clinton on
Saturday, the House rejected a Democratic proposal, along party
lines, to allow lawmakers to censure Clinton instead of impeach
him.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after a failed procedural vote on the censure
alternative, about half of the 206 Democrats stalked out of the
House chamber to protest the Republican leadership's decision to
block a floor vote on censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're offended by this process,'' Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo.,
the Democratic leader, told reporters at the base of the Capitol
steps. ``They have disregarded the clear will of the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls show that Americans prefer censure over
impeachment, but House Republican leaders vowed to block a censure
vote, arguing that it was unconstitutional for the House to punish
the president, instead of the Senate. Republican leaders feared
that allowing a vote on censure would drain away votes for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, conceding they were fighting a losing battle,
nonetheless used a series of procedural motions to push the censure
alternative to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The censure motion, which was rejected in the House Judiciary
Committee, stated that the president made ``false statements''
concerning his ``reprehensible conduct with a subordinate.'' It
also condemned the president for taking steps to ``delay discovery
of the truth'' and said Clinton remained subject to criminal and
civil penalties once he left office.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the version proposed in the committee, Saturday's censure
motion did not require the Senate's approval or Clinton's
signature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment should be used only as a last resort,'' said Rep.
Rick Boucher, D-Va., author of the censure motion. ``It is a
drastic remedy to remove a tyrant.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans said censure was not an option the Founding
Fathers envisioned as a part of the impeachment process. ``Censure
is outside the framework of the Constitution,'' said Rep. Charles
Canady, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   With the direct route to censure blocked, the Democrats took
other parliamentary steps. Just before voting on the first article,
Democrats asked the House to reconsider the impeachment resolution,
but with instructions to censure Clinton instead. This is called a
motion to recommit.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans immediately challenged whether the censure proposal
was relevant, or germane, to the underlying impeachment issue. This
is called a point of order.
</P>
<P>
   There were several minutes of debate on this matter. But the
results were carefully scripted, since both sides had submitted
their arguments in advance to the House parliamentarian, Charles
Johnson, for his ruling. The parliamentarian, the arbiter of House
rules, is a nonpartisan position, and members are obliged to follow
his recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   After the brief debate, Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., whom Speaker
Newt Gingrich named to preside over the impeachment vote from the
speaker's chair, read a statement, based on Johnson's advice,
ruling that censure was not germane.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats appealed the chair's ruling. But House Republican
leaders have made parliamentary votes a test of party loyalty. The
appeal lost, 230-204. Only two Republicans voted with the
Democrats, Constance Morella of Maryland and Peter King of New
York.

 &HT;    Miami hot for back
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson bypassed Randy Moss this
year because of off-field concerns, but his need for a big,
every-down tailback might force him to take a chance in the '99
draft. One player Miami scouts are monitoring closely is tailback
Cecil Collins, who over the last two seasons has been booted out of
LSU and McNeese State, played in only six games, undergone knee
surgery and tested positive for drugs. Collins, who had a great
season in '96 after replacing injured Kevin Faulk, currently is in
a halfway house in Baton Rouge. If ``The Diesel'' gets his life on
track, he will be a first-round choice. Blesto Scouting, which
assesses players for 12 teams, rates Collins the top player
available. The rest of the top five prospects, excluding
underclassmen: WR Torry Holt (North Carolina State), FB Ron Konrad
(Syrcuse), RB Ricky Williams (Texas) and QB Daunte Culpepper
(Central Florida). The Dolphins still like incumbents Karim
Abdul-Jabbar and John Avery, but short-yardage problems convinced
Johnson and coordinator Kippy Brown to get a bigger back.
</P>
<P>
   Back for more
</P>
<P>
   As predicted here last week, San Diego owner Alex Spanos granted
GM Bobby Beathard a two-year contract extension late Thursday
night. That move ensures the team will not pursue Green Bay's Mike
Holmgren and suggests San Diego will replace June Jones with a
college coach. Beathard desperately wants to retain the current
defensive staff _ Joe Pascale (coordinator), Wayne Nunnely (line),
Jim Vechiarella (linebackers) and Rod Perry (secondary) _ along
with offensive line coach Joe Bugel. Word is that Bugel has
informed Beathard he won't stick around if another Kevin
Gilbride-type is hired.
</P>
<P>
   Steelers stalled
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Bill Cowher's public criticism last week of
quarterback Kordell Stewart comes word the Pittsburgh coach has
been just as harsh in private with his first-year offensive
coordinator, Ray Sherman. The classy Sherman has been under
scrutiny since replacing Chan Gailey and he's had a tough year
trying to learn the offense, formulate game plans and refine
Stewart's techniques. Sherman has attempted to afford Stewart more
input into planning, seeking preferences for third-down calls, but
gotten nowhere with the young signal-caller. Stewart's ``crying
game'' last week, after being replaced by Mike Tomczak, could force
GM Tom Donahoe to seek an alternative. The team is said to be
enamored of UCLA's Cade McNown as a second-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   Miami vice
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins are apoplectic at having only one defender selected
to the AFC Pro Bowl squad. Coordinator George Hill is incredulous
that one player was tackle Tim Bowens. Scouts feel the Dolphins'
other tackle, Daryl Gardener, was superior. The selection earns
Bowens a $500,000 salary increase for '99, which doesn't thrill
Jimmy Johnson. The team feels middle linebacker Zach Thomas along
with cornerbacks Terrell Buckley and Sam Madison merited more
consideration. Free safety Brock Marion now has played 40 straight
games without an interception.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis leaving the building
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if Kansas City quarterback Elvis Grbac winds
up in Cleveland in '99, reunited with fellow former 49ers Carmen
Policy and Dwight Clark. The Chiefs seem to be more sold now on
quarterback Rich Gannon, a potential free agent, and quietly have
talked to him about an extension. Dumping Grbac could save them as
much as $2 million on next year's salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Etc
</P>
<P>
   Since corner Eric Allen was injured Nov. 15, the Oakland defense
has gone 18 quarters without an interception.

 &HT;    Despite disappointing season, Bobby Ross' zeal to win burns in
Detroit
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Because the public persona reflects the gentility of
his Southern upbringing, the discipline of military education and
the rectitude of a church-goin' man whose Sunday mornings still
mean as much to him as his Sunday afternoons, Bobby Ross isn't
about to curse the darkness of the Detroit Lions soulless 1998
season.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, unless Ross is operating in the
what-is-said-here-stays-here sanctuary of the locker room, the man
who led Georgia Tech to a share of the national title in 1990 isn't
about to curse at all. Ever in character, he will mumble the
trademark ``dad-gummed'' or ``gosh-dang'' for the benefit of
minicam jockeys paid to document the fact the man possesses passion
as well as a pulse.
</P>
<P>
   But if his guards have let him down this season (as have his
tackles and wide receivers and players at just about every other
position), Ross isn't about to let down his guard. The emotions
which so often and so obviously have simmered below the surface
after inexplicably shabby performances have yet to fully erupt for
public consumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be a time bomb ticking inside of him,'' said
defensive end Robert Porcher late last week, ``but it's only going
to blow up in front of us. Lately, you might have to say the
explosions resemble the last few nights in Baghdad. Given the
situation, they're justified. He's pretty (angry) and he's got a
right to be. I mean, it wasn't supposed to be this way, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the Lions host the Atlanta Falcons this afternoon,
the matchup has a definite role reversal feel to it.
</P>
<P>
   The people who sign Ross' paychecks, of course, moonlight by
building Ford trucks and automobiles. But instead of wheeling
around in an F-Series pickup in '98, the coach has been driving a
rusty old Edsel with a faulty transmission. Atlanta, conversely,
has traded in its Yugo traditions for a shiny stretch limousine.
</P>
<P>
   The irony, some will claim, is that Ross might have been
piloting this Falcons joy ride had he opted to return to the city
where he led one of the college game's best turnarounds of the past
two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, when Ross and Falcons president Taylor Smith led
local media on a wild goose chase around the city in January of
'97, both men knew the courtship was merely a facade. Smith had all
but committed to Dan Reeves and Ross already had a handshake deal
with Lions owner William Clay Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Ross may have conducted a mental inventory of the Falcons and,
as some front-office people from both sides suggested, decided the
club's talent did not compare favorably to that on the Detroit
assembly line. The prospect of trying to recreate the miracle of
The Flats in the precinct of Suwanee, though, never was seriously
considered.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two years later, neither regrets the staged mating dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both knew where things were headed,'' Ross said recently.
``Because of my respect for the Smith Family, and I'd like to think
their respect for me, we owed it to each other just to get
together. I'm sure they're thrilled with the way things turned out
and I'm happy for them. This is where I wanted to be and I'll never
second-guess myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly since his early-season switch of quarterbacks, from
nine-year veteran Scott Mitchell to rookie Charlie Batch, the fans,
some players and the media all have handled those second-guessing
chores for him.
</P>
<P>
   By his third season in San Diego (1994), Ross had taken a team
to the Super Bowl and similar results were expected with the Lions.
</P>
<P>
   Now some wonder if he'll survive more than three years with
Detroit, a team whose stars are on the downside of their careers.
The urgency expressed by veterans such as tailback Barry Sanders
and wide receiver Herman Moore hasn't carried over to the rest of
Ross' team and he has become the target for a group of players who
fear that their chances for winning a championship are running out.
</P>
<P>
   His critics emphasize that Ross, who was brought in to win
immediately, suddenly is enamored with rebuilding the club around
Batch and a younger talent pool that includes wideouts Johnnie
Morton and Germane Crowell, guard Jeff Harting, linebacker Stephen
Boyd, free safety Ron Rice and corners Bryant Westbrook, Terry Fair
and Kevin Abrams.
</P>
<P>
   Team vice chairman William Clay Ford Jr. debunks the notion that
Ross' direction for the franchise has changed or that he has worn
on his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to win this year, next year, every year,'' Ford said.
``That's all that drives the man. It's all he knows.''
</P>
<P>
   With two games remaining this year, the Lions are just 14-16
(counting a '97 playoff defeat) under Ross' stewardship. Last
season's 9-7 performance was supposed to be a starting point and
not a high-water mark. Should the Lions drop both games left on the
schedule, this season would tie for the franchise's worst
performance since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Already the year represents an NFL low for Ross, who in six
previous pro campaigns never finished worse than .500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I despise (losing),'' Ross said when asked how he has
reconciled this season. ``The grass doesn't look green, the sun
doesn't shine, all those things. It's bad. It's ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the notorious workaholic has extended his
already-torturous regimen. Ross has privately questioned his team's
heart, charged some with playing only for the paycheck following
one lethargic defeat, jabbed at the veteran leadership, cajoled and
criticized and juggled. The consummate coach has pored over hours
of videotape and, as is his wont, reviewed the schemes on both
sides of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The results, unfortunately, are hardly reflective of his efforts
and last Monday's loss at San Francisco was an embarrassment in
which it appeared the Lions had quit on him. In the wake of that
defeat some old charges that were raised in San Diego _ that Ross
is a coach eventually tuned out by his players _ again resurfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have switched to a different frequency, Ross allowed,
will find themselves in a different city next year. The turnaround
for the Lions, he said, begins today.
</P>
<P>
   ``These last two games are about establishing character,'' said
Ross, a man eminently familiar with that coveted commodity. ``All
of us, me included, are going to find out what we're all about
here.

 &HT;    Raising the ante for Washington ownership
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The battle for ownership of the Washington Redskins
heated up last Wednesday when New York banker Howard Milstein and
Bethesda, Md., businessman Daniel Snyder bid a whopping $720
million for the club. That bid, which is 36 percent more than Al
Lerner paid for the Cleveland Browns expansion franchise, could
blow away team president John Kent Cooke, son of the late owner
Jack Kent Cooke.
</P>
<P>
   A clever element involved with the Milstein bid is that it is
only good through this Wednesday. The seven other suitors are to
submit binding bids by Tuesday. That means the seven trustees who
operate the team might have less than 24 hours to evaluate the
Milstein-Snyder bid against others before it disappears.
</P>
<P>
   Cooke last week secured additional financing which enabled him
to raise his bid from $450 million to about $600 million. If he's
able to keep the Skins, look for Cooke to retain GM Charley
Casserly and coach Norv Turner for one more year. If the
Milstein-Snyder group prevails, it will pursue Green Bay coach Mike
Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   More green for Garrison
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco GM John McVay already has contacted agent Pat Dye
Jr. about a new deal for tailback Garrison Hearst. For practical
reasons, the former Georgia star deserves a contract upgrade. He
needs just 61 yards in the final two games to break Roger Craig's
single-season club rushing record and has been named to his first
Pro Bowl squad. But the Niners have pragmatic reasons as well for
wanting to renegotiate. The club already is $22 million over the
projected '99 salary cap and McVay certainly will need some of the
juggling skills of predecessor Carmen Policy to find a remedy. The
goal is to lower Hearst's 1999 cap figure from $2.65 million to
about $1.5 million by replacing base salary with signing bonus.
McVay desperately wants to retain young wideouts Terrell Owens and
J.J. Stokes. The former can become a restricted free agent next
spring and the latter an unrestricted player. Look for the 49ers to
get their annual cap relief from quarterback Steve Young.
</P>
<P>
   Bad news Bears
</P>
<P>
   Although vice president Mark Hatley wants to give coach Dave
Wannstedt another year in Chicago, the decision will be made by
president Mike McCaskey. Since earning a wildcard berth in '94,
Wannstedt's second season, the Bears are 23-39. Chicago failed to
land a player in the Pro Bowl for the fifth straight season,
currently the longest such streak in the NFL. The team's last
players in the annual all-star game were defensive end Richard
Dent, corner Donell Woolford and free safety Mark Carrier in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Trent not entrenched
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty over ownership has kept the Redskins from making
a contract offer to quarterback Trent Green, who can become an
unrestricted free agent in February. In the seven games since the
Skins' bye on Oct. 25, Green has thrown for 1,675 yards and 14
touchdowns, with just two interceptions. Washington is 5-2 in that
stretch and Green, 28, has a passer rating of 89.6. ``The
indications are that their hands are tied for now because of the
question of ownership,'' agent Jim Steiner said. The Skins probably
will release quarterback Gus Frerotte after the season to avoid
paying him a $1.25 million roster bonus due on Feb. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia coach Ray Rhodes acknowledged last week he's going
to be fired, but he doesn't sound like a man worried about
employment. ``I had a job when I came here and I'll have a job when
I leave,'' Rhodes said. ... One scout's perspective on why Arizona
quarterback Jake Plummer has developed quicker than Pittsburgh's
Kordell Stewart: ``If Jake makes a mistake, he shrugs it off. Bad
plays seem to hang with Stewart longer.''

 &HT;    Two-minute drill with John Elway
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Subject: Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   Topic: His rivalry with Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino.
</P>
<P>
   Background: Elway and Marino entered the NFL as part of the
celebrated ``Class of '83,'' when a record six quarterbacks were
selected in the first round. Between them, the pair has thrown for
109,224 yards. But in 16 seasons, the two have played only once,
the Dolphins claiming a 30-26 victory in '85. On Monday night,
Marino and Elway match up for the second, and probably the final,
time in their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How has the Marino-versus-Elway debate affected your career?
</P>
<P>
   A: It seems like it's been there forever. Because we're the same
age, people compared us in high school, college and finally, the
NFL. Dan hit the ground running in the league, and I had to climb a
little more. But him being around, yeah, it's been an (incentive).
</P>
<P>
   Q: You have the one thing he doesn't have, a Super Bowl ring.
Have you two talked about that at all?
</P>
<P>
   A: It used to come up all the time when people pointed out no
one from that Class of '83 had one. It was like an asterisk after
our names. I'm sure Dan got tired of talking about it, just like I
did, so we stopped bringing it up when we got together.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it fair to say you're a fan of his?
</P>
<P>
   A: To do the things he's done and put up the numbers he has, how
could you not admire that? But what I admire most is how he loves
to compete. You still see that same look in his eyes every time
he's on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Spotlight on . . . .
</P>
<P>
   _ Veteran: With two more wins, the Cardinals gain their first
playoff berth since '82. To get the first today, against New
Orleans, quarterback Jake Plummer must be very decisive against a
Saints defense that will bring plenty of pressure from the inside.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rookie: With Mark Brunell (ankle) and Jamie Martin (knee) both
out, Jacksonville will turn to rookie Jonathan Quinn as its
starter. A shaky performance by the third-rounder from Middle
Tennessee State could cost the Jaguars a first-week bye in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Free agent: New England defensive tackle Chad Eaton flopped
with three teams before landing with the Patriots in '96. Over the
past three games, he has 32 tackles and three sacks and will have
to play stout if the Pats are to slow the 49ers' Garrison Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Miami coordinators Kippy Brown (offense) and George
Hill (defense) were outcoached badly by their New York Jets
counterparts last Sunday. The duo will need better game plans
against Denver on Monday for the Dolphins to have a chance for an
upset.
</P>
<P>
   Tip sheet
</P>
<P>
   The contract extension that has been on the desk of Green Bay
coach Mike Holmgren since August is worth much less than the $4
million per year that has been reported, and he has no intention of
signing it. Packers GM Ron Wolf quietly is solidifying his short
list of potential replacements. ... Former UCLA coach Terry Donahue
and San Diego State coach Ted Tollner are campaigning quietly for
the Chargers job. ... The first three coaches who will be
interviewed by Cleveland Browns president Carmen Policy are Denver
offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak, Green Bay quarterbacks coach
Andy Reid and Jacksonville offensive coordinator Chris Palmer. The
Browns probably will interview six to eight candidates. ... He has
yet to throw his first regular-season pass, but several teams
already are eyeing New York Giants No. 3 quarterback Mike Cherry,
who will be a restricted free agent in February. ... The Redskins
will expose tailback Terry Allen in the expansion draft. ... By
landing a spot on the NFC Pro Bowl team, New Orleans defensive end
Joe Johnson earned a $1 million bonus and voided the final season
of the five-year deal he signed in September. ... Look for
Minnesota offensive coordinator Brian Billick to emerge as the
leading candidate to succeed Ted Marchibroda in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Thumbs up
</P>
<P>
   In a year when the ``zebras'' have come under fire, game
officials Jerry Markbreit, Johnny Grier, Phil Luckett, Ed Hochuli,
Gerry Austin and others donated time and money visiting children's
hospitals around the country for the holidays. The guys in stripes
deserve a nod for their generosity.
</P>
<P>
   Thumbs down
</P>
<P>
   All six offensive tackles selected for the Pro Bowl _ Tony
Boselli (Jacksonville), Tony Jones (Denver), Jonathan Ogden
(Baltimore), Larry Allen (Dallas), William Roaf (New Orleans) and
Todd Stuessie (Minnesota) _ play the left side. The left and right
tackle spots have evolved into different positions and should be
voted as such.
</P>
<P>
   The list
</P>
<P>
   There are four new starting quarterbacks today _ Frank Reich
(Detroit), Steve Bono (St. Louis), Jonathan Quinn (Jacksonville)
and Scott Zolak (New England) _ raising to 62 the number who have
started at least one game in 1998. That number is believed to be
the most since the 1970 merger. The number of starting quarterbacks

<P>
   ``We are here to debate impeachment and should not be distracted
from that,'' the minority whip, Rep. David Bonior, Democrat of
Michigan, said during Saturday's House debate, in what leaped out
as an impossible goal. It would have taken a kaleidoscopic
television screen to capture the constantly shifting images
competing for center stage: impeachment, Iraq, the resignation of
Rep. Robert Livingston, the response from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The months leading up to the impeachment of President Clinton
had become a series of televised anticlimaxes, but the hours before
the vote made up for that lack of drama. There were hardly enough
shorthand terms or split screens to cover the activity.
</P>
<P>
   All the networks and cable channels carried the moment that
unexpectedly set the tone, as Livingston, a Louisiana Republican,
announced during the debate that he would not become House speaker.
The commentators had been set to carry the congressional
ratification of the inevitable vote, but suddenly the most
plugged-in reporters were caught off guard. As Tim Russert said to
Tom Brokaw on NBC, ``Tom, knock us all over.''
</P>
<P>
   In the echo chamber that television news so often becomes, the
shared mantra had been weightier in early morning. ``For only the
second time in American history'' a president would be impeached,
went the standard line. Yet despite all the pundits speculating and
politicians telegraphing every move, no one had hinted at the
Livingston resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was, as Brokaw put it, at least partly ``a
political ploy,'' and the repercussions were immediate. Reporters
began gathering word from Capitol Hill about candidates for the
speaker's job, and the conversation moved to the next stage of the
political tug of war. The Republicans used Livingston's resignation
to say that the president should resign, too; the Democrats
immediately countered with the idea that the president would stay
and that Livingston should as well.
</P>
<P>
   That led to one of the less-expected split screens of the day,
and it was not a bad choice. While Congress was debating, CNN
showed anti-aircraft fire in Baghdad in one box. In the other, Joe
Lockhart, Clinton's press secretary, stood in the White House
driveway telling reporters that the president would like Livingston
to reconsider his decision.
</P>
<P>
   There was more stateliness in the House than television usually
offers, and one reason was purely visual. ``Keep in mind that we do
not control the picture,'' Dan Rather said on CBS, explaining that
the television cameras in Congress are provided by the House, not
the individual networks. There was no way to roam and zoom in for
reaction shots, as at a political convention.
</P>
<P>
   But the sense of history and decorum didn't last long at CBS. At
noon, before the vote, CBS went to a football game, becoming the
only network to leave the news coverage. CBS' corporate decision to
try to have it both ways meant that Rather would break in with
updates from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll see you very soon,'' he said as he signed off the
complete coverage, looking like a trouper. But he was in a position
no news anchor should have been in on this day. He later announced
impeachment votes on a split screen with the football game in
progress in the upper part of the screen.
</P>
<P>
   On the other networks and cable channels, the vote itself
literally happened in the background. As TV screens toted up the
numbers of the electronically-cast vote, members of Congress milled
around and chatted on the floor. Even the brief Democratic walkout
after a motion to consider censure was defeated was thoroughly
forecast. As the Democrats straggled down the steps of Congress, it
looked curiously undramatic on television, though it probably made
a better still photograph once they were all in place.
</P>
<P>
   And while the votes were in progress, the jockeying for the
speaker's job heated up. ``We already have a presumptive leader,''
Gwen Ifill of NBC News said in midafternoon, naming Rep. Dennis
Hassert, R-Ill., who had also been cited by the other networks as a
likely candidate.
</P>
<P>
   If the political and military action had not intruded, it might
have been more obvious that the debate on the House floor sent a
message about vast divisions in politics and morality, signaling
how deep a cultural fissure this crisis has opened.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment, said Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, was ``a debate
about relativism vs. absolute truth.'' Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.,
contended that Congress had lost the ``distinction between sins and
crimes,'' and argued against the ``sexual McCarthyism'' that has
become prominent.
</P>
<P>
   And against the backdrop of the revelations of adultery that led
to Livingston's resignation, Rep. Dick Gephardt, the minority
leader, declared ``the politics of personal destruction has to
end.''
</P>
<P>
   But as all the jabbering and political posturing continued, as
reporters raced to cover the president's statement about the
impeachment and the latest briefings from the Pentagon, there was
little time to focus on the profound cultural message beneath those
rhetorical flourishes.

 &HT;    Breaking addiction's hold
 &HT;    By Jeff Nesmith
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The answer to America's drug problem may lie
somewhere in the roots of an obscure plant that grows wild in
African rain forests. That is, if only scientists could read and
follow the directions the plant seems to be giving them.
</P>
<P>
   With a single capsule _ or perhaps several over a period of
weeks _ heroin addicts, alcoholics, cocaine users, even smokers,
might erase or at least interrupt their cravings. One researcher
talks hopefully of a skin patch from which addicts would slowly
absorb a compound that blocks the biochemical events that trigger
the desire to smoke, shoot up or drink.
</P>
<P>
   But after several million dollars' worth of federally funded
research, efforts to understand the plant and the properties of a
compound squeezed from its cells have foundered on a tangle of
lawsuits and conflicting scientific results.
</P>
<P>
   That is unfortunate, said Dr. Stanley Glick, chairman of the
department of pharmacology and neuroscience at Albany Medical
College in New York. ``In my view, it is something that certainly
should be investigated,'' Glick said. ``When you hear the same
stories from enough people enough times, you have to believe that
there's something at least worth investigating.''
</P>
<P>
   The stories Glick and others have been hearing for a decade
involve the results of ``offshore'' treatment of drug addicts at
clinics in the Caribbean and Panama with a substance called
ibogaine. In dozens of cases, addicts report that a day or two
after taking ibogaine, a relatively mild hallucinogen, they are
strangely free of cravings.
</P>
<P>
   The plant from which ibogaine is extracted is Tabernanthe iboga,
and hunters in the African nation of Gabon have known about it for
centuries. They say eating small quantities of iboga root enables
them to remain alert, yet motionless, for hours on end.
</P>
<P>
   But until 1962, when Howard S. Lotsof, then a New York film
student, decided to try the drug, no one knew of its effect on
addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Lotsof explained that he and several friends were experimenting
with a variety of psychoactive drugs, including LSD and heroin. He
had no intention of ending any kind of drug use when he heard about
ibogaine and decided to give it a try at the age of 19, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty hours later, my desire to use heroin had vanished,'' he
recalled. He suggested that several other friends give it a try,
and they had the same experience.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Lotsof did nothing about ibogaine. But in 1980, he
decided the discovery was too important to be ignored. He filed
patents on the use of the drug to treat addiction and formed a New
York corporation, NDA International Inc. The purpose of the company
is to market a preparation he named Endabuse, composed of capsules
that contain an ibogaine compound, and to pursue research. He
sought Food and Drug Administration approval for clinical trials of
the drug.
</P>
<P>
   By then, ibogaine had been designated a controlled substance by
the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, like cocaine and
marijuana. With the cooperation of physicians in the Netherlands,
Lotsof opened a clinic to treat heroin addicts there, where it was
legal.
</P>
<P>
   Several patients reported the treatments relieved their
cravings. Others were not helped. One young woman died.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lotsof met Dr. Deborah Mash, a brain researcher at
the University of Miami School of Medicine. In 1992, Lotsof's
company and the university signed a contract for Mash to conduct
research on ibogaine and seek FDA approval for human trials. Under
the contract, Lotsof and NDA retained the rights to ibogaine and
any ``discoveries, inventions or improvements'' growing out of
Mash's research.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, FDA approved her proposal for a clinical trial in which
a few volunteers would take ibogaine to assess its side effects.
About the same time, animal studies into the drug's effect were
beginning to show results.
</P>
<P>
   In studies at Albany Medical College, funded by the National
Institute on Drug Abuse, Glick found that drug-addicted laboratory
rats injected with ibogaine appeared to lose their craving for
heroin, cocaine and nicotine. Other researchers found that ibogaine
interfered with addiction to alcohol, Glick said.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one knows why this happens, Glick and others
theorize that something in ibogaine hinders the molecular processes
by which drugs stimulate the feeling of pleasure and craving in the
brain. ``I think there is enough information to warrant doing
reputable clinical investigations,'' Glick said. ``There is a
wealth of animal data. I think there is very good evidence, and
some of it we provided, that the drug may interfere with addiction
to opiates, stimulants, (alcohol) and nicotine.''
</P>
<P>
   But other animal experiments were not so encouraging. Scientists
at Johns Hopkins University reported that ibogaine destroyed brain
cells in rats. Another study showed it caused heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   Then the lawsuits began.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Mash sued NDA and Lotsof, accusing him of failing to
keep up his end of the contract by not obtaining adequate patent
protection for a new ibogaine-related compound she and her
associates had discovered. She sought $50,000 in damages and asked
a federal court in Miami to let her and the university out of the
contract. Lotsof countersued, accusing the university and Mash of
defrauding him and stealing his patented uses of ibogaine. He also
said that by operating an ibogaine clinic on the Caribbean island
of St. Kitts, the university and Mash were illegally competing with
a similar clinic he had opened in Panama to obtain clinical data.
</P>
<P>
   Mash said she owned no interest in the St. Kitts clinic, where
she acknowledges ibogaine is used to treat addicts, but said her
husband, a Miami lawyer, is legal adviser to ``investors'' behind
the St. Kitts clinic. She also said patients pay up to $10,000 for
her treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA-approved trials are on hold because of lack of funds to
continue and because of the lawsuits, she said. Meanwhile, after
spending more than $2 million on research grants, the National
Institute on Drug Abuse is losing interest in ibogaine. ``The drug
doesn't look terribly promising in terms of the risks and
benefits,'' said Frank Vocci, director of its Medications
Development Division.
</P>
<P>
   Vocci said he believes Glick is the only researcher still
receiving support from the institute for ibogaine experiments. And
Glick said he thinks it is unlikely ibogaine will ever be approved
as a drug to treat addiction, but he still believes further
research is worthwhile. ``I also think there is a good possibility
that safer and more (effective) derivatives of ibogaine could be
successfully developed,'' he said. ``Ibogaine is a benchmark
against which such derivatives will be compared and, for that
reason alone, it is important to know as much about ibogaine as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Mash said she remains optimistic about ibogaine, despite the
problems she has had in obtaining funding for research. She said
ibogaine and its derivatives offer hope of ``a very gentle way for
an addict to detox,'' perhaps someday through a skin patch.
</P>
<P>
   Lotsof said ibogaine allows addicts, especially heroin users, to
put aside their fears of withdrawal and begin the process of
detoxification.
</P>
<P>
   The legal fights and discouraging scientific findings have not
kept an ibogaine subculture from growing in several countries, and
a variety of Internet sites now offer information that is, for the
most part, biased in favor of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   One of the sites recently posted a long account from a
self-described ibogaine patient who happily described the wonderful
effects it had on her. The essay is followed by a sad postscript,
stating that a few months after writing her account, the patient
relapsed into drug addiction and committed suicide.

   WASHINGTON _ The House of Representatives impeached President
William Jefferson Clinton for perjury and obstruction of justice on
Saturday and called on the Senate to try him, convict him and
remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   The critical first votes nearly tracked party lines. After Rep.
Ray LaHood of Illinois, the acting speaker, ruled a last-minute
Democratic bid for censure out of order, 228 members, all but five
of them Republicans, voted to impeach him for perjury before a
federal grand jury here on Aug. 17. With 206 representatives,
including five Republicans, voting no, the impeachment was adopted
at 1:25 p.m. ET.
</P>
<P>
   The vote to impeach him for obstruction of justice in trying to
cover up his affair with Monica Lewinsky by inducing her and others
to lie was narrower, 221-212. Twelve Republicans, apparently less
persuaded by the evidence on this charge, voted no but five
Democrats again voted yes.
</P>
<P>
   Two other charges were voted down. An accusation of perjury
about Ms. Lewinsky in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit was
rejected, 229-205, with 28 Republicans breaking ranks with their
leaders. Some of them said that perjury in a civil case was not
serious enough for impeachment, even if perjury before a grand jury
was. Five Democrats voted to impeach. That vote came before the
obstruction charge was approved.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the House overwhelmingly rejected an accusation of
abuse of power, a term taken from the proceedings against Richard
M. Nixon in 1974. The article accused him of perjury in his answers
to 81 questions the Judiciary Committee had sent him in hope that
he would admit lying. The vote was 285-148. Eighty-one Republicans
defected from their party; only one Democrat deserted his.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the votes, Republicans pressed another line of
attack on the president, demanding Clinton's resignation. Rep. Bob
Livingston, nominated for speaker last month by his party, startled
the House when he called for Clinton's resignation and announced he
would set an example by not running for speaker and would resign
from the House after 21 years of service in the wake of this week's
disclosure of his own extramarital affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton rejected the advice immediately. His spokesman, Joe
Lockhart, said, ``The president has no intention of resigning.'' By
calling on Livingston to reconsider, the president argued more
broadly against resignation under fire. Perhaps speaking to both
cases, Lockhart said, ``It would be wrong to give in to this
insidious politics of personal destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless Clinton changes course and resigns, the Senate will
conduct only the second impeachment trial of a president in the
209-year history of the republic. Clinton will be the first elected
president put on trial, since Andrew Johnson, impeached and
acquitted in 1868, had been elected vice president and succeeded to
the White House on Abraham Lincoln's assassination in 1865.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, has
insisted that no bargaining over censure can prevent the trial from
starting.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the degree of partisanship displayed Saturday,
assembling the two-thirds majority required under the Constitution
for conviction is most unlikely. Sixty-seven votes would be
required, and there are only 55 Republicans in the Senate, along
with 45 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican argument, over and over, was that Clinton had
lied in denying having sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky. Rep.
Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, said, ``A nation of laws
cannot be ruled by a person who breaks the law.'' Rep. Nancy
Johnson of Connecticut said: ``There can be no justice without the
truth. That is just profoundly so, and that is why perjury
matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gerald Kleczka of Wisconsin began the Democrats' arguments
by saying, ``What the president did was wrong, both personally and
morally, but his acts did not threaten our democracy and thus do
not rise to the level of impeachable offenses as defined by our
founding fathers in our Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Schumer, New York's senator-elect, said: ``The rule
of law requires that the punishment fit the crime. Allow us to vote
for censure.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's votes were the penultimate step in the most serious
conflict between Congress and a president since Nixon resigned in
the face of impeachment and certain conviction on Aug. 9, 1974.
</P>
<P>
   But while that case spun out from a 1972 break-in at Democratic
headquarters in the Watergate complex, this one began with a murky
land deal in Arkansas in 1978. Through the efforts of Kenneth
Starr, the independent counsel under the law enacted in the wake of
Watergate, the investigation spread to examine Clinton's affair
with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   All year it has preoccupied the capital despite an immense
disconnect with public opinion; since the scandal became public in
January, polls have shown that the public opposed impeachment and
wanted the inquiry brought to an end. Even on Friday night, after a
13-hour debate, a CBS News Poll of 548 people showed that only 38
percent wanted their representative to vote for impeachment; 58
percent wanted a no vote.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict now enters uncharted seas, since the Nixon
resignation cut the matter short and the Johnson trial occurred in
a different America, with no nuclear weapons or cable television or
public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   But the capital was still rife with confident speculation. Some
guessed, or hoped, that the results of the recent poll, which
showed increases in support for resignation as a way to spare the
nation a trial in which Ms. Lewinsky and Linda Tripp would be star
witnesses, would weaken Clinton's resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Others thought the Republicans, seeing dismal numbers in polls
about their party's standing in the United States, would be the
first to blink. With a majority in the Senate, they have the power
to end a trial at any time after the Senate receives notice of
impeachment on the day it convenes, Jan. 6, or the next day.
</P>
<P>
   But while Clinton has focused on the polls, and the CBS News
survey showed that 64 percent still approve of his handling of his
job as president, resignation could almost immediately subject him
to criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   And Republicans have steadfastly ignored the polls all year, and
confronted them directly on Saturday. Representative J.C. Watts of
Oklahoma, newly elected as chairman of the Republican caucus, said:
``What's popular isn't always right. You say polls are against
this. Polls measure changing feelings, not steadfast principle.
Polls would have rejected the Ten Commandments. Polls would have
embraced slavery and ridiculed women's rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``You say we must draw this to a close. I say we must draw a
line between right and wrong, not with a tiny fine line of an
executive fountain pen, but with the big fat lead of a No. 2
pencil. And we must do it so every kid in America can see it. The
point is not whether the president can prevail, but whether truth
can prevail.''

</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, when the Judiciary Committee recommended the four
articles of impeachment, Clinton's side still hoped to prevail with
the help of 20 to 30 Republican moderates who were uncommitted. As
the week wore on, almost all of them broke against the president.
</P>
<P>
   One who did not, Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut, said
Saturday: ``After Judge Starr's report to Congress in September,
and his presentation to the Judiciary Committee in November, I
concluded that impeachable offenses were not proven, and that the
proven offenses were not impeachable.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the president's continued failure to come to grips with
his actions, the sincerity and arguments of members of the
Judiciary Committee from both sides of the aisle, the change of
heart and conviction by members on my side of the aisle who
originally opposed impeachment and who now support it, and the
strong and powerful opinion of so many of my constituents who
oppose my position and who wanted the president impeached caused me
to rethink my position.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Yesterday morning, before I visited with the
president, I concluded that my original position was the correct
one, for me. I believe that the impeachable offenses have not been
proven, and that the proven offenses are not impeachable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, who has led the Republican effort
to force Clinton from office, dismissed his and other arguments as
moral relativism.
</P>
<P>
   He began by praising Livingston: ``There is no greater American
in my mind, at least today, than Bob Livingston, because he
understood what this debate was all about. It was about honor and
decency and integrity and the truth; everything that we honor in
this country. It was also a debate about relativism vs. absolute
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``The president's defenders have said that the
president is morally reprehensible, that he is reckless, that he
has violated the trust of the American people, lessened their
esteem for the office of president and dishonored the office which
they have entrusted him, and that _ but that doesn't rise to the
level of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jose Serrano of New York said, ``My constituents don't hate
Bill Clinton; they love him and they're praying for him right at
this very moment. You may have the votes today to impeach him, but
you don't have the American people. And let me tell you something,
I grew up in the public housing projects of the South Bronx. I can
see a bunch of bullies when I see them. The bullies get theirs, and
you're going to get yours, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the Judiciary Committee chairman
who brought the charges to the House floor, said the Congress and
the American people needed to distinguish between private acts of
infidelity and public acts by public officials. In Clinton's case,
he said, the House was dealing with ``a serial violator of the oath
who is the chief law-enforcement officer.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the Senate could be ``innovative and creative'' in
deciding how best to punish Clinton, but that the House was bound
by the Constitution to move ahead with articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice is so important to the most humble among us,'' Hyde
said. ``Equal justice under the law _ that's what we're fighting
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, reading from the same Constitution, voiced
diametrically opposite conclusions, and attacked the fairness of
the proceedings that culminated Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're losing track of distinction between sins and crimes,''
said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. ``We're lowering the standards of
impeachment. What the president has done is not a great and
dangerous offense to the republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also criticized Republicans for impeaching Clinton at
the very moment that U.S. troops waged war against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six days before Christmas our troops are in battle, and a
lame-duck Congress is rushing to overthrow the commander in
chief,'' said Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the second-ranking
House Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The ghosts of Watergate hung over the House chamber.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican cited the parallels between the charges the House
Judiciary Committee brought against Nixon 25 years ago, and the
counts that the same committee brought to the House floor for
affirmation on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nixon cheated. He cheated the electoral system,'' said Rep.
Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Graham said, the House is voting to impeach Clinton
``because we believe he committed crimes that result in cheating
our judicial system.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats assailed the very premise on which the Republican
majority built its impeachment case against Clinton. Rep. John
Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary
Committee, assailed the four articles of impeachment, count by
count, as unfounded by evidence and failing to rise to impeachment.
He saved his most savage scorn for the final count, abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority has simply tried to dress up the perjury counts
in the Watergate abuse-of-power language,'' Conyers said.

 &HT;    LOSING THE AIR(WAR), SADDAM EXPLOITS THE AIRWAVES
 &HT;    EDs: Optional add begins at 450 words.
 &HT;    With US-IRAQ-1220.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE 
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Saddam Hussein cannot stop the air strikes, but
some defense experts say he is scoring hits on the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   With shrewd use of the news media, these experts said the Iraqi
president has tightly controlled the world's view of the nightly
pounding by American and British missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In a calculated bid for world sympathy following the first night
of bombing, his officials led foreign journalists to a bomb crater
in a residential street to counter the U.S. declaration that it
sought only to disable Iraq's weapon-making capabilities. Foreign
camera crews and reporters, who are not permitted to move without
government ``minders,'' have been taken to photograph and interview
wounded civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Saddam, who has remained in hiding, appeared on a
television broadcast to fire verbal assaults at the ``agents of
Satan,'' as he called the U.S. and British forces. In an appeal to
the Muslim world, he vowed Friday: ``We will fear nothing but God,
and we will not kneel except to the face of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Through such public relations offensives, the Iraqi leader has
placed blame for the suffering of the Iraqi people on the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an information war going on, there's no doubt about
it,'' said William J. Taylor Jr., international affairs specialist
at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in
Washington. ``And Saddam and his Revolutionary Command Council know
how to play this game very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theme is, this is a horrible thing that's being done to
their people.''
</P>
<P>
   That message has touched a responsive chord on the streets of
cities in Arab countries, and even Palestinian-controlled Gaza,
where demonstrators have charged that President Clinton -- who only
Monday was cheered by Arabs for his trip to Gaza -- ordered the
strikes to divert the impeachment effort in the sex-and-cover-up
scandal involving former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In the Egyptian capital of Cairo, protestors have carried signs
saying ``For Monica's sake, Iraqi children are dying'' and crowds
have chanted, ``Leaders of the country, let us go to holy war!''
the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Americans have also attempted to use the weapons
of public persuasion to help its cause. U.S. forces dumped leaflets
over southern Iraq to tell Saddam's troops that, if they stay put
and cause no trouble, they will not become the target of U.S.
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. officials have sought international backing for the
military action with some success. More than a dozen nations,
chiefly European, have issued statements of strong support.
However, Russia and China have both issued equally strong protests,
as have several Islamic nations.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional ad follows.)
</P>
<P>
   One problem for the United States is that its objective is not
clear yet, said John Bolton, who served as undersecretary of state
during the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam's goals have been simpler, easier to define, and he's
been at them for a very long period of time,'' Bolton said. ``He
wants out from under the (United Nations) weapons inspections
regime and he wants out from under the (international) sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's stated goal, to ``degrade''
Saddam's weapons-making capacity, is too ambiguous and hardly a
rallying cry, Bolton said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael O'Hanlon, a foreign policy specialist at the Brookings
Institution, echoed the concern that the lack of specific goals
could make problems for explaining the U.S. mission in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they've made a convincing case,'' he said of the
Clinton administration. ``So far, people are rallying around the
flag , but I think that over time people will see that this strike
didn't have tangible effect except to get the (U.N. weapons)
inspectors out (of Iraq) for good.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., delivered sobering news to
Rep. Robert Livingston on Saturday morning: A small but influential
cluster of House conservatives was so furious at Livingston for not
disclosing his adulterous affairs earlier that it was considering
voting against him for speaker in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were quite a few members who felt this was a huge
dilemma,'' Wamp said he had told Livingston, putting the number at
about a dozen.
</P>
<P>
   It did not matter because Livingston had made up his mind.
Moments after his conversation with Wamp, he stepped up to the
microphone on the House floor and stunned the chamber _ and the
political world _ by declaring that he would not stand for speaker
and would retire from the House in six months.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's decision appeared to be driven by more than threats
to his political survival after he disclosed on Thursday that he
had been unfaithful. His friends and colleagues said he had been
huddled with his wife, Bonnie, who was described as devastated by
the turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``His wife is suffering terribly,'' said Rep. Billy Tauzin,
R-La., one of Livingston's closest friends. He said that in a
conversation he had with Livingston on the House floor on Friday,
``he talked about how much pain she was in. He didn't tell anyone
about his decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin said he had not tried to talk him out of the decision
after it was made. ``No one should. It's personal. It wouldn't have
done any good. Bob did not take a poll. He did not solicit
advice.'' He added: ``This is not just him. This is Bonnie.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the personal factors, Livingston sought to turn his
decision to the political advantage of Republicans by calling on
President Clinton to resign for his own personal indiscretions.
That move added credibility to the Republican cries for Clinton to
resign because it immediately silenced Democrats who had sought to
cast Republicans as motivated by unabashed partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts enormous additional pressure on Clinton because it
raises the bar and the standards for doing what's best for the
country ahead of what's best for you or your party,'' said Ralph
Reed, a Republican strategist. But he said he did not expect
Clinton to ever resign, saying, ``I don't think the words
resignation or quit are in Clinton's vocabulary.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed and many other strategists and friends of Livingston said
they thought he was motivated by a variety of personal
considerations _ not the least of which was his concern about
trying to lead a House that is wracked by partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a series of earthquakes and tornadoes which make
Watergate look like a mild spring shower,'' said Kenneth
Duberstein, a White House chief of staff under President Ronald
Reagan. ``I think this is Bob Livingston realizing that enough is
enough and feeling like it was his duty to step aside. I take him
at his word.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago Livingston announced plans to retire, but then
changed his mind. William W. Pascoe III, political director of the
American Conservative Union, said that considering he was once
chairman of the Appropriations Committee, ``there's no limit to how
much money he could make'' as a lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``We're being silly if we say that the thought
never occurred to him on his own that he was setting an example
that might build public support for Clinton to end this long
national nightmare and resign.''
</P>
<P>
   But Livingston's decision also thrust the Republican Party
deeper into turmoil only weeks after a discouraging election that
cost the party seats in the House and forced Speaker Newt Gingrich
to step aside for Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly has to erode confidence in the Republicans'
ability to govern,'' said Charles Cook Jr., editor of a nonpartisan
political report. ``But at the same time none of this makes the
Democrats look any better. The headaches that this creates are just
endless.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's announcement not only set off a fresh leadership
struggle, but many leading Republicans said they now feared that
David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader, would follow through on
his plans to run for Livingston's House seat should he retire.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., said he was worried that the House
would not be ready to pick a speaker when it reconvened on Jan. 6.
He said he believed that Livingston should take over as speaker
until he left office in six months _ a sentiment echoed by many
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Livingston asked some of his supporters _ Reps.
Callahan, Ron Packard of California, C.W. Young of Florida, Jerry
Lewis of California and Donald Manzullo of Illinois _ to find out
what members thought about his infidelities. They said he was
concerned that he might have lost the backing of some of his
supporters, who were furious that Livingston had not leveled with
them in his campaign for the leadership post.
</P>
<P>
   But almost overwhelmingly, members continued to back him, saying
they were disappointed but still had faith in him.
</P>
<P>
   That did not stop a vocal minority of conservatives openly
speculating as early as Friday night that he might resign. ``On our
side there were some members who felt they deserved to know this
before the conference race in November,'' Wamp said. ``It probably
would have changed the outcome. Bob should have told us.''
</P>
<P>
   The tension between Livingston and House conservatives is
reminiscent of the threats Gingrich faced from the right wing of
his caucus, which had grown increasingly disenchanted with his
leadership _ and was instrumental in his decision to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Livingston's relationship with conservatives in the caucus was
always going to be difficult because he is not one of them,'' Cook
said. ``It was always going to put him in a position of weakness in
dealing with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after Livingston's speech Saturday morning, a number
of Republicans and Democrats surrounded him and asked him to
reconsider, some publicly, some in private conversations. A few
members were crying in the foyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a feeling of almost complete disbelief,'' said Rep.
Peter King, R-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Stone, a lobbyist here who is one of Livingston's closest
friends from Louisiana, recalled Saturday how excited the
congressman was about becoming speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was, `Can you believe this? Can you believe that I'm
actually doing it?' '' Stone said. ``One of our own friends had
actually made it. Now, we're just devastated.''

   WASHINGTON _ By the time the voting was over Saturday in the
House, the vast majority of the moderate Republicans from the
Northeast had locked arms with their more conservative brethren
from the South and West to support the impeachment of President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But in their oratory, the moderates struggled to distance
themselves from the unyielding, often angry speeches of Clinton's
most bitter adversaries. The moderates expressed sadness, dismay,
confusion and angst. Several praised the president's policies. A
few said they liked him as a person. And most emphasized that they
were not motivated by hate _ the emotion that Democrats asserted
had driven the impeachment process inexorably to its conclusion
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bear no animosity toward the president,'' said Rep. Marge
Roukema, R-N.J. ``I do not wish him ill. Clearly, any sins that may
have been committed are between him and the Lord. And any
infidelities must remain between him and his family. But we cannot
deny the damage that has been done to his office and to our
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Franks, another New Jersey Republican, said Friday:
``It's with a profound sense of sadness that I stand here this
evening. We're called upon to decide what is right for the country
and what is required to serve the interests of justice. In making
this decision, I recognize that the purpose of impeachment is not
to punish a political leader, but to preserve the integrity of our
institutions of government.''
</P>
<P>
   In a region where Clinton's policies are popular and the
president himself continues to receive high ratings in opinion
polls, the anguish of these representatives is hardly surprising.
Many of the Republicans from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut _
all states that Clinton won handily in 1996 _ have said that they
expect to infuriate many of their constituents by voting for
impeachment. And so, in their floor speeches, some of the region's
members of Congress leavened their criticisms of Clinton's behavior
with praise for his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is much that is likable about President Clinton, and I
was proud to work with him on the environment, education, health
care and other issues I deeply care about,'' said Rep. Michael
Forbes, R-N.Y. ``This issue comes down to one basic principle: The
president of the United States is not above the law.''
</P>
<P>
   It was left to the region's Democrats, who for much of the last
six years have been Clinton's strongest defenders, to raise their
voices in anger, accusing Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel,
as well as House Republican leaders and the national Republican
Party itself, of peddling hate, destroying civility in Congress and
railroading a popularly elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has this president done to cause so much hatred, so much
animosity?'' asked Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. ``You have brought
hatred to this floor! You can see it in the eyes. You can see it in
the language. And people will walk lockstep and vote as Republicans
and not as members of the United States Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., said: ``Somewhere along the way,
some in this House forgot that Bill Clinton is our president, not
your personal enemy. The Constitution is not a license to destroy a
president because you don't like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats likened impeachment to a peaceful coup d'etat,
salting their defenses of Clinton with warnings of political
recriminations against Republicans from a scandal-weary electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Spanish phrase for a coup, ``golpe de estado,'' Rep.
Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., said: ``I grew up in the public housing
projects of the South Bronx. I can see a bunch of bullies when I
see them. The bullies get theirs, and you're going to get yours,
too. The people are going to rise up, from California to New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   Most pro-impeachment Republicans from the region said they
believed that Clinton had probably committee perjury by lying under
oath about his affair with Monica Lewinsky, and they argued that
such high-profile mendacity would be damaging to the nation's moral
fiber and judicial traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., recalled asking people to tell the
truth in court when he was a prosecutor. Most did, he said. ``If an
anonymous citizen can abide by his oath, what about a president?''
he asked. ``When a president fails in his duty as an ordinary
citizen does not, the failure is catastrophic.''
</P>
<P>
   Several members from the region sounded calls for
bipartisanship. Saying he felt that the president had not committed
impeachable offenses but had come very close, Rep. Christopher
Shays, R-Conn., said he could understand the sentiments of people
on both sides of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray that the Republicans and Democrats in this Congress
will find common ground and do the work of the people of this great
and prosperous land during the next two years,'' Shays said.
</P>
<P>
   Two New Yorkers, one a Democrat and one a Republican, even
chastised their own parties for an overzealous partisanship that
had criminalized politics and hounded worthy people from government
over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a nation consumed by investigations, by special
counsel,'' said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., one of only five
Republicans to vote against the first article of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing his fellow Republicans, King added, ``We saw the
abuses of special counsels by Lawrence Walsh and others as they
went against members of the Reagan and Bush administrations. We saw
good people, like Elliott Abrams, brought down on the flimsiest of
charges involving lying. And all of us know it was wrong, and we
rallied against it. But Saturday, somehow we're willing to apply a
different standard, a different principle. And that's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who will join the Senate in
January, said both parties had pursued investigations to a
destructive end. ``We are now at a point,'' he said, ``where we
risk, deeply risk, wounding the nation we all love.''

   WASHINGTON _ Two of the three previous speakers of the House
were hounded by scandal before Robert Livingston's withdrawal
Saturday after admitting to marital indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Wright of Texas, a Democrat who was speaker from Jan.
6, 1987, to June 6, 1989, was forced out by accusations that he had
skirted restrictions on outside income, some of it from book
royalties. His pursuer was Rep. Newt Gingrich, a Georgia
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Wright was succeeded as speaker by Rep. Tom Foley, a Democrat
from Washington state, who lost his seat in the Republican
avalanche of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich succeeded Foley and survived House charges over the use
of tax-exempt money for partisan purposes. But having weathered his
own scandal, Gingrich was felled after the Republicans' poor
showing in November's elections, in which the party tried to
capitalize on the Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston was out before he was in, having been
speaker-designate for exactly one month.

IDENTIFICATION OF SWISSAIR VICTIMS IS COMPLETE, OFFICIALS SAY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Conn.)   (jw) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Canadian authorities have finished identifying the
remains of the passengers and crew on Swissair Flight 111, the
MD-11 that crashed off the coast of Nova Scotia, and the airline
will begin returning them to families soon, the Nova Scotia medical
examiner said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 111 crashed Sept. 2 after leaving Kennedy International
Airport for Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   With help from the Canadian armed forces and the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police, and with heavy reliance on DNA testing, the medical
examiner identified all of the 229 people on board except a pair of
identical twins, 19-year-old men from Switzerland, whose DNA was
indistinguishable.
</P>
<P>
   People involved in the investigation said 1,300 DNA tests were
conducted, the most in connection with a single event. Some remains
were identified by dental records or other means.
</P>
<P>
   Some remains cannot be identified as those of a specific person
and will be buried ``at an appropriate site in Nova Scotia,'' said
the provincial Medical Examiner, Dr. John Butt.
</P>
<P>
   Families of all the victims were notified that 17 ``small pieces
of dental remains'' were accidentally incinerated at a laboratory
in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where they had been sent for
identification. In his letter of notification to the families
earlier this week, Butt called it ``a most unfortunate
occurrence.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are still searching the Atlantic Ocean bottom for
plane parts and human remains, but if any remains are recovered
now, after three months in the water, the soft tissue that can be
typed by DNA is no longer usable for testing, Butt said in a
telephone interview on Friday. Remains of each person aboard the
plane are available and will be returned, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Miles Gerety of Stamford, Conn., the brother of a passenger and
now the acting chairman of an organization of families of Flight
111 victims, said families could choose to bury the remains in
Halifax, scatter ashes at sea or have the remains sent home.
</P>
<P>
   Gerety said some families would probably delay burial until the
authorities turn over personal effects, especially wedding bands. A
spokesman for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Sgt. Bill Price,
said that no passengers' belongings had been turned over to
relatives yet because his agency was still gathering evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators continue to search the sea bottom, turning up
small parts of the plane and human remains, according to Jim
Harris, a spokesman for the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said the flight data recorder, a computer recording
device that tracks hundreds of aspects of flight, was working
normally when the pilots first radioed a distress call. It stopped
recording six minutes before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The first sign of trouble was the autopilot disconnecting
itself. The autopilot is supposed to disconnect if it cannot keep
the plane flying the way the pilots have ordered and turn control
back to them, but so far investigators do not know what prompted
the disconnection.  &QL;

IT'S 1969 AGAIN FOR DIVISION CHAMPION JETS

<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ With an improbable cast assembled, then
cajoled into becoming a team by the demanding Bill Parcells, the
Jets captured their first division title in almost 30 years on
Saturday with a difficult 17-10 victory over the Buffalo Bills.
</P>
<P>
   The last time they could call themselves a division champion,
the Jets were still playing in the American Football League. It was
1969, the time of Woodstock and Joe Namath, and Muhammad Ali was in
exile.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Jets can also clinch an important first-round playoff
bye if the Jacksonville Jaguars lose Sunday night at Minnesota or
if the Jets win their regular-season finale next Sunday at Giants
Stadium against the New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets improved their record to 11-4, equaling the franchise
record for victories in a season, and Vinny Testaverde, who threw
for two touchdowns, brought his record as their starting
quarterback to 11-1.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde completed 14 of 23 passes for 184 yards and was not
intercepted. He won the duel with the Bills' resurrected veteran,
Doug Flutie, who finished 14 of 38 for 220 yards with 1 touchdown
and 1 interception.
</P>
<P>
   With 2 minutes 15 seconds left in the third quarter, the Jets
broke a 10-10 tie as Testaverde connected on his 25th touchdown
pass of the season, one under the club record. He hit a wide-open
Dedric Ward, the Jets' speediest receiver, who had eluded
inexperienced cornerback Donovan Greer.
</P>
<P>
   Ward turned it into a 71-yard touchdown, scampering the final 50
yards with Greer at his heels.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1960, when the team was still the Titans, Al Dorow
tossed 26 touchdowns. Joe Namath tied that mark in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie got the Bills back down to the Jets' 22-yard line with
under four minutes remaining in the game, but his pass for Kevin
Williams was bobbled and deflected to Victor Green, who dived for
the interception. Replays appeared inconclusive as to whether Green
actually had possession when he hit the ground, but the Jets were
awarded the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The disappointments had rolled by year after year for the Jets.
Many of these Jet players were not even alive in 1969, when they
captured their last division title. And how many knew that that was
in the old American Football League?
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the leagues merged. And the Jets had been the only
club from that original, post-merger group of 26 teams that had
never won a divisional title.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde, a player who had been cut by Baltimore at the age of
35 and waited around much of last summer before being signed, has
led the Jets this far _ as improbable a hero as some of the rest of
the cast Parcells and his staff had assembled.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that Saturday alone, Dave Meggett was in on a big run
on the opening score; Bryan Cox helped position it by stripping the
ball; and Pepper Johnson recovered it.
</P>
<P>
   Meggett had been out of work since being cut by the Patriots in
May, when a court appearance clouded his future; Cox had been
working at home after being released by Chicago; and Johnson was
returning from knee surgery. But Parcells loved them all.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie came into the game with a 5-0 record at home, in a season
that the 36-year-old veteran of the Canadian Football League has
called ``my second rookie year.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of the opening half, which ended in a 7-7 tie, he
cavorted like a rookie, as he was being hurried repeatedly by the
Jets' pass rush. But he tossed several completions just as
onrushing defenders leveled him.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have a remarkably small player of their own in wide
receiver Wayne Chrebet, and he helped lift them to a 7-0 lead in
the opening quarter.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Bills coughed up the ball, a rarity. Buffalo entered
the game having fumbled only five times all season, which tied the
Bills for the second-best mark in the league. Overall, they had
turned the ball over fewer times than all but five clubs.
</P>
<P>
   But Antowain Smith, carrying the ball at the Jets' 20-yard line
on what was shaping up to be a Bills scoring drive, was met by Cox.
This was Cox's first regular-season appearance here since his
famous incident in 1995, when he had a fight and then spit at the
fans. Cox, apparently unfazed Saturday, stripped the ball from
Smith and Johnson recovered it for the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde then helped march the Jets 79 yards to a score. On
the first play of the drive, Keyshawn Johnson joined Chrebet in the
1,000-yard receiving club as he snared a 16-yarder. It marked the
first time since 1986, and the tandem of Al Toon and Wesley Walker,
that two Jets had achieved the milestone.
</P>
<P>
   Then Dave Meggett, playing for the third time under Parcells,
appeared for the first time in a Jets uniform and produced some
minor heroics. On a second-and-11, Meggett dashed for 18 yards,
almost breaking all the way for a score. Chrebet made a diving
catch for 22 yards and finally snared a 7-yarder in the end zone
from Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie was to throw 26 times in the half, completing only 12,
but he made several big plays on third down. One pass to Williams
was good for 22 yards and moved the Bills beyond midfield in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Flutie, who also ran twice in the first half,
scrambled down to the 30. After getting to the 25, Flutie was under
intense pressure from Cox, who hit him just as he released a screen
pass to Thurman Thomas. Thomas caught the ball 5 yards downfield
and ran the rest of the way to the end zone to complete a 25-yard
pass play that helped tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills got close enough for a chip-shot field goal in the
closing seconds of the opening half, but Steve Christie's 28-yard
attempt was wide to the left.
</P>
<P>
   John Hall, though, successfully booted a 48-yarder, through the
same uprights, to close out the Jets' opening drive of the third
quarter. It gave them a 10-7 lead, and marked the 13th successful
field goal, in 16 tries, since John Kidd became the punter and new
holder for Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the period, Christie, kicking into the wind, generated
a 44-yard field goal.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE PARCELLS 10, DIFFERENT BUT THE SAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Updates with Jets beating Bills, winning division.) (jt) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ On the Jets, there is the team within the
team. Call them the Parcells 10, those who had worked for Bill
Parcells with the New England Patriots or with the Giants or, in
the case of the latest member, David Meggett, who worked for the
coach with both the Patriots and the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10, no two are the same.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Meggett, are considered club pros _ Jumbo Elliott,
Pepper Johnson, Keith Byars, Otis Smith, Jerome Henderson. Two are
mostly on special teams, Corwin Brown and Mike Gisler. One is a
third-string quarterback, Ray Lucas. And one, Curtis Martin, is a
$36 million running back.
</P>
<P>
   Their positions and responsibilities vary. So do their salaries.
But to Parcells, the 10 have a common denominator. ``They like
football, they're willing to work, and winning means something to
them,'' he said. ``It's not about money.''
</P>
<P>
   It's mostly about understanding and appreciating what makes
Parcells such a successful coach. Meggett knows all about that.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Jets beat the Bills 17-10 here on Saturday, clinching
first place in the American Conference East, Meggett explained why
he enjoyed working for Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``The knowledge the coach brings to the game,'' Meggett said.
``The businesslike atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   As the most recent member of what is now the Parcells 10,
Meggett also enjoyed seeing familiar faces in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a feeling of home,'' he said. ``So many guys I played
with. That's a good feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   And those Meggett played with on the Patriots and earlier on the
Giants remember what Meggett did.
</P>
<P>
   Byars, now a Jets fullback, cited the Patriots' 23-22 victory
over the Giants in the 1996 season finale, when Meggett's touchdown
on a 60-yard punt return pulled the Patriots to within 22-17 in the
fourth quarter. That victory clinched first place and a playoff bye
for the Patriots on their way to Super Bowl XXXI.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how much they pay you,'' Byars said, ``it's not
going to make you make a play, make a catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, the offensive tackle, remembered several Meggett
moments when they were on the Giants together.
</P>
<P>
   ``David made big plays,'' Elliott said. ``Whether it was a
return or a run or a catch or throwing a pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Meggett twice threw option passes for Giant touchdowns against
the Redskins in 1993. As a Giant rookie in 1989, he took a short
pass from Phil Simms and scooted 57 yards in a swirling snowstorm
for the winning touchdown in a 14-7 victory in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   When Meggett was a free agent after the 1994 season, Parcells,
then in New England, quickly signed him to a five-year, $10 million
contract that included a $3 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Over his career, Meggett, now 32, who last Tuesday signed a
two-game contract for $60,000, has scored 27 touchdowns _ 11 on
pass receptions, 8 as a rusher, 7 on punt returns and 1 on a
kickoff return. He is the National Football League's career leader
in punt returns, 344, and punt-return yardage, 3,668.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, when Parcells was coaching the Giants, he had
resisted using a 1989 fifth-round draft choice on Meggett, who had
been the Division I-AA player of the year at Towson State. Although
a sturdy 180 pounds, Meggett was only 5 feet 7 inches, and Parcells
already had a 5-7 running back, Joe Morris.
</P>
<P>
   ``How else can I use him?'' Parcells asked the Giants' scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Use him, the scouts suggested, on a pitchout or a reverse.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you guys think this is, the Blue-Gray game?'' Parcells
snapped, but then he said, ``All right, let's take him, but I'm
telling you right now, if he can't return kickoffs and punts, I'm
going to cut him.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells not only didn't cut Meggett, he also brought Meggett to
the Patriots. And now Meggett is one of the Parcells 10 on the
Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all played for Bill,'' Elliott said. ``Football was
different when most of us started. You had to earn your way more.''
</P>
<P>
   Signing Meggett paid off quickly for Parcells on Saturday. On
the Jets' first drive, Meggett picked up 22 yards on a draw play to
help set up Vinny Testaverde's 7-yard touchdown pass to Wayne
Chrebet.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, who joined the Giants in 1988, played three seasons for
Parcells; in the 20-19 victory in Super Bowl XXV, he blocked Bruce
Smith, the Bills' feared pass-rusher. Elliott joined the Jets as a
free agent in 1996; the next year Parcells was happy to inherit
him.
</P>
<P>
   But when Elliott was told about Parcells' reference to ``It's
not about money'' for the Parcells 10, he smiled. ``Winning means a
lot to us,'' the 308-pound, 6-foot-7-inch offensive tackle said,
``but we wouldn't do it for free.''

PIRATES OVERCOME ESCHMEYER DOWN THE STRETCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By STEVE POPPER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ For Seton Hall, it came down to playing
with what you have. While Northwestern came into Continental Arena
on Saturday with Evan Eschmeyer, one of the most experienced and
solid big men in the nation, Seton Hall has a talented and tough
backcourt that includes Rimas Kaukenas, the fourth-ranked 3-point
shooter in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   When the Wildcats, behind Eschmeyer's inside play, threatened to
upset the Pirates, it was Kaukenas who banked in a tough jumper and
then buried a pair of 3-point field goals to give Seton Hall back
its composure and the lead. On the other end, it took a team
effort, but the Pirates held Eschmeyer in check just enough to
escape with their fifth consecutive victory, 63-52.
</P>
<P>
   Eschmeyer led all scorers with 22 points. But after converting a
3-point play with 11 minutes 29 seconds left in the game to give
Northwestern a 44-42 lead, he scored only one more point, hitting
one of two free throws with 1:20 remaining and the game out of
reach. Gary Saunders led Seton Hall with 17 points and when the
game was on the line, Kaukenas, who finished with 15 points, awoke.
</P>
<P>
   After Shaheen Holloway hit one of two free throws, Kaukenas, who
entered the game hitting 65.2 percent from beyond the arc, drilled
his first 3-pointer of the game to put Seton Hall in front by
46-44. Eschmeyer then allowed an entry pass to slip out of bounds
off his hands. Kaukenas hit another from 3-point range to stretch
the lead to 49-44.
</P>
<P>
   With Duane Jordan providing a feisty defensive effort against
Eschmeyer, as well as contributing 12 points, the Pirates were able
to pull away, stretching the lead to as many as 13 in the closing
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates entered the game with a four-game winning streak,
the school's longest in four years, and a 6-3 record, which
included a victory at Syracuse in their last game. For
Northwestern, the loss snapped a five-game winning streak and
lowered its record to 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly as many NBA scouts in the stands as fans to see
Eschmeyer, the Pirates were left with the difficult task of trying
to control him with a short and shortened roster.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, the Pirates announced that freshman center
Damian Dawkins would be lost for the remainder of the season,
leaving the 6-foot-10-inch Charles Manga as the only center on the
roster and the only player taller than 6-7.
</P>
<P>
   Eschmeyer, a sixth-year senior, entered scoring 20.8 points a
game. He had helped the Wildcats defeat the Pirates in each of the
last two seasons, scoring 19 points and grabbing 18 rebounds last
season and posting 18 points and 11 rebounds in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Manga did what he could and received help from the 6-6 Jordan,
who had done a solid job on Syracuse's Etan Thomas when Manga got
in foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Manga worked feverishly, trying to muscle the 6-11, 255-pound
Eschmeyer out of the post and deny him the ball. When that failed
and Eschmeyer got the ball down low, the Pirates collapsed
defenders around him, tempting the Wildcats to try to beat them
from outside. In the first half, Eschmeyer had 12 points on 5-of-7
shooting, but turned the ball over three times.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until Northwestern, which starts three freshmen and a
sophomore alongside Eschmeyer, got some help for him from the
outside that it was able to get into the game. The Pirates opened a
22-12 lead midway through the first half, but Northwestern inched
back and took a 30-28 lead when Eschmeyer was double-teamed in the
lane and found Joe Harmsen alone inside. The Wildcats took a 33-30
lead into the half.
</P>
<P>
   Dawkins had averaged 3.2 points, 3.8 rebounds and 12.8 minutes
of playing time over the first five games of the season. It was
determined that the dizziness and migraine headaches he had been
suffering may be related to a heart problem. Dawkins fainted in
practice on Dec. 4 and has not been able to play since then.
</P>
<P>
   Dawkins returned home to Brampton, Ontario, to spend the
holidays with his family and will return to school for the winter
session.

SPRINKLERS IMPROPERLY SHUT OFF IN BUILDING WHERE THREE DIED 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   and BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Crucial valves in the sprinkler system at a Brooklyn
apartment building for the elderly where a fire killed three
firefighters Friday may have been closed for years, perhaps even
since the building was built in 1983, and the sprinklers in a twin
building were also improperly shut down, city officials said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani ordered an immediate check of the
sprinkler systems at about a dozen other Housing Authority
buildings, and started an investigation into whether requirements
for inspections and other fire-prevention procedures should be
strengthened. Giuliani said all new apartment buildings should be
required to have sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with top officials in the fire, police and housing
departments, the mayor said, ``They have been working all through
the night to try to find the answer to make sure that this problem
doesn't exist in any other building that has a similar kind of
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the main valve connected to the water source was open,
five valves on the first floor intended to feed water to the
residential areas were concealed behind a trapdoor that had been
painted over, according to Giuliani and Fire Commissioner Thomas
Von Essen. It was unclear how the sprinkler system had passed a
1996 fire department inspection, or whether required monthly checks
by the Housing Authority had been conducted properly.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the head of the most remote sprinkler in a system
would be removed to check whether water was reaching it; it appears
that in this building only the main valve was checked.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a series of inspections that indicate that the
sprinkler system was working,'' Giuliani said. ``However, there's
this question: `Did anybody inspect the valves'' that feed the
sprinklers? ``We don't know the answer to that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials believe that the fire was caused by an elderly woman
smoking in bed. In addition to studying why the sprinkler system
was shut off, officials are trying to determine why a self-closing
steel fire door malfunctioned and remained ajar, allowing a
fireball to engulf the three firefighters in the 10th-floor
hallway.
</P>
<P>
   A fire department official who spoke on the condition of
anonymity said that the hallway temperature had reached 2,000
degrees and that the firefighters' protective suits can withstand
heat only up to 700 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Colon, a spokeswoman for the Housing Authority, said the
intense heat made the fire door malfunction, and that doors on
neighboring apartments were working fine after the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``No clue,'' Ms. Colon said when asked why the sprinklers were
off and the fire door open. ``This is the mystery that we are
trying to find: Why was the main one open and every other one was
closed? We are investigating every possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Colon said that despite searching all night Friday,
officials had been unable to find recent inspection records on the
sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
   Fire department officials spent all morning in meetings but
emerged with little information about what had gone wrong at the
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're planning funerals here,'' said Michael Regan, a deputy
fire commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Funerals for the victims, Lt. Joseph Cavalieri and firefighters
James Bohan and Christopher Bopp, are scheduled for Monday and
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Pinder, 67, the woman who lived in the apartment
where the fire started, was listed in critical condition Saturday
at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, along with her neighbor
Angel Morales, 69, who pulled Ms. Pinder into the safety of his
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Five firefighters who were injured fighting the blaze were in
good condition and were expected to be released from hospitals this
weekend, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At the 10-story apartment building, police, fire, and housing
department officials were cleaning up soot and soggy rugs, and
relatives of the elderly residents swarmed in to check on their
loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tragedy, but they're lucky that more people weren't
killed,'' said Andrew Malave, 40, whose mother lives on the eighth
floor. ``With all these elderly people, these sprinklers should not
be turned off.''
</P>
<P>
   Malave and other residents and their relatives wondered whether
the sprinklers were shut because of recent construction in the
building, including repairs to the elevators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing here ever works,'' said Gloria Bryant, 73, who has
lived in the building for three years. Ms. Bryant said there was a
fire a year ago and the fire alarms failed, but it was a small
blaze and was contained. ``Something is always wrong,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the building, firefighter Mike Fazio was helping assess
the damage, remembering Bopp, who was in his class at the training
academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is horrible, really crushing,'' said Fazio,
who last saw Bopp at a Christmas party last week. ``It's been hard
on everybody and everybody's families. Everybody is still in shock
from this.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As they plunge into the uncharted waters of the
impeachment trial of a modern president, senators are uncertain
about what lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Some think they are in for a long ordeal on the Senate floor
that could last until next summer or even longer.
</P>
<P>
   Others think that President Clinton and the Senate will quickly
cut a deal in January and short-circuit a trial before it gets
started in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Still others expect something in between _ a procedure short of
a full trial, that lasts for some weeks but may then be shelved.
</P>
<P>
   But all the senators and staff experts interviewed last week
agreed on an essential point: Unless unanticipated, damaging new
evidence against the president arises, the Senate will never muster
the two-thirds majority necessary to convict him and remove him
from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that there are not 67 votes against
him,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, one of the president's most
ardent Republican opponents but also a senator who usually has a
sure sense of where his colleagues stand.
</P>
<P>
   Another point to remember is that although it takes a two-thirds
majority to remove a president from office, a trial can be stopped
before it begins or at any time after it starts by a simple
majority vote of the senators. The Senate will have 55 Republicans
and 45 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that no one knows what may develop. There is no
reference book that spells out what an impeachment trial in 1999
would look like. There is no staff expert who has mastered all the
legal and political nuances.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the Senate has been out of session for two
months _ the senators scattered around the country _ so there has
not been the give and take necessary to reach a political
consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, the Republican leader, insists that he has made
no plans for how the Senate will proceed, and there is no evidence
to the contrary. Lott, who has stayed in Mississippi during the
House deliberations, said he did not want to appear presumptuous
while the matter was before the House.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott has said that he has no plans to call the Senate back
into session this year. And he leaves no doubt that he expects an
impeachment trial next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate will do its constitutional duty,'' he said last
week on CNN. ``We will go to a trial, and there won't be any
deal-making as we begin our job in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lott hinted that at some point after a trial began, the
Senate might decide to stop it. ``There are a number of votes on
procedures that may be demanded along the way, and we'll have to
work the will of the Senate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The best guess is that on Jan. 6, when the 106th Congress
convenes, the Senate will pass a resolution stating that it is
prepared to receive the articles of impeachment from the House
managers, as the small group of representatives selected to act as
official prosecutors of the case are called.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 7, if the schedule holds, the managers will walk across
the Capitol to the Senate and read the articles on the Senate
floor. That day or the next, Chief Justice William Rehnquist will
be sworn in to preside over the trial, as the Constitution
requires. (The Founding Fathers realized that it would be a
conflict of interest to have the vice president, who also serves as
president of the Senate, manage the impeachment trial of a
president.)
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist's oath will probably be administered by Sen. Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C., the president pro tem. The chief justice will
then swear in the 100 senators as jurors in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the Senate will vote to notify Clinton formally that the
proceedings have begun, and a schedule will be set. The president
will probably get a month or more to file a written response to the
impeachment charges, and the House will get time to prepare its
reply.
</P>
<P>
   During this hiatus the negotiations over a deal will begin.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is that the Senate might agree to stop the trial
in return for the president's acceptance of a stiff censure. A
trial could also end quickly if Clinton decides not to present a
defense at all _ like a defendant in a trial so confident of
victory that he rests his case without calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, is one who thinks that is the most
likely outcome. He explained: ``If I were the president, I would
want to get this thing over with as soon as you can. He knows there
are not 67 votes there. I don't know anybody who would argue
there's a chance to have 67 votes at this point. But who knows what
else might come up if he got into a trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm agreed with that assessment. ``Why would he want to have
an extended trial?'' Gramm asked. ``From his point of view, this is
all about damage control.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., said he thought that script was
unlikely. ``I think it goes nine innings, meaning we have a
long-drawn-out process,'' he said. Many other Democrats and some
Republicans agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the middle ground, Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, said he
expected the Senate to begin operating on two tracks, dealing with
legislation in the afternoon and with the trial either in the
morning or in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after ``a sufficiently legitimate period of time,''
Bennett said, the Senate could vote to end the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate can't just pass a motion right up front to stop the
trial,'' he said. ``That would be a terrible slap in the face of
the House institutionally. So we need to put some time in. If they
have gone through the seriousness of voting impeachment, we should
go through the seriousness of having a trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if after a while, we can say we have sifted through the
issues and have decided to suspend the trial, then there's
face-saving all around. The House can live with it. The president
can live with it. And we look like statesmen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the top Democrat on the Judiciary
Committee, has had his legal staff research impeachment issues and
has decided that the rules would require the new House that takes
office next month to vote to reappoint the managers who would
present the case to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy said it was possible that the new House, with a smaller
Republican majority than the current one, would vote against naming
managers. That would end the case, because there would be no
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Leahy said, ``we are in for a long, long, long
trial.''

</P>
<P>
   If there is a full-scale trial, it would bear no resemblance to
anything anyone alive has ever seen. It would be part legal and
part political, governed partly by arcane Senate rules that were
created for the trial of President Andrew Johnson in 1868 and
partly by rules of law.
</P>
<P>
   In all of American history, there have been only 13 such trials
and only seven convictions, all of federal judges. Johnson's trial
130 years ago was the only one of a president.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, the trial would be like one in a courtroom.
There would be opening statements, presentation of witnesses and
evidence by both sides, cross-examinations, rebuttals and closing
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Potential witnesses like Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp would
testify under oath, in public, presumably on television, no matter
how distasteful and embarrassing their testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The House would hire professional prosecutors and the president
would hire defense lawyers to question witnesses and argue their
cases. Because an impeachment trial will be part of the president's
official duties, his legal fees will be paid by the government.
</P>
<P>
   But other elements would be quite different from a courtroom
trial. The senators, sitting as jurors, would be the judges not
just of facts but also of law. By majority vote, they could
overrule decisions of Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   In most impeachment cases, the rules allow the Senate to choose
a 12-member committee to hear evidence, sparing most senators from
the tedium of a trial. But Senate history makes clear that the
authority is not to be delegated in the trial of a president.
</P>
<P>
   The senators, who in normal circumstances think nothing of
talking for hours on the most routine matters, would not be
permitted to speak in public session during the trial. To question
a witness, they could pass a note to the chief justice, who would
pose the question.
</P>
<P>
   All the senators' deliberations would be in closed session with
no personal staff members or reporters present. And their time for
speaking in those sessions would be strictly limited _ 10 minutes
maximum for each senator on preliminary motions and 15 minutes on
the final verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference from a courtroom trial would be that the
verdict would not be based primarily on facts or law. Some senators
would doubtless decide on the basis of politics, others on their
judgment of what would be best for the country.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said he was in
this last category. He had no doubt, he said, that lying to a grand
jury, the first charge against Clinton, was an impeachable offense
that could justify removal from office. But he said he might not
vote that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to what is in the best interest of the American
people,'' Hatch said. ``Should we really throw the president out of
office for this kind of prevarication? I don't know. It's not an
easy question to answer. It's one I'm struggling with.''

 &HT;    Jets clinch division title, spot in playoffs
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In keeping with his track record, New York Jets coach
Bill Parcells has accomplished what three decades worth of
predecessors could not.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' 17-10 victory over the Buffalo Bills on Saturday
earned the team its first division title since 1969 and first-ever
AFC East championship. New York was the only team in the league at
the time of the 1970 NFL-AFL merger which had never claimed a
division crown.
</P>
<P>
   The winning score came on Dedric Ward's 71-yard touchdown
reception.
</P>
<P>
   It marks the third time in Parcells' 14-season career as a head
coach that he has taken a franchise to the playoffs in just his
second year on the job. The other occasions were with the New York
Giants and New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to say alive in the chase for the NFC's final
wildcard spot, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers faced the Washington
Redskins in a late afternoon game on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the first home defeat for quarterback Doug Flutie in his
NFL and USFL career, the Bills still can secure a wildcard berth if
Tennessee loses at Green Bay today. With Saturday's results, three
of the six division championships have been decided and the other
three could be determined in today's action. The Atlanta Falcons,
Jacksonville Jaguars and Dallas Cowboys all can clinch division
crowns.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the 12 playoff berths already are reserved. Pending the
outcome of the Tampa Bay-Washington game, it is possible for all of
the postseason spots to be filled by the time this week's schedule
is completed.

 SOME BIG NAMES MARSHAL FORCES AGAINST TRUMP'S LATEST TOWER
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Donald Trump's plan to build what he calls the
tallest residential tower in the world across the street from the
United Nations is arousing the kind of opposition unknown since the
great real estate wars of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the area have complained that the slim bronze-glass
monolith will overwhelm the neighborhood and lord over its most
distinctive landmark _ the United Nations. But the hue and cry
raised by Seymour Flug, former chairman of Diners' Club, and Walter
Cronkite, former television news anchor, has spread from their
exclusive Beekman Place neighborhood near the United Nations to the
Upper West Side, Yorkville and the halls of the Municipal Art
Society.
</P>
<P>
   They have formed a coalition, hired lawyers, raised more than
$125,000 in a week and hired a public relations outfit to fight the
most media-conscious developer in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Trump has his permits and has begun demolition for the $360
million tower on First Avenue, between 47th and 48th streets, and
construction is expected to begin early next year. But a similar
alliance among neighborhood groups, civic organizations and
blue-bloods a decade ago brought another developer, Mortimer
Zuckerman, to his knees when his proposed 925-foot tower at
Columbus Circle threatened to cast long shadows across another
landmark, Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   The groups have been largely quiet since the last great real
estate boom in the 1980s, when there were protests in neighborhoods
from the Upper East Side to TriBeCa against the demolition of town
houses, tenements, shoe repair stores and dry cleaners to make way
for more tall towers.
</P>
<P>
   But every full-color advertisement and brochure for what Trump
said would be his most luxurious tower has served as a clarion call
for the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trump certainly has broadened his opposition with this
project,'' said Olive Freud, vice president of the Committee for
Environmentally Sound Development, a West Side neighborhood group
that continues the fight against another project at Columbus
Circle. ``Maybe a lot of people will understand what Trump's doing
to this city.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Flug, Cronkite and Ms. Freud are Genie Rice, president
of Civitas, an East Side planning group that won a five-year battle
to force a developer to lop 12 floors from his newly built 31-story
tower on East 96th Street because it failed to conform to local
zoning regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Madeleine Polayes, president of the Coalition for a Livable West
Side, which has tangled with Trump over his Trump Place project
between 59th and 72nd streets near the Hudson River, has also
joined the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Flug, who heads both the Beekman Hill Association and the newly
formed Coalition for Responsible Development, said: ``This is not
about a bunch of rich guys going after Donald Trump. This is a
grass-roots, community effort. It's about one of the most
irresponsible development projects we've ever seen. To drop this
into the middle of a residential area which has a great deal of
historical importance is about as offensive as anything anyone can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump is not as concerned with Ms. Polayes as he is with ``the
rich guys,'' many of whom he considers friends, he said. Flug's
comrades include William Donaldson, founder of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette Inc., an investment firm; Stanley Kaplan, chairman of the
test preparation company; David Koch, executive vice president of
Koch Industries, an oil and gas company, and Alberto Vilar, the
founder of Amerindo Investment Advisers, who recently donated $25
million to the Metropolitan Opera.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Trump project has grown in size with each telling of
the story. The developer himself and his glossy advertisements
describe it as a 90-story tower. Some opponents refer to it as a
looming 100-story behemoth. Truth be told, the building will have
only 72 floors. But at 861-feet, it will be the tallest residential
tower in the city, and possibly, the world. Trump World Tower would
soar 317 feet above the 39-story U.N. Secretariat and 11 feet above
the General Electric Building at Rockefeller Center to be the rough
equivalent in height of Citicorp Center on Lexington Avenue in
midtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``People actually like the building,'' Trump said. ``They just
don't like the height. But the height is what gives it majesty.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Philip Howard, chairman of the Municipal Art Society, said he
did admire the ``simple and clean'' design of the tower by the
architect Costas Kondylis.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the reality is,'' Howard added, ``you shouldn't have a
building of this size in that neighborhood. It's twice as big as it
should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Cronkite shares that view: ``This building overwhelms the
architectural features of the United Nations. The enormity of the
project is not in keeping with the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has also said the tower is too
tall and questioned its approval by the city, but Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani has defended the approval process.
</P>
<P>
   If the project cannot be stopped for legal or environmental
reasons, Howard, Ms. Rice and the local community board will press
for changes in zoning regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The developer is not without supporters. Buyers love the
project, Trump said, adding that he sold 58 of the building's 376
apartments in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Newman, an insurance broker who lives nearby at 870 U.N.
Plaza, said she favored the tower because each of Trump's previous
projects was accompanied by a greater sense of security,
cleanliness and city services. ``I'm a proponent of change,'' Ms.
Newman said. ``I think it's going to be an improvement for the
neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, community groups from across Manhattan met to draw
up a battle plan to oppose the building. That evening, dozens of
local residents debated the project, including Ms. Newman and
Arthur Caliandro, senior minister of Marble Collegiate Church,
which happens to be the Trump family church. Caliandro said that a
Trump executive had encouraged him to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Although Trump's building would block his living room view of
the East River, the minister said he expected the tower to be
spectacular and, like the developer's other projects, an
improvement for the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Vasell, a management consultant, noted that much of the
opposition was centered at 860 and 870 U.N. Plaza, two towers that
obstructed the views of Beekman Place residents when they were
built in the 1960s. Nevertheless, Vasell said, Trump's building was
``totally out of scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump and his associates say they worked within the city's
zoning regulations. Local residents could easily have foiled any
plans for a tall tower by buying the air rights in the early 1990s,
after others considered building on the site, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Abe Wallach of the Trump Organization said: ``You've got some
powerhouse people living over there. They could've maintained the
character of the area by buying up a sliver of air rights, which
would have negated any developer from building a tall tower.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump outbid a dozen other developers for the property nearly
two years ago, paying about $52 million. In an uncharacteristically
quiet manner, Trump then spent another $30 million buying up unused
development rights, or air rights, from nine of his neighbors on
the block, including the Japan Society and the Church of the Holy
Family. Those rights, along with a promise to build a public plaza,
enabled Trump to obtain construction permits to build an oversize
tower.
</P>
<P>
   Trump acknowledged that if he had bought the development rights
with his well-publicized style, his opponents ``probably would have
changed the zoning rules'' and prevented him from building.

OFFICERS WHO MISUSE GUNS WHILE DRUNK WILL BE FIRED 
</HEADLINE>

 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In response to recent incidents of off-duty police
officers firing their weapons after drinking alcohol, Police
Commissioner Howard Safir warned this week that he would fire any
officer who misused his gun while intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   The disciplinary directive, handed out on Friday, fell short of
a recommendation by the Mayor's Commission to Combat Police
Corruption that all officers be banned from carrying guns while
drinking off duty.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said officers would still have discretion about when to
carry their weapons, but he suggested that they ``should not be in
possession of their firearms if there is any possibility that they
may become unfit for duty due to the consumption of intoxicants.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that there had been incidents of misconduct, Safir said
in a prepared statement: ``The public expects police officers to be
held to a higher standard of duty and act responsibly when carrying
a firearm. This change in policy will insure that that
responsibility is taken seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, after a night of drinking, a city police officer
fled a multicar accident he caused on Long Island and then
committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, six detectives were suspended after the
department said they had fired their guns wildly in the air and
beaten a porter following an argument at a Brooklyn restaurant
where they had been drinking. The porter, Reginald Bannerman, fled
and was hit less than an hour later by a subway train at the nearby
Sterling Street station. Four of the detectives face charges,
including assault, prohibited use of weapons, tampering with
evidence, intimidating a witness and menacing.

VIRTUAL SAILORS JOIN THE AROUND ALONE FLEET AS IT BRAVES THE
SOUTHERN SEA
</HEADLINE>
  (ATTN: Calif., S.C.) 
 (nk) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark Rudiger, a champion ocean racer, is not one of the
competitors in the Around Alone race. But a computer game is
bringing him and thousands of other virtual sailors closer to the
action.
</P>
<P>
   The 44-year-old Rudiger is one of 5,521 people who have signed
up on the Web site of the Around Alone (www.aroundalone.com) to
sail along with the 15 actual competitors in the 27,000-mile solo
race. The army of armchair sailors is currently navigating its
fictitious boats through Leg 2, a 6,884-mile trek from South Africa
to New Zealand that began Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty addictive,'' Rudiger said recently by telephone
from San Francisco. ``I get in on it at least a couple of times a
day. If I don't get on the Web for a stretch, I start worrying
about what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the virtual race, the site includes e-mail
dispatches from the real sailors, news updates and ``Rudiger's
Roundup,'' an audio commentary on the race which Rudiger provides
for the site's producer, Quokka Sports.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997-98 Whitbread Round the World Race, Rudiger was
actually racing. As navigator on EF Language, the 60-foot Swedish
sailboat that won the race, Rudiger found out what victory is like.
But in the virtual Around Alone, he is struggling to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, his entry, named Team Rudiger, was among the top
100 boats. But by the end of last week, his standing had dropped to
333rd. Part of the problem, he said, was a computer game hiccup
that caused a small portion of the cyberspace fleet to look as if
it was going backward through the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Distressing, yes. But mild by comparison to the rerouting
experienced by many of the real Around Alone sailors last week. The
15 competitors had agreed at sea, by e-mail, to head north around
the mid-ocean Kerguelen Islands to avoid a severe storm to the
south.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the new routing affected them all differently.
Mike Golding, the English sailor who had won Leg 1 from Charleston,
S.C., to Cape Town, was blindsided with a 30-knot breeze and huge
ocean swells from the distant storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, a succession of waves arrived with a squall, and we
were off,'' Golding said in an e-mail last Monday. ``At first I
thought it was fun sailing at 26-28 knots. Then the fun turned to
fear when I realized I was on an unstoppable ride.''
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old Golding said that his sailboat, the 60-foot Team
Group 4, accelerated down a huge wave in a near vertical drop. ``A
split-second later, she hit the bottom of the wave,'' he added. ``A
veritable wall of water engulfed the boat from stem to stern, then
threw the boat on its side causing an instant jibe and knockdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Golding was able to bring the boat back under control 30 minutes
later. By late last week, he was in third place with fewer than
3,500 miles to go to Auckland, New Zealand. In first place, about
100 miles ahead of Golding, was Giovanni Soldini, the Italian
skipper of Fila.
</P>
<P>
   Isabelle Autissier, the French sailor who was leading early last
week, was forced on Thursday to seek calmer waters by heading
north. She dropped out to fix a jam in her boat's mainsail track,
and is unlikely now to have a chance at winning.
</P>
<P>
   The on-line competitors choose one of three boat designs and
then make decisions about how much food to take, how many calories
to expend each day and when to eat and sleep. The same weather
reports sent by satellite to race competitors are shared by at-home
sailors. The multitude of information requires difficult decisions,
whether a person is at sea or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm finding that more factors come into play with one person
sailing the boat than with the 10 or 12 people per boat in the
Whitbread,'' said Frank Tulp, a former equity trader from San
Francisco. ``For one thing, you have to take into account the extra
time needed to fix something.''
</P>
<P>
   Quokka Sports says the average number of visits to the Around
Alone home page is about 12,000 a day, compared to about 66,000
visits a day at its 1997-98 Whitbread site. But the Around Alone
visits have been longer, averaging 15 minutes compared to 9 minutes
for the Whitbread site.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to know when the solo sailor sleeps,'' said Susan
Daly, vice president of sailing for Quokka Sports. ``We tell them,
on and off for a few minutes at a time, 24 hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Participation in the current virtual race is closed to new
entrants for the remainder of Leg 2. But people interested in
joining for Leg 3 can register on the site in mid-January.

 &HT;    Thrashers keep chipping away at negotiations for practice rink
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lest there were any doubts that the Thrashers'
negotiations to build a practice facility at the Cooler ice rink in
Alpharetta, Ga., are on a respirator, the team is in the middle of
serious talks with a facility in Duluth. The Ice Forum is
interested in helping build the team's permanent complex adjacent
to its existing skating rink. The Ice Forum has one sheet of ice
but owns several acres that could be used to build a second rink
and a separate building for team offices, training equipment and
locker facilities. Thrashers general manager Don Waddell has met
with architects and is convinced that a new building could be
completed in time for the team's inaugural season. The only
alternative is to rent ice next year and maintain offices downtown
at CNN Center while a deal is worked out. Blueprints have been
drawn detailing the proposed practice facility at the Ice Forum.
... Waddell has been named to a staff of NHL general managers that
will help select players for the United States to compete in
hockey's World Championship, which takes place every spring in
non-Olympic years. Next year's championship will be held May 1-16
in Oslo, Norway. ... The Thrashers' advertising has spread to a new
outlet. A 30-second pre-show commercial began appearing in several
movie theaters Friday. The idea is to take advantage of the
increase in moviegoing during the holiday season. ... Team
officials held a dinner for several former Atlanta Flames last
week, including Tom Lysiak, Curt Bennett and Tim Ecclestone. ...
Waddell, marketing director Derek Schiller and other members of the
front office held the first in a series of breakfast study groups
last week with a dozen season-ticket holders, hoping to gauge the
success of marketing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   FACEOFF: RAY BOURQUE
</P>
<P>
   Team: Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Position: Defender.
</P>
<P>
   Age: 38.
</P>
<P>
   Update: His 20 years with the Bruins represent the longest
tenure by any active player in the four major sports. He has played
in 16 All-Star games and his 1,425 career points at the start of
the week rank 11th on the all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   On making the roster as an 18-year-old: ``Back then, the
expectations weren't as high and the money issue wasn't as big. Now
they're making the big bucks right off the bat, and they're
expected to deliver earlier than I did. I came into a good
situation with a veteran team. But now, kids are picked first by
the worst teams in the league, and they're being expected to make
the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   On his longevity: ``Sometimes I think about how fortunate I've
been. But I intend to keep on trucking as long as my body and mind
hold up. Sometimes I think: When will it end? I guess when I start
falling apart. But hopefully, that won't happen. I want to be out
of the game before I start sliding.''
</P>
<P>
   On whether he will slide into coaching: ``I definitely see
myself in hockey. But I'm not too sure about coaching. The travel
gets old after a while. One thing I'd like to do is slow down and
spend more time at home.''
</P>
<P>
   On the highlight of his career: ``I hope it hasn't yet come. I
still see myself skating around the ice with the (Stanley) Cup one
day. I've had so many great moments _ going to two finals, the
All-Star game in Boston when I scored with under a minute left, my
first game in Boston Garden in 1979. But if I ever win a Cup, that
would be the special time.''
</P>
<P>
   FIT TO BE TIED
</P>
<P>
   Although it remains to be seen if any rule changes will be
implemented, league officials continue to study ways to minimize
tie games in the regular season, and here's why. The percentage of
games that remain tied after overtime has been on the rise in the
last three years. Here is a 10-season breakdown of total games
played, overtime games and completed ties.

MAN OF PARADOXES 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This is a tale of two winter days at the Capitol,
one six Januarys ago and one only Saturday. This is a tale of
figures headed for history, one an idealistic president with great
promise speaking of his vision on his Inauguration Day, one a
battered president facing impeachment on the House floor. This is
the political tale of our time, the story of dreams finally
realized and the story of dreams in ruin.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, this is a tale of one man who has seen
astonishing success and, as Saturday showed, has suffered defeat so
devastating, so personally wounding, that it has been shared by
only one person in history. He is a man who has inspired and
retains remarkable public support and, as the impeachment vote
demonstrated, even more startling opposition; a man who seems, as
his supporters argue, to personify selflessness at its very best
and, as his detractors countered in a historic House session,
selfishness at its very worst; a man who raised himself from the
obscurity of a wrecked family in an Arkansas spa town all the way
to the White House, the American Dream made flesh, and now faces
the cold banishment of history, the politician's loneliest, most
dreaded nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen years ago, when Bill Clinton was an obscure young
governor, the Washington political pollster Peter D. Hart told him
over dinner at the governor's mansion in Little Rock: ``The people
in Arkansas want you to win, but they want you to win by only one
vote. They like you, but not everything about you.''
</P>
<P>
   That's still true. Americans generally like Clinton, even as
they despair of his character flaws. And now all Americans have
seen their lives, their perceptions of government, even their
personal views of honesty and political trust, affected and altered
by the Clinton experience.
</P>
<P>
   In that way, as much as any of the past half century, Clinton's
is a landmark presidency, exposing deep cultural divides in the
country. ``It has brought a lot of important issues to the
surface,'' said Joseph Cooper, a Johns Hopkins University political
scientist. ``He has brought us a lot of questions to which there
aren't a lot of easy answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton has added a modern twist to our politics, an ironic
turn to our outlook, a morality tale to our folklore, and, most of
all, a second thought to the way we view American public life. He
is, more than anything, the ``and yet'' president.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks for the best in all of us, and yet he stands as a
symbol of the flaws in all of us.
</P>
<P>
   He has jettisoned longtime friends and allies at a moment's
notice to serve his political needs, and yet he retains the
enduring loyalty of people he has never met.
</P>
<P>
   He sometimes seems arrogant, and yet he oftentimes appears
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   He talks from the podium like the boy from Hope, and yet he
speaks from the witness chair as the operator from Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   His opponents cannot abide having him at the center of political
life, and yet he would leave an enormous vacuum if he were gone.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters find him endlessly beguiling, and yet his
detractors find him unbearably repugnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like he was going to be one of the bright lights,'' Ray
Smith, a 28-year veteran of the Arkansas legislature who was its
House speaker during Clinton's first year as governor, said in an
interview. ``But I never knew why he had such a capacity to
irritate people so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the nation and Bill Clinton confront those very
paradoxes, the conflicts and complexities that make Clinton at once
the most compelling figure of our time and the most contradictory
figure of our age.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at what makes him tick and it is clear that he loves
this, this idea of serving,'' Carolyn Staley, who grew up next door
to the Clintons in Hot Springs, Ark., and who remains a close
friend of the president's. ``But he also has a competitive streak.
It has served him well through all of this. He can go harder and
with more fatigue than anyone else. He sees the two things as part
of the same process. He cannot have one without the other.''
</P>
<P>
   A prominent figure in Arkansas politics who has known Clinton
since 1968, when the leading members of the political elite
recognizied him as the shiniest, most promising youth of his time,
bound for the big city and for big things, added: ``He kind of
enjoys these things. There's a bigger mountain always for him to
climb. But he never reckoned on a mountain this high.''
</P>
<P>
   The president and Hillary Rodham Clinton pride themselves on
their ability to ``compartmentalize'' life, to keep their concerns
in ``little boxes'' that they can stow at will. But it might be
closer to the truth to say instead that these little boxes are the
building blocks of an extraordinary person, so powerful in
personality that he has come to dominate his time, so fragile in
reality that the removal of one of the little boxes might send the
whole structure tumbling to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   One of those boxes came from his mother, Virginia, who taught
Clinton, as one of his old friends said the other day, ``that every
day is a new day and you shouldn't look back.'' One of those boxes
came from his wife, who taught him the importance of battling back,
even when the odds seem insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best in these circumstances,'' said Senator Edward M.
Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat. ``He's competitive and
combative when he's worked up.''

 WASHINGTON: ... worked up.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But many of the boxes came from Clinton's own experience as a
young man growing up in Arkansas, viewing politics as a ladder of
social mobility as much as a blunt instrument of social change; as
a youthful activist, determined to bend politics to his own will
even when, as he found as an operative in Texas for George
McGovern's failed 1972 presidential campaign, the public resists;
as a boy-wonder governor who was, former Arkansas state
Representative Shirley Meecham once said, far better at sales than
at production; as a presidential candidate in 1992, when he
discovered that a candidate who stresses personality inevitably has
to answer for his own; and as a president whose every moment in the
White House has been full of tension and tumult.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a presidency of unusual upheaval,'' said Robert Ross,
a retired political scientist at the University of Northern Iowa.
``There's been a heavy loading of personalism in this presidency,
and the thing about it is that the upheaval is relentless, going on
and on and on, and there is a raw, animalistic edge to it.''
</P>
<P>
   He has always been drawn to the tumult, and that, along with his
marital unfaithfulness and his elastic view of the truth, is part
of the Clinton character.
</P>
<P>
   As a student government leader at all-white Hot Springs High
School, he joined the superintendent of schools in a risky campaign
for a bond issue to build a new high school for both races. He
plunged into Senator J. William Fulbright's 1968 re-election
campaign, attracting the attention of political leaders in the
state, prompting many of them to think: (itals)This is a kid, so
idealistic, so sophisticated, who will do great things.(unitals) As
governor, he took on the teachers' union. As president, he mounted
an assault on the health-care establishment.
</P>
<P>
   And yet he also shies from conflict. In Arkansas, politicians
noticed that he wouldn't rest until he had won over everyone in the
room, often taking more care to court his opponents than to
reassure his allies. ``He is a true politician,'' said state
Representative John Dawson of Camden in south Arkansas, who dealt
with Clinton as governor. ``In most instances he can find an
audience and tell them what they want to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   After the health-care plan died a miserable death in 1994,
CLinton retreated. He had bitten off too much, and from then on his
proposals were bite-sized, sometimes merely suggestions (``Let's
think about youth curfews''), sometimes ideas snatched straight
from his opponents' platforms (the emphasis on deficit reduction,
which had not been a prominent part of his 1992 campaign but was a
matter of orthodoxy to some elements of the Republican Party).
</P>
<P>
   From his youth, he was a magnet for attention _ and speculation.
</P>
<P>
   His friends remember their parents saying he might be president
some day. Everyone in the Clinton circle at the time was stunned
when he turned down an offer to be a staff attorney for the
Watergate impeachment committee; the man who would eventually be
impeached himself wanted to go back to Arkansas and prepare for a
House race against Representative John Paul Hammerschmidt. Another
Yale Law graduate, Hillary Rodham, took the job instead. Clinton
wore out three pair of shoes in the House race, and lost.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, an Arkansas columnist would call Attorney General Bill
Clinton ``the most formidable state-level politician in Arkansas.''
He ignored the advice of one of the savvy mastodons of Arkansas
politics, Senator John L. McClellan, who told Clinton the
governorship was the road to nowhere, and he transformed the job
into the road to the White House. Some of his predecessors,
Winthrop Rockefeller, Dale Bumpers and David Pryor, had been
prominent figures who won notice beyond Little Rock _ Governor
Rockefeller once even appeared on the cover of Time _ but none of
them held the attention of Little Rock or won attention beyond it
the way Clinton did.
</P>
<P>
   He almost ran for president in 1988 and then pulled back. In
1991, he looked at the race and grappled with how to deal with his
pledge to serve out his full term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethically, you can't simply plead changed circumstances,'' he
said in an interview in 1991. ``Changing circumstances are why
people are asked to make commitments in the first place. But most
contracts have an escape clause, and I'm arguing that there's a
limit as to how much any governor can do, and that if I were to
win, or even to change the debate, the people of Arkansas would
profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, on an airplane between Little Rock and Washington for the
breakfast with reporters in which he and Mrs. Clinton would say
they had worked out the problems in their marriage, he added
tellingly:
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest problems we have in this country is that no
one ever believes politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   More than any other politician on the American scene he has been
picked apart, evaluated, analyzed, and always the focus returns to
his character. He may express surprise, even resentment, at how
intrusive the inquiries are, but in truth, Bill Clinton has spent
as much time as his opponents thinking about his own character,
exploring its contours, testing its suppleness, probing for its
weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that people ultimately have to live with the
consequences of their lives and work through them and go on,'' he
said in an extraordinarily revealing conversation in San Antonio
only weeks before he won the Democratic presidential nomination in
1992. ``Questions of private character also have private
consequences that either make your life or break it. I've tried to
learn from it and grow as a result of it.''
</P>
<P>
   A man whose critics oftentimes accuse him of self-deception has
an unusually deep knowledge of himself. Listen to Clinton on
Clinton, reflections in a hotel suite eight years ago:
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I as as good as (my supporters) did _ goodness
is a function of what you feel and think as well as what you do _
and I know darn well I wasn't as bad as I was being portrayed. I
always thought I did a lot of good things and some bad things. . .
. To me, life is a journey and character is a quest. It's an
unfolding thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's journey isn't over, his quest for character
continues. But as it does, America's quest to understand Clinton
and to evaluate his character has come to dominate this nation's
politics.

NO PROHIBITION AGAINST WAR DURING RAMADAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite President Clinton's desire not to launch attacks on Iraq
during Ramadan, there is nothing in Islamic law that prohibits
warfare during Islam's holiest month, some religious scholars said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue about not attacking during Ramadan is only
important in the administration's mind, because there's absolutely
nothing in Islam that says you can't have a war during Ramadan,''
said Yvonee Haddad, a professor of the history of Islam and
Christian-Muslim relations at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   Ramadan, which begins this weekend, celebrates the divine
revelation of the opening sections of the Koran, Islam's sacred
text, to the prophet Mohammed. Fasting from dawn to sunset during
the month-long observance is one of the five pillars, or
obligations, of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Along with fasting, the world's 1 billion Muslims are also
required to observe the holy month by abstaining from smoking,
liquids, and sex from dawn to dusk as a sign of purification and
sacrifice. Ramadan ends with Id al-Fitr, the feast of the breaking
of the fast, one of the biggest Muslim celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Ramadan's special significance _ it is specifically
mentioned in the Koran _ Haddad noted that, Iran and Iraq, two
predominantly Muslim nations, waged war in the 1980s during the
month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   But other Islamic specialists said that even if it is not
forbidden by religious law, bombing Iraq on Ramadan could still be
regarded by Muslims as being highly disrespectful because it is
considered an especially sacred period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attention, the effort, and energy of Muslims is very much
directed toward Ramadan,'' said Denis Sullivan, an associate
professor of political science and a Middle East specialist at
Northeastern University. ``To have that experience of faith
violated by non-Muslims, especially by the United States, is really
a complete and total denigration of that month.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Muslim organizations in the United States, while not
necessarily supportive of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, have been
critical, for political and not religious reasons, of the US
assault on Iraq .
</P>
<P>
   ``This assault does not lend credibility to undermining the
Iraqi regime's perceived threat to its neighboring states as well
as the world community,'' said a statement released Saturday by the
Washington-based American Muslim Council.
</P>
<P>
   Another Washington-based group, the Council on American-Islamic
Relations, said the bombings along with the continuing US economic
sanctions against Iraq will exacerbate a ``humanitarian disaster
that includes vastly increased rates of malnutrition, disease, and
infant deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Islam follows the lunar calendar, which is shorter than
the solar calendar, the dates of Ramadan change every year. The
start of Ramadan depends on the date of the new moon, based on
stringent Islamic astrological guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim countries begin and end the month on a different day,
based on when their clerics determine a new moon to be sighted. In
the Boston area, Muslims are expected to begin their Ramadan fast
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to some misconceptions, the majority of the world's
Muslims are not in the Middle East and are not Arab. According to
Muslim scholars, the country with the largest number of Muslims is
Indonesia, followed by Pakistan, Bangladesh, and India.

FOR US TROOPS, FAMILIAR GROUND 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DOHA, Kuwait _ As they quick-stepped into the staging area, the
soldiers of Charlie Company gave roar to that durable Army marching
chant: ``Here we go _ again! Here we go _ again!''
</P>
<P>
   Staff Sgt. Kurt Antoine was surely going again. Saturday marked
his fourth rapid deployment to Kuwait since the 1991 Persian Gulf
War. The sands of the emirate were becoming as familiar as the
sands of his native Asbury Park, N.J. ``Saddam Hussein keeps
jerking Americans back here, and it's getting pretty tiresome,'' he
said. ``If the orders come, we're ready to head across that border
and start killing bad guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Overhanging the operation, however, was the ongoing impeachment
crisis enwrapping Bill Clinton, commander-and-chief of these
fighters. For some, it plainly whittled away the edges of their
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What should really be a political sideshow for Americans has
become the whole show, and I guess there is a feeling that we're
here, willing to put our lives on the line, but no one at home is
paying attention except as it plays out as part of the scandal,''
said Spec. Derrin Brown, 21, of Taunton, Mass. ``This deployment is
our reality. But it doesn't seem to register at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the fliers were back in the air, delivering death and
destruction at supersonic speed. American F-16 fighters and A-10
``tank busters'' thundered again Saturday night from Navy carriers
and desert air bases.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, the US troops still pouring into the Gulf were
wondering if maybe, just maybe, their time might be next.
</P>
<P>
   It's a prospect they weigh with equal parts anxiety and
anticipation. ``No one really wants to go into combat,'' said
Specialist Kevin McKoon, 20, of Rindge, N.H. ``But the bottom line
is, that's what we're trained for.''
</P>
<P>
   Barely an hour after being disgorged from the air transport that
carried them from their home base of Fort Stewart, Ga., the
bleary-eyed soldiers of Charlie Company, 3rd Battalion, 15th
Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division were hurriedly drawing ammunition
and field rations, then readying their Bradley fighting vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our soldiers are moving at speed. It's 12 hours from the
moment they hit the ground to the time they take up fighting
positions out in the desert,'' said Col. Ron Williams, chief
spokesman for US ground forces in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Company was just one of scores of combat units airlifted
or landed by sea into Kuwait over the past several weeks, bringing
total American ground forces in the emirate to over 5,000 Army
troops and Marines, a number increasing almost by the hour in an
operation that has gone nearly unnoticed as the bombs crash down on
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The company's staging ground was a forlorn strip of asphalt
whipped by wind-blown sand. The cold darkness of early morning was
harshly illuminated by batteries of diesel generator-fired
floodlights.
</P>
<P>
   There came the oily purr of turrets swiveling as gunners
performed battle readiness checks on 25mm ``chain guns'' capable of
chewing an ordinary car into metal confetti in two blinks of the
eye.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeants bawled orders; officers pored over maps; lowlier ranks
manhandled crates of Meals-Ready-to-Eat, drinking water and ammo
into the dun-colored armored vehicles. Each Bradley carries three
crew members -- gunner, driver, commander -- along with six
infantrymen, plus the hundreds of pounds of gear and supplies
needed to sustain them.
</P>
<P>
   As the troopers of Charlie Company prepped as if for war, the
31st Marine Expeditionary Unit -- ``a thousand trigger-pullers
strong,'' in the words of Lt. Kristen A. Lasica -- were digging
into a rocky ridge not far from the Iraq border.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines had shoved ashore on landing vessels after a rushed
ocean passage from a training mission in Okinawa. Now, as first
light paled the eastern sky, the Marines were hacking foxholes into
the barren ground, sweat streaking the sand plastered to their
faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like an adventure, only not a lot of fun,'' said Cpl.
Sean Walsh, 21, of Worcester, Mass., mechanic on an amphibious
assault vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Marines were dug in, there was little to do but listen
to the desert wind moan and watch a camel caravan plod across the
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Most US troops interviewed had little inkling of world events,
so cut off are they from the news; none had any notion of how their
commander-in-chief was faring in his fight for political survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got no TV, got no radio, but that's fine, that's cool,'' said
Cpl. Joshua Ridley, 20, of La Grande, Ore. ``We're not here to be
public commentators. We're here to do whatever our country asks us
to do.''

IMPEACHMENT LEAVES BLAIR AN UNLIKELY HAWK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ With President Bill Clinton undermined and effectively
silenced by his impeachment, an unlikely chief cheerleader of the
Anglo-American assault on Iraq has emerged: British Prime Minister
Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   It is an unaccustomed position for Blair, who is more
comfortable extolling the virtues of his post-empire vision of
``Cool Britannia'' than sabre rattling.
</P>
<P>
   But with the American commander-in-chief being impeached even as
US forces are in combat, it has been left to Blair to be the
standard bearer for Britain and America.
</P>
<P>
   Telegenic and an accomplished speaker, Blair has impressed even
his political enemies by forcefully articulating the Anglo-American
case for striking at Saddam Hussein's regime.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, some observers in London were stunned by the
hard-line rhetoric Blair used. He talked of keeping ``Saddam in his
cage, because if he is allowed out of his cage he is a danger to
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair's choice of words was even more striking because the most
vocal critics of the Anglo-American attacks on Iraq are members of
his traditionally left-wing Labor Party, which last year broke an
18-year hold on power by the Conservatives in winning the biggest
parliamentary majority in nearly two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   But, like Clinton, Blair moved his party away from ideologically
held positions to the center in a calculated move to gain power.
And like Clinton, Blair has emerged as an unlikely hawk in the
campaign against Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Blair stepped up the war of words.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is without any doubt at all our desire to see the end of
Saddam Hussein,'' Blair said at a news conference here. ``As well
as the military dimension, we are already in discussion with our
colleagues and allies and partners around the world as to how we
then adopt a forward strategy to make sure there is stability and
containment in the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton has an ever-decreasing credibility with many of
those European allies, it will be left to Blair to mend fences with
the major powers, especially France, which has joined Russia and
China in opposing the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, with the president preoccupied, the case
to be made for bombing Iraq has been left mostly to Defense
Secretary William Cohen, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and
General Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Similarly, the British have used Foreign Minister Robin Cook and
Defense Minister George Robertson to argue their case.
</P>
<P>
   But even those who despise the Blair administration, viewing it
as arrogant and self-righteous, acknowledge that it is Blair
himself who has made the most compelling case for bombing Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Bipartisan support here has been made easier by Blair's public
speeches. The opposition Tories find themselves handcuffed, unable
to repudiate Blair's hard-line rhetoric because they agree with it
wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P>
   Quentin Letts, who covers the House of Commons for The Daily
Telegraph, the voice of the Conservative establishment, conceded
that Blair's speech to Parliament on Thursday defending the attacks
on Iraq was impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Letts and others feel uncomfortable giving too much credit
to the leader of a party whose backbenchers were describing the
bombings as a violation of international law. Conservatives are
suspicious of Blair's motives and think his Commons speech on
Thursday was inconsistent with the pacifist stance of Blair's Labor
Party predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though one hesitates to say this,'' said Letts, ``he (Blair)
seemed almost to be enjoying his opportunity. . ., rejoicing in it,
even.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday night, as the first bombs were
dropping on Iraq, Blair's foreign secretary, Cook, chuckled when
asked if his boss was acting tough.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Blair, he said, is much tougher than his critics give him.

CHANGING THE POLITICAL WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the end, in the chamber, there was a moment of
awe. The votes had been tallied, the president of the United States
had been impeached. It is a frightful act, harsh and unforgiving,
inserted in the Constitution as much as a deterrent as a
punishment, intended to be contemplated rarely and utilized even
more sparingly. And the men and women who for the first time since
Reconstruction delivered this terrible blow knew that with their
votes they were giving new shape to the presidency, altering the
historical view of President Clinton, changing their own destinies,
and transforming the political world.
</P>
<P>
   They knew that this act, coming on the precipice of the
millennium, may have been designed to punish acts of the past but
inevitably and inalterably would fashion the future, possibly
making impeachment less formidable a tool, the presidency less
potent an office, the separation of powers less sterile a concept.
</P>
<P>
   They knew that for all of them, newcomers and retirees,
Republicans and Democrats, this was a vote that marked not only the
president but themselves, and that its consequences went beyond the
fact that forevermore Bill Clinton would be remembered as an
impeached president. They knew that, in profiles and in memories
and maybe even in books and surely in obituaries, they would be
remembered for this single vote.
</P>
<P>
   They knew that their civic lives, and the president's, would be
distilled down to this single public act.
</P>
<P>
   They knew that, as a result of this vote, this is a different
president, a different Congress, a different political system, and
a different country than it was Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In ways impossible to predict but impossible to deny, Saturday's
vote to impeach President Clinton was a cairn along the path of
American politics, a turning point after which the terrain will be
different, the setting will be different, the atmosphere will be
different.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term there almost certainly will be even more
partisan strife, even more bitterness, even more suspicion, even
more distrust. But all ``the venom and the hatred,'' as retiring
Democratic Representative Bill Hefner of North Carolina put it,
might itself bring on a softer era as a reaction.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, Saturday's vote to impeach the president
represents the triumph of religious conservatives, who reacted with
outrage to the president's infidelity. Combined with the startling
announcement Saturday by Louisiana Representative Robert L.
Livingston that he would not accept the speakership of the House
and would resign from Congress next year, it means that leaders in
American public life would continue to be judged by strict,
unforgiving standards of private comportment.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, Saturday's action makes impeachment less
forbidding an instrument of punishment, less unthinkable a remedy
for presidential wrongdoing. But in the long term, the willingness
of congressional Republicans to unsheath this weapon over a sexual
affair might prompt future Congresses to be more wary of broaching
impeachment at all.
</P>
<P>
   But all of the inquiries into politicians' private lives might
also lead to a backlash, restoring the traditional barriers that
allowed leaders such as John F. Kennedy and Franklin D. Roosevelt
to be inspiring figures of great public character despite the
blotches on their private character _ blotches that remained
private in their White House years.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, a great constitutional, political, and psychological
bar has been crossed. For 13 decades no House has voted to impeach
a president, no Senate has prepared to try a president. The last
time such an ominous event was even contemplated, when a president
faced almost certain impeachment in 1974, Richard M. Nixon stepped
down from office rather than face a House vote and a Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   That episode, broken short by Nixon's resignation, has its own
shorthand in history, ``Watergate.'' Within months it transformed
the Congress, with the Democrats picking up 49 new seats, some of
them still in the chamber Saturday, many of them forever regarded
as ``Watergate babies.'' It prompted an overhaul in the
campaign-finance system, a new openness in Congress, a moral style
in politics that led to the election of Jimmy Carter, and a
crusading style in American journalism.
</P>
<P>
   For decades lawmakers were marked by how they voted on
desegregation, or on the Voting Rights Act that extended the most
precious democratic right to black Americans, or on the Bay of
Tonkin Resolution that gave thin legal sanction to the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers who voted for or against the impeachment of the
president Saturday will answer for that decision the rest of their
public lives. John Kennedy, for example, never escaped his failure
to vote for the censure of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, the
Wisconsin Republican who fueled the Communist-baiting excesses of
the 1950s. Representative Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, a
Pennsylvania Democrat, was so pilloried for providing the decisive
vote for a budget-reconciliation measure in August 1993 that it
cost her the seat representing Philadelphia's northwest suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's vote will be reprised in the next congressional
elections, perhaps in the presidential campaign of 2000 and
probably in the presidential elections that follow.
</P>
<P>
   On a brisk afternoon when the flags flew crisply from all the
flagstaffs of the Capitol, when the House chamber was jammed with
lawmakers, when the corridors of the old legislature were jammed
with the very people the system was designed to serve, when the
galleries were full to overflowing with them, the whiff of history
was palpable in the air. Here, on Saturday, December 19, 1998, the
future was being changed.

NATION TO JUDGE BOTH CLINTON, SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``William Jefferson Clinton! William Jefferson
Clinton! William Jefferson Clinton! Appear and answer the articles
of impeachment exhibited by the House of Representatives against
you.''
</P>
<P>
   With these words, spelled out in a 101-page congressional
impeachment manual, the Senate would begin what inevitably will be
called the ``trial of the century.'' One hundred US senators, a
political jury like no other, are slated to sit in judgment of
President Clinton, his sexual affair and his alleged perjury. At
stake is the presidency and, some believe, the words upon which
this nation was founded.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this grave constitutional matter, this time of sober
reflection by the Senate and the nation, is bound at times to come
across like a sordid screenplay. With senators barred from speaking
during the trial, the nation could witness Supreme Court Chief
Justice William Rehnquist presenting questions to former White
House intern Monica S. Lewinsky about her sexual relationship with
the president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   More strangely still, as the nation prepares for these pages of
history to turn, most people think they already know the plot and
foresee the ending. The Senate could well vote mostly along party
lines to acquit the president.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the interest, to a great degree, will be in the spectacle
of the trial itself. The rules and procedures are arcane, including
many that date to the 1868 impeachment trial of President Andrew
Johnson. In many ways, it will not be just Clinton on trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate itself will be on trial,'' said Senator John F.
Kerry. The public, he said, will be watching whether the Senate
puts aside political biases and acts fairly.
</P>
<P>
   Can 100 of the most strong-headed politicians on the planet put
politics aside?
</P>
<P>
   Potential for pre-judgment is everywhere. For Democrats, this
would be a vote to convict a president of their own party, a friend
who has raised enormous amounts of money for numerous senators and
helped many with their careers. For Republicans, this would be a
vote to oust a man many consider an arch-enemy, who in many cases
has worked hard for their defeat. Senate majority leader Trent
Lott, for example, has already called Clinton's behavior
``disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also conflicts with ramifications for the 2000
presidential campaign. Kerry, in effect, would be voting on whether
to replace Clinton with Vice President Al Gore, thus boosting the
stature of a man Kerry might oppose for the presidency. Kerry said
this won't affect his vote. Senator John McCain, an Arizona
Republican, might wreck his possible presidential campaign no
matter how he votes; to acquit might anger conservatives who are
important during the primary, to convict could upset moderates of
both parties needed in a general election.
</P>
<P>
   The framers of the Constitution knew partisanship would be a
problem and made it very hard to remove a president from office by
requiring a two-thirds vote for conviction. That prospect seems
unlikely given the GOP's 55-45 control of the Senate _ 67 votes
would be needed to convict. But the possibility remains, especially
if some key Democrats use their influence. White House officials
worry about a worst-case scenario in which Democratic senators such
as Robert Byrd of West Virginia, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New
York and Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut might favor a conviction,
which could start a chain-reaction in the party.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd and Moynihan have remained mostly mum, which worries the
White House, and Lieberman said in an interview that it would be
foolish to presume how the vote will turn out. Not one senator has
declared how he or she will vote, Lieberman noted. But Lieberman
has signaled that he may vote for acquittal even if he determines
that Clinton committed perjury. The question is not whether the
president committed a certain crime, Lieberman said, but whether
Clinton committed an impeachable offense. Crimes can be prosecuted
in criminal court later, Lieberman noted.
</P>
<P>
   Under rules spelled out in a 1986 manual, ``Procedure and
Guidelines for Impeachment Trials in the United States Senate,''
the Senate is supposed to be immediately informed that the House
has impeached the president, as it was Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   When the Senate convenes around Jan. 6, it will notify the House
that it is ready to receive the articles of impeachment. The
articles must be delivered, and by 1 p.m. the following day, the
Senate takes up the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate would notify Clinton that he is to stand trial, and
he is given the option of appearing himself or sending a
representative. The Senate would decide how much time to give
Clinton to prepare for the case. In 1868, President Johnson asked
for 40 days to prepare for his impeachment trial and was given 10.
Clinton or his lawyer would enter a plea _ guilty or not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The trial would begin with all senators sitting in their chairs,
forbidden under the rules from speaking during the trial. Senators
could send written questions to Rehnquist, who would serve as judge
and sit in the chair normally occupied by the acting president of
the Senate. The tables usually occupied by clerks in the Senate
chamber may be turned over to the prosecution and defense teams. If
Clinton chooses to appear, he would sit in a docket.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution team, more formally known as ``managers'' of the
impeachment trial, will be led by House Judiciary Committee
Chairman Henry Hyde of Illinois and others approved by the House.
Hyde is expected to let other House Judiciary Committee members, as
well as his friend, GOP chief investigative counsel David
Schippers, handle various parts of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Hyde, the other managers, named Saturday, were Reps:
James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, Bill McCollum of Florida, George
Gekas of Pennsylvania, Charles Canady of Florida, Steve Buyer of
Indiana, Ed Bryant of Tennessee, Steve Chabot of Ohio, Bob Barr of
Georgia, Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, Chris Cannon of Utah, James
Rogan of California and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The president's attorneys, David Kendall, Gregory Craig and
White House counsel Charles Ruff, would present Clinton's defense.
Unlike in the House, which based much of its impeachment case on
the report by independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr, Senate rules
make it more likely that the managers, who perform the role of a
prosecutor, would obtain evidence independently. Just as in a
regular trial, witnesses would be deposed and may eventually be
called to testify on the Senate floor. They could be
cross-examined, possibly giving the president's attorneys their
first chance to question Lewinsky, her one-time friend Linda R.
Tripp and others.
</P>
<P>
   The rules of the trial are a mix of criminal court procedures
and Senate parliamentary maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a hybrid event,'' said Senator Judd Gregg, the New
Hampshire Republican who is helping organize the trial in his role
as chief deputy whip. ``You have got a trial, but the jurors are
elected officials. I don't think people realize this is essentially
a criminal trial, with all the structure and formality and
protections that come with a criminal trial. There will a
prosecutor, a defense, and a defendant sitting in the docket.''
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson trial, the only presidential impeachment case that
has reached the Senate, riveted the public's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a Democrat, was impeached after he fired Secretary of
War Edwin W. Stanton, who opposed many of Johnson's policies. The
basis for impeaching Johnson is viewed by historians as overly
political; the Republicans did not like the relatively lenient way
Johnson was trying to rebuild the South after the Civil War. While
the Republicans had enough senators to convict Johnson on a
party-line vote, seven Republicans joined Democrats in voting to
acquit Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   In the Clinton case, the best hope for the White House is that
at least six moderate Republican senators join with the 45
Democrats in a motion to dismiss the case. While such a move is
likely to be opposed by Lott, the Senate majority leader might go
along if it becomes certain Clinton would be acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most significant political and structural oddity of this
is that it takes 67 votes to convict, an extremely high threshold,
but only 51 votes to dismiss or terminate or suspend the trial,''
Gregg said. ``Nobody knows what is going to happen. No one in his
life has ever seen something like this.''

IN SOME CHURCHES, CHRISTMAS IS A MOVABLE FEAST 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Christmas was still a week away, but the spirit of
Christmas Eve prevailed Thursday night at the Fifth Avenue
Presbyterian Church.
</P>
<P>
   For the last four years, the majestic church at Fifth Avenue and
55th Street has conducted what it terms the ``Travelers' Christmas
Eve,'' a service that lets parishioners who are leaving town for
the holidays worship in their home church. Visitors are welcome
too.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, in 1995, the early Christmas Eve was a hit,
and this week it drew 625 people. The service was identical in
every way with the one that will be conducted twice on Christmas
Eve itself, complete with prayer, sermon, choir, brass and string
instruments, audience caroling and a candlelight conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become a tradition, and the key point is not to make
people feel it is a lesser service or miniservice,'' the Rev. Dr.
Thomas Tewell, the senior pastor of the congregation, said. ``It
makes people who travel feel that this is the way the church cares
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Other churches in the city will be having services for travelers
on Sunday, among them Marble Collegiate Church, Riverside Church,
and the Unitarian Church of All Souls, where, in addition to
Christmas services Sunday morning, there will be what the Rev.
Forrester Church described as a ``New York City-Sioux Falls
Christmas pageant, the same pageant you grew up with in Sioux Falls
with children dressed as wise men, shepherds and sheep.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Dr. Arthur Caliandro of Marble Collegiate Church, where
Sunday's service will include the Christmas story, carols and
Handel's ``Messiah,'' said: ``When people go away to Ohio,
Nebraska, wherever, they still want to have Christmas in their New
York church. If we don't have a full-blown Christmas experience for
them here, they leave wanting.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Judson Memorial Church, an interdenominational
Christian church in the heart of Greenwich Village, where for years
there has been no service on either Christmas Eve or Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our people travel and the idea that Jesus was born in
late December was a European invention and is arbitrary,'' the Rev.
Peter Laarman, the senior minister, said. ``We made a considered
decision this year that because Christmas is Friday, it would be OK
to have the main celebration on December 20. Some years, we've
moved it ahead by 10 days. We want to create the opportunity for
the most people to come and enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampering with the traditional service schedule for either
Christmas Eve or Christmas Day is unthinkable in Roman Catholicism
or Episcopalianism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not critical of what others do, but it wouldn't be
liturgically proper,'' said Joseph Zwilling, the spokesman for the
Archdiocese of New York. ``This is the last Sunday of Advent, and
the Christmas Eve service anticipates the Christmas Mass.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the lack of a precise date for the birth of Jesus that
gives the more liberal denominations justification for celebrating
early.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly a dilemma that certain congregations,
especially ones with affluent people who travel a great deal,
face,'' said Dr. Peter Awn, professor of religion at Columbia
University. ``Do you allow the community to diminish in order to
keep to an artificial date? What services like this say is that if
you care about community building, you must make what appear to be
untraditional compromises.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clearly community was important at Fifth Avenue Presbyterian
Church, where greeters were on hand at every doorway wishing people
merry Christmas, and where worshippers hugged and kissed one
another.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith Marsh, who will be spending the holiday in Brandon,
Miss., brought a group of friends who will disperse across the
country. ``I think this is wonderful,'' Ms. Marsh said. ``I
wouldn't miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie Manning, who will be in Minneapolis at Christmas, stood
at the back of the sanctuary holding her daughter, Alex, who will
be 1 on Dec. 30. Ms. Manning is due to have her second child next
month. ``Whoever would have thought you would find something so
welcoming in the middle of Manhattan,'' she said.

   They were going to call it Desert Viper, but the second word had
to begin with an F. Desert Fiper? Generals do not like to sound
foolish.
</P>
<P>
   Well, what about Desert Ferret or Desert Flamingo? OK, maybe
those handles lack that certain something.
</P>
<P>
   But Desert Fox? That was the nickname of Erwin Rommel, the
fabled North African field marshal of Hitler's army.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon wanted to name the campaign against Iraq
desert-something-or-other to be consistent with names for other
operations in the Persian Gulf, like Desert Storm in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Desert Viper may have a ferocious ring, but under Pentagon
protocol, the military command planning the operation _ in this
case, the one based at MacDill Air Force Base near Tampa, Fla. _
was supposed to choose a name beginning with D or F.
</P>
<P>
   Enter a computer data base, known at the Pentagon, the world
capital of acronyms, as the Nicaa. (Don't even ask what that stands
for.) It decided that the second word should begin with an F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fiper'' is not in the dictionary, of course, and ``Desert
Fiper'' doesn't have the right ring. So high-level types at MacDill
settled on fox. Eventually, Defense Secretary William Cohen
approved the name Desert Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Did anybody think of Rommel, who was portrayed by James Mason in
not one but two Hollywood films?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody,'' said Lt. Col. David Thurston, a spokesman for the
Joint Chiefs of Staff. ``That was not in the mix. I know that it's
been speculated on by various members of the media and others, but
that did not enter into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Schneier, president of the New York Board of Rabbis,
accepted that explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure the powers that be did not associate the name with
the Nazi general,'' he said. ``And as it happens, the choice could
be something positive, because in the aftermath of this campaign,
the term Desert Fox will no longer be associated with a Nazi
officer, but instead will be associated with a determined effort to
stop a mad dictator from acquiring weapons of mass destruction.''

IN DOWNTOWN NEWARK, HOPEFUL SIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RACHELLE GARBARINE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ As day faded into night on a recent Sunday,
people began streaming into the 13-month-old New Jersey Performing
Arts Center in downtown Newark for the New Jersey Symphony
Orchestra's 4 p.m. Christmas show. Instead of passing by New
Jersey's largest city, long a symbol of urban decay, more than
2,000 patrons _ young and old, black and white, well-to-do and
working class _ were pouring into its heart.
</P>
<P>
   The scene captured a potential for change that even the most
ardent supporters of Newark's current revival are quick to admit
seemed almost unimaginable three years ago in this city, which was
brought to its knees by race riots some 31 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that the struggle for recovery is far from over can be
found by weekend concert goers in the lonely streets and the
sparsity of customers in shops a few blocks from the $180 million
arts center, streets and shops that are livelier during the work
week.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty still clings to many of the city's crumbling
neighborhoods. But there have been signs of progress in the core of
this 24-square-mile city in addition to the arts center, which in
its first year of operation drew more than half a million visitors.
</P>
<P>
   One of the clearest has been the purchase over the last 18
months of eight office buildings _ at least two of which were sold
twice. Four more are on the market, with deals reported to be
close. And the longtime owners of a fifth property _ a
467,000-square-foot office building that one of the owners said
could not be rented or even given away earlier this decade _ are
sprucing it up and marketing it to tenants.
</P>
<P>
   For the investors who are buying buildings in downtown Newark,
``the bet is to buy older, mostly vacant buildings, upgrade them to
compete for corporate tenants and, in turn, be able to achieve a
higher rental stream,'' said Arthur Della Salla, regional director
of research at Grubb &AMP; Ellis, the national commercial brokerage.
His firm puts the sale price for such buildings in Newark at $9 to
$27 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   Della Salla said the recent sale of one of the city's most
modern buildings _ the only Class A building to have changed hands
recently _ told a similar story: An investor sold the building for
double what he paid for it after securing a long-term lease from a
financially secure tenant.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, he said, the first investor purchased the
720,000-square-foot Gateway II building, part of a complex of four
office towers adjacent to Penn Station, for $34 million, or $40 a
square foot, and sold it 19 months later for $78 million, or $94 a
square foot.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential Insurance Company of America, whose corporate
headquarters has been in the city since 1875, has moved some 3,800
workers back to Newark after having dispatched them to the suburbs
years earlier, raising its city work force to 7,000. Prudential now
occupies about 2.2 million square feet of office space in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic has also made a commitment to move back employees,
starting with 85 workers in the last six months and with the
potential for some 600 more at its partially occupied
428,000-square-foot New Jersey headquarters at 540 Broad St. It now
has 1,000 workers in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Regaining those jobs will help compensate for the loss of 500
expected at Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Co., based at 520 Broad
St. The insurer _ which was seized by state regulators after it
collapsed in 1991 and has operated under a rehabilitation plan
since then _ has announced that it will sell its insurance assets
at year's end and close its doors this summer, an indication that
despite the good news, Newark still faces an uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an evolutionary process,'' said Alfred Faiella, the
city's deputy mayor for housing and economic development. ``The
idea is to put so much into the hopper that more will eventually
come.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Sharpe James added that Newark was ``following the format
of other cities by starting to build an arts core and give people a
reason to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why people like Lawrence Goldman, president and chief
executive officer of the arts center, consider the current wave of
investment in downtown office buildings so important.
</P>
<P>
   ``The depopulation and disinvestment in some of the buildings
around the arts center was worrisome from the standpoint of the
health of an urban center,'' said Goldman. ``What is happening now
is astounding, and if you asked me the week before the arts center
opened how long it would take for the impact on real estate to be
felt I would have said three to five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimates from Grubb &AMP; Ellis, the national commercial brokerage,
are that about $400 million will have been invested in downtown
Newark over the next few years, counting from mid-1997. That figure
includes what the new owners paid for the office buildings and what
they and existing landlords say they have spent or will spend to
renovate the structures.
</P>
<P>
   The new investors are looking at forces at play outside Newark,
as well as within the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamentals of the New Jersey economy are as good as they
have been in 30 years and the office market is as healthy in the
state as in Manhattan,'' said James Hughes, dean of the Edward J.
Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers
University. ``So areas left behind like Newark are benefiting from
that and seeing more activity.''
</P>
<P>
   After renovating the buildings, investors are betting they can
make money by leasing space at higher rents. The appeal to tenants
is that the rents will still be lower than those in Manhattan and
along the Hudson River waterfront in Jersey City, which has been
the first stop for companies willing to cross the river to New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Grubb &AMP; Ellis put the average annual asking rent for prime space
in Newark _ defined as newer buildings close to Penn Station _ at
$25 per square foot, compared with $22 a year ago. In contrast,
such space goes for an average of about $30 along the riverfront in
Jersey City and $35 in downtown New York City according to the
brokerage firm's figures. Asking rents for space in second-tier
buildings in Newark range from $15 to $21 a square foot annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tenants looking for space at lower rents can find it in
Newark, which has a labor supply and accessibility by train to
Manhattan,'' said Donald Eisen, executive managing director for the
New York area at Cushman &AMP; Wakefield. Newark has shown ``signs of
life'' recently and could take off as an office market, but over
time, he said, ``it needs a commitment from an outside company, and
people fueling 24-hour activity.''

</P>
<P>
   So far, most of the new buyers are from out of state, including
some from New York City such as Cogswell Realty Group. With Lehman
Brothers and other New York investors, Cogswell bought two
buildings, totaling about a million square feet, most of it empty.
</P>
<P>
   The investors plan to modernize the 641,000-square-foot office
building at 744 Broad St., which they bought late last year for
$7.5 million from Newark Building Associates. That company's
general partner is Peter Malkin of New York, whose extensive
holdings include investments in the Empire State Building.
</P>
<P>
   The 440,000-square-foot 1180 Raymond Blvd., which the
Cogswell-Lehman partners bought for just under $3 million, is to be
converted from offices to a 915-bed student dormitory.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Stern, a partner at Cogswell, said he was discussing
customizing sections of the building to meet their needs with
officials of the city's five institutions of higher learning _ the
city's Rutgers campus, Seton Hall Law School, the New Jersey
Institute of Technology, the New Jersey University of Medicine and
Dentistry and Essex County College.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is easy to take potshots at Newark, which everyone was
writing off as a dead city in 1990 and 1991,'' said Stern. ``But
the perception is changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Witkoff, president of Witkoff Group, a real-estate
investment concern based in New York, bought Gateway II, an
occupied Class A building, last May from Townsend Co. of Towson,
Md. Witkoff is under contract to buy the other three buildings
totaling 1.26 million square feet at the Gateway complex.
</P>
<P>
   Though Witkoff declined to say how much he would pay for the
buildings, he said it was less than the reported $175 million
asking price. Prudential is selling the buildings as part of a plan
announced a few years ago to sell the properties it owns and invest
the proceeds in more liquid real estate, such as shares in REITs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've bought the best buildings in Newark and if the tide goes
up we go up with it,'' Witkoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other buyers of downtown Newark buildings in recent
months were Read Properties of Newark, which bought the
485,000-square-foot 24 Commerce St. for $2.3 million, and Townsend,
which bought for $12 million the half-vacant, 380,000-square-foot
former headquarters of Blue Cross/Blue Shield of New Jersey at 33
Washington St.
</P>
<P>
   And at the end of the year Kushner Cos. of Florham Park is
expected to close on the purchase of the 440,000-square-foot
headquarters of Mutual Benefit Life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says something that at a time when the capital market has
shifted from institutions to private banks, which have upped the
ante, there are still investors who believe in Newark,'' said
Dudley Ryan, senior vice president at the Teaneck office of the
CB/Richard Ellis real-estate brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   Other investments are being made in downtown Newark. Rutgers is
building a new law school and construction has begun on a
6,700-seat minor-league baseball stadium. Some $10 million in
public funds is in place for work this summer on the initial phase
of what eventually will be a 1.75-mile esplanade along the Passaic
River as well as on the first phase of a $175 million light-rail
line linking downtown to Newark International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The activity has helped encourage new investors, whose arrival
is significant in a long-overlooked city where schools are
substandard and unemployment, though lower than a few years ago, is
still high _ 11 percent in 1997 (the latest figure available),
compared with 16.6 percent in 1991, according to state data.
</P>
<P>
   Other encouraging factors include the growing influence of
public-private partnerships willing to promote development and the
city's newly established downtown Special Improvement District,
which includes the performing arts center. The district allows
property owners to tax themselves and spend the money on services
such as extra security forces and more frequent garbage pickups.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a sense that residents are beginning to believe
that change is possible. Until recently, said Raphael Gesumaria, a
retired medical secretary who has always lived in Newark and raised
her two daughters in the same North Ward house she grew up in, ``I
stayed away from downtown because there was no place for me to shop
and I didn't feel safe. Now I go to Broad Street to shop and twice
a week I volunteer at the arts center.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the arts center had brought positive attention to the
city. ``I saw Newark when it thrived and when it died,'' she said.
``I have hope.''
</P>
<P>
   But what is most important for investors is that Newark offers
substantial old office buildings at prices that are cheap compared
with much of the metropolitan area. It is also a city that offers
tax incentives and other sweeteners to developers who help in its
revival program.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is if enough tenants will follow to fill the
renovated space. Newark can still be a tough sell because ``tenants
are still skeptical,'' said Richard Mirliss, a broker at the West
Orange office of Grubb &AMP; Ellis. ``The arts center has been a big
positive,'' he said, but ``there has been a lot of talk about
redevelopment for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Now there is even more talk, including a proposal for a
basketball arena and soccer stadium for the New Jersey Nets and New
Jersey Metro Stars, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Another proposal calls for portions of eight blocks along Broad
Street, one block in to Halsey Street, between Cedar Street and
Central Avenue to be transformed into a Greenwich Village-like
streetscape with housing and office space over shops.
</P>
<P>
   The redevelopment would link the business district to the arts
center to the north and the University Heights neighborhood to the
west. Such linkages, analysts, developers and city officials say,
are needed for the downtown revival to spill into the rest of
Newark.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit group pushing the linkage plan, the New Newark
Foundation, is led by Raymond Chambers, a philanthropist and Newark
native who is considered a prime mover behind the city's revival.
(He, along with other investors, also owns 19 percent of the Nets
and has made it clear he wants to bring the team to Newark.)
</P>
<P>
   The foundation has control of about eight acres between Broad
and Halsey streets and hopes to start implementing the plan to
redevelop that property into a mix of uses within a year, said Mort
Goldfein, the group's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The former Hahne's department store, part of the assemblage,
sits across Broad Street from the arts center and is a focal point
of the plan. City officials said discussions were under way with
Continental Airlines to rent two of the building's upper floors for
use by flight attendants, bringing people to the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to continue to create a draw for the downtown, that
brings people to the city and gets them walking on the streets,''
said Faiella. Such projects, he said, will not solve all the ills
downtown or in the rest of the city, which, James emphasized, have
not been ignored.
</P>
<P>
   As examples of investment outside the downtown core, the mayor
pointed to projects under way or expected to start in the next six
months near Newark International Airport. They range from a
100,000-square-foot warehouse/distribution building rising in the
South Ward to Coca-Cola's plan to start construction this spring on
a 425,000-square-foot service, production and distribution complex
on 50 acres.
</P>
<P>
   And Hartz Mountain Industries of Secaucus expects to begin
construction at a cost of $85 million this summer on two hotels,
with a total of 800 rooms and a 50,000-square-foot conference
center on 55 acres near the airport. The site will be linked to the
airport's monorail system, as well as to the planned light-rail
system to downtown. ``Our perspective is that Newark has turned
around,'' said Emanuel Stern, president of Hartz.
</P>
<P>
   And early next year, James said, the city will turn its
attention to the construction of market-rate housing, up to 1,000
two-family homes in the neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   A key to the success of these plans is what happens downtown.
``A lot of balloons are being floated,'' said Dean Hughes, ``and
many may never see the light of day, but Newark has no choice but
to follow that road and try to build on the momentum of the arts
center. Now is an opportune time for the city to pull the pieces
together and make its core work as an office node.''
</P>
<P>
   But getting the revival to spill into ``the balance of the city
so residents benefit is the real challenge,'' said Dean Hughes, who
noted, ``That has not yet happened in any American city that has
fallen has far as Newark.''
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Newark began its slide in the 1960s as the middle-class
exodus and poor economy drained commerce from its once vibrant
core. That exodus was followed by a long caravan of retailers,
including Macy's, which closed its doors in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1980s a wave of renewal helped create a swath of
glass-walled office towers, including the Gateway complex. But the
Gateway Complex did little to reclaim the neighborhood, given the
aerial bridges that connect it to Penn Station, easing safety
concerns but keeping workers off city streets. The last downtown
office building was completed in 1991, before the recession hit and
the market soured.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the market has regained some strength, many of the new
office investors are betting on Newark and are courting tenants.
But while Prudential continues to look for more space, there has
not been a stampede of other users into the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commitments from the larger companies in the city have
absorbed most of the class A space and those following suit now
have to look at the secondary space,'' said Eisen of Cushman &AMP;
Wakefield. Mirliss added that back-office users who want to beat
New York rents might also start to drift to Newark. ``If not Jersey
City, why not Newark?'' he asked rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that is starting to happen. McCarter &AMP; English, a large
law firm, has leased 35,000 square feet of space to expand into
1100 Raymond Blvd., a mostly vacant 467,360-square-foot building
just across the street from the Gateway complex, where the firm is
based.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations are under way at 1100 Raymond Blvd. with office
users that would take a total of 70,000 square feet, as well as
with retailers, said Jerald Kaufman, one of the building's owners.
The structure is now being renovated.
</P>
<P>
   A few New York companies have been drawn to Newark because of
the lower rents, Among them is LZA Group, a large engineering and
architectural firm that leased a floor at 24 Commerce St. and is
planning to expand into a second, said Robert Wolf, president of
Read Properties, the owner. Wolf said his company, which bought the
building in August, was targeting small tenants who are priced out
of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications firms, including the giant WorldCom, recently
leased a total of 300,000 square feet, much of it to set up
switching stations, on the upper floors of the former
1.2-million-square-foot Macy's building at 165 Halsey St., which
was bought 18 months ago by Market-Halsey Urban Renewal of New
York. The company has leased the ground floor to 14 retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect Newark to boom overnight,'' said Sam Jemal, a
Market-Halsey principal. ``Like Wall Street, the streets at the
shopping area go desolate at 7 p.m. It will be a slow climb back,
and that is healthier.''

 TRYING TO MAKE A BLEAK WATERFRONT INTO A HARLEM RIVER PARK
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The elegant Robert F. Wagner Jr. esplanade along the
Harlem River stops cold at 125th Street _ no more antique lights,
no railing, no benches. What relentlessly unfolds as one keeps
walking north is an almost surreal industrial wasteland. An
enormous pile of road salt gives way to an abandoned concrete plant
surrounded by hundreds of tons of asphalt chunks.
</P>
<P>
   The dreary riverfront is littered with burned-out automobiles,
rusted oil drums and empty bottles. There is a small encampment of
homeless people.
</P>
<P>
   In place of this desolation, people have long imagined a
waterfront park beside the river from 125th to 145th streets. A
plan was actually drawn up in 1991 at the behest of Ruth Messinger,
then the Manhattan borough president. But administrations changed,
and other projects claimed priority.
</P>
<P>
   Now the plan, with a price estimated at $15 million, is
resurfacing _ albeit slowly and in smaller stages. The City Parks
and Recreation Department has assembled $1.9 million, including
$1.1 million in federal transportation funds, to build a segment of
the park from 135th to 139th streets and is completing final plans.
It is also applying for more money to build the segment between
139th and 142nd streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be done; the question is, when?'' Parks Commissioner
Henry Stern said. ``Why not do it sooner, rather than later?''
</P>
<P>
   Stern said he has been fighting for a Harlem River park since
the 1960s, when, as assistant to the Manhattan borough president,
he urged the city to forbid the construction of a concrete plant
between 128th and 131st Streets.
</P>
<P>
   There is good reason to be optimistic about the area's chances
for renewal, despite its desolation, Stern said. Unlike many other
suggested sites for city parks, he said, this stretch of the Harlem
River has no developers clamoring for it. He added that the City
Sanitation and Transportation Departments were willing to remove
the piles of salt and asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   But finding almost $15 million to build the entire park remains
a major stumbling block.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, a variety of conservation and civic organizations
are urging the state to pick up at least part of the tab under the
1996 environmental bond act.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To demonstrate their concern, members of the Audubon Society,
the Parks Council and Civitas, an Upper East Side community
organization, marched through steady rain on Thursday morning .
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can attract some bond act money, we can cobble together
more funding from other sources,'' said Linda Davidoff, executive
director of the League of Conservation Voters, which organized the
march.
</P>
<P>
   The advocates want the revived park plan to be something like
the original design. The 1991 plan envisioned features like
crescent-shaped concrete beaches with beach chairs, barbecue areas
and green shade structures. Swimming would not be permitted, though
sprinklers would spray cool water.
</P>
<P>
   An esplanade would separate the beaches from the river. It would
be designed to look like a tidal zone, with rounded rocks, pebbles
and tidal pools. A trail for jogging and bicycling would run the
length of the park. Tall beacons would mark the end points of the
avenues that end at the water.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Laird, planning director for the parks department, said
the department was trying to do just that. C. Virginia Fields, the
Manhattan borough president, has met with Stern to discuss the
park, Laird said.
</P>
<P>
   Laird said the current approach was a no-frills version of the
1991 design, delaying features like the beaches. A major goal will
be to construct the bikeway along the full length of the park as
early as possible, to establish a constituency and identity for the
park, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said it was time to begin developing parks on the east
side of Manhattan. New parks have been built around Battery Park
City on the Hudson, and the huge new Hudson River Park is under
construction. ``We want to do as much for the waterfront facing the
Bronx as we've done for the one facing New Jersey,'' he said.

 &HT;    A DAY FOR THE HISTORY BOOKS
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Robert Hurt drove 32 straight hours with his
pregnant wife and their 10 children to see the House impeach
President Clinton on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a historic moment,'' explained Hurt, who is from near
Kerrville in southwestern Texas. ``We're conservative, and this is
the answer to a lot of prayers and hard work. We feel like it's the
fruit of our labors.''
</P>
<P>
   In triumph or in tears, hundreds flocked to the Capitol on a
raw, gray day to witness the first impeachment of an elected
president since the nation's founding 222 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For once, the drama lived up to expectations. This truly was a
day for the history books.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the House was gaveled to order at 9 a.m., first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton made an emotional visit to Capitol Hill to
rally Democratic House members.
</P>
<P>
   ``She talked about the fact that she believed we were all
American citizens, and that as citizens we live in a constitutional
country, and that the process should be done right and that up to
now it has not been,'' House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of
Missouri said after the closed session.
</P>
<P>
   For any who may have wondered how the sex scandal had affected
her marriage, she had an answer: ``I love and care deeply about my
husband.''
</P>
<P>
   But as events unfolded, Mrs. Clinton's visit soon became a
footnote.
</P>
<P>
   For once, members filled the House chamber beneath the skylight
emblazoned with an American eagle and the motto ``E Pluribus Unum''
_ ``Out of Many, One.'' But contrary to that spirit, partisanship
reigned on this day.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats quickly set the tone by demanding a roll call vote on
the approval of the previous day's journal, a procedural annoyance
often employed by a piqued minority.
</P>
<P>
   The mood was already dark when Speaker-designate Bob Livingston
strode to the well to speak for impeachment. The room was hushed,
for everyone wanted to know what the lanky Republican leader from
Louisiana would say about his own recent confession to marital
infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   Near the conclusion of his speech, Livingston urged the
president to spare the country the anguish of a Senate trial. ``I
say that you have the power to terminate that damage and heal the
wounds that you have created,'' he said. ``You sir, may resign your
post.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were ready with a response. ``No. No. No,'' they
chanted. ``You resign. You resign. You resign.''
</P>
<P>
   And to the shock of the assemblage, that's what he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only challenge you in such fashion that I am willing to
heed my own words,'' Livingston continued. ``I must set the example
that I hope President Clinton will follow. I will not stand for
speaker of the House ...''
</P>
<P>
   First there was silence. Then Democrats and Republicans rose as
one with respectful applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very dramatic. It was very shocking. It brought tears
to my eyes,'' said Marian Hunter of Richmond, Va., watched from the
visitors gallery. ``It took me a moment to grasp what he was
saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Other spectators said the man who won't be speaker had made his
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think President Clinton should follow Bob Livingston's
example,'' said Christian Adams of Columbia, S.C. ``Bob Livingston
has honor. Bill Clinton has none.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the final House votes on Clinton's fate could begin,
however, the Republicans needed to defeat a Democratic attempt to
substitute a censure motion for the four articles of impeachment.
When they did, the Democrats stood and walked out in an
orchestrated protest.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats straggled down the east steps of the Capitol and
then assembled behind their leaders like a high school band trying
to get into formation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are deeply offended by this process,'' Gephardt began,
before being drowned out by catcalls by pro-impeachment protestors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go back in and do your job,'' shouted one.
</P>
<P>
   And within eight minutes, they did return to the House chamber
to vote on the first impeachment article. It was approved, 228-206,
and President Clinton had been impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, people listened on transistor radios.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very sad for the country,'' said Molly Jones of
Washington. ``I hope and pray the president won't think of
resigning.''
</P>
<P>
   But Curtis Stafford of Woodbridge, Va., thought differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came for the historic vote today,'' he said. ``I think they
did the right thing and I'm glad they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike O'Grady had come from Arlington, Va., to show his support
for Clinton. On his shoulders rode his 4-year-old daughter,
Kaitlin, wearing a Santa hat and waving an American flag. He pushed
Brittany, 2, in a stroller.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the Capitol, O'Grady sighed at the events of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish they'd focus on some issues that would help my
kids,'' he said.

CAPITOL SCENE ONE OF MIXED PURSUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Representative Jon Christenson, a Nebraska
Republican, was not worried about criticism that his party was
overreaching in impeaching President Clinton. Nor was he bothered
by the seeming implosion of the House after Speaker-elect Robert L.
Livingston shocked his party by resigning after admitting
extramarital affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel this will go down as a day when adultery is
wrong,'' Christenson said, applauding Livingston's decision to step
aside and urging the president to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   But all around Christenson, who stood amid a phalanx of
reporters in the elegant Speaker's Lobby, other House members
seemed to have been stunned.
</P>
<P>
   Some members sought to spin on a dime and put the day's events
in a positive light.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Charles Rangel, a New York Democrat, expressed
disbelief at the way he said the GOP right wing was devouring the
rest of the party. ``Is there going to be a marriage fidelity test
for the next candidate?'' Rangel asked.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans quickly came out to proclaim they played no role in
Livingston's action. ``There was no coup,'' said Representative
Donald Manzullo, Republican of Illinois. Still, he sounded
appreciative, saying,``What Livingston did is what people in the
corporate world would have done.''
</P>
<P>
   The analogy seemed apt, as the carefully suited and coifed men
and women of the House went about their work with grim
determination of bankers at a corporate takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Capitol, however, a slice of the 1960s sprawled onto
the lawns and the sidewalks, as several thousand protesters with
varying views gathered to mark the historic moment. The Capitol
``triangle,'' a patch of lawn outside the House, was turned into a
Washington version of Speaker's Corner, with people loudly arguing
with one another about whether Clinton should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are spending all our money talking about sex,'' yelled
elementary school teacher Matthew Meyer. ``I have third and fourth
grade students who can't read. We need the money!''
</P>
<P>
   This prompted a protester to interject: ``We already pay enough
taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we pay enough taxes. But my member of Congress can't
even vote,'' Meyer said, referring to District of Columbia delegate
Eleanor Holmes Norton, who is allowed to participate in House
debate but has no vote on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, two people yelled back and forth about the basis for the
impeachment articles. ``It came out of a civil suit,'' a Clinton
defender said, as television camera operators ran to film the
ongoing debate. ``It came out of a lie,'' an impeachment proponent
responded.
</P>
<P>
   Back inside the Capitol, the expected outcome of the impeachment
vote led many members to focus on Livingston's surprise
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Richard H. Baker, a Lousiana Republican, wondered
aloud how Livingston's private affairs became public. Alluding to
an ad placed by the publisher of Hustler magazine, which sought
information about affairs by members of Congress, Baker asked:
``Why did Larry Flynt place that ad during the impeachment
hearings?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've ever seen a week like this,'' said
Representative Donald Payne, a New Jersey Democrat, referring to
the simultaneous impeachment of a president, the bombing of Iraq,
and the Livingston resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Earier in the day, Democrats were briefly buoyed by the
appearance of Hillary Rodham Clinton, who urged them at a party
meeting to stand by her husband.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 a.m., the debate began on the floor, with most Democrats
urging censure and most Republicans backing impeachment. Then, with
no advance warning to his colleagues, Livingston took the floor.
</P>
<P>
   At first, it seemed as though Livingston was making just another
speech urging Clinton to step down. ``You, sir, may resign your
post,'' Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no!'' cried dozens of Democrats. Then, things got a bit
nasty, as some Democrats began to catcall and said to Livingston:
``You resign!''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, who just weeks ago was elected to replace House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, then announced, ``I must set the example
that I hope President Clinton will follow. I will not stand for
speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, the House was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to stop destroying imperfect people at the altar of an
unobtainable morality,'' said House minority leader Richard
Gephardt. House majority whip Tom DeLay, a major force behind the
impeachment case, seemed near tears.
</P>
<P>
   In the public galleries, hundreds of tourists didn't quite know
what to make of it all. They had come to witness the historic
impeachment of a president, and instead witnessed the political
immolation of a speaker-elect. ``This is a day I'll always
remember,'' said one tourist, Matthew O'Steen of Savannah, Ga.

PROTESTERS MAKE POINT AT POST OFFICE

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ It was an act of defiance.
</P>
<P>
   They knew their packages addressed to Iraq would not be
accepted. Still, the protesters stood in line Saturday at the
Central Square Post Office, along with people buying stamps and
mailing Christmas packages decorated with wreaths and smiling
Santas.
</P>
<P>
   The 20 brown-paper-wrapped packages each bore a label plainly
describing its contents: Children's Aspirin, Medical Journals,
Water, Dried Fruit, Milk, Bandages, School Books, Pens and Pencils.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, each package was rejected by postal clerks, who
politely noted that United Nations economic sanctions prohibit
mailing packages to Iraq that weigh more than 12 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   The orderly protesters retrieved the boxes and rerouted them,
some to US Senators Edward M. Kennedy and John F. Kerry, others to
President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeline Albright, with a
request that they be forwarded to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the busy Post Office, some 300 activists decried the
bombing of Iraq and called for an end to the eight-year-old
sanctions that have left the country with shortages of medicine,
clean water, and other basics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do we think dropping bombs on people and denying them
medicine will make them like the United States?'' asked Jennifer
Horan, 38, a volunteer for the Cambridge-based Campaign for the
Iraqi People. ``If we are so afraid of terrorism, then what better
way to foster it than starve people and deprive them of medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   The UN imposed economic sanctions on Iraq after its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990. A UN Security Council resolution then barred any UN
member country from trading with Iraq. The only exception is the
``oil for food'' deal begun in 1996, which permits Iraq to sell a
small fraction of its oil for food and medicine. The sanctions will
remain in place until Iraq complies fully with UN weapons
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi leaders blame the sanctions for food shortages,
malnutrition, and premature deaths.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF estimates that more than 1 million children under age 5,
nearly one-third of the youngsters that age in Iraq, are
chronically malnourished.
</P>
<P>
   Signe Taylor, 33, who interviewed Iraqi families in 1992 for a
documentary film about the impact of the Persian Gulf War and the
sanctions, said: ``It's tragic. Children are dying from man-made
causes, not from something like a natural disaster. It's something
we can control. And it's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Diener, 34, who carried a sign that read, ``Don't Wag the
Dog,'' said, ``I think Clinton is trying to cover up his abuse of
power in the bedroom by abusing power in the war room.''

<P>
   ST. REGIS MOHAWK RESERVATION, N.Y. _ It was the kind of
smuggling operation that, at its most efficient, resembled a
well-coached relay team seamlessly passing a valuable baton.
</P>
<P>
   In China, smugglers would load their cargo on airplanes bound
for Toronto or Vancouver. Associates in Canada would drive the
cargo in vans with tinted windows to this weathered rural Indian
reservation, which straddles Canada and the United States. The
smugglers would hire Indians or other locals to transport the cargo
by powerboat for a two-minute sprint across the cold, swirling St.
Lawrence River. And waiting on the opposite shore would be another
van, sometimes driven by another Indian, to take the cargo to New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had it down to a science, whether crossing by daylight or
by night,'' said Michael McLaughlin, assistant district director of
investigations for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
``You're talking eight, 10, 15 people a trip, three or four times a
week.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin was referring not to the smugglers, but to the cargo:
Chinese nationals determined to sneak into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, authorities say, smugglers funneled
more than 3,600 illegal Chinese immigrants through the Indian
reservation here, exploiting the region's complicated geographical
and jurisdictional anatomy. For the smugglers, it was a lucrative,
low-risk endeavor that could take as little as a few days, from
Point A, in Fujian province in China, to Point Z, in Chinatown. For
the aliens, it was a life-altering odyssey marked by paranoia,
hunger and hope.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, U.S. and Canadian authorities announced that
they had cracked the smuggling ring, arresting 35 people, including
several Indians, and indicting a dozen others. And in so doing,
they shed light on an operation that had become, quietly and almost
invisibly, an increasingly popular route for those smuggling
Chinese nationals.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, the crackdown has brought attention to
an insular community that has long been branded as a silent partner
for smugglers trafficking in the latest profitable commodity, be it
cigarettes, liquor or immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that most of the 8,000 people on this rugged,
wind-swept reservation do not smuggle. Many did not even know that
the Chinese operation existed. Still, many of the Indians have a
tremendous capacity to forgive, saying that in a hardscrabble place
where unemployment is 30 percent, a person's decision to smuggle
must be framed in economic, not legal or moral, terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't do it, but I understand the concept,'' said an
unemployed social worker who was eating at the popular Bear's Den
restaurant on the American side. ``It's all about survival. If you
have three kids, and you have to pay the rent, and someone says
that all you've got to do is `Drive here, drive there, make a few
thousand dollars,' I can see why you'd do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Split evenly between the Akwesasne Reserve on the Canadian side,
and the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation on the American side, the
reservation is a jurisdictional jigsaw puzzle covering about 22
square miles in two countries, two provinces (Ontario and Quebec)
and one state (New York).
</P>
<P>
   It is a place where the game of hide-and-seek is stacked against
the seeker. There are more than a dozen islands on either side of
the border, plus hundreds of coves and dozens of dirt roads leading
to the St. Lawrence River. Abandoned farmhouses and shacks dot the
flat terrain, which is stubbled with wheat fields and blanketed by
oaks and evergreens. Street lights are dim and sparse.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, smugglers have often ushered illegal immigrants _
many from India, Pakistan or Poland _ through the reservation
without much difficulty. These have usually been unorganized
operations, run by freelancers in an anything-goes environment in
which an illegal immigrant could almost ask someone, on the spot,
for a boat ride to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese smugglers, though, are different.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese are well organized,'' said Dick Ashlaw, patrol
agent in charge of the U.S. Border Patrol in Massena, N.Y. ``And
the Chinese aliens are more terrified than the other aliens.
They're petrified.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement authorities said the Chinese smugglers would
recruit young, and mostly male, farmhands and laborers in Fujian,
promising a prosperous life in America for an admission fee of
$47,000 per person.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, the smugglers would secure forged travel
documents. Sometimes the Chinese would be shipped directly to
Canada; other times, they would travel through another country,
like Germany, Morocco or Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Once in Canada, they would be crammed into safe houses in
Toronto; these were usually apartments or cheap motels. Smugglers
would buy street clothes for the Chinese to help them blend in. The
smugglers would also instruct the Chinese to avoid doing or saying
anything that might jeopardize the operation _ or else risk harm to
their families in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a jail,'' said a businessman in Chinatown who has
talked to some aliens and who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
``They had no freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, the smugglers would arrange for the aliens to be driven in
a minivan from Toronto to Cornwall, an industrial city bordering
the Indian reservation. The trip took about four hours.
</P>
<P>
   The smugglers would usually drive to Cornwall Island on the
Canadian side of the territory _ an island that can be reached
before one hits the customs and immigration checkpoints on the
Cornwall International Bridge. The van would then stop at the end
of any number of long hidden driveways leading to the water.
Quietly, quickly, the Chinese would get out of the van and into 18-
to 24-foot powerboats that could squeeze in eight to 24 people,
said Cpl. Norm Turcotte of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
</P>
<P>
   After a quick dash across the river, the Chinese would jump out
of the boat, and into another van. Then the van would speed away,
usually heading east on Route 37 toward the Gov. Thomas Dewey
Thruway.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For driving the boat, the Indians would receive about $500 or so
per immigrant, and perhaps double that if he played chauffeur to
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Weather permitting, these were usually evening appointments. But
during the winter, when the river froze over, smugglers would often
take a snowmobile, hitch a trailer to the back, pack the Chinese
inside and drive across the river at all hours. Again, all in a
matter of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not here that long,'' said Wesley Benedict, chief of
police of the St. Regis Mohawk Tribal Police Department. ``They
don't walk around on the streets, or go into restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course, there were also times when things would go awry,
when the smugglers would be delayed by botched logistics and police
sightings. If they were lucky, the Chinese would stay in bunk beds
in someone's cellar, or in cheap motels in Cornwall or Massena. If
not, they would be forced to stay in dilapidated farmhouses,
trailers or other shelter for a few days, said Police Chief Lewis
Mitchell of the Akwesasne Mohawk Police, on the Canadian side.
</P>
<P>
   Those who became too cold, hungry or frustrated would wander the
streets, looking for a ride to New York. But they didn't get very
far.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, for instance, the U.S. Border Patrol picked
up four Chinese women in their early 20s who had been abandoned by
smugglers. A smuggler in New York later posted $40,000 bond to win
their release, and their case is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, smuggling by air still remains the preferred choice,
said Peter Kwong, author of ``Forbidden Workers: Illegal Chinese
Immigrants and American Labor'' (The New Press, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, the Akwesasne route has become an
increasingly popular alternative, as evidenced by the growth in
arrests of Chinese immigrants trying to cross the border. American
authorities arrested 94 in 1998, up from 38 the year before _
making the Chinese the leading nationality to be smuggled, Ashlaw
said.
</P>
<P>
   None of this would be possible, of course, without local
assistance. And while most Indians and law enforcement officers
insist that only a small number participate, and that the topic of
smuggling is unfairly soiling the reservation's reputation, the
fact remains that the Chinese have never had any problems finding
help.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, many residents of the reservation said that while
they did not condone smuggling, they did not condemn the smugglers,
either. Most smugglers, they say, are young and desperate, just
trying to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Jacobs, manager of a gift shop on the American side of the
reservation, knows a luckless married couple who were arrested on
charges of smuggling two weeks ago. ``They were just trying to keep
it going, and they decided to play the game,'' she said softly.
``It's hard, especially because there's no work right now.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, more people are supplying police with tips
about immigrant smuggling. And law enforcement officials say that
such cooperation, coupled with better coordination among the
various governmental agencies, contributed to the recent arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, law enforcement officials say that catching one in 10
illegal immigrants would be a coup.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, two senior patrol agents, Dan Witkop and Ken
Studlack, allowed two reporters to accompany them on their evening
shift. It was routine at first, as the agents checked in with
Benedict's police department, crisscrossed the reservation, peered
into minivans, checked license plates.
</P>
<P>
   But at 10 p.m. or so, the agents were informed of a suspicious
man of Polish extraction who said he wanted to cross the border and
head for a bar in Massena. This was notable, the agents said,
because the night before, American authorities had picked up two
illegal immigrants from Poland who were wandering on Route 37.
</P>
<P>
   So for the next two hours, the agents, in an unmarked car,
followed the man. And at first, he pulled into Bob's Motel, whose
owner was recently indicted on charges of transporting an
immigrant. After a few minutes, the man left, pulled into a gas
station, stopped at a bar for a few minutes but did not get out of
the car, then returned to the motel. He checked in, and turned off
the lights.
</P>
<P>
   Did he know he was being followed? Was he supposed to pick up an
illegal immigrant en route to New York? Or was he just a bad driver
who got lost at every turn?
</P>
<P>
   The agents never found out; they waited a couple of more hours
and decided to call it a night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' said Witkop, ``maybe next time.''

H.S. RUNNERS CHRISTEN NEW INDOOR TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Will be led; meet is running behind schedule.) 
 (nk) 
 By WILLIAM J. MILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More than 4,000 boys and girls from 181 Eastern high
schools christened the newly &UR;  &LR; installed $600,000 Mondo 200-meter
banked indoor track on Saturday at the Armory Track and Field
Center in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan. The occasion
was the 45th annual Bishop Loughlin Games, said to be the largest
high school indoor track meet in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Norb Sander, who has spearheaded the drive to make the
former National Guard Armory the Mecca of indoor track in the East,
regarded Saturday's meet as a good test of what he and its Italian
builders claim will be ``the world's fastest indoor track.''
</P>
<P>
   It is constructed with an Olympic-quality Super X surface with
banked turns laid down on the former flat Mondo track at the Armory
with 11 inches of wood beneath it all, Sander said. Most indoor
tracks, according to the builder, are placed on concrete floors or
hard floors.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the track a new Finish Lynx computerized scoring
system has been installed, allowing spectators to view results
immediately after the completion of each event. There are more than
60 meets scheduled for the center in 1998-1999, ranging from Police
Athletic League competition to the New York Sports Museum
Collegiate Invitational on Jan. 16 with entries from Ohio State,
Villanova, Oklahoma and George Mason.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's competition the huge fields in each event caused
the meet to be two hours behind schedule in the boys division alone
with the girls events to follow. The meet was originally scheduled
to be conducted over a 10-hour period.
</P>
<P>
   In early boys events, Ali Abiola of St. Peter's in Staten
Island, nipped his senior teammate Rolondo Ortiz at the finish in
the 1,000-meter run and posted a meet record of 2 minutes 31.07
seconds. Ortiz, who led from the start with a fast 2:02.4 first 800
meters, also topped the previous record of 2:32.4 in finishing
second in 2:31.09.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Morgan, a senior from Lawrence on Long Island, also
registered a fast time over the new track in the 600-meter run,
which he won easily in 1:21.50; Joshua Wilson of Brooklyn's Boys
and Girls was runner-up in 1:23.50. Morgan missed the meet mark set
last year by Sean Jeffers of Boys and Girls by only two-tenths of a
second. Noel Parnell of Philadelphia's Roman Catholic sprinted to a
55-meter dash victory in 6.54 seconds.

NO PROHIBITION AGAINST WAR DURING RAMADAN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite President Clinton's desire not to launch attacks on Iraq
during Ramadan, there is nothing in Islamic law that prohibits
warfare during Islam's holiest month, some religious scholars said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue about not attacking during Ramadan is only
important in the administration's mind, because there's absolutely
nothing in Islam that says you can't have a war during Ramadan,''
said Yvonee Haddad, a professor of the history of Islam and
Christian-Muslim relations at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   Ramadan, which begins this weekend, celebrates the divine
revelation of the opening sections of the Koran, Islam's sacred
text, to the prophet Mohammed. Fasting from dawn to sunset during
the month-long observance is one of the five pillars, or
obligations, of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Along with fasting, the world's 1 billion Muslims are also
required to observe the holy month by abstaining from smoking,
liquids, and sex from dawn to dusk as a sign of purification and
sacrifice. Ramadan ends with Id al-Fitr, the feast of the breaking
of the fast, one of the biggest Muslim celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Ramadan's special significance _ it is specifically
mentioned in the Koran _ Haddad noted that, Iran and Iraq, two
predominantly Muslim nations, waged war in the 1980s during the
month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   But other Islamic specialists said that even if it is not
forbidden by religious law, bombing Iraq on Ramadan could still be
regarded by Muslims as being highly disrespectful because it is
considered an especially sacred period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attention, the effort, and energy of Muslims is very much
directed toward Ramadan,'' said Denis Sullivan, an associate
professor of political science and a Middle East specialist at
Northeastern University. ``To have that experience of faith
violated by non-Muslims, especially by the United States, is really
a complete and total denigration of that month.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Muslim organizations in the United States, while not
necessarily supportive of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, have been
critical, for political and not religious reasons, of the US
assault on Iraq .
</P>
<P>
   ``This assault does not lend credibility to undermining the
Iraqi regime's perceived threat to its neighboring states as well
as the world community,'' said a statement released Saturday by the
Washington-based American Muslim Council.
</P>
<P>
   Another Washington-based group, the Council on American-Islamic
Relations, said the bombings along with the continuing US economic
sanctions against Iraq will exacerbate a ``humanitarian disaster
that includes vastly increased rates of malnutrition, disease, and
infant deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Islam follows the lunar calendar, which is shorter than
the solar calendar, the dates of Ramadan change every year. The
start of Ramadan depends on the date of the new moon, based on
stringent Islamic astrological guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim countries begin and end the month on a different day,
based on when their clerics determine a new moon to be sighted. In
the Boston area, Muslims are expected to begin their Ramadan fast
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to some misconceptions, the majority of the world's
Muslims are not in the Middle East and are not Arab. According to
Muslim scholars, the country with the largest number of Muslims is
Indonesia, followed by Pakistan, Bangladesh, and India.

PENTAGON UPGRADES SUCCESS RATE OF ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon Saturday sharply upgraded its estimate
of how much damage US-led air strikes have inflicted on Saddam
Hussein's military power, leaving open the possibility that the
bombing might soon stop.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, though, many targets _ including those related to
Hussein's nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons program _ have
been only lightly damaged, and several others have not been
attacked at all.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen said Saturday at the
Pentagon's daily news conference, that the impeachment vote in the
House would have no effect on the operation. ``He's still the
commander-in-chief,'' Cohen said. ``We're going to continue to act
accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   As the fourth night of bombing got under way, Cohen claimed the
attacks have ``substantially degraded'' the Iraqi leader's ability
to wage war.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Henry H. Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
declared himself ``very pleased with the results'' and noted
``significant success.''
</P>
<P>
   The upbeat words were explicitly meant to reverse the glum
impression of Friday's news briefing, when Cohen said he was merely
``satisfied'' and Shelton allowed that ``not all'' the strikes had
``gone according to plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the brighter picture, other officers said, was due to
the results of Friday night's ferocious barrage of bombs and cruise
missiles, some of which re-struck targets that they had missed or
just lightly damaged before.
</P>
<P>
   Part of it was also due to revisions by intelligence analysts,
who, one day earlier, had not had time to examine spy-satellite
photos of all the targets.
</P>
<P>
   As of Saturday morning, US and British bombs and missiles had
attacked a total of 97 targets and done at least some damage to all
of them.
</P>
<P>
   This marked an advance over the day before, when a total of 89
targets had been attacked, of which 12 received no damage.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 cruise missiles, each costing nearly $1 million, have
been fired so far from B-52 bombers and ships at sea. An untold
number of laser-guided bombs, but probably at least 300, have also
been dropped by F-14 and F-18 combat planes flying off the USS
Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Only cruise missiles have so far been used over Baghdad,
reflecting the US commanders' extreme caution in this operation.
Officials Saturday said no planes have yet been downed.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, top US officials have said the goal of
Operation Desert Fox is to ``degrade'' and ``diminish'' Hussein's
ability to threaten his neighbors with chemical, nuclear, or
biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen Saturday uttered both of those magic words, saying the
attack has ``substantially degraded'' his warfighting capabilities
and has ``diminished'' his ability to threaten his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   While the secretary declined to declare the mission
accomplished, his words did appear to give his president the option
to make such a declaration if he so desired.
</P>
<P>
   Asked when the air strikes might end, Cohen replied, with almost
circular logic, ``The operation is going to continue until the
president decides it has been completed.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Pentagon reveals more about what kinds of targets are
being hit and not hit, Operation Desert Fox is coming to look less
like a comprehensive attack on Saddam Hussein's ability to make
weapons of mass destruction _ and more like an attempt to
destabilize his grip on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the air strikes have been aimed at Hussein's private
security apparatus, the transmitters that let him communicate with
soldiers in the south of Iraq, and his intelligence headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen has denied that destabilization is the operation's goal.
However, he acknowledged that would certainly be a ``consequence''
of degrading Hussein's military power.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, key elements of what officials say is the main target
_ Hussein's ability to make chemical, nuclear, and biological
weapons _ are going untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen acknowledged Saturday that ``dual-use'' facilities _
plants that produce both chemical weapons and civilian products _
are not being attacked at all, in order to avoid hurting the Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
   It is generally believed dual-use facilities are the only
chemical sites remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Sites that may be producing nuclear and biological weapons are
also absent from the target-list, if they exist at all.
</P>
<P>
   Air strikes have been mounted, however, on sites believed to be
developing and building the missiles that could deliver these
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   As of Saturday morning, the Pentagon claimed to have attacked 11
such sites, inflicting severe damage on one, moderate damage on
five, and light damage on one. The strikes have not destroyed any.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gen. Thomas Wilson, the Joint Staff's intelligence
director, said Saturday that the strikes have set back Iraq's
ability to build long-range missiles by ``at least a year.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that official bomb-damage assessments are ``very
conservative.'' For example, when spy-satellite photos were taken
of the federal building that was blown up in Oklahoma City several
years ago, the assessors deemed the damage to be ``moderate.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Wilson also noted that those facilities can now build
only short-range missiles _ which are allowed by United Nations
resolutions _ and that, even if there were no air strikes, it would
take ``a couple of years'' for the Iraqis to convert them to
long-range weapons. He did emphasize that they seem to have
``plans'' to try and make this conversion.

RETIRING HOUSE MEMBERS DEPART IN SHOCK ON AN HISTORIC DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Retiring House members were stunned Saturday that
their last day in office would combine an historic vote on
President Clinton's impeachment with the startling announcement by
Speaker-designate Bob Livingston that he was resigning his seat.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day that combined history, chaos and political
risk-taking of a magnitude that most of them had never imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Retiring Rep. Gerald B.H. Solomon, R-N.Y., the Rules Committee
chairman who was winding up 10 terms in Congress, said he was
leaving the chamber for the last time ``with very, very mixed
emotions'' and great sadness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of the saddest days in the history of the country _
but one of the most courageous days,'' Solomon told a reporter.
``We did uphold the Constitution and the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   He said fledging democracies around the world ``have looked to
us as the beacon of hope. If we ever let that beacon of hope die,
what's it going to lead to?''
</P>
<P>
   After the House voted two articles of impeachment and adjourned,
Solomon lingered on the House floor, talking with colleagues in the
ornate chamber where President Andrew Johnson was impeached in
1868.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying his trademark red cardboard accordion file with the
letters S-O-L-O-M-O-N written in big magic-marker letters on the
side, Solomon headed for his nearby private office and declared his
confidence that House members will rally and pick a good leader to
replace Livingston who gave up his plans to become speaker after
confessing to adultery.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon cited Reps. Dennis J. Hastert, R-Ill., and Christopher
Cox, R-Calif., as possibilities to replace Livingston who had been
slated to succeed Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., when the new 106th Congress
convenes next month.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon, who plans to join a Washington lobbying firm, flashed a
big grin and declared that he will work for the election of Texas
Gov. George W. Bush to the presidency in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., the former head of the Democratic
Caucus who is leaving Congress after his 10th term, said he does
``not want to leave Congress saying there is no hope'' but that he
was ``very aggrieved at the way in which the House has been
portrayed and has behaved'' in impeaching Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret that I leave the House in this kind of state,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fazio said it was unfortunate that Livingston, ``the one man who
could heal the institution,'' had resigned. Fazio said he had
personally appealed to Livingston to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place has been badly bruised by the partisan wars that
have swirled around us,'' Fazio said. ``This is a cancer that is
eating away at us. We are flawed human beings and we need to be
tolerant of one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Fazio said House members need to ``gather around those who are
wounded and say, `Don't let this drive you out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fazio said members of Congress should not allow people like
Larry Flynt to influence lawmakers' career decisions. Flynt, the
publisher of Hustler magazine, has offered a $1 million bounty for
proof of extramarital affairs by top government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., who cast his last House vote
Saturday before going to the Senate next month, expressed
disappointment at how his House career ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look back on my 18 years with such a feeling of pride and
accomplishment,'' Schumer said. ``To see the House in this kind of
turmoil was not the way I wanted to look back on the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Frank Riggs, R-Calif., another retiree, said the
impeachment vote, the attacks on Iraq and Livingston's resignation
``occurring a week before Christmas have had a surreal effect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It just cast a pall over the chamber to watch the
speaker-designate make such a bombshell announcement,'' Riggs said,
adding that it will take ``months and months'' to heal the
bitterness in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a remarkable ride,'' Riggs said. ``It's certainly
not how I wanted to make my swan song.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Paul McHale, a three-term Pennsylvania Democrat who also
ended his congressional career with the impeachment vote, said the
process ``has been very draining.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On a personal level, it's a deeply disheartening day in our
nation's history,'' said McHale, a former Clinton supporter who
voted to impeach the president on two articles of perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system worked today as the founding fathers intended,''
said McHale, who plans to teach at a Pennsylvania college.
</P>
<P>
   ``A president who acted reprehensibly was impeached ultimately
because of his own conduct. This whole thing started because of
obvious defects in the president's character,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, who finished a 37-year career
in Congress by opposing Clinton's impeachment, said he wasn't
surprised at the high level of rancor in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it should be expected that you would have division on
an issue like this,'' Gonzalez said. ``If there was going to be
such a vote, I'm glad I could be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think that a vote on impeachment was wrong. Impeachment
is a measure that shouldn't be based on personal deviation.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As they plunge into the uncharted waters of the
impeachment trial of a modern president, senators are uncertain
about what lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Some think they are in for a long ordeal on the Senate floor
that could last until next summer or even longer.
</P>
<P>
   Others think that President Clinton and the Senate will quickly
cut a deal in January and short-circuit a trial before it gets
started in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Still others expect something in between _ a procedure short of
a full trial, that lasts for some weeks but may then be shelved.
</P>
<P>
   But all the senators and staff experts interviewed last week
agreed on an essential point: Unless unanticipated, damaging new
evidence against the president arises, the Senate will never muster
the two-thirds majority necessary to convict him and remove him
from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that there are not 67 votes against
him,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, one of the president's most
ardent Republican opponents but also a senator who usually has a
sure sense of where his colleagues stand.
</P>
<P>
   Another point to remember is that although it takes a two-thirds
majority to remove a president from office, a trial can be stopped
before it begins or at any time after it starts by a simple
majority vote of the senators. The Senate will have 55 Republicans
and 45 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that no one knows what may develop. There is no
reference book that spells out what an impeachment trial in 1999
would look like. There is no staff expert who has mastered all the
legal and political nuances.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the Senate has been out of session for two
months _ the senators scattered around the country _ so there has
not been the give and take necessary to reach a political
consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, the Republican leader, insists that he has made
no plans for how the Senate will proceed. He has said he did not
want to appear presumptuous while the matter was before the House.
</P>
<P>
   Lott does not plan to call the Senate back into session this
year. He leaves no doubt that he expects an impeachment trial next
year, but he is not sure when it will begin or how long he will be
away.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued by his office Saturday, Lott said: ``There
are steps that precede the beginning of an impeachment trial. Once
the Senate is organized as an impeachment proceeding, there will be
pleadings and motions that come before the taking of evidence. That
makes it difficult, at this time, to determine when an actual trial
will begin. That timing will depend greatly on the president and
his lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott hinted in an interview on CNN last week that after the
trial began, the Senate might decide to pull the plug on it.
``There are a number of votes on procedures that may be demanded
along the way,'' he said, ``and we'll have to work the will of the
Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Saturday that he hoped that ``there will
be a constitutional and fair means of resolving this matter in a
prompt manner'' in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   After two articles of impeachment were approved Saturday _ the
other two were defeated _ House officials delivered them to the
secretary of the Senate, Gary Sisco. The best guess is that on Jan.
6, when the 106th Congress convenes, the Senate will pass a
resolution stating that it is prepared to receive the articles of
impeachment from the House managers, appointed Saturday, as the
group of representatives selected to act as official prosecutors of
the case are called.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 7, if the schedule holds, the managers will walk across
the Capitol to the Senate and read the articles on the Senate
floor. That day or the next, Chief Justice William Rehnquist will
be sworn in to preside over the trial, as the Constitution
requires. (The Founding Fathers realized that it would be a
conflict of interest to have the vice president, who also serves as
president of the Senate, manage the impeachment trial of a
president.)
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist's oath will probably be administered by Sen. Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C., the president pro tem. The chief justice will
then swear in the 100 senators as jurors in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the Senate will vote to notify Clinton formally that the
proceedings have begun, and a schedule will be set. The president
will probably get a month or more to file a written response to the
impeachment charges, and the House will get time to prepare its
reply.
</P>
<P>
   During this hiatus the negotiations over a deal will begin.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is that the Senate might agree to stop the trial
in return for the president's acceptance of a stiff censure. A
trial could also end quickly if Clinton decides not to present a
defense at all _ like a defendant in a trial so confident of
victory that he rests his case without calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, is one who thinks that is the most
likely outcome. He explained: ``If I were the president, I would
want to get this thing over with as soon as you can. He knows there
are not 67 votes there. I don't know anybody who would argue
there's a chance to have 67 votes at this point. But who knows what
else might come up if he got into a trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm agreed with that assessment. ``Why would he want to have
an extended trial?'' Gramm asked. ``From his point of view, this is
all about damage control.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., said he thought that script was
unlikely. ``I think it goes nine innings, meaning we have a
long-drawn-out process,'' he said. Many other Democrats and some
Republicans agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the middle ground, Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, said he
expected the Senate to begin operating on two tracks, dealing with
legislation in the afternoon and with the trial either in the
morning or in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after ``a sufficiently legitimate period of time,''
Bennett said, the Senate could vote to end the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate can't just pass a motion right up front to stop the
trial,'' he said. ``That would be a terrible slap in the face of
the House institutionally. So we need to put some time in. If they
have gone through the seriousness of voting impeachment, we should
go through the seriousness of having a trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if after a while, we can say we have sifted through the
issues and have decided to suspend the trial, then there's
face-saving all around. The House can live with it. The president
can live with it. And we look like statesmen.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers in the Senate believe the new House that takes office
next month will have to vote to reappoint the managers who would
present the case to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the top Democrat on the Judiciary
Committee, said it was possible that the new House, with a smaller
Republican majority than the current one, would end the case then.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Leahy said, ``we are in for a long, long, long
trial.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   If there is a full-scale trial, it would bear no resemblance to
anything anyone alive has ever seen. It would be part legal and
part political, governed partly by arcane Senate rules that were
created for the trial of President Andrew Johnson in 1868 and
partly by rules of law.
</P>
<P>
   In all of American history, there have been only 13 such trials
and only seven convictions, all of federal judges. Johnson's trial
130 years ago was the only one of a president.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, the trial would be like one in a courtroom.
There would be opening statements, presentation of witnesses and
evidence by both sides, cross-examinations, rebuttals and closing
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Potential witnesses like Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp would
testify under oath, in public, presumably on television, no matter
how distasteful and embarrassing their testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The House would hire professional prosecutors and the president
would hire defense lawyers to question witnesses and argue their
cases. Because an impeachment trial will be part of the president's
official duties, his legal fees will be paid by the government.
</P>
<P>
   But other elements would be quite different from a courtroom
trial. The senators, sitting as jurors, would be the judges not
just of facts but also of law. By majority vote, they could
overrule decisions of Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   In most impeachment cases, the rules allow the Senate to choose
a 12-member committee to hear evidence, sparing most senators from
the tedium of a trial. But Senate history makes clear that the
authority is not to be delegated in the trial of a president.
</P>
<P>
   The senators, who in normal circumstances think nothing of
talking for hours on the most routine matters, would not be
permitted to speak in public session during the trial. To question
a witness, they could pass a note to the chief justice, who would
pose the question.
</P>
<P>
   All the senators' deliberations would be in closed session with
no personal staff members or reporters present. And their time for
speaking in those sessions would be strictly limited _ 10 minutes
maximum for each senator on preliminary motions and 15 minutes on
the final verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference from a courtroom trial would be that the
verdict would not be based primarily on facts or law. Some senators
would doubtless decide on the basis of politics, others on their
judgment of what would be best for the country.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said he was in
this last category. He had no doubt, he said, that lying to a grand
jury, the first charge against Clinton, was an impeachable offense
that could justify removal from office. But he said he might not
vote that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to what is in the best interest of the American
people,'' Hatch said. ``Should we really throw the president out of
office for this kind of prevarication? I don't know. It's not an
easy question to answer. It's one I'm struggling with.''

 &HT;    Toss all the rules into the Potomac
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The old rules no longer apply. In fact, after this there are no
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Politics doesn't stop at the water's edge any more. You can
indeed impeach a president by a narrow partisan vote. Congress can
not only thumb its nose at the public but also feels free to brag
about it. The job of House speaker, one of the most secure and
stable in Washington, has become a revolving door. By January we
will have had three people in that post in three months, one of
whom never officially had the job.
</P>
<P>
   And in a week in which we go to war and impeach a president, the
stock market rose 130 points.
</P>
<P>
   It is strange _ head-scratching strange. This confluence of
events _ war with Iraq coinciding with a bitter war among ourselves
_ has provided the crowning touch to one of the more bizarre years
in American history. Other eras have been more frightening, more
dangerous, more tragic. But for sheer jaw-dropping melodrama, this
spectacle is hard to top. Someone switched worlds on us when we
weren't looking.
</P>
<P>
   There's no single explanation for all this, no unified theory by
which it can be made rational. But when scientists and
mathematicians see this kind of thing happen _ when a previously
stable system suddenly goes all kablooey _ they suspect what is
called a phase transition, in which the system slides into chaos
before emerging once again into a new form of stability.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the country and the culture are undergoing permanent
change, and the chaos in Washington is both a symptom and a cause
of that change. What shape will those changes take? What will this
country look like if and when we emerge from this nightmare?
</P>
<P>
   Some fear that the institution of the presidency will be greatly
weakened, pointing out that a series of weak presidents _ Grant,
Hayes, Garfield, Arthur _ filled the office in the wake of the
impeachment of Andrew Johnson in 1868. But that pattern is not
likely to repeat itself. The issues in the Johnson impeachment were
gravely constitutional, involving a struggle for power between the
presidency and Congress. There are no stately balance-of-power
issues in this tawdry personal tragedy, which in itself is an
argument against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   This must, however, have a long-term effect on politics and how
it is conducted. The stunning announcement by Rep. Robert
Livingston on Saturday that he would not accept the job of speaker
makes him just the latest victim of what has become known as ``the
politics of personal destruction.'' And while Clinton's mistakes
are his own responsibility. for which he must pay the consequences,
his impeachment is also a direct product of attack politics. We
must emerge from this mess with a more mature understanding of one
another.
</P>
<P>
   We are all human beings, with human frailties. But given the
intrusiveness and power of modern media, it has become all but
impossible for high-profile people to keep those personal frailties
personal. We have yet to adjust our political standards and
expectations to that new reality.
</P>
<P>
   It has long been considered fair game in politics to use an
opponent's personal weakness as a weapon to disqualify him from
public life and discredit his point of view. But think about that:
If we all have weakness, if all weakness is exposed, and if all
exposed weakness disqualifies a person from office, then none of us
is worthy.
</P>
<P>
   We can wish it weren't so; we can argue that the media ought to
show greater restraint and judgment in covering the frailties of
those in public life. But in a world shared with the likes of Matt
Drudge and Larry Flynt, that's wishful thinking. It's telling that
Livingston's history of infidelity was exposed by Flynt's Hustler
magazine, a publication that exists solely to flout the social
conventions that might bind the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   The only answer is to grow up and accept the fact of each
other's humanity. The personal humiliation of Livingston, Clinton,
Henry Hyde and others might be the cruel but necessary price of
creating that new understanding.
</P>
<P>
   However, in decrying the attack politics of our leaders, we as a
people ought to be honest with ourselves. The cruel partisanship,
the invective and win-at-any-cost mentality that we find so
disgusting in Washington is not some isolated development out of
step with the rest of our culture. The truth is, it reflects our
culture all too accurately.
</P>
<P>
   There's an eerie parallel with what's going on Iraq. Over the
past few days, American sailors and pilots have been firing weapons
at targets that are hundreds of miles from where they sit, targets
they never even see. But here at home we watch on eerie
green-tinted screens as those missiles slam into buildings. It
gives you the sense of war as a video game.
</P>
<P>
   But of course it's not a game. You can't bring the Baghdad dead
back to life by sticking in another quarter and hitting the ``new
game'' button. This business of making war without getting your
hands dirty is dangerous, particularly if it deludes us into
thinking that war can be a tidy undertaking without repercussion or
consequence.
</P>
<P>
   It is not.
</P>
<P>
   Much of modern political warfare has taken on that same
impersonal detachment, the same sense that we can inflict brutal
casualties on our opponents through television ads and radio talk
shows and direct-mail hit pieces without consequence to ourselves.
As leaders of both parties have discovered, it's just not so.
</P>
<P>
   The larger question, the question that really cuts to the core
of all this mess, is why the American public has become so bitter
and angry. Why did roughly a third of Americans thoroughly despise
Clinton long before the name Monica Lewinsky was ever heard?
Conversely, why have Democrats fought so ferociously to save a
president whose behavior even they will not defend? Why can't we
even talk to each other in a civil tone?
</P>
<P>
   The answer must be that the disorder of our politics, the idea
that no rules apply, accurately reflects the disorder of a society
trying to make sense of profound technological, social and economic
change. We're not really fighting over cigars or perjury, or even
the fate of a president. It's much more important than that.
</P>
<P>
   No, we're fighting over what form this new culture will take,
what the new rules are going to be and who gets to sit down at the
table when we write them. For those stakes, we're ready to fight
dirty if necessary.

 &HT;    Livingston resigns from would-be speaker post, urging Clinton to
do the same
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr and Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Stunned House Republicans scrambled to select a new
leader Saturday after Rep. Bob Livingston (R-La.) shocked Congress
by resigning as the designated new Speaker during during a
passionate plea for President Clinton to leave office himself.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of Livingston's unexpected resigation, names
started ciruclating for his replacement.That list included House
Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde, the Illinois Republican who presided
over the impeachment inquiry, fellow Illinois Republican Dennis
Hastert and Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Calif.).
</P>
<P>
   But the maneuvering to succeed Livingston paled in comparison to
the drama created by Livingston's speech urging Clinton to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``You, sir, may resign your post,'' he said speaking from the
well of the House as lawmakers prepared to vote on four articles of
impeachment against the president for the way he concealed an
adulterous affair with a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   As Livingston spoke, Democrats, led by Rep. Maxine Waters of
California, raised their fists in the air and began hissing, then
chanting, ``No! No! No!'' Then they yelled ``You resign! You
resign! You resign!''
</P>
<P>
   When Livingston did just that, saying he had hurt his family,
Congress and the country with his own extramarital affairs, a
silence fell then over the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have hurt you deeply,'' said Livingston, who has been
married for 33 years to his wife, Bonnie. ``I must set the example
that I hope President Clinton will follow... I will not stand for
speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite having called for his resignation moments before,
Democrats stood with Republicans to applaud Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Bob Livingston's resignation while offered in good
faith was wrong,'' said Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.). ``It is a
surrender to a new sexual McCarthyism.''
</P>
<P>
   As Livingston strode off the floor to his Appropriations
Committee offices a few steps from the House floor, Democratic
Reps. Jesse Jackson Jr. of Illinois, David Skaggs of Colorado, and
Elijah Cummings of Maryland ran after him, attempting to convince
him to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   But Livingston told them firmly, ``It is done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is horrible, we have a real constitutional crisis,'' said
an emotional Jackson, the son of one of the president's staunchest
defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Upon learning of the unexpected resignation, President Clinton
quickly urged Livingston to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president firmly believes the politics of personal
destruction has to come to an end,'' White House Spokesman Joe
Lockhart told reporters outside the White House.
</P>
<P>
   However, Livingston's resignation did little to change Clinton's
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to keep on pushing his agenda forward and I think
it would be wrong to give in to this insidious politics of personal
destruction, which seems so pervasive in this town now,'' Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats universally expressed shock and
sadness at Livingston's decision. His resignation sent the House
into pandemonium and the jockeying for his replacement began almost
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert appeared to be the favorite candidate to replace
Livingston, who was chosen last month by the Republican caucus to
replace Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich resigned last month following the House elections where
Republicans lost five seats to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder (R-Ga.) said he urged Rep. Bill Archer
(R-Texas) to consider succeeding Livingston. ``I think that he'd
unify the party,'' Linder said.
</P>
<P>
   Other contenders included Rep. Chris Cox (R-Calif.), the
chairman of a special committee investigating whether technology
was improperly given to the Chinese as a result of public policy
changes made by Clinton. And Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.), who
narrowly lost a bid last month to be majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) said that he was
throwing his support behind Hastert because he ``has the experience
and the character to lead this House.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich watched Livingston on television, telling his press
secretary, Christina Martin, that ``this is a noble, patriotic and
selfless act by speaker-elect Livingston.'' Throughout the day,
Gingrich had little public presence, always traveling with an
entourage and refusing to answer questions from reporters.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom Delay (R-Texas) learned that Livingston
would resign just minutes before the floor debate on impeaching the
president began.

<P>
   ``There's no greater American in my mind, at least today, then
Bob Livingston because he understood what this debate was all
about,'' said Delay, in his speech to lawmakers.''It was about
honor, and decency and integrity and the truth. Everything that we
honor in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Directing his attention to the president, Delay said he hoped
that Clinton would follow the lead of both Gingrich and Livingston
who in his estimation put the good of the country ahead of their
political lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some it's no longer good enough to make a mistake, confess
that mistake and accept the consequences of that mistake and change
the way you live your life and keep moving and make a contribution
to this country,'' Delay said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle expressed concern about how
the private lives of lawmakers were becoming the main entree in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have a toxic environment that few are immune from,''
said Rep. Jim Moran (D-Va.), an outspoken critic of the president's
affair with Lewinsky. At this point, he said, the only person who
could possibly pass a vetting process is Rep. Barney Frank
(D-Mass.). And that's because his homosexuality is well know, he
said. ``There is a certain kind of sexual guillotine going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) agreed, saying the ``American
Revolution is fast becoming the French Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Tension was thick throughout the day with Democrats fleeing the
floor to tell reporters that Livingston should remain and
Republicans noting that Livingston did the honorable thing.
</P>
<P>
   The overall sense in the marble hallways of the Capitol was a
House coming unglued at a time when U.S. troops are stationed in
Iraq and the president faced the political fight of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kind of like a disaster movie scripted by the Marx
Brothers,'' said Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is madness,'' said Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) ``We are
spiraling down a path of mutually assured destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Others thought Livingston's resignation was an appropriate
response to end the calamity that has now become commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas) joked that candidates in the next
election would be forced to set up several lie detectors.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone caught nearly all members of his party completely
off guard, telling only a small handful of confidants of his
decision to resign before he formally announced in the midst of the
impeachment debate. Livingston said he did not make his decision
until Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gerald Solomon (R-N.Y.), one of those in whom Livingston
confided, said there would undoubtedly be efforts to talk
Livingston into staying, but Livingston's mind was ``made up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party will rally and will make the right
decision,'' said Solomon, who is leaving Congress as well.

 &HT;    Livingston: A hard climb to fall
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice and Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ His alcoholic father left home when Bob Livingston was
7 years old, and his mother had to go to work at a shipyard. From
such humble beginnings, the Louisiana Republican had been on the
brink of becoming one of the nation's most powerful politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's resignation announcement Saturday on the floor of
the House of Representatives came just two days after he confessed
that he had affairs while married to his wife of 33 years.
</P>
<P>
   This is the latest twist in a life that has seen him go from the
bottom rungs of Louisiana social strata to being chosen as speaker
of the next House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had various stages,'' he said in a CNN interview last
month. ``I was a young lawyer and prosecutor for a lot of years,
and congressman now for the last 21 years _ 21-plus years. And in
that time, I think I've learned, through my experiences, that
nothing is like it was before. You've got to move on. You've got to
try to solve new problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving on is something Livingston, 55, knows about.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Colorado, Livingston grew up in an old section of New
Orleans, moving to the suburbs only when district lines were
redrawn to exclude the city. His father's side of the family comes
from an aristocratic line that includes Louisiana's founding
fathers: An early ancestor administered the presidential oath of
office to George Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But his family fell on hard times, losing its fortune in the
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've become, I owe not to geneology, but to my mother,''
Livingston told a Louisiana newspaper last year.
</P>
<P>
   After his now-deceased father's desertion, Livingston's mother
worked at Avondale Shipyards and managed to scrape together enough
money to send her son to a Catholic school in the suburb of
Metairie, with the help of a partial scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started working when I was 14 years old shoveling up stuff
from the elephants _ my first affiliation with my party's symbol _
and I've been working virtually every summer until I got out of law
school,'' Livingston told CNN.
</P>
<P>
   After serving in the Navy from 1961-63, Livingston worked his
way through school, selling Fuller brushes and laboring as a welder
at the same shipyards where his mother had toiled.
</P>
<P>
   He married in 1965 and later received his bachelor's and law
degrees from Tulane University. In 1968, he passed the bar. After a
short stint in private practice, Livingston worked as a prosecutor;
as an assistant U.S. attorney from 1970-1973; with the Orleans
Parish district attorney's office from 1974-75; and the Louisiana
attorney general's office in 1975-76.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, he ran for Congress in the New Orleans suburbs and lost
by 3 percentage points. His opponent, however, resigned in the
midst of a voter fraud scandal, and Livingston won the seat in a
special election in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   It's a post he's held since, never facing serious challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Known as a conservative, Livingston supported aid to the
Nicaraguan contras and mandatory sentences for convicted third-time
felons and opposed the ``motor voter'' registration bill, gays in
the military and Voting Rights Act interpretations that permit
gerrymandered black-majority congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5 Livingston has a legendary temper and has been
known to engage in occasional House floor theatrics, such as
playing the harmonica or wielding an alligator skinning knife to
illustrate how he would cut the budget. He also has a black belt in
tae kwon do.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he surprised many senior members of Congress when House
Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) chose him to become chairman of the
powerful House Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Livingston challenged Gingrich for the speakership
after Republicans lost seats in the House in the midtrem elections.
Gingrich resigned, and a few days later Republican members chose
Livingston as their new leader for the term that begins in January.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his rapid climb, Livingston's supporters like to portray
him as a friend to the common man. They point out that when he ran
for Congress, he had just $5,000 in the bank, all of which went
into the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Representing a city renowned for its fine dining, Livingston's
staff is hard-pressed to name his favorite restaurant. They say
he's more likely to eat a Big Mac in the car.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's main residence is outside Washington, but he keeps
a townhouse in Metairie, about 20 minutes from New Orleans. His
three sons live in Louisiana; his daughter, who is adopted, lives
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent Louisiana fund-raiser, Livingston's wife, Bonnie,
stood by his side, smiling and patiently answering reporters'
questions. Bonnie Livingston recently went to lunch with Gingrich's
wife, Marianne, to learn what to expect as speaker's wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me what was good and what was bad,'' Bonnie
Livingston said. ``She said the unfair criticism was bad. But Bob
comes in without being the person who caused the other party to go
out of office, so he'll have fewer problems, hopefully.

 &HT;    Scarlet Livingston latest to join Scarlet Letter Club
 &HT;    By Cynthia Tucker
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone with a lick of sense should have been able to see this
coming: The tinderbox of sexual scandal, fueled by the unseemly
tactics of independent counsel Kenneth Starr, has turned into a
raging wildfire, incinerating Democrat and Republican alike.
Alluding to revelations of his extramarital affairs, Rep. Bob
Livingston of Louisiana _ poised to become the next speaker of the
House _ stunned his colleagues on Saturday morning with the
announcement that he intends to resign from Congress in six months.
</P>
<P>
   Apologizing to his colleagues and members of his family _ ``I
have hurt you all deeply and beg your forgiveness'' _ Livingston
said, ``I was prepared to lead our narrow majority as speaker...
but I cannot do that job.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Livingston cast his decision as an honorable sacrifice
_ he also urged President Clinton to resign _ his announcement came
as some of the GOP's staunch conservatives began to question his
fitness to succeed Newt Gingrich as leader of congressional
Republicans. Livingston was forced to disclose his adultery on
Thursday because Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt is planning
an expose.
</P>
<P>
   Though his GOP colleagues initially rallied around him, it is no
surprise that carping and second-guessing broke out later. After
all, it would have been difficult for Livingston to lead a
holier-than-thou crusade after Hustler had outted him.
</P>
<P>
   That's been the problem with this sex-and-lies scandal all
along: Many Republicans cannot meet the standard of morality to
which they wish to hold Clinton. They were foolish to believe they
could seek to oust the president on the flimsiest of foundations _
behavior that stemmed from a sexual affair with a consenting adult
_ and not have that crusade come back to haunt them. They sow the
wind, and reap the whirlwind.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of that excuses Clinton for conduct that has
been sordid, reckless and grossly selfish. He destroyed his
credibility and moral authority not by having sex (or non-sex, as
the president insists) with Monica Lewinsky but rather through the
casual misuse of aides and associates, repeated lies to them and to
the public and his failure to genuinely take responsibility
(despite carefully staged, heavily scripted, lip-biting public
performances).
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, have been no less reckless in response to
Clinton. They relied on an overzealous independent counsel willing
to trample the Constitution and come close to entrapment; they
published a report on the investigation filled with unnecessarily
graphic sexual detail; they flouted the public will by impeaching
the president. Most surprising under the circumstances, they went
forward _ zealously and self-righteously _ without considering the
skeletons in their midst.
</P>
<P>
   First there was Henry Hyde, the less-than-statesmanlike chairman
of the House Judiciary Committee, who claimed an affair he had when
he was 41 was a ``youthful indiscretion.'' During the Iran-Contra
hearings, Hyde defended the Reagan administration by saying it
didn't make sense to ``label every untruth and every deception an
outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Livingston, whose initial excuse was that, unlike
Clinton, he had not lied under oath or broken any law. Not to put
too fine a point on it, but adultery is against the law in
Louisiana. And does anyone believe that if Livingston had been
blindsided in a deposition in a civil lawsuit _ as Clinton was with
questions about Lewinsky _ that he would have immediately confessed
his serial affairs?
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans such as Georgia's Bob Barr (thrice married;
sued once for child support) are too consumed with their hatred of
Clinton to notice they've set fire to a building from which they
cannot escape. It is up to cooler heads in the Senate, then, to
extinguish this wildfire.
</P>
<P>
   End the impeachment madness. Get us out of the private lives of
public officials.

 &HT;    Prognostications aside, Senate acquittal far from a done deal
 &HT;    By Jim Wooten
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only the stunning announcement by Speaker-designate Bob
Livingston (R-La.) added drama. Otherwise the national tragedy that
unfolded on cue Saturday was a scripted ritual acted out to the
accompaniment of a national yawn.
</P>
<P>
   This does not bode well for Bill Clinton. The Senate outcome his
defenders and the political prognosticators think certain _ that he
will be acquitted at trial _ is tenuous, a house of hopes and
illusions built on sinking sand.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion is shallow and unstable. Unlike the House, where
districts are drawn with a ideological purity that allows Democrats
and Republicans to snarl invective, to shout partisan viciousness
and to vote with impunity, the Senate is a far different place. The
shallowness, then, of public opinion combined with senators'
freedom from parochialism, makes the trial outcome far from
certain.
</P>
<P>
   This is a remarkable moment in time. The nation is carrying out
acts of war. The president of the United States, the military
commander in chief, invites constant public attention to the
essential job he has of ``running'' the country.
</P>
<P>
   And yet on the first day of war, the stock market rises 85
points and on the first day of impeachment the Dow rises 27 while
the Nasdaq records new highs. Those whose fortunes depend on
stability in the ``running'' of a country are not shaken by the
prospect that this president may be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   At the water cooler, too, the event is ordinary. Opinions, but
little passion. Mark McGwire or Sammy Sosa. Crime in Buckhead. An
event factored into the routine of daily life. And when is Macy's
last one-day sale before Christmas?
</P>
<P>
   A bizarre thing has happened _ and this is what Clinton's
defenders should fear: The nation has discounted the presidency to
its present-day value in people's lives. Like the pre-Christmas
display of bread machines, the presidency is marked down to
clearance prices. Grave as this moment is, people do not feel
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Too much exposure. Too much celebrity. Too much spin. Too many
stories. The presidency, once revered as essential to well-being,
is degraded, marked down. His impeachment affects our choice of
style and policy preferences, not well-being.
</P>
<P>
   With support shallow _ 60 percent of the people didn't want him
impeached, but 59 percent would prefer his resignation rather than
subject the nation to a drawn-out Senate trial _ public opinion can
stampede.
</P>
<P>
   Cable television and the Internet offer reams of information and
misinformation and constant spin, reshaping the channels by which
the nation reaches consensus. During Watergate, the nation came to
consensus slowly and thoroughly. The constant flow of information,
though _ three to five cable shows per night offering spin _ means
people know enough to form an opinion, but not necessarily to
develop conviction. Public opinion, therefore, changes. People
shift and coalesce quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of commitment means that people are forming opinions
based on the options presented them. Article One of the impeachment
resolution can be presented in concise, easy-to-understand terms.
The issue is, did he lie or didn't he? That is the kind of equation
around which consensus quickly forms.
</P>
<P>
   With impeachment now a fact, the rule of law is upheld. No man
is above it. The language of impeachment does not depend for
meaning on any middleman, and is neither strengthened nor weakened
by talk-show chatter or the spin of partisan historians.
</P>
<P>
   If the president will now accept and acknowledge his lies, a
Senate trial can be avoided. The proposal offered by former U.S.
Sen. Bob Dole offers a framework.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the president can continue in office depends on his, and
his defenders', response to impeachment. If the personal attacks on
adversaries are to continue, if the nation is to endure two more
years of partisan vituperation and score-settling, what Minority
Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) calls ``the politics of personal
destruction,'' the country would be better served now by proceeding
to a Senate trial. It need not be drawn-out or salacious. That is
within the purview of the president.
</P>
<P>
   The president, too, could hasten reconciliation by resigning, as
Livingston did. ``I must set the example that I hope the president
will follow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The next few days are critical. If the president is contrite, if
the gravity of what has just happened does, indeed, cause partisans
to step back from the politics of personal destruction and
incivility, some resolution short of removal from office may indeed
be possible.
</P>
<P>
   The American people are an unpredictable jury. Acquittal in the
Senate is not a slam-dunk.

the blame to Americans. His officials control the cameras and
access of western journalists. At the same time, military experts
say that the United States has failed to set forth clear
objectives. In the Gulf war, the motto was to find Saddam's army

   PANAMA-CANAL-$ADV20 _ PANAMA CITY, Panama _ The year is 1977,

treaties are a milestone in U.S.-Latin American relations,
requiring the United States to relinquish control of the Panama
Canal _ long a symbol of American domination and Yankee ingenuity _
to Panama by high noon on Dec. 31, 1999. In 1977, the turn of the
century seemed eons away. But now the sun is finally setting on
this strategic outpost, a presence the United States has enjoyed
for 95 years. But like a husband and wife headed for an amicable
divorce, both sides are suffering a rush of last-minute doubts. In
the United States, there are misgivings over whether Panama, a
small country with no military and only 2.8 million people, can
successfully oversee one of the world's most valuable waterways.

Panama Canal. But whether any of them fly remains to be seen.

 &HT;        SHUSTER BREAKS SILENCE, VOTES TO IMPEACH; MURTHA VOTES
AGAINST   By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Dec 19., -- For the second time in his career in
Congress, Rep. Bud Shuster, found himself supporting the
impeachment of a president.
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman member of the House in 1974, Shuster, R-Everett,
would have voted for the impeachment of Republican President
Richard Nixon had he not resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four years later, Shuster, who waited until the final
hour to make up his mind, voted Saturday to impeach President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``[This] I believe demonstrates my belief that a constitutional
issue of this gravity should not be decided on a partisan basis,''
Shuster said in a prepared statement. ``
</P>
<P>
   Mirroring the rest of Congress, the Pennsylvania delegation
voted almost squarely along party lines to impeach Clinton for
lying under oath about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and
obstructing justice. Shuster voted for the articles outlining those
charges, and Rep. John Murtha, D-Johnstown, voted against them.
</P>
<P>
   The articles will be sent to a trial in the Senate, where a
two-thirds majority is needed to convict the president and remove
him from office. Articles accusing Clinton of perjury in the Paula
Jones sexual harassment lawsuit and abuse of power failed on the
House floor.
</P>
<P>
   The tumultuous day began with Speaker-designate Bob Livingston's
announcement that he would resign following his recent admission of
extra-marital affairs. In a symbolic move, embattled Democrats
walked off the House floor to protest Republican leaders refusal to
allow members to vote for a censure resolution that could have
prevented a Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   Murtha joined Democrats who streamed off the House floor,
outside the Capitol and in front of a crowd of cheering onlookers,
visitors and television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   An expressionless Murtha and other Democrats re-entered the
building and took their places to vote against the impeachment
articles.
</P>
<P>
   Murtha, evaded reporters after the vote, and said only, ``I have
a plane home to catch.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement released by his office, Murtha denounced
party politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential removal of a President, and the overturning of
the election results which are the very basis of our entire
democracy -- demand unity in Congress and the nation, not
politics,'' it stated.
</P>
<P>
   Murtha also said the impeachment vote would strain the
relationship between Congress and the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The charges here simply do not rise to that level of
impeachment,'' Murtha said. ``This exercise does not bode well for
hopes in the coming year for a bipartisan approach to dealing with
such vital issues as stabilizing Social Security.''

 &HT;    ANALYSIS: Caught up in a nonstop rush of news
 &HT;    By Carolyn Nizzi Warmbold
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The fall of the house of Nixon pointed out that the
media not only reports on culture, but is part and parcel of it.
Television, tape recordings and two Washington Post reporters had
as much to do with the downfall of his administration as did the
shenanigans of all the president's men.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of a century later, the Clinton impeachment case is
being played out in a heightened-information environment. These are
the days of hot-off-the-press books by aides and enemies; of
round-the-clock CNN coverage; of Ken Starr culling evidence from
e-mail, taped conversations and answering machine messages; of
Internet flashes that topple the House leadership.
</P>
<P>
   This is the hyper-media age, when _ like a kid overdosed on
sugar _ events move at ``electric speed,'' when the world seems
like ``a growing plant in an enormously accelerated movie.'' Those
phrases are from Marshall McLuhan, a communications scholar whose
mark was made in the 1960s. He believed that speed would lead to
``an understanding of causes.''
</P>
<P>
   But speed can destruct as well as instruct. The recent news has
begotten metaphors for forces beyond our control: impeachment
inevitability becomes a ``snowball rolling downhill.'' Add the
bombing of Iraq or the resignation of House Speaker-to-be Bob
Livingston, and the metaphors take on a nightmare hue.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague compared last week's political crises to being on a
train that is screaming at top speed to who-knows-where. The
breakneck speed was stoked by the media, who now are hanging on for
the ride by their fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   In times like these, journalistic modes of operation shift.
Commentary, that staple of news TV and editorial pages, becomes
less relevant when there's no time or _ in a spin culture _ even no
basis for perspective. All TV can do, some say, is point a camera.
</P>
<P>
   But another apparatus is being pointed: the computer mouse. The
impeachment story has bookmarked this as a watershed year for the
Internet. Matt Drudge pulled the Monica Lewinsky rug out from under
Newsweek when he went online with the story. Salon detailed the
infidelities of House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, and
last week Roll Call revealed Livingston's marital strayings.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reports that Hustler magazine, published by
Larry Flynt, who has offered up to $1 million for information about
the sexual indiscretions of congressional members, may soon make
more online disclosures. Nothing caused as much thunder on the
Internet this year as the Starr Report, which generated a record 32
1/2 million hits for CNN Interactive, according to editor-in-chief
Scott Woelfel. This week's numbers challenged that high, with 25.7
million hits Thursday and 23 1/2 million on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Americans are in disconnect.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, the Net can be the most hyper of media, fueling
the frenzy that values breaking a story over getting it right. News
providers who take time to check facts or to consider ramifications
now risk being scooped by the Drudges of the world. The Internet is
jostling journalists and journalism.
</P>
<P>
   And the traditional media's collective finger seems to have
slipped off the public pulse. During election week, when political
pundits misjudged Republican gains and House Speaker Newt Gingrich
resigned, CNN congressional correspondent Bob Franken found himself
explaining to an on-air caller: ``We're supposed to be on top of
things, and we definitely were not then.''
</P>
<P>
   Franken ``then'' implied the state of unpreparedness was
temporary. But it hasn't been. We're all hanging on for the ride,
expecting only the unexpected. As CNN Chairman Tom Johnson said
last week when both Washington and Iraq became crises: ``In my
wildest imagination I could not have predicted you would have the
confluence of these two events.''
</P>
<P>
   And that points to perhaps the greatest irony of the hyper-media
age: Surrounded with 24-hour news channels, our laptops connected
to news sites and wire services, with cell phones and radios in our
cars, we inhabit a gray zone where reality seems inseparable from
spin.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1868, when Andrew Johnson was impeached by the House,
books and newspapers comprised the media. Since then, technology
has reached electric speed, but our understanding of causes, not to
mention effects, remain in pony-express mode.

 &HT;    CBS drops the ball with Jets vs. Bills instead of televising the
GOP vs. Bill
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This was CBS: On one of the most important days in
U.S. history, for the first impeachment of a president during the
age of television, the network with the longest and noblest
tradition in broadcast news carried a pro football game instead of
the House votes.
</P>
<P>
   It was the day CBS fumbled.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of television was there Saturday, all day and all the
way, giving plenty of choices for viewers who wanted to watch the
day's events unfold. CNN and C-SPAN, of course, and ABC, NBC, PBS
and even the wily Fox. But CBS carried the Jets vs. the Bills.
Saturday was a day of history and a day for history, so it's
appropriate to note that CBS was the home of Edward R. Murrow and
Eric Sevareid, the network where former news president Fred
Friendly resigned over a less significant conflict between news and
expediency, the seat of Walter Cronkite, Charles Kuralt, ``60
Minutes'' and Dan Rather.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, at high noon on Saturday, before the House even voted
to impeach President Clinton, CBS broke away to start the pregame
hoopla. (Rather was allowed to break in briefly to announce the
vote results on all four articles of impeachment, then got a few
minutes for a wrap-up when the game broke for halftime).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intention was to serve as many viewers as possible,'' CBS
spokeswoman Sandy Genelius explained. ``We had a contractual
obligation to carry the game in its entirety.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather, who once stormed off the evening news set when CBS
postponed his newscast to show the conclusion of a tennis match,
was not given to large gestures on Saturday. Maybe somebody at CBS
News needs to make a grand gesture to protest one of the worst
decisions ever made in television news.
</P>
<P>
   When the across-the-board coverage began Saturday morning, TV
anchors and analysts gave the impression that what was to happen
was completely scripted. CNN's Frank Sesno was among those who
explained the planned walk-out by House Democrats shortly before
the impeachment vote. ``It will be, if nothing else, theatrical,''
said ABC's Peter Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   Several broadcasters predicted a surprise-free day _ until House
Speaker-designate Bob Livingston (R-La.) announced he was resigning
and ``literally sucked the air out of this chamber,'' as Sesno
vividly put it.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's shocker two days after admitting to extramarital
affairs appeared to suck the air out of the TV pundits as well.
ABC's Cokie Roberts seemed to be shaking after the speech; CNN
correspondent Candy Crowley said she was ``speechless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is surreal,'' Democratic Minority Whip David Bonior said
from the House floor. ``The scenario reads like the plot of a cheap
paperback thriller.'' But such thrillers can be potent
page-turners, and with Livingston's resignation and the start of a
fourth day of U.S. bombing of Iraq, it was a day when turning off
the set seemed impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Better to keep a thumb on the remote, flipping frantically to
catch Judge Robert Bork on NBC calling Clinton ``the most corrupt
president in history,'' and being challenged by a skeptical Brokaw;
to see Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) trying to bring down the House with
an emotional speech, roaring above the dink-dink-dink of a gavel
reminding him his time was up; to CNN doing split screen between
Christiane Amanpour in Baghdad and the House debate; to Watergate
icon Carl Bernstein on CBS and Tim Russert on NBC, both looking
ahead to the Senate impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   CBS' Bob Schieffer pointed out (during halftime) that, given
Congressional timetables, the trial is unlikely to start before
February. When it does, CBS will probably be there. Because
football will be over.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The raw passions were such that the House Democrats
did not hesitate to bellow ``You resign! You resign!'' at
Speaker-elect Robert Livingston when he called from the House floor
for President Clinton to quit the White House in the face of
certain impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Shockingly, stunningly, Livingston did just that.
</P>
<P>
   He quit in one breathtaking utterance, as if flicking a trump
card onto the heap of impeachment angst festering before his eyes
in the debating chamber.
</P>
<P>
   In his one and only stratagem in leading his fellow House
Republicans, Livingston's decision struck Congress like a verbal
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned Democrats saw their fury vaporized in an instant. They
stood, almost staggering to their feet, and joined the Republicans
in a prolonged, emotional ovation for Livingston and his undeniable
self-sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   As they stood, the Democrats sensed that Livingston, R-La., had
suddenly closed a trap on the president and his defenders. For,
with the impeachment issue set to move to the Senate, Livingston,
whose own marital indiscretions were now before the public, to his
obvious misery, chose to show that the question of a political
leader's resignation was very much in play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must set the example that I hope President Clinton will
follow,'' Livingston declared, flabbergasting all attending the
impeachment debate and the nation watching beyond.
</P>
<P>
   He walked off the floor like the sheriff in some bullet-pocked
political ``High Noon,'' discarding the leadership badge he had
wrested from the earlier speaker-casualty, Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   In the corridor just beyond, a doorman shouted to a police
officer, ``Livingston just resigned!''
</P>
<P>
   ``What? What?'' came the reply from the officer, who obviously
thought the momentous announcement would be about Clinton's
impeachment, not Livingston's political self-immolation.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, already deep into bone-raw exhaustion after their
long fight to save the president, grasped for bearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a surrender to a developing sexual McCarthyism!''
declared Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., a leading presidential
defender trying to rally Democrats around the argument that
Livingston should not resign any more than Clinton should quit
under fire.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans were surging to the fore on the strength of
Livingston's announcement, fighting tears as they rose to salute
him as the ultimate political role model in the grueling
impeachment process as it roared into the final minutes of debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some, it is no longer good enough to make a mistake, to
confirm that mistake and take the consequences of that mistake,''
said Tom DeLay of Texas, the Republican whip, his hands shaking,
his eyes tearing as he addressed the House and sought to drive the
example of Livingston all the way down Pennsylvania Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understood what this debate was all about _ honor, duty,
integrity and the truth,'' said DeLay, arguing that in one swift
blow, Livingston had demonstrated himself to have been a far better
speaker, without ever officially holding the post, than Clinton had
been a president.
</P>
<P>
   With something of the political elan the president showed in
initiating a bombing attack on Iraq as his own impeachment loomed,
House Republicans, battered in public opinion polls, had found a
rocket's red glare of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have hurt you all deeply and beg your forgiveness,''
Livingston told the House, the nation and his family as he
announced retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Only moments before, Democrats openly hissed Livingston as he
firmly read his own judgment upon the president: ``Sir, you have
done great damage to this nation over the past year.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidential resignation was in order, he continued, and then
came the shouts of ``You resign! You resign!''
</P>
<P>
   And as Livingston closed the circle on his career, he stunned
the place into a collective breath of disbelief and somehow almost
threatened to reduce the dark historic issue before the House _ the
impeachment of the president _ into a matter of anticlimax.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must not succeed,'' David Bonior of Michigan, the
Democratic whip, said of the Republicans as he was given the task
of refocusing the day on the misdeeds of the president, not the
departure of the speaker. ``We are here to debate impeachment and
should not be distracted from that,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way we can stop this vicious cycle,'' Bonior cried
out from the floor, ``is if we refuse to give in to it, whether it
is Bill Clinton or Bob Livingston.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats sought to turn a day of the darkest political passions
into a cry for mercy for the president in the form of a motion to
censure, not impeach. But this alternative was readily rebuffed by
the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us step back from the abyss,'' Richard Gephardt of
Missouri, the minority leader, pleaded amid the frenzied politics
of the House, drawing some bipartisan applause but no easing of the
Republicans' determination to impeach Clinton. ``We need to start
healing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the lawmakers were still reeling through the day. The
fateful vote on the presidency approached, and the notion of
resignation licked about the capital city like a flame in a forest.

 &HT;    Bitter feud tearing body politic apart
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It came down to that fateful morning, when it
seemed history would finally take precedence over news, when it
seemed no more short-term shocks could overshadow the gravity
implicit in the first impeachment of an elected president of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   That was the way things felt Saturday, briefly, before Rep. Bob
Livingston got up to announce his resignation and the anxieties of
the moment came rushing back to elbow history aside one more time.
</P>
<P>
   That chaotic, angry moment, when the Democrats began their chant
for Livingston to resign, delaying him for a few seconds from doing
just that, encapsulated as well as any the anguish in a capital
which has come to seem more like a dysfunctional family at the
verge of a breakdown than a two-party government doing the business
of the people.
</P>
<P>
   At year's end the toll could be expressed in this way: Two
articles of impeachment, and a permanent scar on the president's
record. Two Republican speakers derailed as well as the party's
agenda, at least for the short term. And in the country, a deep and
roiling discontent that will have consequences as yet unmeasurable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very saddened and troubled that we would arrive at this
point,'' Rep. John Lewis said. ``We're tearing this place apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost instantaneously, Livingston's announcement that he will
leave Congress and not stand for speaker produced a bizarre change
in the political current.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats who jeered Livingston when he rose to speak
suddenly became the chorus calling for him to stay. Rep. Jesse
Jackson Jr. and two other Democrats rushed to his office to urge
him to reconsider, as other Democrats decried the poisonous
atmosphere that brought on his downfall.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Republicans who had applauded when Livingston
confessed his sexual indiscretions a couple of nights before were
already jostling to choose his successor. Rep. Bob Barr said later
in the day that between the time he rose to his seat and walked out
to the Speaker's Gallery, a few feet away, five GOP members came up
and asked him to support one or another candidate for speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans would be setting up lie detectors, joked Rep. Joe
Barton of Texas, to make sure the next speaker had not pushed any
old ladies in front of cars or any other awful thing.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports that support for Livingston had begun to
erode in the Republican caucus, prompting his decision. Livingston
posed his resignation as ``an example I hope President Clinton will
follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi gave the definitive answer to that suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resignation is not in his DNA,'' the California Democrat said.
Clinton, at his White House rally with congressional Democrats
after the impeachment vote, confirmed her prediction, vowing to
stay on until ``the last hour, and the last day, of my term.''
</P>
<P>
   That promise sets the stage for a titanic standoff in the coming
year, unless there can be a compromise, which seemed a distant
possibility on this rancorous day.
</P>
<P>
   New York Democrat Charles Schumer, who voted against impeachment
as his last act in the House and will have it as his first order of
business in the Senate next year, was pessimistic that the public's
desire for a speedy resolution can be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be tremendous pressure on (Senate Majority
Leader) Trent Lott from the radical right to push a trial,'' said
Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   As a historical matter, it only mattered that one of the
articles of impeachment passed Saturday. As a political matter, the
fact that two of the four articles failed could have more
significance that might appear at first glance.
</P>
<P>
   That marginal difference could make it more comfortable for some
Democratic senators to stick with their president. For their part,
the Democratic House members seemed more relaxed in defeat than the
Republicans did in victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe the other side has begun to feel the wrath of
the American people,'' said Rep. Sanford Bishop, whose victory in
his southeast Georgia district this November is Exhibit A for
Democrats nervous about the political costs of loyalty to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to his office were mostly anti-impeachment before the
impeachment debate began this week, Bishop said. When the debate
began, the pro- and anti- calls were about even, but as the debate
has gone on, the anti-impeachment calls again became predominant.
</P>
<P>
   As for Congress itself, few members voiced any hope there can be
any progress on legislation in the coming year, both because of the
Senate trial and the hardening animosity on both sides of the party
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the place needs to take a deep breath,'' said Democrat
Vic Fazio of California. ``But I don't think we will have that
opportunity.''

<P>
   Residents of New Orleans, where Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La.,
grew up, and of its suburbs, which he has represented in Congress
for two decades, were just getting their minds around the
revelation that the fabled straight-shooter had admitted to
extramarital affairs when the news hit early Saturday that he had
decided not to stand for speaker and would retire from Congress
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we've had a double dose this week,'' said Edward
Renwick, director of the Institute of Politics at Loyola
University, which Livingston attended in 1973, when he was
beginning to consider running for office. ``Everyone I've talked to
was so shocked by the announcement the other day of the affairs. I
can't tell you how many people said to me that they couldn't
believe it. And now this.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been less than two months since Livingston emerged as the
likely successor to his mentor, Speaker Newt Gingrich. Livingston,
a 55-year-old fiscal conservative, grew up modestly in New Orleans'
Uptown district, overcoming his father's abandonment of the family
and working his way through private schools and Tulane University
and into a successful career as a prosecutor and eventually a seat
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and colleagues almost universally described him as a
hard-working, pragmatic conservative who was devoted to his wife,
Bonnie, and their four children. Some said they were stunned by the
revelations of marital infidelity and by Livingston's unexpected
announcement in Congress that he would retire as a result.
</P>
<P>
   ``The group reaction is surprise and disappointment,'' said Hans
Jonassen, a friend for more than 40 years. ``It's just such a
shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Haik Terrell, the only Republican on New Orleans' City
Council, who described Livingston as one of her political mentors,
said: ``I don't think he decided to resign for any political
reasons. I think it was a moral decision, just a totally personal,
moral decision. It's an incredible pity.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn Hillyer, an editorial writer for The Register in Mobile,
Ala., who was Livingston's press secretary for many years, said he
was angry and sickened when he learned of the congressman's
decision to step down. He said he hoped Livingston would
reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that what happened is that Bob is a stand-up
guy and will take raps even when he doesn't need to,'' Hillyer
said. ``If Bill Clinton had the decency that Bob Livingston has in
his little finger, Bill Clinton would resign tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   When Livingston told his fellow Republicans on Thursday about
the affairs, their response was a standing ovation. So it was
unclear to Livingston's friends back home what happened in the next
48 hours to persuade him to resign. Did he lack the stomach to go
through weeks of grilling about the affairs? Were there more
damaging revelations to come? Did political rivals within his own
party use this as an excuse to advance their own positions?
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Livingston in the House will also have serious
financial consequences for the region. ``This is very bad for
Louisiana and for New Orleans,'' Renwick said. ``Here he was, head
of appropriations and about to become speaker, so the state and
city have been getting things from him for years. And now, after
this, nothing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With many people traveling or finishing up their Christmas
shopping, news of Livingston's decision spread slowly through New
Orleans. But that did not stop the jockeying to succeed Livingston
in Congress from beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Terrell, the City Council member, said she was stunned to
receive calls from political allies within hours of Livingston's
announcement, wondering if she would make a run for his seat. She
said she was disgusted to hear that at least three potential
candidates had already let their eagerness be known.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston nearly announced his retirement earlier this year,
but had been talked into running again, partly because of concerns
among Republicans that his departure might open the way for David
Duke, the right-wing candidate whose former ties to neo-Nazi groups
had embarrassed the Republican Party in the past.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Republican officials were putting together lists of
names of those who might be called on to run for Livingston's seat.
And some Democratic officials were pushing the candidacy of Dan
Foley, a former civil district clerk of court in Orleans Parish.
``I am convinced we can find a Democrat to beat David Duke in
1999,'' said Russell Henderson, a Democratic political consultant
in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Renwick said he was marveling that the controversies swirling
around Clinton had apparently ended yet another career in public
service, while the president continued to ride high in the polls
and cling to office.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole deal claims another victim,'' Renwick said. ``From
Gennifer Flowers to today, how many victims have been claimed? It
would be quite a large cemetery. And it happens to his friends and
to his enemies. Everyone Clinton touches eventually pays a price.''

AMID MISSILE STRIKES, IRAQIS SEE DIVINE JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD _ As missiles rumbled outside for the fourth and final
night, Mohammed Naji and his family watched the scrambled reception
of Iraqi TV to see the man commanding the US bombing against them
be impeached by his fellow Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton sent his bombs here to topple Saddam,'' said Naji,
staring while tracers and Iraqi anti-aircraft fire rattled outside
his downtown apartment. ``But your Mr. Clinton has toppled himself.
This is the will of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Through shortwave radios and intermittent Iraqi broadcasts, Naji
and millions of Iraqis saw divine justice in the political blow
delivered to Clinton _ who directed the punishing air strikes at
the heart of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's regime.
</P>
<P>
   The dizzying pace of Saturday's news developments _ with the
chaos in Washington, the devastation caused here by US and British
bombing before the end of the offensive Saturday night _ created a
feeling that the political status quo from Washington to Baghdad
was coming unglued.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqis are tuned in to the term ``Wag The Dog'' _ the title of a
political satire of a faked US military attack to protect a
troubled presidency _ and fully conscious of America's questions as
to whether Clinton timed the bombings of Baghdad for the same
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Naji, a 46-year-old printing press operator, along with his wife
and six children, gathered in the living room of their middle-class
apartment while his oldest son adjusted a broken antenna on a 1970s
vintage Sanyo to try to get a picture of American democracy in
action.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi TV reception is severely disrupted since US cruise
missiles have pounded at the government-controlled television and
radio stations' central transmitters near Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   But through the gray static and muffled sound of Iraqi TV and by
tuning into a battered shortwave radio, the family could still get
the picture: that Bill Clinton was the first US president in more
than 130 years to be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American and the Iraqi people are the same. The mistakes
are made by the political leaders and the people suffer,'' said
Naji. ``Clinton lies and we are the victims. Tell me, is he bombing
us to save himself?''
</P>
<P>
   As the sun set here, Iraq broke the fast of the first day of the
Muslim holy month of Ramadan, hoping that the night skies would be
calm. But before the Najis finished their dinner, the air-raid
sirens wailed. And the distant sound of cruise missiles slamming
into Saddam's military and political infrasctructure from the Iraqi
capital in Baghdad to the southern port city of Basrah.
</P>
<P>
   The Naji family said that despite the bombardment, Saddam would
stand and Iraq would endure. The newscast on Iraqi television was
brief and nearly impossible to follow because of the disruption of
the signal. But strangely, the stock videotaped footage of Saddam
Hussein waving heroically to the Iraqi people under the Arches of
Victory in Baghdad was clear and easy to see. The contrast between
Iraq's access to American democracy at work and the heavy-handed
propaganda of the dictatorship was stark.
</P>
<P>
   Naji and his teenage sons prompted his 2-year-old daughter,
Jasmin, to tell an American vistor to their home who was the man in
the military uniform and the thick black mustache on the
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam. Saddam,'' Jasmin said staring at the television.
</P>
<P>
   In a home with a framed portrait of Saddam on the wall next to a
photograph of the Muslim holy city of Mecca, Naji expressed anger
at the United States for targeting Saddam and was furious that the
atttacks have extended into the Muslim holy month.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are bombing on Ramadan,'' said Naji, referring to the
observance of the time when the Muslim holy book, the Koran, was
delivered to the Prophet Mohammed in the 7th Century A.D.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not only an insult to the Iraqi people, this is an
insult to all Muslims all over the world. And it proves once again
that Clinton is a liar,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when Clinton announced the decision to bomb Iraq for
preventing UN weapons inspectors from carrying out their work, he
said the United States had to act quickly in part because Ramadan
was approaching.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said on Monday, ``For us to initiate military action
during Ramadan would be profoundly offensive to the Muslim world
and therefore would damage our relations with Arab countries and
the progress we have made in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq interpreted that as a promise that attacks would end at the
start of Ramadan at dawn Saturday. But the US officials insist that
they made no such promise and vowed that the attacks would continue
until all of the targets are destroyed and the mission is
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely what that mission is remains unclear. The United
States insists that it is not intending to destabalize Saddam's
regime in its massive air attack, which is accompanied by British
forces. But the ``target list,'' as the Pentagon calls it, has
included the regime's Baath Party headquarters, presidential
palaces, a social services building, and communication centers. The
US claims all of these are suspected sites where Saddam has hidden
Iraq's program for weapons of mass destruction. But the Iraqi
government claims these are attacks on the civilian and political
life of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Saturay night, in the Iraqi Ministry of Information, foreign
correspondents from around the world and Iraqi officials crowded
around a cable-connected television that picks up CNN by satellite.
A cluster of muscle-bound and black-leather-clad Iraqi Mukabarat,
or secret service, agents watched as the US House of
Representatives voted to adopt the First Article of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   They looked bored watching American democracy moving in its
slow, grinding pace to impeach the president. One of them yawned
and later asked a fellow Iraqi official in Arabic, ``So what does
this mean? Is he overthrown?''
</P>
<P>
   As the House vote tallies flashed on CNN at 9:15 p.m. local
time, a sudden burst of Iraqi anti-aircraft fire roared outside.
What appeared to be roughly two blocks away, a cruise missile
slammed into another target in downtown Baghdad. Someone yelled,
``Get down!''
</P>
<P>
   And many of the foreign reporters ducked for cover.
</P>
<P>
   After the volley of explosions, Aziz El Herzaji, an official
with the Ministry of Information, pointed to the televised coverage
of the impeachment hearings and said, ``Look at your democracy at
work and look at what it is doing outside.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My family is there behind those buildings across the street,''
added Herzaji, a man in his late 60s, wearing a frayed tweed jacket
and fingering caramel-colored Muslim prayer beeds. ``Clinton? Well,
let him fall. Look at what he is doing to us.''

 &HT;    Falcons shoot for a stress-free win
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. _ This place is miserable this time of year, and
for that matter it's been miserable for the Falcons just about
forever.
</P>
<P>
   But the Silverdome might seem like heaven's doorstep today if
the Falcons' game with the Lions goes as expected.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (12-2) hasn't played in a game this important since
1980. If the Falcons beat Detroit (5-9) today, coach Dan Reeves
probably will lock up the NFL's coach of the year award without
even coaching.
</P>
<P>
   He's recuperating at his Buckhead home from heart-bypass surgery
on Monday, and he'll have to watch on television as his team tries
to clinch its second NFC West title; the other was in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   If the Falcons win, something they haven't done here since 1986
before losing five in a row, the Falcons will have a bye in the
first round of the playoffs and home game the next weekend. Reeves
could use that time.
</P>
<P>
   If they lose and San Francisco (11-3) wins at New England, the
49ers can clinch the NFC West with a win next week at home against
the Rams, a team that San Francisco has beaten 16 times in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves is supposed to avoid any stress. No wonder he said he'll
have team physician Charlie Harrison sitting on the sofa beside
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the team will respond,'' free safety Eugene Robinson
said. ``It's going to be paramount that we limit the stress in his
life as much as possible. The way we're going to do that is by
winning this ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   By appearances, the Falcons should roll over the Lions, a bad
team getting worse. They've been steamrolled the past two weeks,
37-22 by Jacksonville and 35-13 at San Francisco, eliminating them
from playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   They're losing injured players, too, as an MRI on Friday
revealed rookie quarterback Charlie Batch has a compression
fracture in his back. He's out for the final two games; 14-year
veteran Frank Reich will start.
</P>
<P>
   Also, middle linebacker Stephen Boyd, the team's leading
tackler, and promising rookie receiver Germane Crowell might be
finished for the season because of bad shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   The test today is not as much to see if Atlanta can beat Detroit
as it is to see if the systems Reeves has put in place can function
without him.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons defensive coordinator Rich Brooks is interim head coach.
He will remain in the coaches' box to call defenses and will only
be involved in the offense when there is a critical decision.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, quarterbacks coach Jack Burns will call the plays, but
instead of relaying them through Reeves to quarterback Chris
Chandler, they'll be relayed through backup quarterback Steve
DeBerg.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, something like that could have been a huge
distraction,'' said running back Jamal Anderson, the second-leading
rusher in the NFL with 1,596 yards. ``But it's not. One of the
things Dan did was put together a top notch staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel confident everybody understands their role as defined
for the last two years by coach Reeves,'' he said. ``Unfortunately,
he won't be there to see it fulfilled or fall short. I know that's
one thing he would not want to happen. We have to do it for him,
and for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison drove Reeves to team headquarters in Suwanee on
Saturday, three minutes before the 9 a.m. meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The coach met with players and coaches for 10 minutes and left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are a lot of fanatical Falcons fans,'' Reeves
said. ``And this week I'll be one of the biggest ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week, look for Reeves to return to Suwanee on at least a
part-time basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Dan,'' Anderson said. ``He expects the ship to be
sailing straight ahead when he gets back. We intend to see that it
is.

GOP RUSHES TO FILL VOID TO BE LEFT BY LIVINGSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER AND MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans, stunned by the decision of
Speaker-designate Robert L. Livingston to step aside because he had
been unfaithful to his wife, Saturday scrambled to align behind a
new leader and struggled to draw the lines between public lives and
private morality.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the current House leadership, including Speaker Newt
Gingrich, pressed for a quick endorsement of Representative Dennis
Hastert as speaker for the next Congress. Allies of Hastert, a
former high school wrestling coach and restaurateur, late Saturday
released a list of 80 lawmakers who are supporting him in the Jan.
5 election. It will take 112 votes to win.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional aides said Livingston decided to step aside after
being informed Friday that about a dozen conservative Republicans
had reservations about electing him speaker. On Thursday,
Livingston, who is 55 and a father of four grown daughters,
revealed that he had on several occasions ``strayed'' during his
33-year marriage. He said the announcement was prompted by word
that Hustler magazine, which had posted a $1 million bounty for
information about lawmakers' private lives, was preparing a report
on Livingston's past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must set the example that I hope President Clinton will
follow,'' Livingston said in a floor speech delivered just hours
before the House voted to impeach the president. ``I will not stand
for speaker of the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers of both parties fretted about what Livinsgton's
departure augured for those who serve in public office.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's next? Go to the video rental store and check out what
videos they were renting? Do we check the 900 lines?'' asked
Representative Richard Baker, a Republican from Livingston's home
state of Louisiana. ``Where in God's name does the public right to
know end and individual rights begin? We have eviscerated that
line.''
</P>
<P>
   After the impeachment votes, Republicans met privately to decide
how to proceed in the wake of their own sex scandal. During the
meeting, aides said Gingrich rose, listed the five characteristics
of a good speaker, and said Hastert was ``the only one man who has
them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Majority Leader Dick Armey has also endorsed Hastert, and
Majority Whip Tom DeLay told reporters: ``He will make a great
speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, 56, now serves as a deputy whip, whose job is to count
votes for the GOP leadership and maintain contacts with Republican
lawmakers. About 15 or 20 members who are part of the whip
organization met in Hastert's office after Livingston's
announcement and by midafternoon had drafted a letter urging
support for Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert said in a statement that a ``sense of duty now calls me
to serve our free nation by seeking a position of great
responsibility. ... It is a calling that I have not sought;
however, it is a duty that I cannot ignore.''
</P>
<P>
   It was expected that other candidates might vie for the post,
including Representatives Christopher Cox of California.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Mark Souder, an Indiana Republican who supports
Hastert, said that Hastert was not telegenic but that he could heal
divisions in the House. He described Hastert as ``a teddy bear, a
vote-counter, a peacemaker.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, an architect of the House GOP's impeachment strategy,
told colleagues family obligations kept him from running for
speaker. Some members suggested DeLay was too partisan to repair
the deeply divided House.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston was selected by House Republicans on Nov. 18 to
replace Gingrich, who resigned after the November elections. He was
not to take office formally until next month.
</P>
<P>
   It became increasingly clear last week that Livingston had two
predicaments. One was acknowledging his own sexual peccadillos
while leading a party that was impeaching the president for
misconduct related to his. The other was getting the often
unmanageable GOP social conservatives under control next year in
the closely divided House while he was under a moral cloud of his
own.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat, told
Livingston not to give in to the destructive forces that were
pushing honorable people out of public life, and he urged him to
reconsider his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a surrender to a developing sexual McCarthyism,'' Nadler
said to his House colleagues. ``Are we going to have a new test if
someone wants to run for public office: Are you now or have you
ever been an adulterer?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are losing sight of the distinction between sins, which
ought to be between a person and his family and his God, and
crimes, which are the concern of the state and society as a
whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston told his colleagues he was ``prepared to lead our
narrow majority as speaker, and I believe I had it in me to do a
fine job. But I cannot do that kind of job or be the kind of leader
that I would like to be under current circumstances.'' Livingston
said he would retire from Congress next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Livingston did his fair share in creating this atmosphere
of hatred and hostility by participating in this abuse of the
impeachment process,'' said Kim Gandy, executive vice president of
the National Organization for Women. ``Having helped foul this
pond, now he doesn't want to swim in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gandy, who was among a group of feminists who last week pressed
Livingston to censure rather than impeach Clinton, said she feared
a bad precedent was being set for all public servants. ``If you
require that every politician who cheated on his spouse must
resign, you are going to have some loud echoes in Congress and
state legislatures all over the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservative broadcaster Paul Weyrich, who is closely associated
with the Christian right, said he was stunned by Livingston's
decision but said it was exactly, and refreshingly, the right thing
to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, what a terrible thing that morality is having an influence
on politics!'' Weyrich said sarcastically. ``Finally, reality is
catching up with what has been the biggest lie ever perpetrated on
American society: that private actions do not have public
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, Republican Representatives Henry Hyde of
Illinois, Dan Burton of Indiana, and Helen Chenowith of Idaho all
confessed to having had extramarital affairs. Weyrich said such
indiscretions that occurred before they entered Congress should not
disqualify members from public service, but some lawmakers said the
atmosphere was still chilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think ... either of them deserved public disclosure,''
Representative Baker said. ``It only caused great harm to their
families and to people who changed their career plans to work with
them.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Nita Lowey, a New York Democrat, said Livingston
had ``no choice'' but to resign in the climate Republicans have
created in pursuing and impeaching the president for misconduct in
his private life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The path the Republican leadership has chosen to take us on is
destroying this House,'' Lowey said. ``This is a time for
solemnity, not glee, when you see an individual being destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster Frank Luntz said he was ``horrified'' by
what happened to Livingston and predicted the preoccupation with
scandal and private lives could affect the elections in 2000 and
``be an absolute nightmare for the American people, hearing nothing
substantive about politics and everything they don't want to
hear.''

   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ The House vote calling for Bill Clinton's
impeachment went unheard at Bennett's, a camping and military
surplus store that has been a fixture in downtown Little Rock since
1870. There were no televisions, no radios, and no reason for them.
</P>
<P>
   The owner, Joe Kaufman, did not need to see one more nail driven
into the pride of his city and state and into the hearts of the
people who once saw such promise in a favorite son.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's boredom,'' Kaufman said when asked why people in his
store and in the city just seemed to be going about their business
on the day the House of Representatives voted to bring President
Clinton to trial.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that they do not care, only that they are weary of it
all, weary of feeling bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another slap in the face,'' said Kaufman, 73. ``We've been put
down so much, for a man who had shown us such hope and promise.
It's a little like a personal affront, a sinking feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   A Southern state, mostly rural, long defensive over jokes about
its sophistication, had given the nation a president. In return,
people here say, the nation has only piled more derision and
ridicule on them.
</P>
<P>
   In the city where Bill Clinton's political dreams were first
validated by those who believed in him, people accepted the House
vote calling for his impeachment with a sense of resignation,
sorrow, and, some, with satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill did some dumb stuff, but he did some good,'' said Jackie
Cox, who runs Newsmart Liquor in downtown Little Rock and has been
angry with what she sees as a political witch hunt to unseat the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' she said, ``this is all just too much. I feel like
there has to be a quitting place.''
</P>
<P>
   In the television section of Dillard's, a department store in
the upscale Park Plaza shopping center in western Little Rock, 42
of the 56 televisions were turned to the House proceedings. But
there was no crowd to watch it. Many shoppers did not so much as
glance as they moved through the aisles searching for toasters,
china and the perfect gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really tired of this,'' said Carrie Foster, 34, a medical
administrator who was shopping Saturday afternoon with her fiance,
Brian Scott, 30, vice president of a real estate title company.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Foster commented: ``I wish he'd resign and be done with it.
I really don't think it's an impeachable matter.''
</P>
<P>
   But of Clinton's presidency, she said, ``It's a wash,'' and
added: ``He could really have improved the image of the state, put
it in a good light. But he's brought us back down.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she voted for Clinton in 1992, but for Bob Dole in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   There was no remorse in her fiance, who voted against Clinton
both times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lied and he lied before a federal grand jury,'' Scott said.
``Nobody forced him to lie. It's an embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the president's scandals, Scott said: ``I go to regional
meetings in Chicago, and they say to me, `Hey, Bubba.' In Los
Angeles, that's all I heard about. So I started telling them I was
from Texas. And then I stopped going altogether. It's really
embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people shopping in downtown Little Rock had not even heard
about Rep. Robert Livingston, the House speaker-designate, and his
decision to resign after acknowledging that he, too, had had
affairs. The ones who had heard said it was only evidence that all
leaders were flawed, somehow.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't deserve this,'' Jessie Thompson, 59, a hospital
coordinator, said of Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Catlett, 73, the Monroe County judge, from Clarendon, Ark.,
voiced the unease of many here that the vote was pure politics
against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a straight partisan deal,'' Catlett said. ``We all make
mistakes. I think he brought half of it on himself. But I'm not
going to put my foot on a friend. There's some wrong in all of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Estelle, 65, agreed, saying, ``He should not be
crucified.''
</P>
<P>
   Jo Cheek, 62, of Little Rock, is a strong Clinton supporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad, really sad,'' Ms. Cheek said. ``It's tearing the
country up.''
</P>
<P>
   But those who have not supported Clinton had no pity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lied,'' said David Hall, 52, a doctor. ``It's a shame for
the state and the country. He had so much negative press from the
get-go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Monica Lewinsky affair was just the caboose on a train, some
here said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were like the rumors we've heard about around here for
years,'' Hall said, ``so we were not surprised,''.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Victoria, 49, voted for Clinton in 1992 but not in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his dishonesty that brought us to this point,'' she said,
``not politics.''

PENTAGON UPGRADES SUCCESS RATE OF ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon Saturday sharply upgraded its estimate
of how much damage US-led air strikes have inflicted on Saddam
Hussein's military power, leaving open the possibility that the
bombing might soon stop.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, though, many targets _ including those related to
Hussein's nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons program _ have
been only lightly damaged, and several others have not been
attacked at all.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen said Saturday at the
Pentagon's daily news conference, that the impeachment vote in the
House would have no effect on the operation. ``He's still the
commander-in-chief,'' Cohen said. ``We're going to continue to act
accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   As the fourth night of bombing got under way, Cohen claimed the
attacks have ``substantially degraded'' the Iraqi leader's ability
to wage war.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Henry H. Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
declared himself ``very pleased with the results'' and noted
``significant success.''
</P>
<P>
   The upbeat words were explicitly meant to reverse the glum
impression of Friday's news briefing, when Cohen said he was merely
``satisfied'' and Shelton allowed that ``not all'' the strikes had
``gone according to plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the brighter picture, other officers said, was due to
the results of Friday night's ferocious barrage of bombs and cruise
missiles, some of which re-struck targets that they had missed or
just lightly damaged before.
</P>
<P>
   Part of it was also due to revisions by intelligence analysts,
who, one day earlier, had not had time to examine spy-satellite
photos of all the targets.
</P>
<P>
   As of Saturday morning, US and British bombs and missiles had
attacked a total of 97 targets and done at least some damage to all
of them.
</P>
<P>
   This marked an advance over the day before, when a total of 89
targets had been attacked, of which 12 received no damage.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 cruise missiles, each costing nearly $1 million, have
been fired so far from B-52 bombers and ships at sea. An untold
number of laser-guided bombs, but probably at least 300, have also
been dropped by F-14 and F-18 combat planes flying off the USS
Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Only cruise missiles have so far been used over Baghdad,
reflecting the US commanders' extreme caution in this operation.
Officials Saturday said no planes have yet been downed.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, top US officials have said the goal of
Operation Desert Fox is to ``degrade'' and ``diminish'' Hussein's
ability to threaten his neighbors with chemical, nuclear, or
biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen Saturday uttered both of those magic words, saying the
attack has ``substantially degraded'' his warfighting capabilities
and has ``diminished'' his ability to threaten his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   While the secretary declined to declare the mission
accomplished, his words did appear to give his president the option
to make such a declaration if he so desired.
</P>
<P>
   Asked when the air strikes might end, Cohen replied, with almost
circular logic, ``The operation is going to continue until the
president decides it has been completed.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Pentagon reveals more about what kinds of targets are
being hit and not hit, Operation Desert Fox is coming to look less
like a comprehensive attack on Saddam Hussein's ability to make
weapons of mass destruction _ and more like an attempt to
destabilize his grip on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the air strikes have been aimed at Hussein's private
security apparatus, the transmitters that let him communicate with
soldiers in the south of Iraq, and his intelligence headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen has denied that destabilization is the operation's goal.
However, he acknowledged that would certainly be a ``consequence''
of degrading Hussein's military power.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, key elements of what officials say is the main target
_ Hussein's ability to make chemical, nuclear, and biological
weapons _ are going untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen acknowledged Saturday that ``dual-use'' facilities _
plants that produce both chemical weapons and civilian products _
are not being attacked at all, in order to avoid hurting the Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
   It is generally believed dual-use facilities are the only
chemical sites remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Sites that may be producing nuclear and biological weapons are
also absent from the target-list, if they exist at all.
</P>
<P>
   Air strikes have been mounted, however, on sites believed to be
developing and building the missiles that could deliver these
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   As of Saturday morning, the Pentagon claimed to have attacked 11
such sites, inflicting severe damage on one, moderate damage on
five, and light damage on one. The strikes have not destroyed any.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gen. Thomas Wilson, the Joint Staff's intelligence
director, said Saturday that the strikes have set back Iraq's
ability to build long-range missiles by ``at least a year.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that official bomb-damage assessments are ``very
conservative.'' For example, when spy-satellite photos were taken
of the federal building that was blown up in Oklahoma City several
years ago, the assessors deemed the damage to be ``moderate.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Wilson also noted that those facilities can now build
only short-range missiles _ which are allowed by United Nations
resolutions _ and that, even if there were no air strikes, it would
take ``a couple of years'' for the Iraqis to convert them to
long-range weapons. He did emphasize that they seem to have
``plans'' to try and make this conversion.

COST OF WEAPONS MAY BE AROUND $500 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pentagon officials decline to put a dollar figure
on Operation Desert Fox, but the four days probably cost around
$500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Tomahawk cruise missiles, fired from B-52 bombers and Navy
ships, cost about $1 million apiece. Roughly 400 were fired _ or
about $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy's F-14 and F-18 combat planes flew about 200 sorties
over targets outside Baghdad, dropping GBU-15 and GBU-24
laser-guided bombs, which cost about $250,000 and $60,000 apiece,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Officials will not say how many of these bombs were dropped. The
planes can carry between two and four per sortie, so the cost could
run anywhere between $25 million to $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   To replace all these weapons would, therefore, cost between $425
million and $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   This does not include the costs of fuel, repairs, spare parts,
overtime pay and other aspects of basic operations and maintenance,
which are nearly impossible for an outsider _ and very difficult
even for an insider _ to calculate.

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ It was an act of defiance.
</P>
<P>
   They knew their packages addressed to Iraq would not be
accepted. Still, the protesters stood in line Saturday at the
Central Square Post Office, along with people buying stamps and
mailing Christmas packages decorated with wreaths and smiling
Santas.
</P>
<P>
   The 20 brown-paper-wrapped packages each bore a label plainly
describing its contents: Children's Aspirin, Medical Journals,
Water, Dried Fruit, Milk, Bandages, School Books, Pens and Pencils.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, each package was rejected by postal clerks, who
politely noted that United Nations economic sanctions prohibit
mailing packages to Iraq that weigh more than 12 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   The orderly protesters retrieved the boxes and rerouted them,
some to US Senators Edward M. Kennedy and John F. Kerry, others to
President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeline Albright, with a
request that they be forwarded to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the busy Post Office, some 300 activists decried the
bombing of Iraq and called for an end to the eight-year-old
sanctions that have left the country with shortages of medicine,
clean water, and other basics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do we think dropping bombs on people and denying them
medicine will make them like the United States?'' asked Jennifer
Horan, 38, a volunteer for the Cambridge-based Campaign for the
Iraqi People. ``If we are so afraid of terrorism, then what better
way to foster it than starve people and deprive them of medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   The UN imposed economic sanctions on Iraq after its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990. A UN Security Council resolution then barred any UN
member country from trading with Iraq. The only exception is the
``oil for food'' deal begun in 1996, which permits Iraq to sell a
small fraction of its oil for food and medicine. The sanctions will
remain in place until Iraq complies fully with UN weapons
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi leaders blame the sanctions for food shortages,
malnutrition, and premature deaths.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF estimates that more than 1 million children under age 5,
nearly one-third of the youngsters that age in Iraq, are
chronically malnourished.
</P>
<P>
   Signe Taylor, 33, who interviewed Iraqi families in 1992 for a
documentary film about the impact of the Persian Gulf War and the
sanctions, said: ``It's tragic. Children are dying from man-made
causes, not from something like a natural disaster. It's something
we can control. And it's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Diener, 34, who carried a sign that read, ``Don't Wag the
Dog,'' said, ``I think Clinton is trying to cover up his abuse of
power in the bedroom by abusing power in the war room.''

REJECTION OF TWO ARTICLES RAISES DEMOCRAT HOPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House's rejection Saturday of two of the four
articles of impeachment might provide a glimmer of hope among
Democrats that the case against President Clinton has been weakened
and that a Senate trial could be shortened. But Republicans and
some legal analysts doubted it would make much difference.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved two articles of impeachment charging that
Clinton committed perjury before the Whitewater grand jury and
obstructed justice. As expected, the House rejected the abuse of
power article that charged Clinton with supplying false answers to
81 questions submitted by the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But the House, by a 229-205 vote, rejected the article that
accused Clinton of perjury in his deposition for Paula Jones's
civil suit alleging sexual harassment. Clinton's testimony in that
case, after all, set in motion the chain of events leading to the
president's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in testimony he later called ``legally accurate,''
swore he did not have sexual relations with Monica S. Lewinsky.
Clinton's lawyers argued later that Clinton did not commit perjury
because oral sex was not included in the definition of sexual
relations and because the testimony was not ``material.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an argument that may have helped persuade about two dozen
Republicans to vote against Article II.
</P>
<P>
   But Alan Baron, a former Democratic counsel involved with the
impeachment trials of two federal judges before the Senate in 1988
and 1989, said he did not think it would make much difference that
the House rejected the civil perjury article.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Martin T. Meehan, the Massachusetts Democrat,
said failure to approve the civil perjury article ``significantly
weakens the case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely bizarre to have the House on record saying
the president perjured himself before the grand jury in explaining
his civil deposition testimony, yet at the same time expressly
rejecting an article of impeachment alleging civil deposition
perjury,'' he said.

 &HT;    MEMBERS WORRY ABOUT ADULTERY 'LITMUS TEST' FOR CONGRESS
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawmakers warned Saturday that a spreading ``sexual
McCarthyism'' may become the new litmus test for public office
following House Speaker-designate Bob Livingston's announcement
that he would resign over adultery charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot be the kind of leader that I would like to be,''
Livingston said. ``So I must set the example.''
</P>
<P>
   Three other Republicans _ Henry Hyde of Illinois, Dan Burton of
Indiana and Helen Chenoweth of Idaho, were re-elected to the House
last month despite recent confessions of extramarital affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But as Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt reportedly has
gathered information on a dozen elected or appointed officials with
his $1 million offer for details of extramarital affairs with them,
the decision by Livingston, R-La., seemed likely to reignite the
debate over the boundaries of morality and fitness for office.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no perfect people and we all make mistakes,'' said
Randy Tate, executive director of the Christian Coalition. ``But
it's unavoidable today that your personal life won't be on display.
And we have always wanted our elected officials to live up to the
highest moral standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans praised Livingston for his difficult decision but
acknowledged that it would raise the bar for those seeking to
replace him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to have to be a thorough vetting process'' for
the next speaker, said Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston ``understood what this debate was all about _ it's
about honor and decency and integrity and the truth, everything we
honor in this country,'' said House Majority Whip Tom DeLay,
R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't criticize the president's behavior as being
unacceptable and then not consider this as material, just ignore
this and brush it aside,'' said Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, members from both parties warned that private
behavior was not a proper standard for public service.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., called Livingston's resignation ``a
surrender to a developing sexual McCarthyism.'' He asked, ``Are we
going to have a new test: If someone wants to run for public
office, are you now or have you ever been an adulterer?''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, who admitted to an affair decades ago, said Saturday,
``Those of us who are sinners must feel wretched today. Something
is going on repeatedly that has to be stopped, and that is a
confusion between private acts of infidelity and public acts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to stop destroying imperfect people at the alter of
unattainable morality,'' said House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt,
D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   And after the impeachment vote, nearly the entire Democratic
caucus stood behind President Clinton as he made clear that he
would not resign and declared, ``We must stop the politics of
personal attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., one of Clinton's most vociferous
defenders, said Livingston's demise may spark a backlash over the
influence that Christian conservatives are having on the Republican
Party. ``This will mark the high point of the religious right,'' he
said.

MEDIA, CONSERVATIVE GOP KEPT POT BOILING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 11 months since Matt Drudge first posted the name Monica
Lewinsky on his Web site, most Americans have consistently said
that they wanted the whole sordid mess to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout a turbulent year that has culminated in the
impeachment of a popular Democratic president, two major forces
have defied public opinion to keep a story that broke in January
smoldering on the front burner _ Republicans on Capitol Hill and
the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about strange bedfellows. Conservatives have found common
cause with same Beltway/New York media axis that they have
frequently dismissed as elitist liberal dupes. (In the waning hours
of their losing campaigns against Clinton in 1992 and 1996, George
Bush and Bob Dole both complained of left-leaning media bias. And
influential conservatives from Rush Limbaugh to Rupert Murdoch have
long chanted the mantra of liberal media tilt.)
</P>
<P>
   Journalism's preoccupation with the Lewinsky scandal may not
conclusively demolish the charge of liberal bias. But at a minimum,
it strongly suggests that no ``ism'' will get in the way of the
relentless pursuit of a story with all the juicy elements of this
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This story had irresistable ingredients...it had conflict,
sex, jeopardy and downfall,'' said Tom Rosenstiel, vice-chairman of
the Project for Excellence in Journalism. Noting that Ronald Reagan
once compared journalists to sharks who sense blood in the water,
Rosenstiel said that ``Democrats bleed the same blood as
Republicans. Our animal instincts as journalists, for better or
worse, aren't guided by ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In an age of miserably low civic education and public
distraction from the news, sex sells,'' said media analyst and
``Feeding Frenzy'' author Larry Sabato. ``It's the oldest line in
the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Giles, executive director of the Media Studies Center in
New York, said that in discussions with citizens about press
fairness, his organization found that ``they are much more
concerned'' about accuracy and sensationalism than about ``any
perceived ideological bias.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can look at the coverage of the press throughout
this year and be hard pressed to find any evidence of so-called
liberal bias,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   As the year's events unfolded _ from the first reports about a
DNA-stained dress to salacious tales of cigar sex acts to the
release of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report and finally
to a congressional impeachment debate _ there was some good news
for journalists. ``Public respect for the press in terms of being
accurate grew and grew as time went on,'' said Giles.
</P>
<P>
   The early failing grades did improve. By October, a Media
Studies Center survey revealed that 52 percent of the public
thought coverage of the scandal was good or excellent, up from only
36 percent in January. A similar poll in late August by the Pew
Research Center For the People and the Press found 55 percent
lauding the media's peformance compared to only 42 percent a few
months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, on one major point _ the charge of overkill _ public
opinion has remained resolutely unchanged. In a survey released
last week, Pew found that 64 percent thought the media had paid too
much attention to the Lewinsky investigation while only 2 percent
thought too little attention had been lavished on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Fred Barnes, executive editor of the
conservative Weekly Standard magazine, acknowledged that charges of
liberal media bias may have contributed to the public's disconnect
with the story. Conservatives ``have so inoculated the public that
you can't trust that media (that) the public demands more than just
the media saying the president did something wrong,'' he said, with
more than a touch of irony.
</P>
<P>
   Some journalism observers see another kind of media bias at play
here that has nothing to do with ideology: economic self-interest.
Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center, said ``the
arithmetic of scandal is that you don't need more than 20 percent
of the public'' to reap economic benefits for the media. ``If the
media has a bias, it is not an ideological one,'' he said. ``It's
in favor of themselves, in favor of building audience, in favor of
building careers.''
</P>
<P>
   The salacious scandal was a boon to a news industry in search of
what Rosenstiel called the next ``summer crossover blockbuster'' on
the heels of two big mega-hits, the Simpson case and the death of
Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   ``The national press, the mass media are in crisis because
they're losing audience share. There is no mass audience for news
anymore,'' he said. ``For national news and the big media to
thrive, they need to somehow reassemble that audience.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Andrew Tyndall who analyzes broadcast network news,
Lewinsky coverage passed the ultimate milestone in early December.
With nearly 1,800 minutes having been devoted to the scandal on the
CBS, NBC and ABC nightly newscasts, the saga surpassed the airtime
given to the O.J. Simpson murder case in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the impetus for this saturation coverage was also the
emergence of new players in the news business. This was the first
major story to unfold in the era of two new media that have a
relentless, voracious appetite for news: the Internet and 24-hour
cable news networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an everything-driven story,'' said press critic
Steven Brill, describing the convergence of all these forms of
media in scandal coverage. ``You really can't separate (the various
media) anymore. Print people are on television. Print is online and
television is online.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Rosenstiel believes journalism is already paying a
price in for its constant attention to this ugly episode. ``The
press coverage of this is one of the reasons that the public has
turned off,'' he said. ``It's out of proportion. It's almost
numbing.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the media and the Washington politicians are
co-conspirators in alienating large segments of the public,
journalists may end up getting off relatively easy. When asked by
the Pew poll whether 1998 has been a good year for the media, 52
percent said yes. In contrast, only one-third of the public thought
it had been a good year for the major political parties.

SANTA CLAUS WANTS HIS FAIR SHARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A five-hour meeting in New York between Santa and department
store owners ended today with neither side reporting progress.
</P>
<P>
   Unless an agreement is reached soon, it appears Santa Claus
``won't'' be coming to town.
</P>
<P>
   The holiday season is in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   For generations, St. Nick has brought joy to children of all
ages, free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   But those days are over.
</P>
<P>
   Santa has turned pro.
</P>
<P>
   According to Santa's agent _ Santa now has an agent _ ``My
client feels he is an integral part of the spirit of Christmas and
is largely responsible for its financial success. I think it is
reasonable to suggest Mr. Claus is as important to the economic
prosperity of Christmas as Michael Jordan is to the NBA or Randy
Johnson to major league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is good.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is how to divide $2.6 trillion in holiday season
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Santa reportedly is asking for 58 percent of profits from retail
sales. Negotiators for merchants have called the demands
``outrageous'' and said, ``Santa doesn't understand the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Store owners have offered 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The public already has felt the effects of the four-month-long
labor dispute. Santa has canceled most public appearances. &QL; 
That smile will cost you &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the jolly old man appeared (for a fee) at a Nike
store to promote his new line of athletic shoes _ Air Claus.
</P>
<P>
   Santa signed autographs, for $5 each.
</P>
<P>
   He also charged $4 per ``Ho!'' or three for $10.
</P>
<P>
   Before lifting any child onto his knee and asking, ``And what
would you like for Christmas?'' Santa's agent collected $7.50.
</P>
<P>
   And pocketed $1.94 for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Santa also showed up at last week's Cardinals-Eagles game at
Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   He was booed.
</P>
<P>
   Santa says this isn't about money.
</P>
<P>
   But Claus is profiting during this usually quiet December. He
has appeared on the TV home shopping network three times. A limited
number of Santa collectibles and a new music video featuring Santa
and Pete Rose _ ``Nick &AMP; Pete's White Christmas ''_ sold quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jeff Gordon, Santa has his own Web site: www.jingle.com. &QL; 
Times change &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Privately, the elves say Santa seems different since he turned
professional. Even Rudolph has noticed a change.
</P>
<P>
   Santa is taking androstenedione.
</P>
<P>
   He ditched the old itchy red outfit. He wears Armani.
</P>
<P>
   Santa favors sunglasses and sports a gold neck chain with a
pendant that says ``Claus No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Santa has an earring.
</P>
<P>
   The sleigh is out, replaced by a black Mercedes, with
personalized plates.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview with Jim Rome, Santa said he is eager to
go to work but won't be railroaded into accepting a bad deal from
``greedy'' store owners.
</P>
<P>
   Santa also told the radio host he is unhappy living in the North
Pole because it's not a major media market.
</P>
<P>
   Santa said he prefers a warm-weather city. Like LA.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   St. Nick and Mike Tyson have become friends.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a percentage of all holiday season profits (the
season defined in the proposed contract as beginning the day after
Thanksgiving and ending the day after the Super Bowl) Santa wants
the use of a private jet on the night before Christmas. He won't
fly commercial. Forget flying coach.
</P>
<P>
   As for home delivery, Santa will not walk on any snow-covered
roofs.
</P>
<P>
   One slip and he could tear a cartilage.
</P>
<P>
   Santa won't play hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Santa's agent said that because of legal issues, his client
won't slide down the chimney of any dwelling. He only will enter
and exit the front door.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still hopeful an agreement satisfactory to everyone can
be reached,'' Santa's agent said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only want what is fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have ruled out postponing Christmas until February.
</P>
<P>
   No new talks are scheduled. &QL;

MEDIA, CONSERVATIVE GOP KEPT POT BOILING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 11 months since Matt Drudge first posted the name Monica
Lewinsky on his Web site, most Americans have consistently said
that they wanted the whole sordid mess to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout a turbulent year that has culminated in the
impeachment of a popular Democratic president, two major forces
have defied public opinion to keep a story that broke in January
smoldering on the front burner _ Republicans on Capitol Hill and
the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about strange bedfellows. Conservatives have found common
cause with same Beltway/New York media axis that they have
frequently dismissed as elitist liberal dupes. (In the waning hours
of their losing campaigns against Clinton in 1992 and 1996, George
Bush and Bob Dole both complained of left-leaning media bias. And
influential conservatives from Rush Limbaugh to Rupert Murdoch have
long chanted the mantra of liberal media tilt.)
</P>
<P>
   Journalism's preoccupation with the Lewinsky scandal may not
conclusively demolish the charge of liberal bias. But at a minimum,
it strongly suggests that no ``ism'' will get in the way of the
relentless pursuit of a story with all the juicy elements of this
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This story had irresistable ingredients...it had conflict,
sex, jeopardy and downfall,'' said Tom Rosenstiel, vice-chairman of
the Project for Excellence in Journalism. Noting that Ronald Reagan
once compared journalists to sharks who sense blood in the water,
Rosenstiel said that ``Democrats bleed the same blood as
Republicans. Our animal instincts as journalists, for better or
worse, aren't guided by ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In an age of miserably low civic education and public
distraction from the news, sex sells,'' said media analyst and
``Feeding Frenzy'' author Larry Sabato. ``It's the oldest line in
the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Giles, executive director of the Media Studies Center in
New York, said that in discussions with citizens about press
fairness, his organization found that ``they are much more
concerned'' about accuracy and sensationalism than about ``any
perceived ideological bias.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can look at the coverage of the press throughout
this year and be hard pressed to find any evidence of so-called
liberal bias,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   As the year's events unfolded _ from the first reports about a
DNA-stained dress to salacious tales of cigar sex acts to the
release of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report and finally
to a congressional impeachment debate _ there was some good news
for journalists. ``Public respect for the press in terms of being
accurate grew and grew as time went on,'' said Giles.
</P>
<P>
   The early failing grades did improve. By October, a Media
Studies Center survey revealed that 52 percent of the public
thought coverage of the scandal was good or excellent, up from only
36 percent in January. A similar poll in late August by the Pew
Research Center For the People and the Press found 55 percent
lauding the media's peformance compared to only 42 percent a few
months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, on one major point _ the charge of overkill _ public
opinion has remained resolutely unchanged. In a survey released
last week, Pew found that 64 percent thought the media had paid too
much attention to the Lewinsky investigation while only 2 percent
thought too little attention had been lavished on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Fred Barnes, executive editor of the
conservative Weekly Standard magazine, acknowledged that charges of
liberal media bias may have contributed to the public's disconnect
with the story. Conservatives ``have so inoculated the public that
you can't trust that media (that) the public demands more than just
the media saying the president did something wrong,'' he said, with
more than a touch of irony.
</P>
<P>
   Some journalism observers see another kind of media bias at play
here that has nothing to do with ideology: economic self-interest.
Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center, said ``the
arithmetic of scandal is that you don't need more than 20 percent
of the public'' to reap economic benefits for the media. ``If the
media has a bias, it is not an ideological one,'' he said. ``It's
in favor of themselves, in favor of building audience, in favor of
building careers.''
</P>
<P>
   The salacious scandal was a boon to a news industry in search of
what Rosenstiel called the next ``summer crossover blockbuster'' on
the heels of two big mega-hits, the Simpson case and the death of
Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   ``The national press, the mass media are in crisis because
they're losing audience share. There is no mass audience for news
anymore,'' he said. ``For national news and the big media to
thrive, they need to somehow reassemble that audience.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Andrew Tyndall who analyzes broadcast network news,
Lewinsky coverage passed the ultimate milestone in early December.
With nearly 1,800 minutes having been devoted to the scandal on the
CBS, NBC and ABC nightly newscasts, the saga surpassed the airtime
given to the O.J. Simpson murder case in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the impetus for this saturation coverage was also the
emergence of new players in the news business. This was the first
major story to unfold in the era of two new media that have a
relentless, voracious appetite for news: the Internet and 24-hour
cable news networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an everything-driven story,'' said press critic
Steven Brill, describing the convergence of all these forms of
media in scandal coverage. ``You really can't separate (the various
media) anymore. Print people are on television. Print is online and
television is online.''

press coverage of this is one of the reasons that the public has
turned off,'' he said. ``It's out of proportion. It's almost
numbing.''

journalists may end up getting off relatively easy. When asked by

DEFIANT CLINTON DECRIES `POLITICS OF PERSONAL DESTRUCTION' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton Saturday vowed to remain in
office ``until the last hour of the last day of my term,''
resisting calls for his resignation after becoming only the second
US president to be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by Democratic congressional leaders and rank-and-file
members who descended on the White House after the House approved
two articles of impeachment, Clinton said, ``We must stop the
politics of personal destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Washington is beginning to look to America like it is
``coming apart.'' One way out of the jam, he said, is for the
Senate to work with him in finding a ``reasonable bipartisan and
proportionate response'' that is ``constitutional and fair'' and
that allows him to stay in office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton walked out of the White House, with Hillary Rodham
Clinton clutching his arm, to applause from dozens of Democratic
members of Congress who had gathered behind a small roped-off area
on the South Lawn. As Clinton spoke, there were scattered protests
from people who oppose the bombing of Iraq and the impeachment of
Clinton, as well as those calling for Clinton's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The calls for his resignation are expected to intensify in the
aftermath of Saturday's resignation of the House speaker-designate,
Robert L. Livingston, two days after he admitted to having been
unfaithful to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he had ``accepted responsibility for what I did wrong in
my personal life,'' Clinton asked: ``The question is what are we
going to do now?''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, after Livingston announced his plan to resign on the
floor of the House, Clinton, through his spokesman Joseph Lockhart,
joined some Democrats in asking the speaker-designate to
reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president firmly believes that the politics of personal
destruction in this town and this country has to come to an end,
and it has to stop soon,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   And in that spirit, he said, ``The president's wish is that
Representative Livingston would reconsider the decision he
announced on the floor.'' The quick response was an attempt to
blunt any pressure on Clinton to follow Livingston's lead. ``We
need to stop playing these kinds of games in Washington,'' Lockhart
said, referring to ``this insidious politics of personal
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Clinton made clear he has no intention of
resigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the American people to know today that I am still
committed to working with people of good faith and good will of
both parties to do what's best for our country, to bring our nation
together, to lift our people up, to move us all forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It's what I've tried to do for six years. It's what
I intend to do for two more _ until the last hour of the last day
of my term.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore said Saturday was ``the saddest day I
have seen in our nation's capital.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the House vote to impeach Clinton for perjury and
obstruction of justice without allowing a vote on censure ``does a
great disservice to a man I believe will be regarded in the history
books as one of our greatest presidents. . .There is no doubt in my
mind that the verdict of history will undo the unworthy judgment
rendered'' by the House vote, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to thwart a party-line vote in the Senate, Clinton
implored lawmakers of both political parties to create ``some
atmosphere of decency and civility, some presumption of good faith,
some sense of proportionality and balance in bringing judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``We must get rid of the poisonous venom of excessive
partisanship, obsessive animosity and uncontrolled anger.''
</P>
<P>
   As the House voted on the first article of impeachment, a count
of perjury, Clinton was in the Oval Office finishing a prayer
meeting with his spiritual adviser, the Rev. Tony Campolo, who
later described Clinton as being ``tired.''
</P>
<P>
   The president was interrupted by this aides, chief of staff John
Podesta and senior adviser Doug Sosnik, who broke the news that the
House had voted out the first article of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   After Campolo left, Clinton watched the vote on the next three
articles, two of which failed, with Podesta and Sosnik. They were
later joined by the president's new deputy chief of staff, Steve
Ricchetti. The four men huddled in the private study off the Oval
Office, the same small space where Clinton often met and exchanged
gifts with former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky, the woman
whose affair with the president has brought him to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton did not speak after the vote, but she paid an early
morning visit to the Capitol, where she received several standing
ovations during a closed-door meeting with the House Democratic
Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats described the meeting as a pep rally filled
with emotion, through which Mrs. Clinton kept her calm.
</P>
<P>
   They said the first lady told them she watched the House
impeachment debate and felt that many members were extraordinarily
eloquent in phrasing their explanations of why the offenses charged
against her husband were not reasons to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Jim Moran, a Democrat from Virgina, said of Mrs.
Clinton: ``She was both personal but also very much professional in
her approach to the caucus.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Chet Edwards, a Democrat from Texas, quoted the
first lady as saying, ``I love and care dearly about my husband.''

CLINTON VOWS TO FIGHT IMPEACHMENT, ASKS RETURN TO CIVILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, pleading for an end to ``the
politics of self destruction,'' vowed Saturday to fight rather than
resign after becoming the first chief executive in 130 years to be
impeached
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who is facing a trial in the Senate, appealed for ``a
reasonable, bipartisan and proportionate'' punishment for his
cover-up of a sexual relationship with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In a dramatic response to his new status as the only elected
president ever to be impeached, Clinton faced reporters and cameras
on the White House lawn just two hours after the House approved two
articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   There, under glowering skies and with Hillary Rodham Clinton,
Vice President Al Gore and House Democrats standing by, Clinton
said he would press the Senate for a ``fair means of resolving this
matter in a prompt manner.''
</P>
<P>
   He had been challenged to resign earlier in the day by House
Speaker-apparent Bob Livingston, R-La., who said he would ``set the
example'' by stepping aside himself. Livingston had admitted two
days earlier that he had ``strayed'' from his 33-year-year
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton did not mention the word ``resign'' during his
brief remarks, House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.,
told reporters afterwards that Democratic leaders privately had
urged him not to step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard him very clearly say that he will not resign,''
Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the briefing on the South Lawn: ``We must stop the
politics of personal destruction. We must get rid of the poisonous
venom of excessive partisanship, obsessive animosity and
uncontrolled anger. That is not what America deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton silently nodded her agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton portrayed himself as a busy chief executive conducting
the nation's business despite the political backdrop of
congressional Republicans pressing to oust him.
</P>
<P>
   The president left the podium to join a meeting of his national
security advisers to discuss the four-day U.S.-led bombing campaign
against Iraq to punish defiance of U.N.-required weapons
inspection. Clinton emerged two hours later to announce that an end
to the bombing of Iraq because the campaign had achieved its
objectives.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a career politician who had dreamed of the presidency
since shaking hands with John F. Kennedy in 1963, could barely
disguise his disappointment. He prayed with his religious
counselor, Rev. Tony Campolo, in the Oval Office as the House
approved the first article of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Campolo, a friend of Clinton's from the New Year's Renaissance
Weekends in Hilton Head, S.C., and a sociology professor at Eastern
College in St. Davids, Pa., later said that Clinton appeared ``very
tired.''
</P>
<P>
   White House Chief of Staff John Podesta and political adviser
Doug Sosnik entered the Oval Office prayer session to tell the
president that the House had taken action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sober moment, and he reflects it,'' Podesta said
afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Podesta and Sosnik then went to Clinton's private study
off the Oval Office to watch televised coverage of House action on
the remaining three articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, closeted in the presidential residence with the
Clintons' daughter Chelsea, was not with her husband as the House
voted. She had visited the Capitol to rally House Democrats shortly
before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton faces a Senate trial on charges of lying to a federal
grand jury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The last president impeached by the House was Andrew Johnson in
1868 in a political dispute over the harshness of federal
occupation of the defeated Confederacy. Johnson, who succeeded to
the presidency after Abraham Lincoln was assassinated in 1865,
escaped ouster from office by one vote in his Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   President Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 after the House
Judiciary Committee lodged impeachment charges but before final
action in the House.

</P>
<P>
   Clinton's post-impeachment appearance was rich with symbolism.
About 100 House Democrats who had spent the last two days battling
Clinton's impending impeachment on the House floor encircled him.
</P>
<P>
   The president and first lady, her arm clutching the president's
elbow, parted the tide of supporters to reach the podium. The
president clutched Mrs. Clinton's hand as Gore declared that ``what
America needs is not resignations but the renewal of civility,
respect for one another.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials were already mapping Clinton's defense in
the Senate; if 67 senators vote to convict, Clinton would
automatically be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials hope to cut short the Senate trial by
wooing six moderate GOP senators to join the 45 Democrats in
adopting a bipartisan resolution of censure.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said they hope to enlist the help of
former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, a
well-respected centrist who left the Senate in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole, the GOP's 1996 presidential candidate and a former
Senate GOP leader, proposed last week that Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss., introduce a joint congressional resolution to
censure Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, however, has signaled a determination to launch a Senate
trial _ a prospect feared by the White House because the
proceedings might be protracted and unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., an early critic of Clinton in
the Senate, said last week that he could not predict the outcome of
a Senate trial.

 &HT;    U.S., BRITAIN CALL OFF AIR STRIKES AGAINST IRAQ -- FOR NOW
 &HT;    With IRAQ-SCENE-1220, IRAQ-PROPAGANDA-1220.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After four days of massive airstrikes against the
soldiers and facilities Saddam Hussein relies upon to retain power
in Iraq, President Clinton ordered an end to the bombing Saturday
and announced a long-term strategy to work with anti-Saddam forces
to topple the dictator.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring that the objectives of Operation Desert Fox have been
achieved, Clinton said the United States and its allies would now
``intensify our engagement with the Iraqi opposition groups,
prudently and effectively'' to end Saddam's regime. He said the
United States would help any ``new leadership'' that emerges in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the long term, the best way to end the threat that Saddam
poses to his own people and the region is for Iraq to have a
different government,'' Clinton said in a brief announcement at the
White House. ``We hope that we will return Iraq to its rightful
place in the community of nations.''
</P>
<P>
   In London, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, backing the
president's long-term strategy, addressed himself to the Iraqi
people, saying, ``We have a common enemy in Saddam.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the United States and its allies will retain a
significant military force in the region that will be used again in
the event that there is evidence of Saddam threatening his
neighbors or resuming efforts to build weapons of mass destruction.
He also said economic sanctions against Iraq would continue.
</P>
<P>
   Although Iraqi officials indicated earlier in the day that they
would no longer allow United Nations weapons inspectors in the
country, Clinton expressed hope that the inspection process could
resume.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq remained defiant, however, as protests and tensions spread
throughout the Arab world, which began observing Ramadan, a holy
Muslim month. Rioters in Damascus attacked the U.S. and British
embassies and broke into the U.S. ambassador's residence in the
Syrian capital. And officials in the United Arab Emirates, Iran and
Egypt called on Clinton to halt the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you that Iraq will continue to defend its land, policy
and dignity . . . We will fight until the last citizen,'' Iraqi
Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan told a news conference in
Baghdad. He also vowed that the mission of the U.N. Special
Commission, known as UNSCOM, is over.
</P>
<P>
   The commission was created at the end of the 1991 Gulf War to
oversee the destruction of banned Iraqi weapons and the means to
produce them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything related to inspections and the Special Commission
is now behind us,'' Ramadan said.
</P>
<P>
   After the president's announcement, Cohen said the four-day,
70-hour operation had successfully hit 100 targets, with a minimum
number of civilian casualties. He said U.S. and British forces in
the conflict had not suffered any casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Before Saturday's attacks, the United States fired nearly 300
Tomahawk cruise missiles from ships in the Persian Gulf or from
B-52 bombers. The missiles carry warheads weighing up to 3,000
pounds
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appeal to anti-Saddam forces in Iraq began earlier
Saturday with a radio address.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll strengthen our engagement with Iraqis who want a new
government, one that will respect its citizens and live in peace
with its neighbors,'' he said. ``We must not harbor illusions,
however, that change will come easily or quickly. But we should go
forward and we will with determination, working with opposition
groups, strengthening the global consensus for bringing Iraq a
government worthy of its people.''
</P>
<P>
   This appears to have been a major goal from the beginning of
Operation Desert Fox. Primary targets of the bombings have been the
Republican Guard, the regime's most loyal soldiers, and the
facilities used by the regime for intelligence, propaganda and
security.
</P>
<P>
   The air strikes on Baghdad began much earlier Saturday than the
three previous days of bombing. They came about 6:30 p.m. (Iraq
time), ending hope that the barrages would stop with the beginning
of Ramadan. Witnesses said six Iraqis were injured, one seriously,
when three missiles landed near a welfare office in a residential
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters were shown a crater approximately 30 feet wide and 25
feet deep. The blast threw mud, rocks and missile parts over nearby
streets, and the crater remained hot to the touch two hours after
impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must ask them why they bombed this place. The children are
crying they are afraid,'' said Saad Aimed, who lives three houses
away from the crater.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said the bombed building was a complex for government
benefits. However, they also acknowledged that U.N. weapons
inspectors had come to visit the site at least twice, the last time
two months ago. They said the inspectors were allowed inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a military area. It is not a warehouse for military
things. It is only for the public,'' said Aimed Sibiu, a
32-year-old electrician. ``It takes care of poor people.''
</P>
<P>
   The first day of Ramadan is traditionally a tense and difficult
one as Muslims forego eating, drinking or smoking from sunrise to
sunset. But in Baghdad there seemed to be additional tension caused
by four sleepless nights of missile strikes.
</P>
<P>
   There also appeared to be more than the usual number of militia
from Saddam's Baath Party keeping watch on street corners.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqis awoke Saturday morning to the site of one of the Baath
Party headquarters, a large complex with two 10-story buildings,
apparently gutted and destroyed by repeated missile strikes. The
missiles appeared to have entered from the roof, leaving the walls
intact but hollowing out the inside amid plumes of flames.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second downtown landmark to be destroyed by missiles.
On the first night of bombing, missiles gutted the high-rise
offices of Iraq's military industry.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Iraqis maintained at least a facade of defiance and
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Iraq are more determined to support the
leadership and the central leader, President Saddam Hussein,'' said
Ramadan, the deputy chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council.
</P>
<P>
   On a street in Baghdad, rank-and-file soldiers said they were
equally steadfast.
</P>
<P>
   Near a monument to the Iran-Iraq war, Amar Hamed, a 24-year-old
soldier, showed reporters a handwritten oath of loyalty to Saddam
that he had marked in blood with five of his fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   ``These fireworks don't scare us,'' he said. ``We will stay here
against American or Britain or any country for all time and we will
sacrifice ourselves for him (Saddam).''

CLINTON IMPEACHED ON TWO COUNTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House impeached President Clinton Saturday for
obstructing justice and lying to a federal grand jury about his
sexual affair with a former White House intern, forever tarnishing
his legacy and forcing the Senate to decide his fate.
</P>
<P>
   Rocked by partisan tumult and the startling resignation of the
speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston, the Republican-controlled House
approved the two charges almost entirely on party lines, impeaching
a president for the first time in 130 years and only the second
time in history.
</P>
<P>
   Two other charges _ abuse of power and lying under oath in a
civil deposition _ were rejected after a turbulent debate marked by
soaring rhetoric, raw anger and conflicting visions of the
consequences of recommending the 42d president's removal from
office.
</P>
<P>
   In the somber aftermath, Representative Henry J. Hyde, chairman
of the House Judiciary Committee, carried two leather-bound
articles of impeachment through the grand, chandeliered halls of
Congress to the Senate, where the final chapter of Clinton's crisis
will unfold.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, barring a negotiated resolution, will put Clinton on
trial when the 106th Congress convenes in early January. If 67
senators vote to convict him on either charge, he automatically
would be removed from office, the first president ever to endure
such disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have fulfilled our duty to our magnificent Constitution,''
said Livingston, who earlier had shocked the House by announcing he
will resign _ and abandon his pending speakership _ amid
controversy over his recently disclosed adultery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not ruled by kings or emperors,'' Livingston said,
``and there is no divine right of presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, portraying his impeachment as the product of
``poisonous venom and excessive partisanship,'' vowed afterward to
serve out his term despite a fresh flurry of calls for his
resignation. He made the pledge on the White House lawn, surrounded
by House Democrats who had waged a futile struggle to spare him
from the shame of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have just witnessed a partisan vote that was a disgrace to
our country and our Constitution,'' said the House Democratic
leader, Richard A. Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   On a gray, wintry day in Washington, as US forces continued a
massive air strike against Iraq, the first impeachment count passed
the House at 1:25 p.m. six days before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   The charge alleges that Clinton repeatedly and ``willfully
provided perjurious, false and misleading testimony'' to a federal
grand jury investigating his illicit affair with the former intern,
Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Article I is approved,'' announced Representative Ray LaHood,
an Illinois Republican who presided over the climactic, two-day
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Five members of each party broke ranks as the House approved the
charge, 228-206. The only New England lawmakers who voted for the
count were New Hampshire Representatives Charles F. Bass and John
E. Sununu, and Representative Nancy L. Johnson of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   At 1:59, the obstruction of justice charge passed by a narrower
margin, 221-216, as the five dissenting Democrats made the
difference by joining 216 GOP lawmakers in supporting the count.
Twelve Republicans opposed the charge, including Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   That left Bass and Sununu as the only New Englanders supporting
the obstruction allegation, which lists seven charges that Clinton
engaged in an elaborate coverup to conceal his affair with Lewinsky
in the face of a sexual harassment suit that was filed against him
by Paula Corbin Jones and settled last month for $850,000.
</P>
<P>
   Each impeachment charge states: ``William Jefferson Clinton has
undermined the integrity of his office, has brought disrepute on
the presidency, has betrayed his trust as president, and has acted
in a manner subversive of the rule of law and justice, to the
manifest injury of the people of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, said he has begun the
process of organizing a trial and senators were ``prepared to
fulfill their constitutional obligations'' in the impeachment case.
</P>
<P>
   A number of senators in both parties issued statements declaring
their sadness about the impeachment and their intention to judge
Clinton fairly. Others expressed outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House action is an insult to the country and the
Constitution,'' said Senator Edward M. Kennedy. ``The impeachment
resolution is irreparably poisoned by the vindictive partisanship
of the House Republican extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry was no less harsh. Blasting the GOP
refusal to allow a censure vote, he said, ``That is disgraceful,
and the Republicans will pay a high price for their fear of the
democratic process.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry added: ``We desperately need to move away from this
modern-day Salem witchhunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Tom Allen, a Maine Democrat who voted against two
articles and expressed opposition to all of them, did not vote on
the obstruction count because he rushed home to attend part of his
daughter's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   He left a House divided. ``My God, what kind of country are we
becoming?'' Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts
Democrat, said on the House floor. ``What kind of institution are
we becoming?''
</P>
<P>
   The House rejected the charge that Clinton lied under oath in
the civil deposition, 229-205, as 29 Republicans broke ranks,
including Representative Christopher Shays of Connecticut, the only
GOP member from New England to vote against all four counts. Bass,
Sununu and Johnson supported the charge.
</P>
<P>
   The final count, alleging abuse of power, was handily rejected,
285-148, with Sununu the only New Englander to support it.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, at 2:13 p.m., ended Clinton's impeachment oddysey in
the House, which deeply divided the institution and indirectly
toppled two speakers, Newt Gingrich, and his would-be successor,
Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   In a stunning development, Livingston was midway through a
speech calling on Clinton to resign when several Democrats began
chanting, ``You resign, you resign.'' And Livingston ironically
_and coincidentally _ obliged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must set the example that I hope President Clinton will
follow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an unprecedented scene, the House was occupied for the next
several hours both with debating Clinton's impeachment and a mad
scramble among GOP leaders for the suddenly vacant speakership.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the chaos, Hyde sought to stay the course toward completing
the House case against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Equal justice under the law, that's what we're fighting for,''
Hyde said in an impassioned appeal for Clinton's impeachment.
``When the chief law enforcement officer trivializes, ignores,
shreds and minimizes the sanctity of the oath, then justice is
wounded, and you're wounded, and your children are wounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats denounced what they described as a partisan vendetta
against Clinton orchestrated by a small group of conservative
leaders. They set the tone for debate immediately after they
uttered the last words of the pledge of allegiance, ``liberty and
justice for all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All! All! All!'' they chanted to protest what they called the
unfairness of the case against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the rhetoric turned hostile.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is full of hate,'' said Representative Jose E.
Serrano, a New York Democrat. ``I know a bunch of bullies when I
see them. The bullies get theirs, and you're going to get yours,''
Serrano shouted at House Republicans. ``The people are going to
rise up from California to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Seething with frustration, Democrats walked out of the chamber
en masse and boycotted part of the vote on the first article of
impeachment after GOP leaders blocked their attempt to vote on a
censure alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``This impeachment has left a stain on this institution,'' said
Representative William D. Delahunt, a Massachusetts Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders vigorously rejected criticism that they were
impeaching Clinton over circumstances stemming from a private,
consensual affair. Many GOP members, like Representative J.C. Watts
of Oklahoma, the incoming chairman of the House Republican
Conference, said the case is about defending the rule of law in the
face of polls that showed broad opposition to Clinton's
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polls measure changing feelings, not steadfast principles,''
Watts said. ``Polls would have rejected the Ten Commandments. Polls
would have embraced slavery and ridiculed women's rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Livingston's resignation...is a surrender to a developing
sexual McCarthyism,'' said Representative Jerrold Nadler, a New
York Democrat. ``We are losing sight of the distinction between
sins, which ought to be between a person and his family and his
God, and crimes, which are the concern of the state and of society
as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadler described Clinton as a target of the same ``McCarthyism.'
</P>
<P>
   Hyde agreed in part. ``Those of us who are sinners must feel
especially wretched'' about Livingston's resignation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he drew a distinction between private sexual infidelity and
dishonesty in a court proceeding, describing Clinton as ``a serial
violator of the oath.''
</P>
<P>
   The day's events began with a rousing speech to House Democrats
by Hillary Rodham Clinton. She cited her experience as a legal aide
to the Watergate committee investigating President Richard M.
Nixon, and railed against the notion of impeaching a president on a
narrow, party line.
</P>
<P>
   ``She galvanized the caucus,'' Delahunt said. ``She was very
inspiring.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hours later, with her husband impeached, Mrs. Clinton
stood silently by his side as he lashed out at the ``obsessive
animosity'' of their political foes.

   WHEATON, Ill. _ To many of the staunch conservatives who have
disdained Bill Clinton from the start, the impeachment of the
president brought unwavering approval but little cheering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the right thing, but I feel very sad today,'' said Wyatt
Waterman, 42, the assistant manager of a bookstore. ``It's not good
for the country, and it's not good for us as a nation to watch. But
there was no alternative. He committed perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   In this sharply conservative western suburb of Chicago, the home
of Wheaton College, a school that hews to the literal words of the
Bible, the vote to put Clinton on trial in the Senate was greeted
with quiet praise, especially for Republican Rep. Henry Hyde, who
represents the district.
</P>
<P>
   In a barbershop on Front Street, Doug Wicks, a 39-year-old sales
manager, said that ``Clinton's getting what he deserved,'' but he
added, ``I hate to see it _ this man's got a family of his own, and
loyal supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, not everyone was feeling sorry for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a liar, an adulterer, a bribe-taker,'' said Joe Maurer,
67. ``The man is a public disgrace. Not only should he be out of
office, he ought to be behind bars.''
</P>
<P>
   But in general, few people in Wheaton seemed to have a visceral
reaction to the impeachment. Most often, they shook their heads and
spoke in somber tones. Most said Congress simply had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   To Andy Pilipzcuk, 26, voting against impeachment would have
lowered the standard of behavior expected of public officials. ``We
can't let the next generation think this kind of behavior is
acceptable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually no one here relishes a trial in the Senate. All of
Clinton's critics, and even a defender or two, called on the
president to step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish he'd resign,'' said Nancy Lewis, 46, as she
shopped for Christmas presents at the college bookstore, where a
book featured in the window was titled, ``Tell Me the Truth,''
about the importance of fidelity and family values.
</P>
<P>
   To Ms. Lewis, punishment was only just for a president who, in
her view, had abused his power, especially when it came to women.
``I'm not a women's libber at all, but he's taken advantage of
women,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that she was ``not vindictive _ we all have problems,''
but that Clinton should ``do the respectful thing and step down.''
</P>
<P>
   Wicks, who also called on the president to resign, said he
mostly feared that a long trial in the Senate could ``ruin the
economy, the stock market, the holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in a place like Wheaton, however, there were people who
registered objection to the impeachment of Clinton over actions
tied to a sexual affair, and saw hypocrisy in many of the
denunciations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let God judge,'' said Sunny Hardwick, fairly trembling with
anger, as she clipped the hair of a man who sharply criticized the
president. Ms. Hardwick said that, as a devout Christian, she was
spending her time ``praying for the president'' instead of throwing
stones.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Volle, too, said she abhorred the actions by Congress, and
the invasions into his private life. ``From the beginning, he
should have just said, `It's none of your business.'''
</P>
<P>
   But the overwhelming majority of people here said they welcomed
the impeachment, even if they found little joy in the president's
comeuppance. And almost all of them said they hoped Clinton would
leave office without subjecting the nation to a tawdry ordeal in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to uphold the Constitution,'' said Scott Mathias, 40.
``I'm pleased by the impeachment, but saddened. I just don't think
there was any choice here.'' &QL;

</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following is the text of President Clinton's address Saturday at
the White House after the House of Representatives voted two
articles of impeachment against him, as recorded by The New York
Times:
</P>
<P>
   Let me begin by expressing my profound and heartfelt thanks to
Congressman Gephardt and the leadership and all the members of the
Democratic caucus for what they did today. I thank the few brave
Republicans who withstood enormous pressure to stand with them for
the plain meaning of the Constitution and for the proposition that
we need to pull together, to move beyond partisanship, to get on
with the business of our country.
</P>
<P>
   I thank the millions upon millions of American citizens who have
expressed their support and their friendship to Hillary, to me, to
our family and to our  &UR; a &LR; dministration during these last several
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The words of the members here with me and others who were a part
of their endeavor in defense of our Constitution were powerful and
moving and I will never forget them.
</P>
<P>
   The question is: What are we going to do now? I have accepted
responsibility for what I did wrong in my personal life, and I have
invited members of Congress to work with us to find a reasonable,
bipartisan and proportionate response. That approach was rejected
today by Republicans in the House. But I hope it will be embraced
by the Senate. I hope there will be a constitutional and fair means
of resolving this matter in a prompt manner.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, I will continue to do the work of the American
people. We still, after all, have to save Social Security and
Medicare for the 21st century. We have to give all our children
world-class schools. We have to pass a patients' bill of rights. We
have to make sure the economic turbulence around the world does not
curb our economic opportunity here at home. We have to keep America
the world's strongest force for peace and freedom. In short, we
have a lot to do before we enter the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   And we still have to keep working to build that elusive one
America I have talked so much about. For six years now I have done
everything I could to bring our country together across the lines
that divide us, including bringing Washington together across party
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Out in the country people are pulling together. But just as
America is coming together, it must look, from the country's point
of view, like Washington is coming apart.
</P>
<P>
   I want to echo something Mr. Gephardt said. It is something I
have felt strongly all my life. We must stop the politics of
personal destruction. We must get rid of the poisonous venom of
excessive partisanship, obsessive animosity and uncontrolled anger.
That is not what America deserves. That is not what America is
about.
</P>
<P>
   We are doing well now. We are a good and decent country. But we
have significant challenges we have to face. In order to do it
right we have to have some atmosphere of decency and civility, some
presumption of good faith, some sense of proportionality and
balance in bringing judgment against those who are in different
parties. We have important work to do. We need a constructive
debate that has all the different voices in this country heard in
the halls of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   I want the American people to know today that I am still
committed to working with people of good faith and good will of
both parties to do what's best for our country, to bring our nation
together, to lift our people up, to move us all forward together.
It's what I've tried to do six years. It's what I intend to do for
two more until the last hour of the last day of my term.
</P>
<P>
   So with profound gratitude for the defense of the Constitution
and the best in America that was raised today by the members here
and those who joined them, I ask the American people to move with
me, to go on from here, to rise above the rancor, to overcome the
pain and division, to be a repairer of the breach _ all of us _ to
make this country as one America what it can and must be for our
children in the new century about to dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you very much.

 &HT;    Livingston decision jolts home district
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COVINGTON, La. _ Residents of suburban New Orleans were stunned
and disappointed by news that Rep. Bob Livingston (R-La.) would not
be representing them much longer and would not become speaker of
the House in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shouldn't resign _ he's the best congressman we've had in
this state,'' said Ron Komorowski of Covington, across Lake
Pontchartrain from New Orleans. ``Bob Livingston has done so much
for the little people. If you've got a problem, you can talk to him
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, who last week admitted to extramarital affairs, is
an extremely popular congressman who has represented suburban New
Orleans for more than 20 years, often running unopposed. Moreover,
he was seen as a scandal-free Louisiana politician, something of an
rarity in a state notorious for crooked politics. Having him rise
to the third-highest position in the country was a source of pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been so good for Louisiana's image,'' said Maude Brown,
who was selling Christmas trees in Covington on Saturday. ``If he's
not speaker, fine, but I don't think he should resign his
position.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. David Vitter, a Republican from Livingston's district
who is considered a leading candidate to replace him, said he was
shocked when he saw Livingston on television resigning Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously a tremendous loss for the state,'' he said.
``We were going to have a speaker of the House from Louisiana, we
have had years (with Livingston) as the chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee, and that's made for very good news about
a Louisiana politician. So that is a very sad lost opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's resignation also leaves open the congressional seat
to a possible candidacy by someone reviled on the national
political scene: David Duke. The former Ku Klux Klansman and avowed
white supremacist is head of the St. Tammany Parish Republican
Party in Livingston's district, and probably will run for the
vacant seat.
</P>
<P>
   When Livingston talked of resigning in February, saying he could
make more money if he returned to private law practice, Duke said
he wanted to run for the seat.
</P>
<P>
   Duke could not be reached for comment Saturday. Vitter dismissed
the possibility that Duke could win the seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think David Duke's 15 minutes of fame have come and gone,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some people said that although they were sorry to lose
Livingston as a representative, they thought he did the honorable
thing in light of his recent confession to extramarital affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an honest man _ he probably feels he can't judge the
president and have done the same thing,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson of New Orleans said he liked the fact that Livingston
was setting an example for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Clinton is being arrogant,'' he said. ``He should
resign _ he's got no power, no credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Vitter agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Livingston's stepping down makes a very powerful
argument that Clinton should resign as well and move beyond this
mess,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Maginnis, publisher of the Louisiana Political Fax Weekly,
said that in stepping down, Livingston was ``doing what's best for
Livingston.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding was that the number of affairs was in the
double digits and more information would have continued to come out
about them,'' he said. ``Livingston would have died by a thousand
cuts, so instead, he fell on his sword for the GOP and has invited
Clinton to join him.''
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Reed, a Republican from Hammond in Livingston's district,
gained some notoriety when he begged Livingston in February at a
town meeting not to resign. Livingston later cited Reed as a factor
in his decision to remain in office. Reed is hoping to get another
chance to speak to Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he's not leaving Congress for six months, so maybe I
will get a chance to talk him out of it,'' he said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Scott, who was shopping for a tree with her 2-year-old,
Hannah, and her husband, David, said it was ``ridiculous'' that
Livingston felt forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he's trying to show he can take responsibility for his
actions,'' she said. ``But I don't think politics should be about
your marriage. Clinton is being impeached not because of Monica
Lewinsky, but because he lied.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband felt more strongly that politicians in general are
morally bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton and Bob Livingston have so much power and
yet they can't be trusted to do the right thing,'' David Scott
said. ``If you can't keep your vow to your wife, who can you keep
your vow to? The Republicans are wrapping themselves in this mantle
of morality and here is one of their leaders cheating on his
wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Vix, a fire captain in Covington, said neither Livingston
nor Clinton should be in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that nobody is perfect, but those in positions of
such high responsibility have a higher moral standard to live up to
than Joe Blow in the street,'' he said. ``They reflect a much
greater problem in Washington, maybe in the whole country. The
Muslims would say, quite to the point, that we have no God. Why are
we even asking if Clinton and Livingston did something wrong? Isn't
it obvious?

   WASHINGTON _ These are the 10 lawmakers, five Republicans and
five Democrats, who broke party ranks on the crucial first vote on
impeachment to charge President Clinton with lying to a federal
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who voted against impeachment:
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTOPHER SHAYS, Conn., 53. Elected in August 1987 in a
special election. For much of his 11 years in Congress, he has been
a champion of reform and moderate causes, challenging the
conservative members of his party on issues from abortion to gun
control to campaign finance reform. But his conservative
credentials are never in doubt; he remains a loyalist to Speaker
Newt Gingrich and supports fiscally conservative policies.
</P>
<P>
   CONSTANCE MORELLA, Md., 67. Elected in 1986. A liberal
Republican on issues like gun control and abortion, her
conservative thinking is most evident on economic issues. She faced
a well-financed Democratic challenger this fall who accused her of
moving to the right. She won re-election with 60 percent of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   PETER KING, N.Y., 54. Elected in 1992. He shuns the label
``moderate.'' He is proud to have received a 100 percent rating
from the Christian Coalition and is unabashed about opposing
abortion, affirmative action, bilingual education, gun control and
anything that smells like a ``good government'' proposal.
</P>
<P>
   AMO HOUGHTON, N.Y., 72. Elected in 1986. A leading moderate
Republican who has a reputation as one of the nicest members of
Congress. He is one of the creators of a weekend-long retreat to
promote civility in the House. He has been a leading critic of
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation of Clinton, but
supported the opening of the impeachment inquiry by the House.
</P>
<P>
   MARK SOUDER, Ind., 48. Elected in 1994. Although he voted
against impeaching the president for perjury, he voted in favor of
the third article approved by the House Saturday, which charges the
president with obstruction of justice. He has been a voice for
conservative issues in the House and comes from a heavily
Republican district. He has also displayed an independent streak by
opposing Gingrich in the 1996 budget negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats who voted for impeachment:
</P>
<P>
   GENE TAYLOR, Miss., 45. Elected in October 1989 in a special
election. As a Southern white Democrat, he is part of a dwindling
political breed in Congress. He has a fiscally conservative voting
record and has distanced himself as far as possible from Washington
Democrats who are disdained in southern Mississippi. In 1996 he
announced he would not support the re-election of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   PAUL MCHALE, Pa., 48. Elected in 1992, he did not run for
re-election this year. He supported Clinton enthusiastically in
both the 1992 and 1996 elections and voted for Clinton's positions
about 75 percent of the time. In August he became the first House
Democrat to call on Clinton to resign. In November he offered a
censure resolution as an alternative to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   RALPH HALL, Texas, 75. Elected in 1980. Throughout his career in
Congress he has been a staunchly conservative Democrat who
regularly sides with the Republicans. He supported substantial
portions of the Republicans' Contract With America in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   CHARLES STENHOLM, Texas, 60. Elected in 1978. The 10-term
Democrat has emphasized conservative issues and political
independence in his increasingly Republican district. He often
bucks his own party on such issues as federal spending and abortion
rights, voting with Clinton about half the time.
</P>
<P>
   VIRGIL GOODE JR., Va., 52. Elected in 1996. First won election
by campaigning as an old-fashioned conservative on such issues as
guns, abortion and tobacco while appealing to more liberal
constituents with his support for civil rights and federal support
for education. Like the other Democrats voting in favor of
impeachment, he was one of the 31 Democrats who voted to open the
impeachment inquiry.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When J. Dennis Hastert was first elected to
Congress from Illinois in 1986, he quickly became a protege of
Robert Michel, the moderate, gentlemanly Republican who led the
party in the House in the years before it won control of Congress
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But Hastert, a former high school government teacher and
wrestling coach, owes his sudden status as front-runner in the
unexpected race for speaker to his association in the last few
years with a very different type of Republican leader, Rep. Tom
DeLay of Texas, his party's whip.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, No. 3 in the House Republican leadership and an
unyielding conservative, is as emblematic as anyone of the bitter
partisanship that now dominates the House, and he has a powerful
and loyal base of support that he mobilized Saturday to back
Hastert, his chief deputy, as speaker. Rep. Dick Armey of Texas,
the majority leader, quickly endorsed Hastert as well, and
Hastert's allies said he would have no trouble winning the votes he
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's ability to make friends and win respect across the
party's ideological, generational and regional divides, Republicans
said, is the principal factor propelling him in a flash from
obscurity toward the speakership. If he prevails, he will have to
handle his own bruised and fractious caucus, help heal the wounds
the House inflicted on itself during the impeachment proceedings,
and assume the mantle of national leadership that would come with a
post behind only the vice president in the line of constitutional
succession to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, Denny Hastert is the best of all the people,''
Newt Gingrich, the departing speaker, told Republicans who gathered
Saturday afternoon to plot strategy after the impeachment vote and
Robert Livingston's decision to give up the position before he ever
assumed it.
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican leaving Congress, Rep. Bill Paxon of New
York, said Hastert was ``the kind of overarching figure that our
party needs at this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Hastert said the speakership was ``a calling I
have not sought,'' but a ``duty I cannot ignore.''
</P>
<P>
   The flip side of Hastert's wide acceptance among House
Republicans is that he has no strong base of his own, almost no
public visibility and no articulated agenda. Some Republicans said
Hastert would have to overcome a perception that he was backed by
DeLay and Armey precisely because he would leave them with
considerable power.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, neither DeLay nor Armey appeared to give any
consideration to running for speaker themselves, apparently having
concluded, as they did last month after Gingrich announced he was
stepping down, that they would have a difficult time winning the
needed support to move up from roles more suited to the hard-edged
tactical politics they practice.
</P>
<P>
   Other possible rivals to Hastert for the speakership were
leaving their options open Saturday afternoon. Rep. Christopher Cox
of California, who had run against Livingston last month, said he
was considering running again.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert is likely to be viewed with some suspicion by the
party's right wing, which was a constant source of unrest during
Gingrich's speakership and which may have sent the signals that led
to Livingston's departure. Although he is reliably conservative on
social issues like abortion, Hastert is best known for brokering
deals, particularly on health care issues, the subject to which he
has dedicated much of his time in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denny is referred to as the coach, and he has the coach's
ability to bring the team together in the locker room and motivate
them to get things done,'' said a senior Republican aide in the
House. ``I don't know that he's perceived ideologically one way or
the other. He's a low-key, conciliatory fellow, quiet, unassuming
and effective. He is able to bring people together.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, who will turn 57 on Jan. 2, was a high school teacher
and coach for 16 years. He began his political career as a member
of the Illinois Assembly from 1980 to 1986, when his party asked
him to run for Congress.

<P>
   Many Americans voiced anger, disgust and frustration with the
proceedings. Some radiated grim satisfaction. But as President
Clinton's long, painful journey from scandal to impeachment ended
Saturday, most Americans were just benumbed, inoculated by the
seemingly endless months of lies, legalisms and disillusionment
with politics, Washington-style.
</P>
<P>
   As the House cast the fateful votes to send perjury and other
charges against Clinton to the Senate for trial, countless
Americans paid scant attention, opting for football on television
or Christmas shopping, a reflection of polls that had shown that
the people overwhelmingly opposed an impeachment that was a
foregone conclusion and were sick of the whole mess.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was great drama in the day _ the bombs falling in
Iraq, the stunning announcement that Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La.,
would not serve as speaker and would resign from the House after
admitting adulterous affairs, and the realization by many that the
impeachment of a president had happened only once before, 130 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   And around the nation, Americans paused in homes, restaurants
and shopping malls decked out for Christmas to watch the televised
spectacle. Some endorsed the Republican-dominated vote to impeach,
insisting that even a president was not above the law, and that
impeachment was necessary for moral accountability. Others called
on the president to resign and spare the nation months of agony.
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews in New York, Seattle, Boston, Los Angeles,
Chicago, Miami, Houston and other cities, most people, while
deploring Clinton's behavior in trying to cover up his affair with
Monica Lewinsky, said they opposed impeachment, calling it
excessive punishment and perhaps harmful to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It strikes me as dangerous,'' Greg Noonan, a first-year law
student at Harvard, said as the impeachment vote flashed on a
television screen at the Three Aces, a restaurant in Cambridge,
Mass. ``And most infuriatingly of all, it strikes me as completely
ignoring the will of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, several people working out at the Olympic Athletic
Club shook their heads in disgust as the vote unfolded on overhead
screens. ``I'm very, very saddened and I'm very, very angry,'' said
Ross Carey, a doctor, who said the Republicans had ``put politics
ahead of what is best for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob and Carol Wentink, a Chicago couple, said impeachment seemed
excessive for what the president did. ``It's a shame,'' Wentink,
54, an electronics designer, said. ``I think there's too much
interest in private lives. While he did wrong, I don't think he
deserves to be impeached.'' His wife, a retired teacher, added: ``I
think it's a huge mistake. It's going to affect the way people
around the world look at us.''
</P>
<P>
   Evan Ackerman, 28, a financial consultant in Miami, also called
impeachment inappropriate. ``But that doesn't necessarily mean I
like Clinton,'' he added. ``Even if he is a sleazebag, they should
wait until he leaves office. He should be scolded, sued for
millions of dollars, reprimanded.''
</P>
<P>
   Greater forgiveness was to be found at the Hair Place, a beauty
salon in the New York City borough of Queens. ``So he lied under
oath,'' said Diane Barnett, 41, an office manager who lives in
Roosevelt, L.I. ``That's a petty issue. Everybody lies. It's like
his wife said: There are so many other issues, like hunger and
health care, to be concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Trageser, 62, a silversmith from Cincinnati, said the
impeachment had been motivated by pure politics. ``It's partisan,
it's unfair, it's a witch hunt,'' he said in Los Angeles, where he
was visiting. ``I'm sick of what the Republicans have done over the
past few years _ so squeaky clean and hypocritical. It's sad and
bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, however, there were many who approved of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hooray,'' yelled Ann Jewel, who heard the news as she wheeled
a cart full of grocery bags across the parking lot in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   A 57-year-old receptionist for an insurance company and the
mother of five children, Ms. Jewel said she had voted twice for
Clinton, but had come to believe that he betrayed the country and
was not sincere in his many apologies. ``He put his hand on the
Bible and lied,'' she said. ``A lot of things can be forgiven, but
to be forgiven a person has to be sorry. He cannot be forgiven just
because he is caught.''
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, Monika Miura, 48, a legal librarian, said Clinton,
like any citizen, had to be called to account for lying under oath.
``If anyone needs to be above reproach and needs to be an honorable
individual, it should be the president,'' she said. ``This is not
an issue about sex. This is an issue about honor and
truthfulness.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gertrude Jackson, 75, a retired Chicago department store
cashier, also said she favored impeachment, and that it was not
about sex. ``Everybody knew when he was elected that he was a
woman-chaser,'' she said. ``He just got too big for his britches.
He broke the law. He should be punished.''
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, John Harless, a 53-year-old retired banker, said
Clinton had no one to blame but himself. ``It's a somber moment,
and I'm not happy about it,'' Harless said. ``He did some good
things. It's too bad he recklessly endangered the office of the
president. He ruined his own presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Market coffee shop in Denver, Cherish Finn spoke of
Clinton in the past tense, as if he was already gone, though the
outcome of his trial in the senate remains in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was a good leader,'' Ms. Finn said. ``This has been
a good time in our country. We had a great four years with him, and
he had the potential to do something with this country. He should
have been honest. This society is based on forgiveness, and he made
a mockery of the system by lying.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anyone defended Clinton, but many expressed concern over
the possible effects of his impeachment _ on the economy, on the
stability of government, on the conduct of foreign affairs and on
the future of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is dog eat dog now _ not `of the people, for the
people,''' said Vic Lysell, 50, a paint salesman who had stopped
for breakfast at Johnny's diner in Seattle's waterfront Ballard
neighborhood. ``This is not our system at work, it's the GOP at
work. It's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Wetzel, sitting nearby, needed a jolt of coffee to digest the
news. He said he opposed impeachment, but added that now that it
was a fact, Clinton should ``strongly consider'' resignation.
``This thing would be the focus of the whole next year,'' he said.
``The entire country would suffer for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The owner of Johnny's, John Khalil, disagreed. Referring to
Republicans, he said: ``They are pushing hard to destroy this man
any way they can, and it's wrong. Now the president needs to battle
back.''
</P>
<P>
   For many Americans, impeachment was just another occasion to
condemn Clinton. ``What the president did was shameful, and I think
he has to pay the price,'' said Al Habib, 54, a Brooklyn
pharmacist. ``He's a very bad role model for the younger
generation. The right thing to do is remove him from office.''
</P>
<P>
   But others denounced the forces arrayed against him. ``The whole
thing stinks,'' said Susan Macina, 35, who lives in Brooklyn and
Hollywood, Fla. ``What the president did was terrible, but not
impeachable. It's an offense in his personal life. We elected him
twice without knowing about his affairs. I think there are going to
be mass protests in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was little sign of protest Saturday. Indeed, tours of
shops, cafes and other public places in a half-dozen cities found
many people ignoring the telecast from Capitol Hill. Kevin James,
29, working at a juice bar in Seattle, said he was more concerned
with Christmas shopping and finding a new apartment. ``It's simply
not on my important list now,'' he said of the impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Carlson, a 45-year-old college English professor in
Denver, called the impeachment historic, but not comparable to the
Watergate proceedings that led to the resignation of President
Nixon. ``I cried during Watergate,'' she said. ``I felt the
American way of life was threatened. Now I think it's different.
The country will survive this.''

HARRY TRELEAVEN JR., 76, CREATED NIXON SLOGAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Mass., N.J., Conn.)  (mk) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Harry Treleaven Jr., an advertising executive and
early political consultant who is credited with creating the
``Nixon's the One!'' slogan for the 1968 presidential campaign,
died Dec. 9 at the Sarah Neuman Nursing Home in Mamaroneck, N.Y. He
was 76 and lived in Manhattan and Amagansett, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A former wife, Elsie Lawall Treleaven, said the cause was heart
failure.
</P>
<P>
   Treleaven (pronounced TRELL-eh-ven) was one of the first
practitioners of techniques that are used commonly in politics
today in the packaging and handling of candidates. Though he was
not the best known of Richard Nixon's Republican brain trust in the
1968 campaign, he played an important role in setting its tone and
conveying the desired image to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his contributions were recorded by Joe McGinniss in his
book about the campaign, ``The Selling of the President,'' for
which McGinniss received access to Treleaven's confidential staff
memorandums. In one memorandum quoted by McGinniss, Treleaven
discussed how the campaign had to turn Nixon's liabilities into
assets. ``Not always loved, he is universally respected,''
Treleaven wrote. ``Not glamorous, he does have a certain star
quality going for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Treleaven conceded that there were some negatives to Nixon's
personality, but said, ``If we recognize them, deal with them
intelligently instead of worrying about them, their effect can be
minimized.''
</P>
<P>
   There was, for example, Nixon's apparent lack of humor. ``Can be
corrected to a degree,'' Treleaven wrote, ``but let's not be too
obvious about it.''
</P>
<P>
   On another of the candidate's shortcomings, warmth, Treleaven
wrote, ``He can be helped greatly in this respect by how he is
handled, by what he says and how he says it.'' One solution offered
by Treleaven: ``presenting him informally.''
</P>
<P>
   In another memorandum, Treleaven wrote of Nixon's pictures:
``Avoid closeups.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon presented a difficult case for the handlers. At one point,
Treleaven wrote, ``the chances of overcoming Richard Nixon's cold
image and the chances of making him loved and making him glamorous
via commercial exposure on television (where admittedly he has not
been at his best) are far less than the chances of making him loved
and making him glamorous via saturation exposure of artfully
conceived and produced four-color, full-page (or double spread)
magazine advertisements.''
</P>
<P>
   Treleaven was born in Oak Park, Ill., and graduated from Duke
University, where he was editor in chief of The Duke Chronicle. He
rose to the rank of lieutenant while serving with the Navy's
Seabees in the South Pacific during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   After the war he wrote plays for radio shows like ``The
Whistler'' in California and then moved to New York as an executive
at the J. Walter Thompson agency, working on accounts like Ford,
Pan Am and Singer.
</P>
<P>
   Treleaven's first political job was as consultant to George
Bush's congressional campaign in Houston, which Bush won in an
upset at the start of his political career.
</P>
<P>
   Treleaven is survived by a son from his first marriage, to Joan
Westphal, Gregory Treleaven of Boston; two children from his second
marriage, to Elsie Lawall Treleaven, Bruce Treleaven of Montclair,
N.J., and Gwyneth Claiborne of Fairfield, Conn., and four
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Garment, the Nixon counsel, in his book ``Crazy
Rhythm,'' said Treleaven had a genius for political advertising.
Garment once said the ``Nixon's the One!'' campaign showed Nixon as
a person ``who has had experience and has been able to stay on his
feet _ even if he is unpleasant.''

 &HT;    MIDWESTERNER IS EARLY FAVORITE IN NEW SPEAKER RACE
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., quickly emerged
Saturday as the favorite to become speaker of the House when the
new Congress convenes next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``If elected speaker, I will make a particular effort to build
bridges across the aisle,'' Hastert said as became the first
Republican to announce his candidacy for the top House job.
</P>
<P>
   For the past four years, Hastert has been the chief deputy to
House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Support from DeLay and the party's current top two leaders,
departing Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia and House Majority
Leader Dick Armey of Texas, made Hastert a strong early favorite to
be the next speaker. At a private meeting of House Republicans,
Gingrich argued that as his successor, Hastert would be a
low-profile leader who wouldn't distract attention from the party's
presidential candidate in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert won the leaders' backing even though his first political
mentor was the far less conservative former House Republican
leader, Bob Michel of Illinois. Hastert impressed his colleagues
last month when he refused to cooperate with efforts to draft him
to challenge Armey for majority leader because he had already
promised Armey his support.
</P>
<P>
   Though nominated by party caucuses, House speakers represent the
entire chamber and must be elected by all members. With only a
six-vote margin in the incoming Congress, Hastert's broad appeal is
an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptical of higher spending on almost anything except defense,
Hastert is an evangelical Christian whose voting record has been
highly rated by groups of social conservatives and fiscal
conservatives alike.
</P>
<P>
   Among moderates, he earned a reputation in Congress for forging
compromises between the parties and between the Senate and the
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might not get the highest SAT scores, but he's a real solid
guy _ affable and accessible,'' said a Republican House member who
is supporting him.
</P>
<P>
   He is a former high school wrestling coach with extensive state
legislative experience. Hastert's unbuttoned suitcoats, flopping
tie, pot belly and thick, gray bangs make him look as grandfatherly
as a Democrat who once was speaker, Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, who will turn 57 on Jan. 2, is likely to face
opposition from a trimmer, more telegenic Republican _ GOP Policy
Committee Chairman Christopher Cox, 46, of California.
</P>
<P>
   Cox is a Newport Beach attorney who has developed a reputation
as a likeable, brainy champion of the high tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters that he wouldn't announce his candidacy
formally on Saturday because a campaign for the speakership is
``inter-personal among members, and wherever possible it is best to
talk first to the members one at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox added, ``If you can imagine, it's the third most significant
post in the government, and (a winning majority of) the electorate
will be only your own vote and 111 other people.''
</P>
<P>
   That assumes that when the 106th Congress convenes on Jan. 6,
all 223 House Republicans would vote for the winner of an
intra-party showdown at a meeting to take place no later than Jan.
5. If they remain united, the 223 GOP votes would be enough to beat
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., who could expect
support from 211 Democrats and one independent.
</P>
<P>
   But GOP unity isn't always guaranteed. In fact, Livingston
withdrew shortly after friends told him that some conservative
Republicans might vote against him next month, because they were
upset by his recent confessions of marital infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quicker we can come to a real consensus, the better off we
are,'' said Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio. ``When you're bleeding, the
first thing you want to do is stop the bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Steve Largent of Oklahoma and Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Bill Archer of Texas were among members to declined to run
after being approached by GOP colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Because Gingrich is leaving and DeLay and Armey are prominent
partisans, their colleagues did not ask them to seek the top job.

COMPANY PROSPERS AS SUPPLIER OF STUDENT HOUSING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By MARIANNE ROHRLICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The QE2 was docked at Casablanca in 1989 when Jeanie
Bowers Scott, then performing on board as an opera singer, received
a call from her husband, George. ``I bought a building for $13
million,'' he said, ``and when you get back we are moving in with a
bunch of college students.''
</P>
<P>
   The Scotts did indeed move into 521 West 49th St. with 176
students. But Scott did not buy the building, since he did not have
the $13 million. Instead, he negotiated a lease-purchase agreement
on the unoccupied apartment building; the purchase itself never
came about. The landlord, who until then was having trouble renting
in that area, furnished each apartment, and the Scotts, who had
moved into the top floor, held an open house for representatives of
local colleges that they knew were looking for off-campus dormitory
space.
</P>
<P>
   The building was fully occupied in 90 days and a lucrative niche
business was born _ a business that leases rooms in bulk from
building owners and rents them to students.
</P>
<P>
   Today Educational Housing Services _ the largest provider of
student housing, other than colleges and universities, in New York
City _ manages three off-campus residences. The residences, with
1,958 beds, house close to 4,000 students over the course of a year
from 22 institutions of higher education.
</P>
<P>
   Six hundred beds at the George Washington Hotel, at 23 Lexington
Ave., are leased to the School of Visual Arts; the St. George Hotel
in Brooklyn Heights accommodates 794 students from many schools,
and 202 Tillary St. in downtown Brooklyn houses 160 students from
12 schools.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, a 52-year-old businessman, had foreseen a decade ago a
growing need for safe, affordable dormitories. Today there are
630,000 students in the metropolitan area, according to a survey
done for Student Advantage, a company that offers a variety of
retail discounts.
</P>
<P>
   The Scotts' original building on West 49th Street near 10th
Avenue was sold three years after it opened as a student residence
and the 176 students had to be relocated in 30 days. Scott found
alternative rooms in what he knew were ``underperforming
buildings,'' many in grade B hotels, which he quickly renovated
with fresh paint and new furniture. That established a pattern for
Educational Housing Services.
</P>
<P>
   The company's largest source of rental space is still in B-level
hotels. Scott does not own any of the properties, but negotiates
long-term leases for large blocks of rooms, performs the necessary
cosmetic makeovers and staffs them with experienced managers _
often with hotel management experience.
</P>
<P>
   The company is organized as a not-for-profit corporation. ``That
allows us to borrow money for renovations at favorable rates, be
approved by the New York State Dormitory Authority and not be bound
by rent-stabilization laws,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott is president and chief executive of EHS and Ms. Scott is
executive vice president. Their salaries this year total $277,500,
Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   The business Scott runs is not uncommon in other parts of the
country. GMH Associates of Wayne, Pa., is the largest provider of
private student residences in the country, with 30,000 beds for
students in 17 states. It owns and manages residences for 27
institutions of higher education.
</P>
<P>
   During the academic year EHS rents 60 percent of its units
directly to schools under contract (40 percent in the summer). The
remainder of the beds are rented to students directly. To qualify
for a room a student has to be enrolled in a school working toward
a degree or certificate.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the students are referred to the company by the schools.
Others come through the Internet (www.studenthousing.org) or
through ads in The Village Voice. ``We got 1,000 to 2,000 hits a
week in the summer'' said Lindsay Baker, director of marketing for
Educational Housing Services. ``We are 100 percent rented now _
actually we are over-rented and have 100-150 students on a waiting
list.''
</P>
<P>
   The rooms vary in price from $1,400 a month for a large single
in the studio building annex of the St. George to $680 a person in
a three-bedroom in the same building. At the newly renovated
property on Tillary Street, loft-style studio apartments are $775 a
month for a single room to $725 each for a three-bed suite, which
also has a kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   There is no minimum stay. Students attending a college in the
metropolitan area for short-term projects or internships can rent
by the week. According to state regulations there must be one
residence director living in a dormitory building for every 25
undergraduates and one for every 40 graduate students. When schools
contract for blocks of rooms, their own staff members reside with
the students.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The George Washington Hotel is subleased for 12 years to the
School Of Visual Arts. Students abide by school regulations and pay
dormitory fees directly to the college. The building also has 138
long-term hotel residents, who cannot be forced to move. But as
their rooms are vacated, students can take them over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rooms are small but you can have a single with its own
bathroom,'' said Beau Mitallu, a third year fine arts student from
Pittsburgh. He is one of 15 student resident assistants whose rent
is paid for in exchange for supervising other students. His
air-conditioned room is decorated with photos from home and
wall-to-wall oil paintings from his classes, and, he said, for $75
a year ``I get a TV and cable.''
</P>
<P>
   Every room in the EHS system is furnished, has its own bathroom,
color cable TV and air-conditioning. The newest building on Tillary
Street, an industrial site that was gutted and refitted to EHS
specifications, also has data lines for computers.
</P>
<P>
   The Tillary Street building opened this semester. The eight
floors were divided into 1,000-square-foot loft-style studios
shared by three or four students. Some have private bedrooms for
single-room requests. Each has minimal furnishings and a sleek new
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen rooms on two floors were leased to Pratt Institute,
which needed beds for 44 students this semester. ``We needed a
stopgap while our new dormitories are being built,'' said
Christopher Kasik, director of residential life and housing at
Pratt. ``We were limited in terms of location and we like referring
students to EHS because they are in the business of working with
students and schools and have policies that are identical to
colleges, as opposed to landlords who just rent space.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not on-campus living but it's as close to the experience
as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new apartments are more expensive than Pratt's own
dormitories, for which a student pays an average of $550 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Pace University's 428 beds on its Manhattan campus were full
this September when it contracted for 170 beds in the St. George
Hotel in Brooklyn Heights. ``We have our own professional residence
life person living in the building so that we can exercise some
control,'' said Philomena Mantella, vice president of enrollment
and student life at Pace. ``And we usually house upperclassmen or
graduate students off campus.''
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-eight students from Marymount Manhattan College are also
housed at the St. George _ on four floors of their own. Leah Webb,
a theater major, has just moved to New York from from Charlotte,
N.C. ``Brooklyn Heights is a nice transition from a day at school
in Manhattan,'' she said. ``Our hallway is really like a college
dorm. People are in and out of your room constantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Technical schools like the Institute of Audio Research for
careers in broadcasting, the School for Film and Television and
even Berlitz also house students with EHS.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, who never attended college, entered higher education as
an administrator in 1972 at Robert Morris College in Chicago.
Later, he moved to New York, where he worked at Tobe Coburn and
then Katherine Gibbs, both two-year schools that give associate
degrees in such fields as fashion and business.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Scott's first foray into housing, he was vice
president of the American Musical and Dramatic Academy, a small
private performing arts school in Manhattan that had no residence
facilities. ``Offering dormitory space turned the school around,''
Scott said. ``In two years, it went from 32 students to 300.''
</P>
<P>
   In his five-year plan, Scott said, he hopes to find more rental
buildings _ this time class B and C office structures below 34th
Street in Manhattan that now have high vacancy rates. He is also
looking into expanding into other areas of the country, and even
London.
</P>
<P>
   But for now he faces the very problem he set out to solve for
others _ finding space in New York City that is affordable to
college students.
</P>
<P>
   One neighborhood that he is now surveying is Brooklyn's Dumbo
(Down Under the Manhattan Bridge). And, he says, New Jersey might
be next.

CLAY BLAIR, AUTHOR AND MILITARY HISTORIAN, DIES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis.)   (jw) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clay Blair, an author who wrote extensively on World War II and
the Korean War and was a former editor of The Saturday Evening
Post, died Wednesday at his home on Washington Island, Wis. He was
73.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered a heart attack, said his agent, Russell Galen.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, Blair served aboard the submarine Guardfish,
participating in its last two patrols off Japan. In the 1950s, when
he covered national security affairs as a magazine correspondent,
Blair got to know many of the wartime skippers and made ``dives''
in postwar submarines. Those experiences inspired a deep and
abiding interest in submarine warfare and led to a series of books
in which Blair told the story of the ``silent service.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of his 26 books focused on military history. In the first,
``The Atomic Submarine and Admiral Rickover'' (Henry Holt, 1954),
Blair told of the development of nuclear-powered submarines. He
collaborated with Comdr. William Anderson in ``Nautilus 90 North''
(World, 1959), an account of the first submarine voyage beneath the
North Pole.
</P>
<P>
   Blair wrote of heroic exploits as well as failures in American
leadership and of design problems like defective torpedoes in
``Silent Victory: The U.S. Submarine War Against Japan'' (J.B.
Lippincott, 1975). Robert Trumbull wrote in The New York Times that
the book was ``the definitive work, not only on submarine warfare
in general but also on a controversial chapter in American military
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 10 years Blair worked on the two-volume ``Hitler's
U-Boat War'' (Random House, 1996 and 1998), in which he concluded
that the German submarine menace had been ``vastly overblown'' in
many historical accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Blair provided a wide-ranging look at the Korean War in ``The
Forgotten War'' (Times Books, 1987), collaborated with Gen. Omar
Bradley, a commander of Army forces in World War II, in ``A
General's Life'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1983) and described American
airborne operations in World War II in ``Ridgway's Paratroopers''
(Dial, 1985).
</P>
<P>
   Blair and his co-author, James Shepley, stirred controversy with
``The Hydrogen Bomb'' (David McKay, 1954), maintaining that the
race by the United States against the Soviet Union to develop the
bomb was hampered by opposition from the nuclear physicist J.
Robert Oppenheimer and his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Lewis Strauss, chairman of the Atomic Energy
Commission, made an unsuccessful effort to buy the manuscript with
the intention of locking it in a safe until most of the principal
figures in the book had died.
</P>
<P>
   Blair and his wife, Joan, collaborated on several books,
including ``The Search for J.F.K.'' (Berkley/Putnam's, 1976), an
account of John F. Kennedy's younger years.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, a native of Lexington, Va., attended Tulane University
and then Columbia, leaving in 1949 to become a reporter-trainee at
Time magazine. He was Washington correspondent for Time and Life
from 1950 to 1957, then joined the Washington bureau of The
Saturday Evening Post, which was owned by the Curtis Publishing Co.
</P>
<P>
   Blair was editor in chief of all Curtis magazines and served as
editor of The Post in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   With a goal of ``sophisticated muckraking,'' Blair sought
exclusive articles for The Post. But several libel suits were
brought against the magazine, including a highly publicized case in
which Wally Butts, the athletic director and former football coach
at the University of Georgia, won a $460,000 judgment involving an
article alleging game-fixing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, with Curtis ailing financially, Blair was a leader in a
rebellion by 15 editors and advertising employees who demanded that
the Curtis board oust Matthew J. Culligan, the president, chairman
and chief executive of the company, charging mismanagement. The
turmoil resulted in the departure of both Blair and Culligan. After
that, Blair devoted himself exclusively to free-lance writing.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, Blair is survived by six children from his
marriage to the former Agnes Devereux: four sons, Clay 3rd of
Germany, Kemp and Robert of Boulder, Colo., and Christopher of
Washington and two daughters, Marie Louise Houle of Amherst, Mass.,
and Sibyl Dance of Palm City, Fla. He is also survived by two
stepsons, David West of Greenville, Texas, and Christopher West of
Denver, and five grandchildren.

CASHING IN ON THE TRASH OF THE AFFLUENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENWICH, Conn. _ On Tuesday nights, after people in this
moneyed town have finished dinner, Tonya White, a fourth-generation
Greenwich resident, bundles her toddler into her car and, with her
58-year-old mother, goes hunting for junk.
</P>
<P>
   As the boy nods off, mother and daughter cruise the lanes of
nearby communities like Rye, N.Y., and Port Chester, N.Y., and
rummage with flashlights through homeowners' trash, sifting out old
lamps, dolls, pots, quilts, anything thrown away as clutter or too
much trouble to repair.
</P>
<P>
   On weekday afternoons, mother and daughter take another tack,
visiting the town dump here and poking through mounds of wood,
metal and trash for goods whose value has gone unrecognized. What
they harvest they haul into consignment shops, which pay them 70
percent of sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found a very nice Pentax,'' Ms. White said. ``Wide-angle
lens. Digital. The only thing was the shutter was stuck. All I had
to do was stick my finger inside. I put some batteries in, some
film. Bang, it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   She knows a dozen for-profit scavengers like herself, including
those who do it just because they cannot resist the instinct to get
something for nothing. ``There's so many people looking through
garbage, it's hard to find anything good,'' she said. ``People in
Mercedes-Benzes. They have lots of money and they're still trying
to find that Rembrandt in the garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   Junking, as it's called, is the way Ms. White and her mother
make their living, the kind of occupation most Americans do not
associate with Greenwich but one that says something about wealthy
towns' scruffier, less visible corners, where weather-beaten
clapboard houses are scattered among the factories and the lawns
are handkerchief size.
</P>
<P>
   People who resort to such makeshift enterprises have watched the
wealth mushroom around them and pass them by. Maybe they blame bad
luck or personal troubles. But they seem to have adopted the
philosophy that if they cannot live as well as the rich, they might
as well live off them.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, they help remind us of the extravagance in
increasingly affluent America, where toys languish unopened in
closets and perfectly fine refrigerators are discarded to make way
for trendy Sub-Zeros. Greenwich is self-conscious about this waste.
The town officially prohibits scavenging at the dump (although
officials seem to overlook regulars like the Whites), and it
includes a Salvation Army drop-off bin and a free book exchange
that could stock a small-town library.
</P>
<P>
   However, as Ms. White says, there is no getting around the
indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a fantastic need to consume,'' she said, talking
rapidly between drags of a cigarette. ``They can't get enough. They
have to have more gold necklaces and more shoes when there are
people out there who have absolutely nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White, a slight 24-year-old who also happens to be a
skillful, sensitive painter, thinks of herself as ``rescuing things
that shouldn't be thrown out in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any shame in doing it,'' she said. ``I'm not
prostituting my body. I'm not lying or cheating my way to the top.
I'm making an honest living.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not difficult to understand how Ms. White wound up in her
line of work. She is the great-granddaughter of an Italian
immigrant who settled in Greenwich's more blue-collar Byram
section. Her father abandoned the family when she was 18 and her
mother went into the junk work her own father had done. Three years
ago, Ms. White had a baby with a man who also absconded, so she
went on welfare and joined her mother in junking.
</P>
<P>
   They say the work can earn $200 a month or more, but it is not
easy. ``When it snows, everything looks the same,'' she said. ``You
don't know what you're looking at, and it's freezing and raining.''
One thing that rankles her is when people are offended by her
activities, like the woman who caught her scavenging and icily
said, ``Please leave.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become so callous,'' Ms. White said. ``You see a bum on
the street and immediately you think, `Why don't they go to work?'
But you don't know what they went through. They can't find a place
to take a shower or they can't get the clean clothes to get to the
job. I think they want poor people to die.''

JUDITH ARRON, 56, CARNEGIE HALL DIRECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Wash., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Judith Arron, the executive and artistic director of
Carnegie Hall since 1986, died on Friday at the University of
Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver. She was 56 and lived in
Chappaqua.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was breast cancer, Carnegie Hall officials said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arron presided over probably the most momentous years of
Carnegie Hall since its rescue from the wrecking ball in 1960. The
exhaustive $60 million renovation of the hall in 1986 happened on
her watch, as well as the season-long and highly festive centennial
celebration of 1990-91.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arron used the refurbishment of Carnegie Hall's smaller
Weill Recital Hall as an opportunity to transform it from a rental
space to an important venue for events produced by the Hall. They
included debut series, chamber-music events, jazz concerts and a
new music series administered by the Carnegie Hall Composer's
Chair, which is currently held by Ellen Taaffe Zwilich.
</P>
<P>
   Under Ms. Arron, the Hall promoted and extended educational
programs both for the very young and for professionals, with
workshops overseen by musicians like Robert Shaw and Pierre Boulez.
In partnership with the Hall's president, the violinist Isaac
Stern, and its chairman, Sanford Weill, Ms. Arron began a new
endowment campaign in 1995 and had raised $87 million to date.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arron came to Carnegie Hall from Cincinnati, where she was
the Cincinnati Symphony's manager and the director of its May
Festival. Her work in developing educational outreach programs
there in 1969 was admired in orchestra circles around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, Ms. Arron had worked for the American Symphony
Orchestra League and a government arts program.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arron was born in Seattle and graduated from the University
of Puget Sound with a performance degree in cello and piano. Her
husband, Ronald Arron, is a violinist with the Metropolitan Opera
Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said Saturday that Ms. Arron's health in the last two
weeks had been ``touch and go'' but that her eight-and-a-half-year
battle with cancer had been ``a miracle'' and a victory of ``will
and heart over doctors and medicine.'' Weill cited her
``extraordinary abilities as an administrator and her keen
understanding of the financial world.''
</P>
<P>
   At her death, Ms. Arron was preparing to bring yet another
performing space to Carnegie Hall, a below-ground area long
occupied by the Carnegie Hall Cinema to be equipped with high-tech
appurtenances and intended for smaller opera productions and
experimental work.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arron is survived, in addition to her husband, by two sons,
Joseph and Edward of New York; her parents, Richard and Berenice
Hagerty of La Quinta, Calif.; a sister, Colleen Fretz of Belize,
and two brothers, Richard Hagerty Jr. of Modesto, Calif., and Dale
Hagerty of La Quinta.

COMMERCIAL STRIP BYPASSED BY INTERSTATE IS BEING REVIVED 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLINGBORO, N.J. _ Over the last decade the 614,000-square-foot
Willingboro Plaza went from a vibrant regional shopping center to a
ghost town _ 13 shuttered buildings spread over 56 acres at the
western edge of the Burlington County Township of Willingboro.
</P>
<P>
   An open-air mall, it fell victim to enclosed malls and big-box
retailers. Now, Renewal Realty LLC, a Manhattan-based developer,
plans, in partnership with the township, to transform the derelict
property along Route 130 into a mixed-use development that will
double as the town center for this community of 37,000.
</P>
<P>
   The development, called Willingboro Town Center, will have up to
1.2 million square feet of new and renovated retail, light
industrial and office and civic space and up to 240 town houses, as
well as 3,000 parking spaces. Twenty-five percent of the project
will be open space.
</P>
<P>
   The 7.5-square-mile township is considering running a minivan
service around town to the site and the plans to construct
light-rail line along the nearby Delaware River from Trenton to
Camden.
</P>
<P>
   Willingboro Plaza ``was a blight that implied the rest of the
town was decaying,'' said Lavonne Bebler Johnson, the acting mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Its redevelopment will change that and provide an ``environment
where people can live and work, and not shut down at night,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The project is part of a larger redevelopment plan by Burlington
County to revive the Route 130-Delaware River commercial corridor,
which sits in the northwestern sector of the county and extends
along the river and the highway through 12 towns, from Florence 16
miles south to Cinnaminson.
</P>
<P>
   The corridor has suffered from blight and economic decline,
leaving it pockmarked with empty buildings like those at
Willingboro Plaza, which is one of four key sites the county has
identified in its renewal effort.
</P>
<P>
   The overall plan, which takes a regional approach to
redevelopment, was devised after two years of discussions among
state and county officials as well as the leaders and residents of
the 12 corridor towns.
</P>
<P>
   The corridor plan also reflects the goals of the state's
Development and Redevelopment Plan, which encourages growth in
areas where sewers, highways and mass transit links are available.
In less developed areas, where those facilities are lacking, the
plan tries to manage growth by encouraging mixed-use and compact
development.
</P>
<P>
   At its heart, the corridor plan calls for reinventing the
highway strip, now a dying retail hub, into a patchwork of light
industrial, office and retail uses as well as housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market says that Route 130 is no longer the region's
retail center and that its heyday is not coming back,'' said Mark
Remsa, principal planner at the Burlington County Office of
Land-Use and Planning. ``But without making significant changes in
the four targeted areas, nothing in the corridor can be
preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Willingboro Town Center will be developed in phases over the
next five years at an estimated cost of $60 million to $70 million,
including the $2 million needed to clean the site of low levels of
hydrocarbons and rid the buildings of asbestos. The initial $20
million phase of the project, which includes the cleanup, began
last month and last week demolition started on the first of the
empty buildings _ 10 of which will be razed by the spring. The
remaining three will be recycled into other uses.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase also calls for the construction of some 50
residences and 65,000 square feet of commercial and light
industrial space in two buildings, as well as the renovation of an
existing 100,000-square-foot two-story building for use by public
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations are under way with the local library and Burlington
County College to relocate from elsewhere in the township to the
development, said Robert Stang, managing director at Renewal. The
college and library are expected to open within the development in
mid-2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Renewal will develop most of the property itself but will join
other developers for certain components of the project,
particularly the housing, Stang said. The units are expected to be
a mix of rental and for-sale residences designed for professional
couples and older households.
</P>
<P>
   Redeveloping the property is also important for Willingboro,
which saw its tax base erode with the demise of the old shopping
center. The loss of jobs as businesses closed also took a toll on
this old farming-turned-bedroom community, which started its modern
life in the 1950s as the nation's third Levittown; the community
briefly bore that name. The 11,000-house development built from
1957 to 1972 included Willingboro Plaza, which, like other retail
outlets along Route 130, thrived through the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '70s, a section of Interstate 295 opened, cutting
through the county and shifting growth. Within a decade, enclosed
malls began popping up along I-295, drawing shoppers and businesses
away from Route 130.
</P>
<P>
   That set off alarms two-and-a-half years ago, prompting the
county to come up with the corridor plan, which Remsa called ``a
roadmap for developers.'' The county has submitted the plan to the
Office of State Planning for approval. If approved, he said, it
would give all 12 corridor towns priority from state agencies for
approvals and financing for physical plant and road improvements.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years Willingboro also stepped up efforts to
work with the former owners of Willingboro Plaza to turn it around
_ all to no avail, said Mayor Johnson. In 1997, she said, ``we got
tough with the owners,'' by enforcing municipal and fire codes,
resulting in $900,000 in fines against them.
</P>
<P>
   Last January the two parties struck a deal, under which
Willingboro waived the fines against the owners. In turn, the plaza
owners dropped their pursuit of a $98,000 tax reduction and agreed
to deed it over to the township.
</P>
<P>
   The township then entered an agreement with Renewal to redevelop
the site.

IMPEACHMENT IS ONLY LATEST BATTLE IN `CULTURAL WAR' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The last time the House impeached a president, it
was a direct result of the Civil War. This time, the historic act
was an indirect result of a cultural war.
</P>
<P>
   President Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1868 primarily because
he rejected radical Reconstruction plans for the South. He was
spared removal from office by a single vote in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was impeached Saturday by a narrow, almost
strictly party-line vote on two articles, claiming perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   In that debate, Republicans may have contended that the case
against Clinton hinged on lying under oath and other official
misdeeds, while Democrats argued it was all about sex. But not far
beneath the surface of the historic political drama loomed a
broader, more transcendent issue.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is in the dock now, in part, because of a nasty national
battle over values that has waxed and waned for almost 30 years. In
many ways, House consideration of impeaching Clinton was the 1960s
coming home to roost.
</P>
<P>
   To many Republicans in the House and beyond, Clinton is a
classic ``if it feels good, do it'' baby boomer. To the social
conservatives who now hold sway in the GOP, Clinton is situation
ethics and moral relativism incarnate, be the issue the current
dispute about sex and lying or his older controversial actions _
draft evasion, anti-war activism and smoking marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   To many Democrats, the Republican majority _ and independent
counsel Kenneth Starr _ are direct descendants of the late Arizona
Sen. Barry Goldwater dictum that ``extremism in the defense of
liberty is no vice.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri even hinted at
the earlier ugly phenomenon of McCarthyism when he spoke of
``inquisition'' and demanded that the politics of ``smear and slash
and burn must end.''
</P>
<P>
   And as the impeachment vote neared Saturday, the split arose
sharply as House Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, characterized the House
debate as ``relativism vs. absolute truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., rose to counter that the
House was ``losing sight of the distinction between sins, which
ought to be between a person and his family and his God, and
crimes, which are the concern of the state and of society as a
whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Other elements of the cultural divide echoed earlier in the
debate.
</P>
<P>
   When a Democrat, Rep. Tom Lantos of California, said that
impeachment for lying about sex violated ``the principle of
proportionality,'' a Republican, Rep. Merrill Cook of Utah, replied
that ``a lie is a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook derided the idea that Clinton's oath before his January
deposition or his August grand jury testimony committed him only to
``the truth that's convenient.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans don't think much of attempts to make bank shots
about deeper cultural divisions off the impeachment debate. They
are quick _ and correct _ to point out that were it not for
Clinton's smarmy White House dalliances with former intern Monica
Lewinsky and his attempts to conceal them, the president would not
be caught up in the first impeachment debate in the full House in
130 years.
</P>
<P>
   But experienced social commentators believe the additional
social perspectives present in the debate are unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't just an easy theory, it is absolutely part of our
times. It's playing out right now, every day, before our eyes,''
said Haynes B. Johnson, the former Washington Post reporter who
chronicled the mood of the last decade in his ``Sleepwalking
through History: America in the Reagan Years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more than just this moment. It's much more than just
Bill Clinton,'' Johnson said. The ``cultural war'' spoken of by
conservative commentator Pat Buchanan ``is really true.''
</P>
<P>
   George Shipley, an international corporate strategist and
Democratic adviser based in Austin, Texas, said the two sides of
the impeachment debate broadly represent the classic dichotomy from
the 1960s: ``Those people who expressed a liberated lifestyle and
those who were repelled from it.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, 30 years later, Shipley said, the parameters of that
debate have shifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moral corset worn in public by these Republicans is not
very attractive,'' Shipley said, and could result in a backlash.
``The American people have sent them a message: Get off the
president's back. They haven't heard that message. It cost them the
(Newt Gingrich) speakership, and it may well cost them the Congress
in the 2000 election.``
</P>
<P>
   Susan Rasky, former chief congressional correspondent of the New
York Times and now a journalism professor at the University of
California at Berkeley who studies cultural developments, called
the current impeachment debate ``the other bookend of the cultural
revolution'' that rocked the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, she said, is ``the poster boy of everything that
(Republicans and conservatives) found hateful'' about the era. ``He
is the embodiment of everything that began to go wrong with the
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than producing a generation tempered by world war and the
Depression _ the 1960s sent forth a generation ``tempered by
nothing except prosperity,'' Rasky said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, she observed, the GOP right, which is
controlling the impeachment process, is ``the indigestible lump of
Republicanism,'' which makes the party unacceptable to a broad
swath of America.
</P>
<P>
   The animosity of conservative Republicans against Clinton has a
historic grounding, several social analysts agreed, going back to
the 1964 presidential election and the drubbing of Republican
nominee Goldwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a transcendent moment for liberalism in America,''
Haynes Johnson said. Looking at the House Republicans, he observed:
``These are Goldwater boys and girls in many ways.''
</P>
<P>
   But the political landscape quickly began to shift, beginning
with the election of Ronald Reagan as governor of California in
1966. Reagan took on the college demonstrators and what he saw as
permissive educators. Incumbent Democratic Gov. Pat Brown's attempt
to label Reagan an extremist failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under Goldwater they tasted defeat,'' Rasky said of
conservatives, ``but with Reagan they found out how to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Quickly the phenomenon took on national implications. Richard
Nixon played on similar cultural themes in the national election of
1968 and rallied ``the silent majority'' shocked by the antiwar
protests and other civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   Even that era echoed in the House debate Friday, as a Vietnam
veteran, Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, rose to speak in favor of
impeaching Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you serve in the Vietnam War?'' Hyde asked Johnson,
drawing the unspoken comparison with Clinton, who resisted military
service in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Johnson said, and earlier in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much time did you spend in a prison camp in Hanoi?'' Hyde
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly seven years,'' Johnson answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're qualified to talk about the military service,''
said Hyde, his broader, deeper meaning lost on almost no one. &QL;

PROVIDING HOMETOWN FELLOWSHIP OF CHRISTMAS FOR THOSE WHO WILL BE
AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Minn., Miss., S.D., Texas, Va.)  (rl) 
 By NADINE BROZAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Christmas was still a week away, but the spirit of
Christmas Eve prevailed at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church.
</P>
<P>
   For the last four years, the majestic church at Fifth Avenue and
55th Street has conducted what it terms the ``Travelers' Christmas
Eve,'' a service intended for parishioners who are leaving town for
the holidays. Visitors are welcome too.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, in 1995, the early Christmas Eve was a hit,
and this week it drew 625 people. The service Thursday night was
identical in every way to the one that will be conducted twice on
Christmas Eve itself, complete with prayer, sermon, choir, brass
and string instruments, audience caroling and a candlelight
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become a tradition, and the key point is not to make
people feel it is a lesser service or miniservice,'' the Rev.
Thomas Tewell, senior pastor of the congregation, said. ``It makes
people who travel feel that this is the way the church cares for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Other churches in the city will be having services for travelers
Sunday, among them Marble Collegiate Church, Riverside Church, and
the Unitarian Church of All Souls, where, in addition to Christmas
services Sunday morning, there will be what the Rev. F. Forrester
Church described as a ``New York City-Sioux Falls Christmas
pageant, the same pageant you grew up with in Sioux Falls with
children dressed as wise men, shepherds and sheep.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Arthur Caliandro of Marble Collegiate Church, where
Sunday's service will include the Christmas story, carols and music
from Handel's ``Messiah,'' said: ``When people go away to Ohio,
Nebraska, wherever, they still want to have Christmas in their New
York church. If we don't have a full-blown Christmas experience for
them here, they leave wanting.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Judson Memorial Church, an interdenominational
Christian church in the heart of Greenwich Village, where for years
there has been no service on either Christmas Eve or Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our people travel and the idea that Jesus was born in
late December was a European invention and is arbitrary,'' the Rev.
Peter Laarman, the senior minister, said. ``We made a considered
decision this year that because Christmas is Friday, it would be OK
to have the main celebration on Dec. 20.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampering with the traditional service schedule for either
Christmas Eve or Christmas Day is unthinkable among Roman
Catholics, Episcopalians or members of other orthodox
denominations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not critical of what others do, but it wouldn't be
liturgically proper,'' said Joseph Zwilling, spokesman for the
Archdiocese of New York. ``This is the last Sunday of Advent, and
the Christmas Eve service anticipates the Christmas Mass.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the lack of a precise date for the birth of Jesus that
gives the more liberal denominations justification for celebrating
early.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly a dilemma that certain congregations,
especially ones with affluent people who travel a great deal,
face,'' said Peter Awn, professor of religion at Columbia
University. ``Do you allow the community to diminish in order to
keep to an artificial date? What services like this say is that if
you care about community building, you must make what appear to be
untraditional compromises.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly community was important at Fifth Avenue Presbyterian
Church, where greeters were on hand at every doorway wishing people
merry Christmas, and where worshippers hugged and kissed one
another.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith Marsh, who will spend the holiday in Brandon, Miss.,
brought a group of friends also about to disperse across the
country: Don Latham to New Orleans, Elizabeth Brooks to Houston,
Heather Murrell to Gruver, Texas, and Alicia Kelly to Norfolk, Va.
``I think this is wonderful,'' Ms. Marsh said. ``I wouldn't miss
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie Manning, who will be in Minneapolis on Christmas, stood
at the back of the sanctuary holding her daughter, Alex, who will
be 1 on Dec. 30. Ms. Manning is due to have her second child next
month. ``Whoever would have thought you would find something so
welcoming in the middle of Manhattan,'' she said.

<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ With an improbable cast assembled, then
cajoled into becoming a team by the demanding Bill Parcells, the
Jets captured their first division title in almost 30 years on
Saturday with a difficult 17-10 victory over the Buffalo Bills.
</P>
<P>
   The last time they could call themselves a division champion,
the Jets were still playing in the American Football League. It was
1969, the time of Woodstock and Joe Namath, and Muhammad Ali was in
exile.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Jets can also clinch an important first-round playoff
bye if the Jacksonville Jaguars lose Sunday night at Minnesota or
if the Jets win their regular-season finale next Sunday at Giants
Stadium against the New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets improved their record to 11-4, equaling the franchise
record for victories in a season, and Vinny Testaverde, who threw
for two touchdowns, brought his record as their starting
quarterback to 11-1.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde completed 14 of 23 passes for 184 yards and was not
intercepted. He won the duel with the Bills' resurrected veteran,
Doug Flutie, who finished 14 of 38 for 220 yards with 1 touchdown
and 1 interception.
</P>
<P>
   With 2 minutes 15 seconds left in the third quarter, the Jets
broke a 10-10 tie as Testaverde connected on his 25th touchdown
pass of the season, one under the club record. He hit a wide-open
Dedric Ward, the Jets' speediest receiver, who had eluded
inexperienced cornerback Donovan Greer.
</P>
<P>
   Ward turned it into a 71-yard touchdown, scampering the final 50
yards with Greer at his heels.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1960, when the team was still the Titans, Al Dorow
tossed 26 touchdowns. Joe Namath tied that mark in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie got the Bills back down to the Jets' 22-yard line with
under four minutes remaining in the game, but his pass for Kevin
Williams was bobbled and deflected to Victor Green, who dived for
the interception. Replays appeared inconclusive as to whether Green
actually had possession when he hit the ground, but the Jets were
awarded the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The disappointments had rolled by year after year for the Jets.
Many of these Jet players were not even alive in 1969, when they
captured their last division title. And how many knew that that was
in the old American Football League?
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the leagues merged. And the Jets had been the only
club from that original, post-merger group of 26 teams that had
never won a divisional title.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde, a player who had been cut by Baltimore at the age of
35 and waited around much of last summer before being signed, has
led the Jets this far _ as improbable a hero as some of the rest of
the cast Parcells and his staff had assembled.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that Saturday alone, Dave Meggett was in on a big run
on the opening score; Bryan Cox helped position it by stripping the
ball; and Pepper Johnson recovered it.
</P>
<P>
   Meggett had been out of work since being cut by the Patriots in
May, when a court appearance clouded his future; Cox had been
working at home after being released by Chicago; and Johnson was
returning from knee surgery. But Parcells loved them all.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie came into the game with a 5-0 record at home, in a season
that the 36-year-old veteran of the Canadian Football League has
called ``my second rookie year.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of the opening half, which ended in a 7-7 tie, he
cavorted like a rookie, as he was being hurried repeatedly by the
Jets' pass rush. But he tossed several completions just as
onrushing defenders leveled him.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have a remarkably small player of their own in wide
receiver Wayne Chrebet, and he helped lift them to a 7-0 lead in
the opening quarter.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Bills coughed up the ball, a rarity. Buffalo entered
the game having fumbled only five times all season, which tied the
Bills for the second-best mark in the league. Overall, they had
turned the ball over fewer times than all but five clubs.
</P>
<P>
   But Antowain Smith, carrying the ball at the Jets' 20-yard line
on what was shaping up to be a Bills scoring drive, was met by Cox.
This was Cox's first regular-season appearance here since his
famous incident in 1995, when he had a fight and then spit at the
fans. Cox, apparently unfazed Saturday, stripped the ball from
Smith and Johnson recovered it for the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde then helped march the Jets 79 yards to a score. On
the first play of the drive, Keyshawn Johnson joined Chrebet in the
1,000-yard receiving club as he snared a 16-yarder. It marked the
first time since 1986, and the tandem of Al Toon and Wesley Walker,
that two Jets had achieved the milestone.
</P>
<P>
   Then Dave Meggett, playing for the third time under Parcells,
appeared for the first time in a Jets uniform and produced some
minor heroics. On a second-and-11, Meggett dashed for 18 yards,
almost breaking all the way for a score. Chrebet made a diving
catch for 22 yards and finally snared a 7-yarder in the end zone
from Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie was to throw 26 times in the half, completing only 12,
but he made several big plays on third down. One pass to Williams
was good for 22 yards and moved the Bills beyond midfield in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Flutie, who also ran twice in the first half,
scrambled down to the 30. After getting to the 25, Flutie was under
intense pressure from Cox, who hit him just as he released a screen
pass to Thurman Thomas. Thomas caught the ball 5 yards downfield
and ran the rest of the way to the end zone to complete a 25-yard
pass play that helped tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills got close enough for a chip-shot field goal in the
closing seconds of the opening half, but Steve Christie's 28-yard
attempt was wide to the left.
</P>
<P>
   John Hall, though, successfully booted a 48-yarder, through the
same uprights, to close out the Jets' opening drive of the third
quarter. It gave them a 10-7 lead, and marked the 13th successful
field goal, in 16 tries, since John Kidd became the punter and new
holder for Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the period, Christie, kicking into the wind, generated
a 44-yard field goal.

PREMIER OF NOVA SCOTIA CLEARED IN RAPE TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs to correct day of aquittal to Friday from Saturday. No
other changes.)  (jw) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The former premier of Nova Scotia was acquitted Friday
of eight charges of rape, attempted rape and indecent assault
related to incidents that allegedly took place 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The former premier, Gerald Regan, now 70, led the province's
government from 1970 to 1978. He was also a member of the federal
Parliament and a Cabinet minister under Prime Minister Pierre
Trudeau.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long, long ordeal,'' he said after hearing the
jury's decision. ``We've lived and died with this for the last five
years.''
</P>
<P>
   A jury of six women and four men deliberated about eight hours
before returning the not guilty verdict in a Halifax courtroom
Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But it was only after the jury had been sequestered Thursday
night that it became known that besides the three women who had
testified during the trial, 19 other women had told investigators
they had been sexually assaulted or harassed by Regan years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Michael MacDonald, blocked attempts by prosecutors to
allow some of the other alleged victims to testify, and limited
this trial to just the charges brought by three women. The judge
also issued a publication ban, which prevented any information
about the other cases from being reported during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of Regan, a respected public figure in Nova Scotia,
was one of the most sensational proceedings in Canada in recent
years. It brought calls from some quarters for a statute of
limitations on criminal charges. The trial also forced Canadians to
try to reconcile two starkly different images of a man who had
spent most of his adult life in public service.
</P>
<P>
   Regan, a tall, stately man, was always formal and polite as he
marched into and out of the Halifax courthouse. Inside the
courtroom, however, the prosecution and three alleged victims
portrayed him as a brutal rapist and sexual predator who enjoyed
watching his victims cringe in fear.
</P>
<P>
   It came down to Regan's word against the moving testimony of the
alleged victims. The accusers, now middle-aged women, said they
were teen-agers when the attacks took place, often after Regan had
parked his car in an isolated area. The women all said they knew
him then but not intimately.
</P>
<P>
   Regan steadfastly denied making advances to the women.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trial, his wife, Carole, 62, defended him against
the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   The crown prosecutor, Adrian Reid, told the jury that despite
Regan's gentlemanly demeanor and public reputation, he had ``a dark
side'' that led him to prey on young women.
</P>
<P>
   The jury's acquittal was a stinging loss for the prosecution,
which had spent five years on the case. ``If there are grounds for
appeal, we'll consider them,'' Reid told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But Regan's lawyer, Edward Greenspan, said that prosecutors had
been off base from the moment the investigation was launched. ``If
he had not been the former premier of this province they would
never have spent millions of dollars pursuing him,'' Greenspan
said. ``It just wouldn't have happened to an ordinary citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   Regan's troubles have not ended. He is scheduled to appear in
court again next February as proceedings begin on another sex
complaint.

 &HT;    CLINTON LAUNCHES FIGHT TO SAVE HIS PRESIDENCY
 &HT;    840&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hours after becoming the only president in this
century to be impeached, President Clinton launched the next phase
of his fight for political survival Saturday, vowing he would not
be hounded from office and calling for a censure deal in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring a stunning challenge by House Speaker-designate Bob
Livingston to follow his example and resign, Clinton pledged to
remain in the White House ''until the last hour of the last day of
my term.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in a dramatic appeal from the White House lawn, Clinton
asked all Americans to mend the tears which a year of scandal and
bitter partisanship have ripped in the fabric of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must stop the politics of personal destruction,'' Clinton
declared.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must get rid of the poisonous venom of excessive
partisanship, obsessive animosity, and uncontrolled anger,'' he
said. ''That is not what America deserves. That is not what America
is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by his wife, Vice President Al Gore, and 101 of his
staunchest House Democratic supporters, Clinton was visibly
stricken by conflicting emotions in a setting that mixed some of
the somberness of a wake with much of the rhetorical energy of a
campaign rally.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton struggled to fend off tears as Gore hailed him as ''one
of our greatest presidents,'' praising Clinton's efforts through
six years of peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton appeared more determined than wounded as he pledged
to ignore calls for his resignation and press on to complete his
second term.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want the American people to know today that I am still
committed to working with people of good faith and good will of
both parties to do what's best for our country, to bring our nation
together, to lift our people up, to move us all forward together,''
Clinton said. ''It's what I've tried to do for six years. It's what
I intend to do for two more, until the last hour of the last day of
my term.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore the point, Clinton donned the mantle of
commander-in-chief, going directly into a meeting with his national
security team to assess the impact of four days of U.S. and British
attacks on Iraqi military and communications sites.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have achieved our mission,'' Clinton said in an address to
the nation after the meeting, at which he decided to declare
victory and end air strikes against Iraq after 70 punishing hours.
''I want to give my thanks to our men and women in uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   The focus of Clinton's attention, however, was the battle he's
waging on Capitol Hill, where the House voted to impeach him on two
charges _ perjury before a grand jury and obstruction of justice _
in connection with his attempts to cover up an intimate
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's House action, the first since Andrew Johnson's
impeachment in 1868, moves the issue to the Senate, which is
expected to hold a trial to determine whether to convict Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A conviction on either charge would require a two-thirds
majority vote in the Senate and would result in Clinton's immediate
removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of House Republicans, however, have urged Clinton to
head off a Senate inquiry by resigning.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, a Republican from Louisiana, said he would forego
the chance to become speaker of the House and step down from
Congress in six months as political penance for repeated instances
of adultery he admitted to several days ago.
</P>
<P>
   He then challenged Clinton to step down, saying, ``I must set
the example that I hope President Clinton will follow.''
</P>
<P>
   In his South Lawn address, Clinton made no mention of
Livingston's challenge, but White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said
''the president's wish is that Representative Livingston would
reconsider the decision he announced on the floor today.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the Senate impeachment fight, Clinton said he would
try to achieve in the Senate what he was unable to win from the
House _ an agreement to drop the impeachment charges and instead
approve a resolution of censure condemning him for his conduct in
the Lewinsky matter but ending the constitutional process that
threatens his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have accepted responsibility for what I did wrong in my
personal life, and I have invited members of Congress to work with
us to find a reasonable, bipartisan, and proportionate response,''
said Clinton. ''That approach was rejected today by Republicans in
the House, but I hope it will be embraced in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   With his personal attorney Gregory Craig looking on, Clinton
said ''I hope there will be a constitutional and fair means of
resolving this matter in a prompt manner.''
</P>
<P>
   With opinion polls showing that about 65 percent of Americans
believe Clinton is doing a good job as president, he made clear
that part of his Senate strategy will be to continue to plead his
case to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ask the American people to move with me, to go on from here,
to rise above the rancor,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Even as he was surrounded by political allies, though, Clinton
found himself a lonely historical figure _ only the second American
president ever to be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the darkest moment of his political career, Clinton
declined to watch the first House vote to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton closeted himself in the Oval Office, where tiny
white lights flickered on a large Christmas tree. With him was the
Rev. Tony Campolo, an old friend and one of a group of spiritual
advisers Clinton to whom he has turned since his admission last
August that he had an ``inappropriate'' relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   After the first vote, Clinton moved into a nearby study with his
chief of staff, John Podesta, and one of his closest policy aides,
Douglas Sosnik. Together, the group watched the House approve one
additional article of impeachment against him and vote down two
more.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Clinton strode out of the Oval Office, through a
glass door on which hung a large green Christmas wreath with a
broad red bow, to address reporters. First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton was at his side, her right arm tucked over his left.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath steely gray skies and the twisted limbs of barren trees,
staff members took deep breaths and exchanged quick grasps of
hands, as if to gird themselves for a moment as solemn as the
winter afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a sad day for the presidency, the constitution and the
country,'' said one aide. ''But there's also a sense of relief that
it's moved out of the House, where it's been so partisan and
bitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton let others do the public criticizing of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., lambasted House
Republicans for managing what he called ''a partisan vote that was
a disgrace to our country and our Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore continued the theme.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me say simply, the president has acknowledged that what he
did was wrong,'' said Gore. ''But we must all acknowledge that
invoking the solemn power of impeachment in the cause of partisan
politics is wrong. Wrong for our Constitution, wrong for the United
States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   With those attacks out of the way, Clinton was free to take the
high road, calling for national reconciliation in the wake of the
most bitterly partisan political year in at least a generation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Out in the country people are pulling together,'' Clinton
said. ''But, just as America is coming together, it must look, from
the country's point of view, like Washington is coming apart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have some atmosphere of decency and civility,'' he
said, ``some presumption of good faith, some sense of
proportionality and balance in bringing judgment against those who
are in different parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Following his appearance at the edge of the Rose Garden, Clinton
ignored a couple of questions shouted at him from reporters.
Instead, he strode among his Democratic supporters as if presiding
over a memorial service, shaking hands, patting backs and
expressing his gratitude for their support.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thanks,'' Clinton said to Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., the former
civil rights leader who has been among Clinton's sturdiest
defenders over a long a scandal-stained year.
</P>
<P>
   Then Clinton leaned over the broad shoulders of the congressman,
locked him in a long embrace with both arms and slapped him on the
back.

LIVINGSTON'S DRAMATIC RESIGNATION STUNS LAWMAKERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Capping one of the craziest weeks in House history,
Speaker-designate Bob Livingston, who admitted to adultery earlier
in the week, shocked colleagues Saturday by giving up his post and
promising to resign his seat.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., a former wrestling coach first
elected to Congress in 1986, quickly emerged as the frontrunner for
the job.
</P>
<P>
   The latest setback hit as House Republicans were reeling from an
array of problems, including internal bickering between moderates
and conservatives, plummeting popularity with voters, and
increasing partisan tensions with Democrats. Members of both
parties said they feared Livingston had become the latest casualty
of a ``sexual McCarthyism'' spreading in Washington, whereby
private lives were being exposed for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   While he had been informally chosen by his party last month to
be speaker, Livingston still faced an official election by new
House members next month. His confession alienated some
conservative members who indicated they might reconsider their
support.
</P>
<P>
   He was to replace Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who quit the post after
November midterm elections went poorly for the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Livingston's announcement could not have been more
dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing colleagues gathered in the House chamber for a
historic presidential impeachment vote, Livingston called on
President Clinton to resign, prompting Democrats to boo and chant
that the incoming speaker was the one who should resign.
</P>
<P>
   Before they could finish taunting him, the lanky Louisianan
dropped the bombshell that he would do just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my colleagues, my friends, and most especially my wife and
family, I have hurt you all deeply and I beg your forgiveness,'' he
said to a suddenly hushed chamber. ``I was prepared to lead our
narrow majority as speaker and I believed I had it in me to do a
fine job. But I cannot do that job or be that kind of leader I
would like to be under the current circumstances,'' he said. `` So
I must set the example that I hope President Clinton will follow.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would resign from the House in six months.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his statement, lawmakers of both parties, some of
them tearful, gave Livingston a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats expressed disbelief at Livingston's
decision, with a number urging him to reconsider. They complained
that the episode further indicated a deterioration of civility and
respect for privacy in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're eating ourselves,'' bemoaned Texas Democratic Rep. Nick
Lampson.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., one of the few Republicans arguing
against impeachment, said that events of the last week should serve
as a ``wake-up call.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are destroying and consuming ourselves with hatred,'' he
said. ``There will be more dead bodies along the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press, citing Republican sources, reported that
Livingston's wife, Bonnie, had asked him to step down.
</P>
<P>
   The latest drama began unfolding Thursday evening when
Livingston disclosed to colleagues that he occasionally had
extramarital affairs during his 33-year marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston revealed the affairs to pre-empt an investigation by
media, including Larry Flynt's Hustler Magazine. A story about his
adultery had been posted on the Internet site operated by the
Washington newspaper, Roll Call.
</P>
<P>
   While most Republicans continued to back Livingston, it became
apparent that a number of conservatives were unhappy with the
revelations.
</P>
<P>
   In the newly elected House where the GOP holds a six-vote
majority, Livingston could not afford a defection of even a
handful.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., said Friday that about a dozen
conservatives were unhappy with Livingston's conduct. Wamp said he
relayed those concerns to Livingston on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Wamp said Livingston was aware of his eroding support. ``He
looked at me and said, `You need to find a new leader.'''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston emerged as party leader last month after House
Republicans became increasingly disgruntled with Gingrich in the
aftermath of the party's showing in the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich decided to resign rather than face a challenge by
Livingston, who had amassed considerable clout as chairman of the
appropriations committee.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Livingston has come under increasing criticism,
particularly from Democrats angry that he delegated to House
Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the task of overseeing the
impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   Many believed that DeLay was pressuring moderate Republicans
into voting for impeachment by ruling out the possibility that the
House might consider censure as an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats became even more furious with Livingston when he sided
with DeLay on the censure issue.
</P>
<P>
   However, DeLay is likely to amass even more power if Hastert is
elected speaker. The Illinois lawmaker has served as DeLay's top
deputy in his whip operation.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of Livingston's announcement, DeLay had endorsed
Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will make a great speaker,'' said DeLay, whose office also
sent out a list of 80 lawmakers backing Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's standing was bolstered by the backing of other
powerful allies including Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, and
Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   After speaking to his wife, Hastert announced his intention to
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``After searching my heart and discussing it with my family and
closest friends, my sense of duty now calls me to serve our free
nation by seeking a position of great responsibility _ that of
speaker of the United States House of Representatives,'' he said in
a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chris Cox, R-Calif. also said he would consider running for
the post. Another potential candidate, Texas Republican Rep. Bill
Archer quickly ruled himself out.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were hoping that either DeLay or Armey, combative
conservatives who alienate liberals, might run for speaker so they
could have someone to run against in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, the liberal Democrat from Massachusetts,
joked that ``there's a great fear in the Democratic caucus that Tom
Delay would not be speaker. If he needed money for his campaign we
would raise it.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay and Armey said they would not run for speaker.

GOALS OF AIR STRIKES WERE `RELATIVELY MODEST' 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IRAQ-RDP, IRAQ-HIDE, IRAQ-POLICY, IRAQ-ENTERPRISE,
IRAQ-B1-BOMBER, IRAQ-U.S.-ARABS.) (mk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton called off the air strikes
that had rained hundreds of cruise missiles down on Iraq last week,
he could claim justifiably that he had achieved the goal
established on the first day of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objectives were clear,'' he said Saturday night in
announcing that he had ordered a halt to the air strikes after four
days. The United States, he said, had sought ``to degrade Saddam's
weapons of mass destruction program'' and ``his capacity to attack
his neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Again and again over the last week, Clinton and his senior aides
have said the central goal of the air strikes was to ``degrade''
the ability of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to develop chemical
and biological weapons. And that mission, the president said
Saturday, ``is now complete.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``degrade'' can mean many things. It is possible to degrade
a target heavily. It is possible to degrade one slightly.
</P>
<P>
   And as senior administration officials acknowledge, albeit on
condition of anonymity, the aftermath of the bombing campaign will
be a weakened Iraq, but one still capable within months _ and
possibly just weeks or days _ of threatening its neighbors with an
arsenal of chemical, biological and even nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. weapons inspectors believe the Iraqis are still hiding tons
of nerve gas and that they are seeking to obtain uranium from a
rogue nation or terrorist groups to complete as many as four
nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department insisted that last week's air strikes had
set back by at least one year Iraq's program to build ballistic
missiles capable of delivering chemical and biological weapons. But
Iraq retains a number of mobile missiles capable of hitting targets
in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very limited air campaign,'' said Adm. Stanley
Arthur, the retired four-star admiral who oversaw all naval forces
during the 1991 Persian Gulf war, which included weeks of air
strikes that were several times larger than the combined strikes of
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goals here are fairly modest,'' he said. ``All this can do
is set back the Iraqis on some sort of time scale. And I would
guess that you're talking about months.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials say they are drafting plans for
another set of air strikes against Iraq early next year, after the
end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   No decision has been made on whether to carry out additional
American air strikes next year, but the fact that the planners are
already at work suggests that the Pentagon recognizes the severe
limits of the air campaign that ended Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can maintain some degree of international consensus
about this, I think we'll be going back,'' said an administration
official who is involved in the planning.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Secretary of Defense William Cohen made clear
Saturday that they would still like to see U.N. weapons inspections
resume and that they will continue to rely on the punishing
economic sanctions that have done as much as any missile to
``contain'' Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton again indicated that the best way to solve the
problem ``is for Iraq to have a different government.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In this military strike, the weapon of choice was the cruise
missile. And the limitations of the missile could be seen as a
metaphor for the administration's limited goals.
</P>
<P>
   While the ground-hugging missiles are more likely to hit their
targets than traditional free-falling bombs, they sometimes miss,
they pack less of a punch than many types of so-called dumb bombs,
and they are expensive, about $1 million each.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has acknowledged using at least 290 of them in the
air strikes last week, meaning that U.S. taxpayers are already out
a quarter of a billion dollars, just for cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The reliance on these weapons over traditional bombing _ in
which pilots take the risk of flying close to their targets and
dropping more powerful explosives _ was a virtual acknowledgement
by the administration of the modesty of its goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cruise missiles are great at the start when you want that
element of surprise and pinpoint accuracy,'' Arthur said. ``But
they are not hard-target destroyers. For that, you need to get the
fixed-wing assets in there, with more penetrating weapons and with
some of the bigger warheads.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But if the target is worth getting, you're going to have to
take that risk at some point,'' he added. ``If you're not going to
take that risk, the results will always be limited.''

STERN FIGHTS TO SAVE NBA EMPIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Recite David Stern's successes, and the list
starts to sound almost cliche.
</P>
<P>
   The storied rise of the NBA with Stern as commissioner is so
well-documented, so oft-cited, the average fan could play
word-association games with Stern's resume and without hesitation
complete the following sentences:
</P>
<P>
   Before Stern took over, the NBA played ... to half-empty arenas.
</P>
<P>
   Before Stern took over, the NBA Finals were broadcast ... on
tape delay.
</P>
<P>
   Before Stern took over, the league was viewed as ... a
collection of drug users and thugs.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when Stern became NBA commissioner in 1984, it would
have seemed fantasy to suggest the league would one day wilt under
the immense weight of its prosperity, as opposed to crumbling under
the weight of its problems.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is the state of the NBA today _ a league too successful
for its own good, its incredible fortunes having begotten the most
damaging labor war in its history.
</P>
<P>
   Stern, players and owners, who just 14 years ago forged a
partnership that gradually burgeoned into a multibillion-dollar
global enterprise, have shut down their money machine because they
cannot agree on how to divide the $2 billion annual fortune.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's nearly six-month-old lockout threatens to wipe out the
entire 1998-99 season. Stern himself will have to make that fateful
decision _ probably within the next 14 days if no progress is made.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the lockout has badly tarnished the NBA's reputation
and threatens to destroy everything Stern helped create. Yet you
would hardly know it by listening to Stern's detached assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an economic model that needs some remodeling,'' he
says flatly, almost comically underplaying the crisis that has
wiped out 300-plus games and counting. ``Successful companies have
labor problems at one time or another.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the voice of ``Easy Dave,'' as he dubbed himself during
the 1995 labor negotiations. The commissioner is renowned for
profanity-laced tirades behind closed doors but in public it's all
statesman and salesman.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the NBA has canceled games over labor issues for
the first time in history, or that it may become the first pro
sports league to cancel a season.
</P>
<P>
   Easy Dave's sales pitch right now is this: lockout or no, things
could be far worse. He knows. He's been there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest crisis this league faced was ... in the late '70s
and early '80s (when Stern was NBA general counsel). We were a
league that had very little following, and predictions of our
demise were widespread,'' Stern said during a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were viewed as having too many African-American players, we
were viewed as the only place in the country where drugs was an
issue and where players earned too much money _ about $200,000
apiece.... The only time we ever made the evening news was if a
player got hit by another player, or a story on race or empty
arenas or drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the last year has brought the NBA more bad publicity
for drug abuse (Allen Iverson, Isaiah Rider) and violence (Latrell
Sprewell). But it took the lockout, imposed by owners July 1, to
really smear the league's image and close the book on a decade and
a half of unbridled growth.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that, for the 1983-84 season, average attendance was
10,620 per game, ticket sales were about 10 million and arenas were
filled to about 60 percent of capacity. In 1997-98, attendance
averaged 17,135, ticket sales reached close to 20 million and
arenas were filled past 90 percent capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum salary was $272,500, the median was about $1.3
million, and the top players commanded $10 to $20 million a year.
Coaches too are prospering _ all but four cleared $1 million last
year _ and Stern himself reportedly makes about $7 million (though
he is declining paychecks during the lockout).
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately, the commissioner's paycheck has grown with the
value of the sport he governs. Stern himself grew up with the NBA,
beginning in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-born Stern was 24 when he landed a $7,800-a-year
job with the law firm that handled the league's legal matters. By
1978 he rose to general counsel for the league under Commissioner
Larry O'Brien and six years later succeeded him.
</P>
<P>
   The ascension did not exactly come as a surprise to those who
watched him grow up.
</P>
<P>
   Suns owner Jerry Colangelo recalls, ``I came into the NBA in
1966 with the startup of the Chicago Bulls. David joined the NBA as
in-house counsel a year later, so I have seen him grow and develop
over those 31 years. I recognized early on that he was very bright,
articulate and was an excellent lawyer and saw him develop other
skills, like becoming very adept at a marketing sense and how to
sell a product, which was new ground for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it has been Stern's business and sales acumen as much as
his lawyer skills that has characterized the era. Creation of
subsidiaries, NBA Properties and NBA Entertainment, gave the league
a marketing machine and television production company. Stern also
planted seeds of the league around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   He played a role in the 1976 settlement that brought free agency
to the NBA, helped create the salary cap system that possibly saved
the league and instituted pro sports' first drug policy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Stern didn't turn a flailing league into a
multibillion-dollar corporation on his own. For that, he owes much
to Magic, Larry and Michael. But Stern helped channel all that
charisma, skill and drama into an entertainment dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how these negotiations turn out, Stern's place in
sports history is cemented in the same bracket as the NFL's Pete
Rozelle.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Stern, I think, is one of the most brilliant sports
executives in the history of modern-day sports,'' said Steve Wood,
a player agent and professor of sports business at Clark Atlanta
University.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the lockout nears the six-month mark and polls show
increasing disdain and disinterest in the league, the intertwined
fortunes of the league and its esteemed leader are in peril.
</P>
<P>
   Is the presumed genius of Stern finally failing? Not exactly. In
fact, quite possibly the opposite. Some observers, including
agents, say he's never been more effective than during this
lockout.
</P>
<P>
   He planned ahead by securing a four-year, $2.6 billion
television contract that provided the league income even without
games being played. He's strategically refused to set a drop-dead
date for saving the season to keep his adversary off kilter.
</P>
<P>
   And he has done his best to undermine the union by playing off
the lower- and middle-income players against the superstars, whose
salaries he wants to cap. Late last week he took that approach to
the extreme, directly mailing a nine-page proposal, aimed at the
middle class, to all 430 players, circumventing union leadership.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part the players have stood firm, but in recent
weeks, having missed three paychecks, several have broken ranks
with the union. In a union conference call, numerous agents lobbied
union head Billy Hunter to compromise and settle.
</P>
<P>
   And while Stern continues to publicly posture about how far
apart the two sides are, it is the players' association that has
arguably made the most concessions to date _ among them, a cap on
some superstar salaries, a decrease from 20 percent to 10 percent
on annual pay raises and longer rookie contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Stern's strategy is long term, and the lesson here is the NBA is
trying to avoid the fate of other pro sports leagues, notably Major
League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball owners lost their fight for salary controls during the
1994 strike, and the result is the current spending spree that's
created a huge competitive chasm between rich teams and poor teams.
The current hand-wringing among baseball owners could portend a
labor battle for the ages in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Stern is trying to avoid the same Band-Aid approach baseball
took, only to have things get worse.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he'll spend his days watching the league he
resurrected take daily beatings from media and fans, knowing the
damage could be permanent if his gambit doesn't get the desired
results.
</P>
<P>
   Stern's success is the league's success, and likewise the
league's failings will be tied to the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Stern's image) is already tarnished,'' said agent
Marc Fleisher. ``I don't think David could ever get back to where
he was prior to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Colangelo: ``Is his stomach churning over this whole state
of events? Sure it is. As is mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Stern lets it show.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I took it personally, I wouldn't be able to do it,'' he
says. ``I've been doing this since 1967, and we've been in some
real donnybrooks. This is one of the best.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to come out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   So says Easy Dave.

TOP BILLING: GASH BOWLS 'EM OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several of his teammates came up to Sam Gash Wednesday to give
him the good news, but for Gash seeing was believing. So in this
Age of the Computer, Gash's Buffalo Bills teammates did what they
must in such a circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   They downloaded the proof for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys were looking on the internet and they saw I'd been
picked for the Pro Bowl,'' the former Patriots fullback said last
week. ``I said, `Stop bulljiving me.' So they copied it and brought
it to me. I was amazed.''
</P>
<P>
   Not as amazed as the host of the Pro Bowl announcement show that
night on ESPN, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``On TV, they didn't really know what to say about my
position,'' Gash joked. ``When they came to the NFC fullback they
said, `Mike Alstott has 697 yards rushing and five touchdowns.'
Then they go, `In the AFC, Sam Gash has 186 yards total (31 rushing
on 10 carries). That dude is sorry, man. He musta got in on a
humbug.' It was funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have your peers vote you in for the kind of stuff I do _
block, block, block _ is the highest honor I've ever received
because I'm hard to find. Unless you're playing against me.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently that was the Patriots' problem last offseason. The
people running the place had never had to pry Sam Gash off the
front of their helmet and thus forgot what he brings to a team when
his knee is right and his coach believes in him and he's free to
knock people's socks off. In such a circumstance, Gash was twice
named a first alternate to the Pro Bowl and this year became the
AFC's starting fullback for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   But just a year ago, under far less positive circumstances, Gash
was called a whiner. He was called injury prone. He was called
unable to realize his worth. He was also called at home one day and
told he wasn't wanted anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Gash was being replaced, it was said, by a younger, faster,
stronger, less injury prone, cheaper, softer-handed guy named Tony
Carter, who had just been told he was no longer wanted in Chicago.
That is no reflection on either guy because that's the way things
go in the NFL these days. What is a reflection is what you do after
you leave.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what Sam Gash did.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Gash has only 31 yards rushing. It is 10 times the
production New England has received from Carter, who has 3 yards
rushing.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Carter has 17 pass receptions for 155 yards and no
touchdowns. Gash has 17 pass receptions for 155 yards and two
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Gash has not missed a game, playing in all 14 and
leading the blocking for 1,000-yard rusher Antowain Smith. Carter
has already missed four games with injury and will sit out again
Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Gash is aware of all this but will say nothing against the
man who replaced him because ``Tony is a very good fullback, and
that's coming from one fullback to another,'' Gash said. ``I just
felt given a fair opportunity I could play, too. They didn't see
that, or they didn't want to see that. Fine. They obviously felt I
wasn't their kind of player. I understand that's just business. I
thank them now for letting me go, because I got to come to a place
where they believe in me. They believed I was a good football
player here from the day they signed me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came up here believing I had to prove to them I could play,
but they had the attitude that I could and that never wavered. From
the first day they put me in position to succeed. I was amazed at
that after what happened in New England. So it doesn't bother me
that they didn't want to re-sign me. It's the way they did things
that bothers me.''
</P>
<P>
   The way the Patriots did things was for some in the organization
to whisper that Gash was damaged goods while others were assuring
him they would find a way to re-sign him. Some claimed they tried
to reach him by phone repeatedly without success while he insists
no such calls came. Instead, they spoke once with his agent and
decided his contract demands were ridiculous and that was the end
of it.
</P>
<P>
   There was no negotiation, they now acknowledge, but say Gash's
people left no room for it. Perhaps, but they willingly paid more
than $2 million a year to Max Lane and ended up benching him a
month ago and handed over a $500,000 signing bonus to a receiver
named Brian Stablein, who had never taken a snap for them and was
cut in August without ever playing a game in New England.
</P>
<P>
   As happy as Sam Gash is, it is not easy for him to forget what
he was put through last year.
</P>
<P>
   Not if you play the game the way Gash does. There is nothing
fancy about his approach. It is a street fight every down, so if
you want to attack him, you had best bring your lunch pail because
it will be a long day for you.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, Gash is going to the Pro Bowl in February, his
running mate is over 1,000 yards with two games to go, his team is
happy with him, and he is a leader in their locker room. In other
words, he has done for the Bills what he did for the Patriots until
somebody decided he was an overpriced, broken-down piece of
machinery instead of what he really was _ a darned good football
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said I was injury prone,'' Gash recalled. ``I found that
funny. The only time I ever missed was when I hurt my knee (late in
the 1996 run to the Super Bowl). I played with busted ribs and a
bad wrist, so for them to say I was injury prone was a slap in my
face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to blast them. They got a good fullback and I
was out. I just wish they told me they didn't want me and that was
the end of it, but one guy tells you one thing there and the other
tells you something different.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of right now, I hate the Patriots organization. I would
never want to be associated with them again. I'm loyal to the end,
but when the end comes, I'm done if you slight me. I give a team my
all, but you slap me in the face and I can't forget it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we played them this year, I felt we were the better team
both times. I didn't see the team I should have seen (in New
England). They dismantled a team that went to the Super Bowl in two
years. I have a lot of friends there, but I (couldn't) care less
about their organization because of what they tried to do to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up here I'm happy. I'm happy to go to work and beat my body
down for these people because they had faith in me.''
</P>
<P>
   Not once, Gash insisted, did his faith in himself waver during
his season of trial. Not when he was battling back from his knee
injury or when his season started slowly. Not when it became clear
coach Pete Carroll had decided to play Keith Byars ahead of him and
not even at the end, when Gash insists Bobby Grier said he would
work things out with his agent at the same time Carroll was
courting Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never at that point,'' Gash said when asked if he ever
questioned his ability to come back from his knee problems. ``Not
with the staff they had. If I had talked to Coach Parcells and he
said `You just can't hit it anymore like you used to,' I might have
reevaluated things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the little whispers from their staff how I couldn't do
it in New England anymore, but I knew I could play somewhere in the
NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   All season his bosses knew he could play in Buffalo. Come Feb.
7, the whole football world is going to know he can play in the Pro
Bowl, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a great tribute to Sam,'' Parcells said when he learned
of Gash's selection this week. ``I love that kid. He's a special
guy. I think everybody in the league knows that now, what kind of
player and person he is.''
</P>
<P>
   A year too late, a few more people know it in New England.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Gash acknowledged he and his teammates had their doubts when
they first heard the Bills had signed  &UR; Doug Flutie &LR; . &UR;  &LR;  Then Flutie
came to camp and their doubts were relieved. ``When we saw how
strong his arm was and the decisions he made, we knew we were all
right,'' Gash said. ``You see the fire in him and you want to do
all you can for him. The decisions he'd make to bail us out when
we'd miss a block. Just in practice you could see he was a very
wise quarterback who made good decisions. I understand now why they
talked about him the way they did in Boston. He wins games. He'll
pass, he'll run, he'll go downfield and throw a block. He's a
complete quarterback. And he brings out the best in the people
around him. If you haven't played with him, you look at him and
just see his size, but if you play with him, you begin to see why
he's always won everywhere he's been.''... There are an assortment
of reasons why  &UR; Ty Law's  &LR; game has risen to Pro Bowl level, but one
that may go unnoticed is the power in his lower legs and the
quickness of his feet. ``Ty has phenomenal lower-body strength,''
secondary coach  &UR; Ron Lynn  &LR; said. ``He can get his body contorted in
some positions and he doesn't have to take a step or two to get his
balance back. He has real good total body strength and nice feet.
His body control is exceptional too. He's just a real good
athlete.'' ... Speaking of Law, he said that as happy as he was to
be selected to the Pro Bowl ``the most important thing is winning,
and the fact that we haven't takes a lot of the joy from this. All
it is is an individual accolade. I'd trade my Pro Bowl spot for a
trip back to the Super Bowl. There's nothing like playing in the
Super Bowl. When you retire no one's going to ask, `Did you play in
the Pro Bowl?' They're gonna ask, `Do you have a ring?''' ... 49ers
wide receiver  &UR; Jerry Rice  &LR; is on one of the worst four-game
stretches of his career. The 12-time Pro Bowl receiver has produced
fewer yards the last four games (114) than he had in their game
with the Falcons five weeks ago (169). But do not think Rice is
slipping. He leads the NFC with 73 catches and is fifth in
receiving yardage with 993 ... Denver quarterback  &UR; John Elway  &LR; said
this week winning the Super Bowl last season has taken far more of
a burden off his shoulders than he realized he was carrying. ``I
know  &UR; Dan  &LR; ( &UR; Marino &LR; , &UR;  &LR; whom he will oppose Monday night and who has
yet to win a Super Bowl) gets tired of answering those questions
and no matter what he does, that is going to be the thing that
everybody goes back to because that is what happened to me after we
lost the Super Bowl in '89,'' he said during a national conference
call. ``No matter what you do numbers-wise or anything else, it
still goes back as a quarterback to how many Super Bowls you've
won. By us winning last year, I no longer had to answer all those
questions. That's a big burden, and to remove that asterisk behind
my name was bigger than I would have thought. There was only one
win or loss that counted. That was winning the Super Bowl. That is
a great deal of pressure to get off your shoulders. So I have a
great deal of empathy for him with the career he's had and for what
he's done for the NFL. As unfair as it is, that's the way of
life.'' ... Amazing fact. In 16 NFL seasons, Elway and Marino have
faced each other only once ... Asked about the season in which
Marino threw 48 touchdown passes, Elway said simply, ``That second
year he had will go down in history as probably the greatest year a
quarterback has ever had. I think that '84 year is the most amazing
thing. Didn't he throw for 5,000 (yards)?'' As a matter of fact, he
did ... Speaking of Marino, he was asked at midweek if he had grown
frustrated at the restraints thrown on him and the passing game by
coach  &UR; Jimmy Johnson  &LR; the last two years. ``I was pretty lucky
early on because I had a great group of receivers and a coach that
was very willing to open things up, and it showed,'' Marino said.
``I think it really did. It showed. We're running an offense now
that we're trying to be a little bit more controlled because of
maybe the personnel that we have and wanting to run the ball more
and be more consistent running it. So things have changed some, but
to say it frustrates me, no. I'm the quarterback of this team. I'm
going to do whatever is asked to try and help this team win. Last
week, we threw 57 times. We haven't done that in a long time and we
lost. So, you look at it and say, `Maybe we need to run the ball
more.''' ... How do you figure the Pro Bowl voting? Baltimore is
5-9 and had five players voted onto the AFC team while Miami is 9-5
with the third-rated defense in the NFL, one that has allowed 40
points fewer than any other team (206), yet placed only defensive
lineman  &UR; Tim Bowens  &LR; on the team. How cornerbacks  &UR; Terrell Buckley
 &LR; (eight interceptions) and  &UR; Sam Madison  &LR; (seven) both missed is
difficult to fathom. Together they have more interceptions than any
starting cornerback tandem in the NFL. Two years ago, the Patriots
passed over Madison to select Chris Canty on the first round.

   Detroit Lions coach  &UR; Bobby Ross  &LR; lost it last week before his
team went out to play the 49ers on Monday night, telling them,
according to a source in the locker room, that he could no longer
motivate them. Ross claimed he knew he was a good coach and the
reason the Lions were losing was that they were not good players.
Several nights later, the same source said, Pro Bowl running back
 &UR; Barry Sanders  &LR; came out of the 49ers game because he said he had a
headache. ``Nobody else would have gotten away with that but
there's different rules for Barry,'' the source said. Something
tells me there's a headache waiting for Bobby Ross by the end of
this dismal season ... The Jets hold an option on quarterback
 &UR; Vinny Testaverde  &LR; for next season but are close to finalizing a
cap-friendly long-term deal that could take him through the end of
his career, at least as a starter ... Central Florida quarterback
 &UR; Dante Culpepper  &LR; has his eyes on the prize. Culpepper, who is the
second-rated quarterback in next year's draft, hired agent  &UR; Mason
Ashe  &LR; following a meeting with him on the day he was supposed to be
at a season-ending team meeting. Culpepper probably figured he'd
done all he could for Central Florida after throwing for 3,690
yards and 28 touchdowns in a 9-2 season ... The Broncos may have
had the most talked-about streak in the NFL broken last Sunday in
New York, but it's not the longest one. Vikings kicker  &UR; Gary
Anderson  &LR; needs two more successful field goals to break the NFL
record for most consecutive kicks in NFL history, a record held by
former Viking Fuad Reveiz (1994-95). The 39-year-old Anderson has
kicked 29 straight, dating back to the 15th game of last season.
He's 23 for 23 with another perfect 51 for 51 on extra points, and
has made 82 straight kicks of one type or the other dating back to
last season. No kicker has ever gone a full season without missing
a kick of any type (The Rams' Tony Zendejas missed one extra point
in 1991). While the Vikings need 62 more points to set an NFL
scoring record, Anderson is only 5 points shy of having outscored
the Philadelphia Eagles, who have racked up a dismal 125 points.
Fifteen more in their final three games and the Eagles will have
done the opposite of the Vikings, setting a rec-ord for lack of
productivity. The 1992 Seattle Seahawks hold the rec-ord for
offensive futility ... If Anderson breaks Reveiz's record, he'll
have one of the same guys to thank that Reveiz had.  &UR; Mike Morris
 &LR; has been the long snapper for both ... If the 6-8 New Orleans
Saints somehow make the playoffs, it will be because of their
defense, which has outscored the offense in three of the last five
games ... Indianapolis running back  &UR; Marshall Faulk  &LR; is trying to
join Roger Craig as the only back in history to rush for 1,000
yards and also have 1,000 receiving yards. Faulk is second in the
AFC to Davis with 1,228 yards rushing and is second in the AFC with
78 receptions for 862 yards. He needs 268 yards to break Sanders's
single-season total offense record of 2,358 ... Falcons team
physician  &UR; Charles Harrison  &LR; said he believes a new factor in heart
disease should be added after attending to Atlanta coach  &UR; Dan
Reeves &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who underwent quadruple bypass earlier this week. ``We
know the risk factors for heart disease,'' Harrison said.
``Cholesterol, diabetes, high blood pressure, family history, and
cigarette smoking. I'm going to add another one _ NFL coaching.''
Reeves is the third Falcons coach in two years to suffer a heart
attack.

CLINTON VOWS TO STAY IN OFFICE DESPITE IMPEACHMENT VOTE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton vowed Saturday to remain in
office ``until the last hour of the last day of my term,'' after
the House approved two articles of impeachment against him.
</P>
<P>
   Aides began work immediately to blunt Republican calls for his
resignation after he became the first president to be impeached by
the House in 130 years. They also turned their attention to the
Senate, where a trial likely will begin in January to decide
whether to remove Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the American people to know today that I am still
committed to working with people of good faith and good will of
both parties to do what's best for our country, to bring our nation
together, to lift our people up, to move us all forward together,''
Clinton said, flanked by scores of congressional Democrats on the
White House lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I've tried to do for six years. It's what I intend
to do for two more until the last hour of the last day of my
term,'' he declared. With first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton at his
side, he thanked the Democrats and the few Republicans who opposed
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   A CNN/Time Magazine poll found 48 percent of those polled
favored no trial but a censure of Clinton; 31 percent favored no
trial but Clinton's resignation and 16 percent favored a Senate
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could take cold comfort in the fact that President
Andrew Johnson was impeached by his political opponents in 1868
only to be acquitted in the Senate by one vote. Johnson completed
his term.
</P>
<P>
   The House, divided mostly along party lines, voted two articles
of impeachment against Clinton, accusing him of perjury and
obstruction of justice for lying about and trying to cover up his
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Two other
articles of impeachment failed.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the final House vote, two buses left the Capitol
building for a short drive down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White
House where more than 70 Democrats met with the president, the
first lady and Vice President Al Gore in the White House residence.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said Clinton
began the meeting with an apology to the members.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said at the top of the meeting how saddened this has made
him and how sorry he is that we all had to go through this. He has
apologized to us in a very sincere way on a number of occasions,
but today was as somber and as genuine and as meaningful as
anything that we have heard,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Democrats told him ``in clear terms that he cannot and
he must not resign. And I heard him very clearly say that he will
not resign.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chet Edwards, a Waco Democrat and one of several Texans who
joined Democrats on the South Lawn, said, ``The president is not
going to resign period. End of discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him to resign would be a slap in the face of 47 million
Americans and to let a partisan impeachment process force the
resignation of a duly elected president would set a terrible
precedent for the future and make impeachment an annual event,''
Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   It would take 67 votes in the 100-member Senate to remove
Clinton from office, a margin that would appear unlikely because
there are 45 Democrats. But White House officials intend to take
nothing for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Lewis, Clinton's communications chief, said the White House,
through a series of conference calls and talking points, had sent
information to Clinton's supporters across the nation outlining how
they can become active in the president's defense.
</P>
<P>
   The message: the House vote was a partisan act by a lame-duck
Congress, and now the Senate should find a bipartisan solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our folks are now so energized,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Another White House aide said, ``The mood is pretty sober but
there's also a sense of relief that this is moving out of the House
and into the Senate where hopefully there will be less rancor and
less partisanship and a little more fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats braced for an expected rash of calls for Clinton's
resignation, especially after the stunning announcement by House
Speaker-designate Bob Livingston, R-La., that he would resign his
seat within six months following his disclosure of extramarital
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In a dramatic statement on the House floor, Livingston called
for Clinton's resignation, generating catcalls from Democrats, but
then hushed the House by saying he intended to take his own advice.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton issued a statement asking Livingston
to reconsider his resignation and deploring the situation that
brought it about.
</P>
<P>
   Later on the South Lawn, Clinton bemoaned the atmosphere in the
nation's capital, suggesting that to most Americans it must look as
though Washington was coming apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must stop the politics of personal destruction,'' Clinton
said. ``We must get rid of the poisonous venom of excessive
partisanship, obsessive animosity and uncontrolled anger. That is
not what America deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time the House took its first vote, Clinton was in the
Oval Office with Tony Campolo, an evangelical minister from
Philadelphia who has emerged as a spiritual adviser to the
president. Campolo later told CNN the two were praying.
</P>
<P>
   There is no television in the Oval Office. Chief of Staff John
Podesta and Senior Adviser Doug Sosnik interrupted Clinton's
meeting with Campolo to tell him the House had approved the first
article of impeachment. Clinton and his aides walked to the
adjacent study where they watched the vote on the other three
articles.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Ricchetti, a deputy chief of staff, also came to the
study, telling the president that Republican leaders had been
lobbying members to vote in favor of the first and third articles,
both of which passed.

CHAMPIONING CAUSE: WHIPPLE'S TEAM BEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. _ The University of Massachusetts has the
best football team in the country. That is not my opinion. It was
not determined by a writers' poll, a computer's whims or a
corporate sponsor's desire for a lovely matchup in the Insight.com
Bowl, Hotmail Bowl or AOL Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   There was a legitimate championship game played at Finley
Stadium Saturday and the Minutemen won it. It was not the Tostitos
Fiesta Bowl, which is supposed to be the Bowl Championship Series
title game for Division 1-A teams. Please. Show me any championship
game that is not played on the field and I'll show you a rotisserie
league showdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Minutemen didn't have to deal with that. They turned into
Southern tourists the past few weeks, making two trips to Louisiana
and one here. They were the 11th seed out of 16 teams in the
Division 1-AA playoffs, came to a city that is only a few miles
north of the Georgia line, and scored 55 points on a previously
undefeated team from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said it was a neutral-site field,'' UMass linebacker
Khari Samuel said. ``We knew that it wasn't. Their fans had
something like 13,000 tickets and we had less than a thousand. But
that's OK. I like that. I wouldn't have liked it if this game had
been played in New England because I think it would have made us
think we had an advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   All I can say is that I hope you found time to watch this team
during the season. I hope UMass athletic director Bob Marcum has
the state's checkbook open so he can retain Mark Whipple as head
coach. I hope the NCAA can see the beauty of having a true title
game for all levels of football. And, please, I hope you do not
think I am gloating when I say this: I cannot believe I was paid to
watch this game.
</P>
<P>
   The rule is that you are not supposed to cheer in pressboxes. It
is unprofessional. Everyone was reminded of that before UMass and
Georgia Southern produced their 55-43 gem. I wish I could have seen
the people who made that announcement. I wish I could have seen if
they were cheering. If they weren't? Well, I'm convinced that they
are other-worldly extras from ``Star Trek'' or Area 51 experiments
who left Roswell, N.M., to see how crazy earthlings play football.
But I could not see them because I was fixed on this game. You know
how you are afraid to get up from a basketball game because you
think you might miss something? This game was like that.
</P>
<P>
   UMass scored on its first possession, had 21 points in the first
quarter, and 38 points by halftime. They opened the game with an
outrageous five-receiver set, a formation they appropriately call,
``Chattanooga.'' They faked a fourth-down punt and ran for a first
down, tried a fullback option, and threatened to drop an onside
kick when they were up by 17 points. They did that all in one half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told someone earlier in the week that it definitely was not
going to be a 10-9 game,'' Whipple said. The coach went on to say
that he thought ``45 (points) would be enough to get it done.'' He
did not smile when he said that. Think about it: It's one thing to
say that your team needs 45 points to win. It's quite another to
have confidence that your team has the ability to score 45.
</P>
<P>
   That's only one reason why Marcum should be a little nervous
this morning. Whipple took a team that was 2-9 last season and
turned it into the best group in the country. In only one year. He
tinkered with his quarterback, got a 100-meter champion from
Florida, and added a few other players, but he basically took the
core from a last-place team and produced 12 wins. Big-time programs
pay attention to stories like that. Don't be surprised in a couple
weeks when Whipple's name pops up as someone's coaching candidate
for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Minutemen, though, can think about that later. Saturday,
they were out to prove their worth to a region. Everywhere you
looked downtown you saw Georgia Southern fans. They screamed out
school chants and songs 90 minutes before the game. One fan paraded
outside the stadium with a sign that read, ``If I went to UMass,
I'd kill myself.'' Once the game started, the Minutemen weren't
getting much respect from the Southern players.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were saying, `We ain't gonna let no Yankees come down
here and beat us,''' Samuel recalled. ``I just said, `I'm going to
keep my mouth shut and play the game.' I didn't want to be jumping
around or anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing the players didn't jump around because they
would have been too tired to do anything on the field. This was a
game that required stamina. Once the Eagles made it a 38-33 game,
it was obvious that Whipple's team would need that 45 and even
more.
</P>
<P>
   It was a great game to watch. It made you wonder if the players
enjoyed it, even if they were on the losing side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, 55 is more than 43,'' Georgia Southern coach Paul
Johnson said. ``It could have been 6-3. It doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The final score was not 6-3. It was 55-43. UMass had the most
points. The Minutemen are the best team in the country. It's not an
opinion. If you don't believe me, you can go to Amherst. The
players have game mementos _ including a trophy _ to prove it.

NEW YORK CAPTURES AFC EAST 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BUFFALO _ The game ball delivered is certain to find a special
spot in Leon Hess's home.
</P>
<P>
   Hess, 84 years old and not in the best of health, was not here
yesterday to see his New York Jets give him something he has never
had as the primary owner of the team _ a divisional title.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets accomplished that by beating a stubborn Buffalo team,
17-10, in a windy Ralph Wilson Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   With either a victory over the Patriots in their regular-season
finale in Giants Stadium next week or a Jacksonville loss in either
of their final two games, the Jets (11-4) will end up with the
second-best record in the AFC and a bye in the first round of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deserve this,'' said Jets coach Bill Parcells. ``To beat
Seattle in a tough game, and then beat Miami and these guys back to
back on the road, to me that means we earned this the hard way.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning the division championship is a major achievement for the
Jets, who had not won one since they were members of the AFL in
1969, the year they also won the Super Bowl. In almost every
preseason poll, the Jets were picked to finish third in the
division behind New England and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, it was Vinny Testaverde, who should be the comeback
player of the year, winning it for the Jets with a quick-strike
71-yard touchdown pass to Dedric Ward in the third quarter to break
a 10-10 tie and produce the final margin.
</P>
<P>
   The game was hampered by high, gusty winds of 30 miles per hour
that affected both the passing and kicking games.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets came into the game assured of a playoff berth. The
Bills (9-6) were a game behind and needed a win to help their
playoff chances. They still could gain a wild-card berth.
</P>
<P>
   The game featured a wonderful story line with Doug Flutie and
Testaverde, both benchwarmers when the season started, going head
to head.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde struck first when he threw a 7-yard touchdown pass to
Wayne Chrebet on a crossing pattern to give his team a 7-0 lead. A
25-yard Testaverde-to-Keyshawn Johnson connection set up the score.
The Jets had the wind in this drive.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo got the wind in the second quarter and used it to drive
79 yards in 11 plays. The Bills scored on a 25-yard screen pass
from Flutie to Thurman Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The play call was perfect, with the Jets getting caught in a
blitz. The rush was on Flutie so fast, he virtually flipped the
ball over his shoulder. But the ball landed right in the arms of
Thomas, who picked up two key blocks and cut back behind the last
defender for the touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo missed a great chance to take control of the game at the
end of the first half. The Bills marched from their own 1-yard line
to the Jets 5 with five seconds left in the half. But they were
penalized back to the 10 for delay of game, missed a pass, and then
an easy 28-yard field goal. Instead of leading, the Bills went into
halftime with the game tied at 7.
</P>
<P>
   The teams swapped field goals early in the third quarter, tying
the score at 10 and setting up the critical play of the game.
</P>
<P>
   With second and 1 at their own 2l, the Jets sent Testaverde back
to pass. Ward and defensive back Donovan Greer were man to man
along the left sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guy (Greer) thought he was going to run a quick sideline
(route) and cut in front of him trying to look for the
interception,'' said Bills coach Wade Phillips. ``He almost had one
earlier on a quick out.''
</P>
<P>
   The mistake was critical. Ward was up the field and Greer
couldn't recover. Ward caught the ball on the Bills 38, shook
Greer, and ran alone down the sideline for the Jets' biggest score
in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind was an important factor,'' said Phillips. ``It was
hard for both quarterbacks to throw the ball. Doug had trouble, and
Vinny had trouble. We held them to something like 250 yards of
offense (actually 269), and we still couldn't win. They made the
big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde finished 14 for 23 for 184 yards. Flutie was 14 for
38 for 220 yards with one interception.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   David Meggett, who didn't join the team until last Tuesday, was
all over the field. On his first carry of the day, on third down,
he ran 17 yards up the middle. He also returned kicks and played in
the Jets' third--and-long situations ... It was Flutie's first home
regular-season loss in his NFL career ... According to Phillips,
``The Jets played us the same way they did before (when they beat
the Bills in New York in midseason). They didn't do anything
different.'' The Jets' game plan was the same on defense. They
tried to rush five men most of the time, keeping them in their rush
lanes, forcing Flutie to throw.

PAYING HUGE PRICE, GORDON SELLS HIS SOUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes a man can want something just a little too much.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a man can love his sport just a little too much.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a man can crave a return to the big-time just a little
too much.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Gordon has become such a man.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is a former head of the New York State Athletic
Commission, a former television boxing analyst, a former editor of
Ring magazine, a former director of boxing at Foxwoods Casino, a
former lot of things in boxing. The problem is not his past. The
problem is his present.
</P>
<P>
   On June 16, 1983, a fighter named Billy Collins came to Madison
Square Garden as a promising junior middleweight with an undefeated
rec-ord. He left a broken man, half blind from being hit in the
face by the loaded gloves of a kid named Luis Resto, who always
claimed he didn't know a thing about it.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, did Resto's chief second, well-known trainer Panama
Lewis. In the end, Resto and Lewis did jail time after being
convicted of tampering with those gloves, gloves that not only beat
Collins out of boxing but beat the life out of him, too.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months after that fight a drunken Collins, no longer able
to fight or work because of those eyes, drove his 1972 Oldsmobile
into a hackberry tree at 68 miles per hour on a road where he used
to run every day and died. His parents believe he aimed at that
tree.
</P>
<P>
   Resto and Lewis have denied for 15 years any involvement in the
removal of half the horsehair padding from inside those killer
gloves that night. Just happened, they say. Somebody else cut the
quarter-size hole in the palm and emptied them, they say. Maybe
cornermen Artie Curry, who's dead now and can't speak for himself,
they say, or Pedro Alvarado, who along with Lewis and Resto was
banned from boxing for his involvement in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but Lewis was always considered a shadowy figure in
boxing, a guy who would do all he could to give his man an edge.
That night, Resto had a big edge on a kid from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   When Collins died, Ring magazine wrote an editorial headlined
``Murder, Plain and Simple.'' That editorial was written by Randy
Gordon and it led to a 15-year feud with Lewis, one that only
heated further after Gordon became director of the New York
commission and made clear there would be no reinstatement of Panama
Lewis's license to train boxers.
</P>
<P>
   Since then things have changed. Gordon fell into and out of
boxing after leaving the commission in 1995, presently working in
real estate and teaching boxing to guys in suits who wear rep ties
for a living. Lewis, meanwhile, served 2 1/2 years in jail as a
result of the Collins incident and since has trained fighters in
gyms that still allow him to work, but he has not entered a ring in
15 years because no state has agreed to re-license him.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Lewis is training Frans Botha, who will challenge
Mike Tyson Jan. 16 on a show that will be watched by millions.
Botha's manager, Sterling MacPherson, is a friend of Gordon's and
solicited his help in preparing Botha, but to do it Gordon had to
agree to work with Lewis. After much soul-searching, he did and is
presently in Las Vegas with all of them. He says he has shed many
tears over this decision, one that came after long talks with his
family, his rabbi, and a priest of his acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   He says he went back years after the incident and read the trial
transcript and talked with as many of the people involved as he
could and slowly came to the conclusion that although Lewis was
convicted and sent to jail, the evidence proved nothing but that
someone loaded the gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon says he is no longer sure it was Lewis, although he
admits he doesn't know that it wasn't and concedes something
happened in that locker room that night, and Lewis knows what it
was.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon says he told Lewis during a tear-stained meeting between
the two longtime enemies that he needed to know if he had done it
or not. Lewis, Gordon claims, showed deep remorse for what had
happened to Collins but said over and over, ``What does it matter?
He's gone and he shouldn't be gone.'' In other words, he told
Gordon nothing but what he knew Gordon wanted to hear ... which was
just enough sobbing to convince him it was all right to accept the
job and turn his back on his principles.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon says Lewis told him he was just in the wrong place at the
wrong time, adding, ``I'm not a monster.'' Well, it seems to me the
only person in the wrong place at the wrong time is dead now. His
name is not Panama Lewis. It's Billy Collins, and Gordon knows it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he's sorry,'' Gordon said Friday night from his
hotel room in Las Vegas when asked to explain how on earth he could
have agreed to work with a man he once called party to a murder.
``I don't know if he did it or not, but I believe he's sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Gordon really does believe that, but it's more likely
he's doing what people do when they love too strong or want
something too badly. He's blinding himself to the facts, and the
facts are that Panama Lewis was in charge of those gloves that
night. He was responsible for what happened to them and what
happened was that half the padding was removed and a boy was, for
all intents and purposes, beaten to death.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I have spent time in the house of Billy Collins's
broken family. I have been to the spot where he died and to the
graveyard where he is buried. I have stood in a New York gym with
Resto and Lewis and asked them both what happened and listened to
their denials and got answers that didn't fit the questions being
asked.
</P>
<P>
   I have come to believe in my heart that Panama Lewis is
responsible for what happened to Billy Collins and more than likely
is the one who did the deed, although that is difficult to prove
beyond a shadow of a doubt because too many people who were there
that night are dead or too old to remember or not inclinded to
reveal what they know.
</P>
<P>
   What we do know is that Lewis was the one who refused to glove
up Resto when a commission inspector ordered him to. When he
didn't, the inspector left to get his superior. He was gone for 15
minutes. When he got back, Resto was gloved up and no one could
tell the gloves had been altered.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon knows inspectors came back later and found horsehair
traces on the floor of a bathroom stall in Resto's locker room.
</P>
<P>
   He knows Lewis has said time and again how he learned the little
things about getting an edge from the great trainer Ray Arcel and
that sometimes you just think you're being smart when maybe you're
being something else.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon knows these things, yet he is in Las Vegas with Botha and
his head trainer because it's a big fight and he wants to be part
of it.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, I believe what changed his mind was not new evidence. It
was that he had been out of boxing's mainstream too long and sold
himself out to get back in.
</P>
<P>
   That is a sad thing to say because I have known Gordon a long
time and know how much he loves the sport. It is why I spoke with
him at great length about his decision. I heard him cry trying to
explain it. I heard him talk of Lewis's remorse and the doubt
created by the trial transcript and his belief now that he is not
sure what Lewis did or what he knew at the time.
</P>
<P>
   I also heard him say: ``I love the sport and I want to be part
of it. When all is said and done, if you believe he's sorry,
there's no correcting it, so I decided to do this. I knew I'd be
called the biggest hypocrite who ever lived. I'll live with it. My
personal battle over this is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than 10 minutes later, he was in tears on the telephone
trying to justify it. If he's honest with himself, he knows why the
tears came.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said he is not willing to be part of the effort to get
Lewis his license back in New York, a move that if granted would
also allow him to work in other states where he is presently banned
because of a reciprocal agreement to honor suspensions by all state
commissions. Somehow he has convinced himself this washes his hands
of a dirty saga. It does not.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow he has convinced himself that blind love for a sport or
a blind desire to get back into a big fight's intoxicating action
can justify what his tears on Friday night made clear to me he
knows is wrong. It cannot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very strange situation,'' Gordon acknowledged.
``Nobody knows the torment I'm going through. Do I have to turn a
gig down in the sport I love because I'm with a guy two hours a day
who may or may not have emptied those gloves?''
</P>
<P>
   To that I say, yes, you do. Remorse and repentance are wonderful
things. So are second chances. We all need them. But that won't
bring Billy Collins back to his family and it shouldn't bring
Panama Lewis back his license to work in a boxing ring. It should
not have brought Randy Gordon back to Lewis's side either, no
matter how big the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said he has little to do with Lewis outside preparing
Botha. He said they break no bread together. He said he asks him
almost daily if he did what he was convicted of and insists he will
know before fight night.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when I asked what he will do if Lewis says yes, he did load
the gloves of Luis Resto, Gordon says he's not sure. Sadly, I am.
</P>
<P>
   He will go to the arena and do his job with Botha and act as if
he hadn't heard what he'd heard. He'll do it because he loves his
sport too much and craves the action too much.

NINERS QB PLAYING BETTER THAN EVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SAN FRANCISCO _ If the Patriots still had any starting players
left, the news that Antonio Langham just might be back in the
49ers' defensive backfield Sunday would have been cause for New
Englanders kicking their heels in glee. Langham has been lit up
more this season than any switchboard in any Congressional office
the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, even if all the Patriots were healthy and Drew Bledsoe
could have sent Terry Glenn time and again deep downfield to torch
Langham, New England still would have a difficult game against the
49ers. That's because San Francisco has one player _ no, not Jerry
Rice _ who is well-nigh indispensable, if not unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Young, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want the ball in my hands that much,'' Young said of
his outgaining Detroit's Barry Sanders by more than a 2-to-1 margin
last Monday. ``I'd rather put it in someone else's hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Truly, though, any time the ball is in Young's hands, only good
seems to happen to the 49ers' offense. It has been that way for
years and years, but now Young is 37, and, if anything, he seems
better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as good as we can be right now,'' said Young of that
rarity in San Francisco, an offense that is a threat both on the
ground and in the air. ``But we've got to be able to do it week in
and week out.''
</P>
<P>
   Young still delivers those so-familiar slant passes of San
Francisco's West Coast offense as well as ever, always seeming to
find Jerry Rice or J.J. Stokes or Terrell Owens. But what is more
fascinating is that Young seems more mobile than ever, and running
better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in the prime of his career,'' said 49ers coach Steve
Mariucci, ``and he's enjoying having some weapons around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Young has rushed for 437 yards this season, the second-highest
total in his career. The quarterback still has a chance to top his
all-time mark on the ground, 537 yards in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The intrigue of all this is that all know what Young will do _
particularly on a key down _ and that is to tuck the ball under his
arm if he's under pressure, sidestep one or two of those lumbering
offensive linemen, raise the ball over his head as if he's to pass
when a linebacker confronts him near the line of scrimmage and then
scamper 10 or 15 or 20 yards downfield before he hook-slides to a
stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's playing very smart football,'' said Mariucci.
``He's making good decisions on passing downs and running when he
should.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Lions, there was a classic Young play when San
Francisco had a third down at the Detroit 9-yard line. The
quarterback dropped back to pass, was flushed over toward the
sideline, and suddenly reversed direction. He raised the ball over
his head when a Detroit linebacker approached near the line of
scrimmage and then easily scampered into a corner of the end zone _
the corner of the end zone at the opposite sideline along which he
was first trapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every possession is so important,'' said Young, explaining his
philosophy of quarterbacking. ``You never want to waste a
possession.''
</P>
<P>
   Young explained why those third-and-9s that he seems to convert
so effortlessly, either with a pass to Rice or a scramble from the
pocket, are so important. ``Our theory is to be aggressive, to do
something every possession we have,'' he said. ``You have to take
advantage of every chance you have.''
</P>
<P>
   The Niners now have Garrison Hearst to gouge out huge chunks on
the ground and, as Young put it, ``every time I turn around and
hand off the ball, I look around and Garrison Hearst is 8 or 10 or
12 or 30 or 40 yards downfield.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 49ers also have three receivers with large egos and
Young acknowledged, candidly, ``the wide receivers will be chomping
at the bit (against the Patriots) to have more balls thrown to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, with Hearst running the way he is running, with the
49ers offensive line blocking the way it has been blocking, and
with Young still so deft in finding his receivers, opposing
defenses have a true dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions chose to double-team Rice often and ``if opposing
defenses continue to play coverage on our receivers like that,
we've got to be able to run the football,'' said Mariucci. And now
it seems to be almost a matter of choice for the 49ers: Throw the
ball for 300 yards? Or run the ball for 200 yards?
</P>
<P>
   And the man making the choices, the quarterback deciding what to
do, is a man truly in his prime _ Steve Young.

CUP LOSS UPSETTING, BUT NOT AN UPSET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ease with which the International Team defeated the United
States at last week's Presidents Cup was, indeed, a surprise. But
don't call it an upset because the only stunner is this: People
still can't believe the US should lose one of these team events.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that the International Team's top five players (Nick
Price, Greg Norman, Ernie Els, Vijay Singh, and Steve Elkington)
had won nine majors among them. No matter that Frank Nobilo, Stuart
Appleby, and Craig Parry had justly earned world-class status with
outstanding play on the American PGA Tour. Or that Royal Melbourne
was a hard, fast golf course, the type of which the Americans
rarely play. No matter that in the 1996 Presidents Cup, the US
barely won on its home soil, 16 1/2-15 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   What seemed to be the only factor mentioned was the presence of
Tiger Woods, David Duval, Mark O'Meara, and Davis Love _ ranked
1-2-3-4 in the world _ in the US lineup. Conveniently overlooked
was that Woods, O'Meara, and Love were also in Spain a year ago
when the US lost to Europe in the Ryder Cup. That was a loss
chalked up to the quirkiness of a Valderrama layout and the magical
touch of coach Seve Balle-steros. The loss Down Under? Many pointed
to incredible good fortune (Nobilo's 40-foot birdie putt on the
18th hole of the opening match) and plain old luck (Parry's chip
shot at the same hole the next day). Again, conveniently overlooked
was the fact that Woods, Duval, O'Meara, and Love _ as well as Fred
Couples, Jim Furyk, and Justin Leonard _ all missed short putts
that could have turned around their matches in the early going when
the International Team was building momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago Bobby Jones explained that there was golf and then
there was tournament golf. Anyone who has tried to take his or her
game into competition knows exactly why Jones was saying the two
have nothing in common. Going a step further, there is tournament
golf and then there is team competition and for reasons hard to
explain, great players don't always make for a great team. That, of
course, won't stop people from making a US team led by Woods,
Duval, O'Meara, and Love the big favorite in next September's Ryder
Cup matches at The Country Club. By then, memories of Melbourne and
Valderrama will have faded, but not this reality: The ``underdog''
Europeans are 4-2-1 in the last seven Ryder Cups.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ben Crenshaw  &LR; could not have been too happy with the way his
American colleagues played in Melbourne, but if there is a bright
side to the 20 1/2-11 1/2 defeat, it could be a more determined
effort in the Ryder Cup. Which is something Crenshaw, the US
captain, would welcome. He hopes US players who figure to be on the
team would take advantage of opportunities to play The Country Club
and get familiar with the course, something they did not do at
Valderrama or Oak Hill in Rochester, N.Y., in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw figures to have a busy 1999, but has already agreed to
take part in the 50th anniversary of the Francis Ouimet Scholarship
Fund. He will be the guest speaker and honoree March 11 as the
distinguished organization puts on a gala event at the Westin
Copley Plaza. It is a nice coup for the folks at the Ouimet and a
perfect match, too. No one in golf embraces the sport's history
quite like Crenshaw, and the Ouimet Scholarship Fund keeps alive
the memory of arguably the most important person in the history of
American golf.

   After weeks of campus visits and serious thought,  &UR; Brent Wanner
 &LR; has committed to Wake Forest. ``It's strange,'' said Wanner, a
senior at Nauset Regional on Cape Cod, ``to know I'm going there
already when there's still a lot of (high) school left.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Wanner, one of the bright young golf talents in
the country, said he was relieved to have the process behind him as
he opted for  &UR; Arnold Palmer's  &LR; alma mater over Georgia Tech,
Vanderbilt, and Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Wanner's busy summer included impressive performances in the US
Junior Amateur and the Ouimet Memorial, which he led through 36
holes before being overtaken by  &UR; Frank Vana Jr. &LR;  in the final round
at Woodland Golf Club. At the recent Polo Junior Classic at Disney
World, Wanner opened with a 67 and easily marched into match play,

Pines/Highlands _  &UR; Kenny Lewis  &LR; and  &UR; Michael Carbone  &LR; _ did
slightly better in that prestigious American Junior Golf
Association event, both of them making it to the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Carbone will be playing his college golf at the University of
Rhode Island, while Lewis is only a junior at Dennis-Yarmouth, so
the collegiate recruiters will have to put their chase on hold.

   As he fights to regain world-class status,  &UR; Nick Faldo  &LR; has
entered the upcoming South African Open. A stated goal of Faldo's
is to earn his way on to the Ryder Cup team, and playing in South
Africa (a European Tour stop) is part of his strategy. No doubt he
is ready to tee it up, having played well in the recent Australian
Open. After an opening 77 Down Under, Faldo brushed past reporters
and marched to the range, though he did take a break from his
practice to talk with  &UR; Norman Von Nida &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a legend in Australian
golf. At 87, Von Nida is legally blind, but his feel for the game
is not lost; he talked putting with Faldo, who apparently
benefited, for he came back with a 69 and was in the hunt before
losing out to  &UR; Greg Chalmers  &LR; ... Great story out of South Africa
where a former gas station attendant,  &UR; Solly Sepeng &LR; , &UR;  &LR; 58, won a
senior event for the biggest paycheck of his 26-year professional
career. For years, apartheid laws prevented Sepeng from playing at
various clubs in his nation. His two-shot win over  &UR; Simon Hobday
 &LR; was his first in a PGA-sanctioned tour and earned him a free plane
ticket to take part in either a European or American senior event
in 1999.  &UR; Gary Player &LR; , &UR; Lee Trevino &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; John Jacobs  &LR; were among
those in the field ... If you had any lingering doubt that golf is
truly a world sport, consider that the top four finishers in the
girls' division at the AJGA Polo Junior Classic were from Germany,
Spain, California, and Paraguay ... The pressures of tour
qualifying have been well documented, but for one European pro,
just getting there proved a hardship.  &UR; Darren Parker &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a
30-year-old Englishman, was a passenger in a car driven by fellow
player  &UR; Robert Coles &LR;  that crashed on the way to the course in
Sotogrande, Spain. Parker came away with a broken arm, 42 stitches
in his head, and no hopes for a 1999 European Tour card. Coles was
uninjured.

SOX SIGN RELIEVER GUTHRIE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Every now and then the Red Sox get lucky. Since the offseason
began, they have been looking for quality pitching. And free agent
lefthander Mark Guthrie was out there all along, eager to return to
his baseball roots.
</P>
<P>
   So you can understand why the parties came together with the
signing of a two-year, $3.2 million contract Saturday. Guthrie, 33,
has been a reliever for most of his major league career, which
began in 1989. He was born in Buffalo, but grew up in Scituate,
where his family still resides.
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie has been with the Minnesota Twins and Los Angeles
Dodgers. He spent his first 6 1/2 big league seasons with the Twins
and was a member of Minnesota's 1991 World Series championship
team. His last 3 1/2 seasons have been spent in Los Angeles, mainly
in a middle relief/setup role. Last season, Guthrie appeared in 53
games, third most on the Dodgers staff, with a 2-1 record and 3.50
ERA in 54 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been talking for a long time,'' said Guthrie. ``I knew I
wasn't going back to the Dodgers. I wanted to go back to the East
Coast, where I'd lived until I was in the sixth grade. The East
Coast is more dynamic and there is more happening there. When I was
in the American League I always enjoyed pitching at Fenway Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie will give the Red Sox bullpen depth and experience in
the wake of Dennis Eckersley's retirement. Guthrie becomes the 20th
pitcher on the team's 40-man roster but only the fifth lefthander.
The others are are Joel Adamson, Brian Barkley, Ron Mahay, and
Robert Ramsay.
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie will take outfielder Darren Bragg's place on the roster.
The team decided Friday night not to tender Bragg a contract for
next season. Guthrie becomes the third free agent signed by Boston,
joining infielder Jose Offerman (from Kansas City) and righthander
Mark Portugal (from Philadelphia).
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five seasons, Guthrie has a 14-14 record with a
3.90 ERA and 247 strikeouts in 304 2/3 innings. On natural grass,
Guthrie has been even better, with a 2.86 ERA and 176 strikeouts in
224 innings over the last five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie is sure to be a favorite of Red Sox pitching coach Joe
Kerrigan. Last year, Guthrie prevented nearly 77 percent of
inherited runners (23 of 30) from scoring and retired the first
batter he faced in 36 of 53 outings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get much publicity in this role,'' said Guthrie,
``but I enjoy it. In the American League you pitch more and that's
what I'd like to do. You get a lot of responsibility.''

 &HT;    NEITHER BOMBS NOR SANCTIONS DETER IRAQIS FROM STAYING IN THEIR
COUNTRY
 &HT;    With US-IRAQ-1220.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD _ When the bombing started, Hilmi Al-Jarrah took just a
small bag and his family dog, Rocky, and hit the road. But they did
not flee, they headed straight to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Jarrah, an Iraqi, lives in Amman, Jordan, but his wife and
four children were in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted to stay there because they love their country. They
sent for their father and their shaggy miniature sheep dog.
</P>
<P>
   By the time U.S. officials called off the air strikes after four
days, it was already early Sunday morning in Iraq. But to Iraqis
like this family, the sleepless nights of bombing were another in
along line of traumas for them and their country.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, the Al-Jarrahs sat in their large home looking
like any upper-middle class family in the United States. Alhamzed,
12, passes the time with computer games. Nadine, 19, reads Gabriel
Garcia-Marques' ``Love in the time of Cholera,'' and keeps a diary
thinking she might not make it through the week.
</P>
<P>
   They talked about the stress of living under airstrikes and the
demoralizing state of their country, nostalgic for the good
schools, medical centers and oil-boom economy of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, their days have been idle. Bombings have closed the
schools. They government's television transmitters have been badly
damaged, leaving just one channel limping along for entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, tension seemed to be increasing on Iraqi streets. Major
downtown landmarks, such as the headquarters for President Saddam
Hussein's Baath Party and the offices of the government's military
industries, have been gutted by missiles.
</P>
<P>
   There were slightly more soldiers patrolling Baghdad's streets
and the start of the holy month of Ramadan, with its daily ritual
of fasting, made observers irritable as it does in even the best of
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Iraqi leaders sounded the predictably defiant chords,
urging their people to resist American aggression and fight to the
last man.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Al-Jarrahs and other families, the battle is trying
to cope with the munitions that fell practically unseen from the
skies. They sidestep questions about politics, but illustrate just
how sad it can be when people are caught in the middle of a violent
political battle that makes a country with a grand past bleak.
</P>
<P>
   Rocky, a cream-colored shaggy thing about a foot high, sat up
and gave some yappy barks at the bombs that fell Saturday evening.
The Al-Jarrahs live near the Iraqi Ministry of Defense, a likely
target in the assault.
</P>
<P>
   At times, they have slept with relatives in a nearby house or in
the same room to support each other when the attacks create flashes
across the sky and rattle the windows.
</P>
<P>
   Their lives are measured between the ``first war, second war or
third war,'' -- meaning the war against Iran in the 1980s, the Gulf
War in 1991 and now this.
</P>
<P>
   Hilmi Al-Jarrah, 49, used to be a commercial airline pilot until
the United Nations-imposed ``no-fly zone'' in southern Iraq shut
down Iraqi Airways in 1990. Then, he tried to open an import
business, but economic sanctions sank that venture.
</P>
<P>
   Now he deals in real estate in Jordan. The family lived there
for several years and could have stayed, but they came back. Nadine
studies architecture and says her college is excellent. She likes
the warm Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents love the secular openness of Iraq, compared to other
neighboring countries. It does not matter here that Hilmi is a
Sunni Muslim, and his wife a Shiite, or that they have many
Christian friends, or that they usually keep a Christmas tree. They
say this is where they belong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be far away from our country when our country
is at war,'' Hilmi Al-Jarrah said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he talked about how hard things are now after the eight
years of economic sanctions Iraq has faced since invading Kuwait in
1990. They cannot travel anywhere without making the 11-hour drive
to Amman. Farouz Al-Jarrah is a dentist, but she has stopped
practicing because there is little dental medicine.
</P>
<P>
   They know a college professor struggling to get by on his
$12-per-month salary. And they do not barbecue anymore because some
neighbors cannot afford meat. Even before this recent bombing,
their electricity shut off for four hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   They take solace in being together, and check on relatives when
there are no airstrikes. They play with Rocky. And, they hope for a
future that is more like Iraq's good old days. It's what keep them
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not all of their life,'' Hilmi Al-Jarrah said,
gesturing toward his children. ``It might be all of my life, but I
have to worry about their futures. They have to return Baghdad to
the way it was.''

HOOPLA MISSING WITH BC, HOLY CROSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not as if there weren't tempting options. It was, after
all, the last shopping Saturday before Christmas, and television
offered the University of Massachusetts winning a Division 1-AA
national championship, Jets-Bills, and the first presidential
impeachment vote in 130 years.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps that's why only 2,811 quiet souls (a papered house,
at that) turned out for Boston College's 61-45 victory over Holy
Cross at Conte Forum Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   You know it's a tough draw when WEEI's Ted Sarandis stands beind
the press table _ a maitre d' with a microphone _ shaking hands and
telling patrons, ``Thanks for coming. Did you get enough to eat?''
</P>
<P>
   Boston College is out of session for the holidays. Students had
to evacuate by 5 p.m. Friday. This meant that an already-shrinking
fan base was reduced to player relatives, some Mass. Pikers from
Worcester, and a few folks who remember when any BC-HC game
mattered.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when Boston College and Holy Cross grads held
seats of power in the Greater Boston community, and Eagle-Crusader
games were a source of considerable fun and occasional wagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to today's game I gave a 20-minute talk to our players
about what this game is,'' said Holy Cross coach Bill Raynor, a
Boston native. ``They started playing this game in 1906. It's been
a tremendous, spirited rivalry with some great players. And I
remember being here in 1990 when Holy Cross last won this game and
that was something special. Now even though we're in different
leagues and the level of basketball is different, there is interest
still felt by former players and fans.''
</P>
<P>
   There are still BC and HC grads all over our region, but there
aren't many bragging rights at stake. The schools don't play one
another in football anymore. A century-long rivalry that once
featured a Holy Cross Orange Bowl team and BC teams bound for Sugar
and Cotton Bowls was terminated in 1987 when it became clear that
Holy Cross should no longer play a Division 1 power.
</P>
<P>
   The basketball rivalry never approximated the intensity of the
Jesuit grid joust. For the better part of the century, it was all
Holy Cross as Bob Cousy, Tom Heinsohn, Ron Perry Sr., and a host of
All-Americans led the Crusaders to NCAA and NIT tourney titles. HC
remains the only New England school to win the NCAA basketball
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   BC's hoop program turned the corner when Cousy took over as
coach. In recent years the Eagles have upended No. 1-ranked teams,
won the Big East Tournament, and twice advanced to the Elite Eight.
</P>
<P>
   But the Glory Days of hoop are in the rearview mirror for both
schools. HC's last NCAA tournament appearance was a 30-point
blowout loss to Arkansas in 1993. BC was atop the Big East just two
years ago, and coach Jim O'Brien had a raft of recruits ready to
keep the Eagles in the hunt well into the next century. But
everything dissolved when the BC administration undercut O'Brien in
a fit of sanctimonious scrutiny, and experts predict the 1998-99
Eagles may go winless in the Big East.
</P>
<P>
   And so you had a 3-7 BC team facing a 2-6 Crusader team
Saturday. The Eagles lost to Harvard and carried a four-game losing
streak into the game. Holy Cross was without starting point guard
Ryan Serravalle (stress fracture), and came into the game with a
three-game losing streak. This was the 101st basketball game
between the schools.
</P>
<P>
   The head coaches are rivals. Raynor and Skinner faced each other
a couple of times when Raynor was a freshman at Dartmouth and
Skinner was in his first year at UMass. Those were the days of
freshman teams. Skinner's frosh team had a guard named Rick Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure we beat them,'' recalled Skinner. ``I think I had 35
and Billy scored 35.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really remember,'' said Raynor. ``But I'm gonna say we
won. We had a good freshman team that year. I probably had a good
game because Al or Rick was guarding me.''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner said he did not guard Raynor. ``You're gonna have to ask
Rick about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by sophomore forward Jared Curry of Braintree, Raynor's
Crusaders Saturday bolted to a 9-2 lead and still held a 23-13
margin with 5:30 left in the first half. But the Eagles had success
with a full-court zone trap and cut it to 3 by halftime.
</P>
<P>
   It was all BC after intermission. The Crusaders couldn't crack
the press and scored only 5 points in the first 16 minutes of the
second half. Eagles sophomore sub forward Jonathan Beerbohm ripped
off 9 consecutive inside points as BC built a 49-36 lead with 4:33
left in the quiet arena. A yo-mama alley-oop dunk by freshman Kenny
Walls served as the exclamation point in BC's win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no sense of rivalry with anybody,'' said Skinner.
``We're not at that level yet. Our players are still trying to find
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles' next home game is Jan. 6 against (gulp) top-ranked
Connecticut.

BEST OF NEELY INSPIRATIONAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cam Neely's comeback didn't go according to Hollywood script _
put away your double-runners and drop that stick, Sylvester
Stallone _ but his legacy does continue in western New York.
</P>
<P>
   Michal Grosek, who has blossomed into Buffalo's leading scorer
this season, sits down before every Sabres home game and watches
videotaped highlights of Neely, once the game's premier power
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Neely's agent, Boston-based Jay Fee, is also Grosek's agent. Fee
introduced the two last season and, according to Fee, the Czech
left winger asked if Fee could send him some tapes of the former
Bruins star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I sent them, Michal said to me, `He was a pretty good
player, wasn't he?''' said Fee. ``And I said, `Yeah, Michal, he was
one of the best ... and you could play like him, you've got the
skill, and you've got the size.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-2-inch, 210-pound Grosek went into weekend action
with 9 goals and 19 points in 25 games, tops among all Sabres. It
doesn't appear he's about to run away with the Art Ross Trophy as
the game's top scorer, at least not this season, but he is way
ahead of his career pace (81 points in 199 games).
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old Grosek began tuning in on Cam's film festival
during last season's playoff, about the same time Sabres coach
Lindy Ruff told him that his sagging play might keep him from
suiting up in the postseason. A little bit of kick-in-the-can
catalyst and a little bit of Cam have gone a long way.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how I want to play,'' Grosek said in an interview in
Pro Hockey EuroReport. ``Play physical games, score goals.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Grosek's career is reminiscent of how Neely
developed into the game's best blend of strength, finesse, and
ferocity at right wing. Selected 145th overall by the Jets in '93,
Grosek got only brief looks (total 28 games) over three seasons
with the Jets before being swapped with Darryl Shannon to the
Sabres in February 1996 for Craig Muni. He immediately became a
Sabres regular, though never showing a real tenaciousness around
the net until the '98 playoffs (6-4_10 in 15 games).
</P>
<P>
   Neely, of course, was a much higher pick (ninth overall by
Vancouver in '83), but never caught the eye of management in his
three seasons with the Canucks. He arrived in Boston in the summer
of '86, the day of his 21st birthday, and went on to score 36 goals
that season and 344 for the Bruins, three times breaking the
50-goal plateau in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Neely and Grosek have talked just the one time, but Fee said
they'll probably meet up again next month around the All-Star
break. Given the impact of the Neely tape, which runs about 30
minutes, Fee might want to consider distributing a few more among
his clients, or sending them out to would-be clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe, but if I do that, Cam might start charging me,'' said
Fee. ``Hmm, Cam charging me, that would be a switch.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sabres general manager Darcy Regier sees some of
Neely in Grosek's game, but says a direct comparision is premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cam Neely was a phenomenal player,'' said Regier. ``You can
see similarities between the two, their skating, and their
strength. But Cam's quick release and that mean streak of his _
boy, he could be mean _ were something that really set him apart.
Michal has the potential to become a power forward, just by virtue
of his sheer strength from the top of the circles, but I don't
think he's quite there with Cam yet.''

   Former BU defenseman  &UR; Tom Poti &LR; , &UR;  &LR; now a regular as a rookie on
the Oilers' blue line, had to reach deep into his pocket in Miami
Wednesday night when the Edmonton rookies hosted a team dinner at
Shula's steak house. Poti,  &UR; Craig Millar &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Fred Lindquist
 &LR; divvied up a tab of $12,500. ``It's amazing when you see those
kind of numbers,'' said Poti. ``But, every rookie's got to do do
it.'' Poti had filet mignon, which ended up costing him about $420
an ounce ... Gee, if the Hurricanes keep this up, do you suppose
all those daddywarbucks in Hartford will try to woo back the
Forever .500s with enough governmental givebacks that they could
return and deal for  &UR; Pavel Bure &LR; ? And who would have thought the
Hurricanes could have reshaped the product so significantly with
 &UR; Ron Francis  &LR; ranking no better than seventh in team scoring as of
last week? ... Another one of Fee's clients, Toronto netminder
 &UR; Felix Potvin &LR; , &UR;  &LR; remains home in Montreal, waiting for the Leafs to
deal him _ something that can't happen now until the holiday trade
freeze expires at midnight, Dec. 27. ``I feel the Leafs have
overplayed their hand,'' said Fee. ``Whatever they've been offered,
it never seems that it's quite enough.'' Clubs believed to have
interest: Chicago, Montreal, Florida, and the Islanders ... Red
Wing power forward  &UR; Brendan Shanahan &LR; , &UR;  &LR; here at the Fleet last
night, said he has grown tired of ``all the chicken littles'' who
constantly want to tinker with the game's rules. Shanahan: ``I've
only been in the game 12 years, so I'm not the oldest veteran or
the youngest guy. Now one of the latest cries is that the game
isn't producing enough skilled players. Heck, in Canada there was a
government inquiry _ why don't we have skilled players? _ when we
couldn't beat the Czechs in a shootout (at the Olympics). Hey, when
the Czechs shut out the Russians, there was no government inquiry
in Russia why they couldn't score a goal against 'em.'' ... The
Sabres watched the Rangers pluck young defenseman  &UR; Rumun Ndur  &LR; off
their roster Friday, claiming the 23-year-old Czech off the waiver
wire. Rangers coach  &UR; John Muckler  &LR; was the Sabres GM when Buffalo
drafted Ndur in '94. ``There will always be that risk there for us,
because of John,'' acknowledged Regier. On Friday, Regier dealt
disgruntled forward  &UR; Donald Audette &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the 29-year-old right winger
whose career has been diminished slightly by a series of knee
injuries and operations, to Los Angeles for a second-round draft
pick in '99. Audette has sat out all season in a contract dispute
as agent  &UR; Gilles Lupien  &LR; has been unable to strike a deal.
According to Audette, the Kings have offered him a two-year deal
worth $3.6 million ... Former Boston College star  &UR; Marty McInnis
 &LR; is finally showing the scoring touch he had in his days at the
Heights. Swapped to Anaheim this season, (for a fourth-round draft
pick in 2000 immediately after the Blackhawks obtained him from
Calgary), McInnis has eight goals, four of them game-winners, with
the Ducks. He suffered a cracked cheekbone late last week but
hasn't left the lineup ...  &UR; Ziggy Palffy's  &LR; deal with the
Islanders, agreed to Thursday, works out to $33 million over six
years, provided the Isles pick up the $7 million option in year No.
6. He'll make a pro-rated $3 million for the rest of this season
(about $1.8 million). If he keeps improving as a sniper, Palffy
could look woefully underpaid by the summer of 2000 ...  &UR; Bob
Goodenow &LR; , &UR;  &LR; head of the Players' Association, wouldn't offer an
opinion as to when he thinks the NHL will see its first $100
million contract (a la the Dodgers'  &UR; Kevin Brown &LR; ). ``Oh, that's
impossible to say,'' said Goodenow. ``I suppose it will be when
there's a player available that another team believes is worth that
kind of money.'' In other words, what's your house worth? What
someone's willing to pay for it? Look for that first $100 million
deal on or before July 1, 2000 (annual free agency date), which
will give the NHL about 18 months to catch up to the salary curve.

   Red Wings coach  &UR; Scotty Bowman  &LR; cautions those who might be
overly eager to see 19-year-old  &UR; Joe Thornton  &LR; step in and do the
job now for the Bruins. ``Look at  &UR; Guy Lafleur &LR; ,'' said Bowman.
``As good as he was _ and remember, he was drafted just before his
20th birthday _ it took him a few years to get established.''
Bowman arrived in Montreal with Lafleur in the fall of '71 and
recalls watching him struggle mightily at center, especially
against Boston. ``He was no match for ( &UR; Phil &LR; )  &UR; Esposito. &LR;  The
Bruins had that size, with Esposito and  &UR; Ken Hodge  &LR; and  &UR; Wayne
Cashman &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and Lafleur was just overmatched. He didn't have the
confidence. Remember, he was drafted No. 1 and he was supposed to
replace ( &UR; Jean &LR; )  &UR; Beliveau,  &LR; but put him out there against a great
player, and he couldn't win a faceoff. No way did I think he'd be a
superstar.'' In his fourth season, switched to right wing, Lafleur
fired in 53 goals _ the first of his six straight 50-plus seasons
... Planet Warning. Planet Warning.  &UR; Rick Curran &LR; , &UR;  &LR; agent for  &UR; Al
Iafrate &LR; , &UR;  &LR; reports that his client should be ready to attempt an
NHL comeback ``within a month or so.'' The former Bruins defenseman
opted to retire during the offseason, eschewing the contract he had
in hand from the Hurricanes, not wanting to take the money if he
didn't feel his knees could withstand game pressure. According to
Curran, Iafrate has been rehabbing on his own in Michigan, feels
good again, and, if all goes right, will report to the 'Canes next
month. ``The deal's been in place the whole time,'' said Curran.
``But Al didn't feel right about taking the money if he didn't feel
he could play, which is why he retired. But he's been working at
his own pace, feels much better, and he looks like he's ready to
go.'' ...  &UR; Paul Coffey  &LR; is finally getting some ice time in
Chicago. The Hall-of-Famer-to-be has been out almost all season
because of nerve damage in his back, which doctors told him was
caused by a steroid epidural he received earlier this year that was
meant to ease back pain. When the pain crept down to his leg and
into his right foot, he sought another opinion, and that's when
doctors at the Mayo Clinic diagnosed the nerve damage ... Detroit's
 &UR; Doug Brown &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a former BC Eagle, on the superior core of NHL
defensemen who still keep playing well into their 30s _ guys such
as Coffey,  &UR; Ray Bourque &LR; , &UR; Larry Murphy &LR; , &UR; Chris Chelios &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Al
MacInnis &LR; : ``Maybe these guys all grew up watching  &UR; Bobby Orr &LR; .''
And where will the next group come from? ``I think we're seeing
them now,'' said Brown. ``There's  &UR; Rob Blake  &LR; in Los Angeles and
 &UR; Ed Jovanovski  &LR; in Florida _ it's the group that watched all these
guys who are still playing.''... Perhaps the best hockey read of
the season:  &UR; David Salter's  &LR; feature on  &UR; Steve Durbano &LR; , &UR;  &LR; ex-tough
guy of the Blues, Penguins, Scouts, and Rockies, in the Dec. 18
Hockey News. Durbano, now 47, lives in Yellowknife, Northwest
Territories, where he sells cleaning goods and shampoos carpets and
rugs. When he did time in an Ontario prison in the '80s for drug
trafficking, only one former teammate came to visit him: ex-Bruin
 &UR; Ken Linseman &LR; . Durbano on his new life: ``I give myself a year of
real hard work, a lot of promotion, pounding the streets handing
out flyers, knocking (on) doors, introducing myself, not as Steve
Durbano the ex-hockey player, but Steve Durbano with
Electrolux/Electroclean. I'm not Bobby Orr in this town.''

PATRIOTS' SECONDARY FIRST RATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; FOXBOROUGH _ The old saying is that figures lie and liars
figure, but how do you figure this?
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, the annual Pro Bowl team was announced and the
26th-ranked pass defense in the National Football League placed two
members on the AFC team and a third as an alternate. That meant
three of the four members of the secondary of the New England
Patriots had been voted among the league's elite by their peers
despite the fact many of those peers had riddled them with pass
completions, if you choose to believe the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   According to the numbers, the Patriots have allowed 3,186 yards
through the air this season, an average of 227.6 a game. The
statistics say the Patriots have allowed 58.1 percent of the 515
throws against them to be completed, and there can be no arguing
the fact that 19 of the 27 touchdowns scored on New England have
been produced by receivers catching balls either over, behind or
through that secondary.
</P>
<P>
   So how did Ty Law become a first-team Pro Bowl cornerback,
strong safety Lawyer Milloy become the third safety on the AFC
all-star team, and free safety Willie Clay be selected as an
alternate?
</P>
<P>
   Patriots secondary coach Ron Lynn believes he knows the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those statistics are deceptive,'' said Lynn. ``We feel the
true barometers are yards per attempt and touchdowns per attempt,
and we're very good in those areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people realized we have good players back there that
have been playing well with a hobbled pass rush in front of them.
With Willie (McGinest) out so much and Chris Slade bothered by his
ankle and knee most of the year, we haven't got the kind of
pressure on opposing quarterbacks we'd hoped for, and that has to
affect your secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to pass defense, it's all connected. With our
(overall) ranking, it is surprising to some extent that people
looked past those numbers and realized how well Ty and Lawyer and
Willie have played, but it makes you feel good that they did
because it was important to them.''
</P>
<P>
   To no one more so than Law, who many felt a year ago deserved
such an accolade but failed to gain it, and who this season is tied
with Miami cornerback Terrell Buckley for the NFL lead in
interceptions (8) yet knows that number could have been
overshadowed by the negative ones against his secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley and teammate Sam Madison learned the hard way this week
that no number guarantees anything when Pro Bowl ballots are filled
out. They have more interceptions (15) than any starting cornerback
tandem in the league and they play on the NFL's sixth-rated pass
defense, yet neither will make the trip to Hawaii in February. Such
are the vagaries of a selection process Law needed four years to
crack but doesn't yet fully understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times it's a popularity contest,'' Law said of the
oft-criticized Pro Bowl balloting. ``Terrell deserved to go as much
as I did. How does anyone justify that? He got my top vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I still think it says something about the way we've played
here this year to be selected when you're ranked 26th in the NFL in
pass defense. I'm glad people didn't just look at our numbers and
judge us on that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Numbers can be deceiving. We've given up a lot of yards but
that's not because we couldn't play individually. Look at our run
defense. No one can hardly run on us (89.1 yards a game), so teams
have to try and throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the numbers of balls they had to throw (515) to get
that yardage (6.1 yards per attempt). Teams have had to throw 40
(36 to be precise) times a game to make their yardage. And me,
personally, I've got eight interceptions and 32 passes defended, so
I think that's saying something, too.''
</P>
<P>
   So did the voters who elected Law along with the Jets' Aaron
Glenn over Buckley and Madison and added Seattle's Shawn Springs,
whose seven interceptions were enough to make him the third corner
picked.
</P>
<P>
   While Law leads the NFL in interceptions overall, Milloy leads
all AFC safeties with five and is the Patriots' second leading
tackler with 124. Although Lynn acknowledges the latter stat is not
necessarily a good sign for his defensive unit as a whole, it has
been for Milloy, whom Lynn feels caught the attention of his peers
by the knockout shots he has delivered both at the line of
scrimmage and in the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawyer is a legitimate tough guy,'' Lynn said. ``He's a
throwback in that regard. He's fearless as a competitor, and people
notice that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a passion for the game. The fact is there are guys
who are bigger and there are guys who are faster and there are guys
who are stronger at that position, but there's not many who will
play it with the fire and commitment he brings to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very aggressive. I think that's a by-product of his
toughness and his love of the game, and you see it when he hits
somebody. He tackles guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed he does, hitting them the way Denver's Steve Atwater has,
which has put Atwater in the Pro Bowl for the eighth time in his 10
NFL seasons. Why Milloy plays this way may be a combination of
things, but one factor surely is that football helped save him from
a troubled youth, which included a period in which he did not know
where his mother was.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually she would return and his family would be reborn, but
in her absence it was sports _ and the most violent of sports in
particular _ that held him together.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be rewarded out of respect for your progression over the
years is a great feeling,'' the three-year veteran said of his Pro
Bowl selection. ``I thought I'd been progressing, and this helps
reinforce that feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I've been a consistent tackler and consistently played
my position. I think it's been my best year, so if I hadn't gotten
it I would have been disappointed for a day or two, but you know
how hard it is to push some of those (Pro Bowl) veterans out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've all been helped by having so many games on
national TV. We've gotten pretty good coverage, and got a lot of
situations where people were talking and writing good about us.
</P>
<P>
   ``But being picked isn't about going to Hawaii. It's about
earning and maintaining that respect around the league.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own way, Clay has managed to do that during a season of
trial in which he has often been forced to sacrifice his own
obsession with making plays for the good of a secondary that has
struggled to find a solid corner to go with Law.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the year, Clay has been rolled over the top of the
other corner, playing a game of reinforcement rather than one of a
truly free safety, which has often taken away opportunities for
interceptions and fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   Clay has only two interceptions and one fumble recovery and has,
at times, been the subject of criticism.
</P>
<P>
   But, while the uneducated may have had little idea what Clay's
role was this season, Lynn knows it well. Instead of playing the
role of ``Big Play'' Clay that led him to a multi-million-dollar
free agent contract several years ago when he came to New England,
he became best supporting actor, an often frustrating role but one
that has not gone unnoticed by his peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie just does so much for our football team that the public
doesn't understand,'' said Lynn. ``But all our players know.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands the `whys' of what we're doing on defense, not
just the hows. He helps every guy out there. I told Ty and Lawyer
that they deserved (to be selected) but that both of them should go
to Willie and thank him for putting them in position to make those
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Law and Milloy did more than that this week when they asked Clay
to be their guest in Hawaii if he isn't moved from alternate status
to the Pro Bowl roster. Explained Milloy, ``Willie's the reason we
were in position to make the plays we did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He does so many things for this team it isn't funny,'' Lunn
added. ``You can't tell him that enough because of all the emphasis
on stats in this culture, but it's true. I know this: I have to
make no apologies for him being mentioned on that (Pro Bowl)
list.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor for Law or Milloy, two guys who may play on the 26th- rated
pass defense Sunday but will be part of the AFC's best one come
Feb. 7.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton declared Saturday afternoon that
he intended to serve ``until the last hour of the last day of my
term,'' in an appearance outside the Oval Office with his wife at
his side and two busloads of congressional Democrats
shoulder-to-shoulder behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called for a quick, ``Constitutional and fair means of
resolving this matter'' and vowed ``to do the work of the American
people.'' He never used the word impeachment, which friends say he
fears will now be bound forever to his name.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as dusk darkened a gray, clammy day in Washington, the
president grasped Hillary Rodham Clinton's hand and waded back
through the Democrats to attend a meeting of his senior foreign
policy advisers. He called off the airstrikes against Iraq that he
launched Wednesday night, on the evening before the scheduled House
debate on his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident we have achieved our mission,'' Clinton said
Saturday evening in a second statement to reporters, demonstrating
to his supporters that he would resolutely perform his job despite
all distractions _ but fueling suspicions of detractors that the
raid was timed for political effect.
</P>
<P>
   A few of each group were clustered outside the iron gates of the
White House Saturday evening, and their distant cries of support or
protest could be heard just beyond the Rose Garden, where Clinton
appeared with the Democrats in a stark display of the partisanship
cleaving Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After announcing his decision on Iraq, Clinton donned black tie
for a holiday dinner at the White House. That brought to a
jarringly festive end his darkest day in an almost unimaginable
sequence of events set in motion 20 years ago, when he and Mrs.
Clinton signed papers on a money-losing land investment along the
White River in the Ozark Mountains in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   It was while investigating that deal and related matters that
Kenneth Starr, the independent prosecutor, learned of a possible
presidential affair and lies under oath.
</P>
<P>
   And it was from the dining room off the Oval Office where
president sometimes met with Monica Lewinsky that Clinton watched
Saturday as the House voted on articles of impeachment against him.
He missed the vote on Article I, aides said, because he was meeting
in the Oval Office with a spiritual adviser, the Rev. Tony Campolo.
</P>
<P>
   As he watched, Clinton showed great interest in the handful of
members who broke with their parties to support or oppose
impeachment, advisers said. Vice President Al Gore entered the room
during the fourth vote and said, ``It's not fair, what they've done
to you,'' according to one aide who was present.
</P>
<P>
   Different friends and advisers sensed different emotions in
Clinton over the last 24 hours: Some detected deep anger where
others felt a wash of remorse. To many of his aides, nervously
searching for signs of distraction or weakness, Clinton presented
only the confident, upbeat face he has maintained through years of
personal and political crisis.
</P>
<P>
   One aide found Clinton to be ``like a Calvin Klein ad: he's
somewhere between obsession and denial.''
</P>
<P>
   Uniformly, Clinton's friends and advisers said he is confident
the Senate will not convict him, and that he will not resign. And
uniformly, they said he is sick at heart about the ``politics of
personal destruction,'' which he denounced from the White House
lawn Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a good and decent country,'' Clinton said in his
five-minute remarks. ``But we have significant challenges we have
to face. In order to do it right, we have to have some atmosphere
of decency and civility, some presumption of good faith, some sense
of proportionality and balance in bringing judgment who against
those who are in different parties. We have important work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he had expected and had braced for the blow of
impeachment, the president was still in for a shock Saturday
morning, when he was told that Robert Livingston had stepped aside
as House speaker after acknowledging extramarital affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is happening?'' President Clinton asked in astonishment
of an old friend, Terence McAuliffe, moments after learning the
news. ``This is terrible for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In describing the telephone conversation later, McAuliffe said:
``The unfairness that the president has been subjected to, he
doesn't want to see it happen to anybody else.'' Indeed, Clinton
dispatched Joseph Lockhart, his press secretary, to tell reporters
that he wished Livingston would reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   But Lockhart said Clinton had no intention of accepting
Livingston's challenge from the House floor that he follow his
example. ``He believes it would be wrong to give in to the politics
of personal destruction,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's friends insist that he is deeply remorseful about his
behavior. ``He has had a knot in his gut for months,'' McAuliffe
said. ``He is in agony over this.''
</P>
<P>
   But he kept to his normal routine Saturday, giving his weekly
radio address, about Iraq, and cheerfully shaking hands with some
80 family members of aides who sat in.
</P>
<P>
   The president made only a glancing reference to any heartfelt
contrition Saturday afternoon, saying, ``I have accepted
responsibility for what I did wrong in my personal life, and I have
invited members of Congress to work with us to find a reasonable
bipartisan and proportionate response.''
</P>
<P>
   By car and bus, the Democrats came to the White House after
losing their battle to fend off impeachment. They attended a brief,
private rally with Clinton in the East Room before strolling in
clumps of two and three under the colonnade and past the Rose
Garden, where a few white roses were in bloom, to wait for the
president in front of a bare, spreading Saucer Magnolia tree.
</P>
<P>
   They jostled one another and some joked, until Rep. John Lewis
of Georgia, standing with hands folded and brow furrowed in the
front row, shushed them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton emerged moments later from the Oval Office, brushing his
cheeks before Mrs. Clinton slipped her right hand into the crook of
his left arm and, smiling, descended with him along a curving path
to join the Congressmen.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared to choke up as Gore introduced him, declaring:
``I know his heart and his will.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he stepped to the blue lectern affixed with the golden
presidential seal and thanked the members for their ``defense of
the Constitution and the best in America.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not publicly thank Mrs. Clinton, who journeyed to the
Hill this morning in a till-the-last-dog-dies defense of the
president. But he clutched at her hand as they stepped from the
podium, and he would not release it even as she reached up to hug
one congressman.
</P>
<P>
   As the president re-entered the Oval Office, Betty Currie, his
secretary and one of Starr's most prized witnesses, reached up to
hug him and kissed him on the cheek.

TO KEEP THIS WINDOW OPEN, COWBOYS MUST BEAT EAGLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It made perfect sense then. It is reality now. Harsh reality.
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1994, Troy Aikman began talking about the Valley
Ranch ``window of opportunity that was closing.'' The Cowboys had
reached dynasty status, but free agency, the salary cap and normal
football attrition was chipping away at the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a team, we were too good to waste what we had,'' Aikman
said last week. ``We had won two Super Bowls. I thought we could
win two or three more before the window closed. That's what I kept
saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning two or three more didn't happen. If anything, the world
championship of '95 was a surprise, considering the internal
turmoil that engulfed the Cowboys in December of that year. After
that, the slide south became an avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   And now ...
</P>
<P>
   The window has slammed shut.
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowls are strictly memories for these Cowboys. Today at
Texas Stadium will be just another Sunday of attempted playoff
survival. Even the Eagles are scary.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, of course, will not admit the dream has died. It's the
``team thing'' that prevents such a confession, but evidence over
the past three weeks is hard to deny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think our window has closed,'' he said, ``but instead,
it's now more a case of us looking out a different window.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to reinvent ourselves. The cast of players is so
different, there is no way we can be compared to where we were four
and five years ago. Different team, different window.''
</P>
<P>
   But what they see is a rather parched landscape.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-November, the view was different. The Cowboys had risen
to borderline NFC championship contender. But the ground was shaky.
When injuries hit, the ground caved in.
</P>
<P>
   Until he was gone, no one realized how important Ernie Mills was
to the offense. Mills' numbers and production were outstanding, but
he still was easy to overlook.
</P>
<P>
   While Michael Irvin struggled, and still struggles, to grasp a
new offense, he became only a receiving shadow of his former self.
Irvin, however, maintained immense respect from opposing defensive
units and a veteran like Mills pounced on that opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   With Mills gone, however, the experience factor at receiver went
to nil. Billy Davis became more of a marked man, and that showed.
Strangely, it's been Patrick Jeffers, No. 6 out of six receivers on
the roster a month ago, who has responded best.
</P>
<P>
   The David LaFleur injury took out a blocking tight end, hurting
the ground game. Plus, LaFleur was a receiver who had to be
accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Who among us considered a Mills and a LaFleur such vital
components? Only the offensive failures of the past two weeks have
emphasized that.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the middle of the offensive line began to show
both green-ness and old age. Center Mike Kiselak and guard Flozell
Adams are rookies. Guard Nate Newton is ancient. None are playing
well at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Bet me on this:
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' first draft pick in April will be a center. Chan
Gailey is a stickler for running the ball, which makes him no
different from most coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Cowboys were smoke and mirrors to begin with.
But when Nine-Toed Deion took his hike, it changed so much about
defensive strategy. This demonstrates the existing fundamental
weakness of the defense, that a cornerback could have a major
impact on the system. It's not supposed to be that way.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman parrots Gailey when it comes to the injuries. ``They
can't be used as an excuse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But they are an excuse. A legitimate excuse. To be competitive,
the Cowboys have to have health. Over the course of an NFL season,
that is hard to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say,'' added Aikman, ``we wouldn't be in the position
we are in right now if we'd had a bit more luck on injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   With six losses this season, all can be accounted for, save for
the disgusting display in New Orleans. Otherwise:
</P>
<P>
   Denver _ not good enough. Oakland _ scored 12 points without
Aikman. Chicago _ scored 12 points without Aikman. Minnesota _
bombs away on a Deion-less secondary. Kansas City _ too many
injuries and a loss of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who will say beating Philadelphia today would
prove nothing. Wrong. The Cowboys, by winning a game again, will
accomplish plenty.
</P>
<P>
   ``To return to the right mindset, the Eagles are our most
important game of the season,'' said owner Jerry Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Looking out the old window, you couldn't see it that way. But
without question, this is a different window that is also closing.

U.S., BRITAIN END BOMBARDMENT OF IRAQI TARGETS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton ended four days of air attacks on
Iraq Saturday, saying he was confident ``significant damage'' had
been inflicted on Saddam Hussein's command structures.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after becoming only the second president ever to be
impeached, Clinton made a national television appearance to assure
Americans that the strikes had reduced Iraq's ability to produce
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   But the president warned that he was ready to order further
military action if Iraq continues to produce and use chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would welcome the return of (the United Nations weapons
inspection team) back into Iraq,'' Clinton said. ``But ... if not
allowed to resume its work on a regular basis, we will remain
vigilant and prepared to use force if we see that Iraq is
rebuilding its weapons programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced his decision to end U.S.-British attacks,
dubbed Operation Desert Fox, following a meeting at the White House
with his top national security advisers and a telephone
conversation with British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   ``That operation is now complete,'' Clinton said, revealing that
the Desert Fox mission was scheduled to last only 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
   In London, Blair noted that all British and U.S. forces involved
had returned safely to their ships and land bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objectives have been achieved. We set out to degrade
Saddam's military and weapons capability, and we have done so,''
Blair told reporters. He said that severe damage had been done to
many of the elite Republican Guard units responsible for propping
up Saddam's regime and hiding his weapons programs from U.N.
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   In a briefing at the Pentagon, Defense Secretary William Cohen
said the air strikes had inflicted ``substantial damage'' on seven
categories of targets, including industrial facilities and oil
refineries, military command centers, and missile sites.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen estimated the strikes had set back Saddam's ``war fighting
capability'' by ``at least a year,'' including his ability to make
and deliver weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have selected those targets which pose the greatest risk to
the region _ chemical, biological, and indeed even potentially
nuclear capability and the means to deliver them,'' the secretary
said. ``We believe that we have inflicted substantial damage upon
his capability to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   After calling off the strikes, Clinton stressed that the threat
of renewed force would play an important role in a strategy he
wants to devise with U.S. allies to contain Saddam and possibly
force him from power.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy, he said, would include maintaining a strong U.S.
presence in the Persian Gulf region to enforce the no-fly zones
over Iraq, maintaining extensive sanctions against Iraq, and
providing renewed assistance to Iraqi opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the long term, the best way to end the threat that Saddam
poses to his own people in the region is for Iraq to have a
different government. We will intensify our engagement with the
Iraqi opposition groups, prudently and effectively,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the United States stands ``ready to help a new
leadership in Baghdad that abides by its international commitments
and respects the rights of its own people.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Clinton called off the attacks, U.S. and British forces
continued to bomb and fire cruise missiles at large concentrations
of Saddam's Republican Guard troops and sites believed to house
elements of his chemical and biological weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam's forces responded with ineffective anti-aircraft fire,
which has been the only Iraqi military response during the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise missiles fired from U.S. ships in the Persian Gulf and
laser-guided bombs apparently destroyed a good portion of Iraq's
air defense system. As a result, said one Pentagon official, ``we
have been able to fly ``into Iraq and not been successfully engaged
by any of the ... air defense systems.``
</P>
<P>
   One Pentagon official said the bombing and missile attacks on
key army installations were meant to ``eliminate'' as many of
Saddam's elite troops as possible. He said Saddam's most loyal
security forces were targeted in an effort to increase the
possibility of a rebellion against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Guard was a key target,'' the official said.
``They not only guard Saddam, they also keep his weapons hidden
from inspectors.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen acknowledged that the attacks on the Republican Guard
locations could have a destabilizing effect on Saddam's regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that we attack those forces who are in charge
and help him either conceal, move, transport and maintain these
weapons of mass destruction programs, then that can have the
consequence of degrading his forces and his stability,'' Cohen
said.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary added that only military-related targets were hit
in an effort to reduce the chance of civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
stressed that the damage to Iraqi targets was apparently more
``significant'' than initial assessments of the missile and bomb
strikes had indicated. He said that some 100 targets had been hit
one or more times during the operation. Although he declined to
give a precise number of cruise missiles and bombs used in the
strikes, he told reporters that more than 400 would be ``in the
ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan is being executed with precision and success,''
Shelton said, using satellite photographs and videotape from U.S.
warplanes to illustrate how many of the targets had been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Before he called off the operation, Clinton offered an
explanation for the continued bombing in a videotaped message to
the Arab world as it was beginning to observe the holy month of
Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   Describing Saddam as a vicious dictator responsible for a
``reign of terror against own people,'' Clinton said the Iraqi
leader was a threat to all ``Muslims and non-Muslims alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing Saddam's refusal to go along with U.N. inspections,
Clinton said, ``We had to act. Saddam simply must not be allowed to
threaten his neighbors or the world with nuclear arms, poison gas
or biological weapons.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States and Britain ended their attack on
Iraq Saturday night after carrying out a fourth day of air and
missile strikes as the holy month of Ramadan began in the Islamic
world.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, appearing at the White House only hours after
the House voted to impeach him, called off the campaign at 6 p.m.
ET, or 2 a.m. Sunday in Iraq. Clinton declared the attack a success
but warned that the United States and Britain would strike Iraq
again if President Saddam Hussein took any steps to rebuild
chemical or biological weapons or threaten his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident we have achieved our mission,'' Clinton said,
appearing in the Roosevelt Room with his senior national security
aides. ``We have inflicted significant damage on Saddam's weapons
of mass destruction programs, on the command structures that direct
and protect that capability and on his military and security
infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, battered but unbowed, reacted with defiance. Its vice
president, Taha Yassin Ramadan, on Saturday declared an end to its
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspections, imposed as part of
conditions for ending the Persian Gulf war in 1991. Although not
unexpected after the U.S. and British attack, the declaration means
that the United States has entered a new phase in its 7-year-old
standoff with Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the strikes, Clinton once again called for a new
government in Baghdad, as did Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain
in London, though both had stopped short of making that an
objective of the bombing campaign, knowing that to do so would
invite failure. Still, Clinton said the United States would work to
maintain Saddam's diplomatic isolation and increase support for
opposition groups that might someday overthrow him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the long term, the best way to end the threat that Saddam
poses to his own people and the region is for Iraq to have a
different government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset of the bombing on Wednesday night, Clinton and
Blair said they were sensitive to carrying out strikes against an
Arab country during the Muslims' month of fasting and religious
study. On Saturday night they said the campaign had always been
meant to last nearly four days, even though that pushed it into
Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   And so as night fell in Iraq Saturday, antiaircraft fire once
again burst over Baghdad, in reaction to one last day of strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's attack included still more Tomahawk cruise missiles
and American and British fighters and bombers, though it was far
smaller than the thunderous barrage of 150 strikes that battered
Iraq on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the four-day campaign, the Pentagon methodically hit,
in wave after wave, targets selected after months of study as the
best hope of damaging Iraq's ability to make and use nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the attacks concentrated on command centers,
missile factories and airfields. The campaign also hit an oil
refinery Saddam allegedly used to evade sanctions and the
headquarters and bases of the Republican Guard, the force that
helps maintain Saddam's grip on power.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning of this operation, we've been careful to
set realistic goals,'' Secretary of Defense William Cohen said at
the Pentagon Saturday before the campaign was called off. ``We've
also been careful not to either overstate or exaggerate the results
as our intelligence analysts study the very preliminary data.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen stressed ``that this military action is substantial.''
Offering the first concrete measure of the assault's impact on
Iraq's power, he said Saddam's ballistic missile program had been
set back ``by at least a year.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior military commander, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, agreed Saturday that the attacks had ``certainly set
back'' Iraq's military, but conceded that it was difficult to
quantify that. And it remains unclear that military successes alone
can do much to advance the administration's longer-term strategy of
containing Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   A day after disclosing that the first strikes had severely
damaged or destroyed only a part of their targets, the Pentagon
said Saturday that American and British forces had struck 100
targets with about 450 sea- and air-launched cruise missiles and
650 sorties by fighters, bombers and support aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   And Cohen and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen.
Henry Shelton of the Army, offered a more optimistic view of the
damage done. Of 74 targets whose damage has been surveyed in
photographs from spy planes or satellites, they said 28 had been
severely damaged or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Many targets, they emphasized, received ``moderate damage,''
which Cohen sought to describe by saying that the Alfred Murrah
Federal Building in Oklahoma had, militarily, been ``moderately
damaged'' by the car bomb three years ago.

 WASHINGTON: years ago. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those Iraqi targets that received little or no damage were
struck again, while new military and industrial sites were targeted
in Saturday's raids, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even by the Pentagon's definitions, 18 of the 74 analyzed
targets received little or no damage.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign ended with no U.S. or British casualties or planes
shot down, a testament to the use of unmanned cruise missiles and
relatively little resistance from Iraq's air defenses other than
ineffective anti-aircraft artillery. Iraq has said that at least 68
civilians have died, but there has not yet been a clear accounting
of casualties there.
</P>
<P>
   A second aircraft carrier, the Carl Vinson, entered the Persian
Gulf and moved into position to take part in a fourth day of
strikes, joining the carrier Enterprise, whose F-14, F-18/A and
EA-6B jets had pounded Iraq for three days. Accompanying the Carl
Vinson were six cruisers and destroyers able to fire Tomahawk
cruise missiles, but officials said they did not launch them,
saving them, significantly, for any future strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's attack included strikes by F-16 and F-15 fighters, as
well as British Tornado fighters, based in Kuwait and supported by
aerial tankers and AWACS communication jets flying out of Saudi
Arabia. B-1 bombers, based in Oman, also flew into Iraq on their
first combat missions after a troubled, three-decade development.
</P>
<P>
   A focus of the assault was the barracks and headquarters of four
divisions of the Republican Guard. U.S. missiles also hit seven or
eight of Saddam's presidential palaces and the headquarters of
Saddam's Baath Party in Baghdad, badly damaging it, Pentagon and
British officials said. Iraq's refusal to allow U.N. weapons
inspectors to inspect that building was one of the reasons the
United States and Britain cited it for targeting.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, signs of destruction were everywhere after the third
night of the attack unleashed the most punishing strikes yet in
Baghdad. Saddam's forces said they had shot down 23 of 60 cruise
missiles fired into Baghdad overnight, a claim the Pentagon
disputed.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the diplomatic sensitivities of attacking during
Ramadan, Clinton prepared a videotaped address to be broadcast in
the Arab world Saturday, explaining the American rationale for
striking Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's address came amid a swelling anger in the region.
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, one of the closest American
allies in the Arab world, called for an immediate halt to the
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has spent the last few months trying to revive the
Middle East peace effort and just last week played the role of
mediator between the Israelis and Palestinians, declared in his
radio address the ``most profound admiration for Islam.'' And he
sought to distinguish the assault on Saddam, saying the Iraqi
leader had disregarded the United Nations, other Arab states and
his own people.
</P>
<P>
   ``No decision to use force is easy, especially at a time when
I'm working so hard to build peace in the Middle East and to
strengthen our own relations with the Arab world,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the days ahead, I hope all Muslims will consider America's
sincere desire to work with all people in the Middle East to build
peace,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In London, George Robertson, Britain's defense secretary, said
the attacks had hit 100 military and industrial targets and had
caused ``substantial damage.''
</P>
<P>
   While the overthrow of Saddam was not the stated objective,
Robertson made it clear that the strikes on the Republican Guard
were meant to weaken Saddam's control.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Republican Guard ceases to support Saddam, his brutal
regime is under immediate threat,'' Robertson said. ``We want the
Republican Guard to know that the cozy life they have led under
Saddam is under attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair said he could not guarantee that the air assault would
topple Saddam. But he added, ``It would be wonderful if Saddam
could be removed from power.''

 CLINTON CITES SUCCESS, HALTS AIR WAR
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hours after being impeached by the House of
Representatives Saturday, President Clinton declared victory in his
air war on Iraq and brought his bombing-campaign to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident we have achieved our mission,'' Clinton
proclaimed, adding that the attacks ``inflicted significant
damage'' on Saddam Hussein's ability to threaten his neighbors with
nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   However, the president emphasized, ``We will remain vigilant . .
. prepared to use force'' again if it seems Hussein resumes
aggressive activities. He said that sanctions, which have deprived
Iraq of $120 billion so far, would continue.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he hoped Hussein would allow United Nations
inspectors to reenter Iraq, but said he would continue to encourage
Iraqi opposition factions that seek to overthrow Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference a few hours before Clinton's announcement,
the Pentagon sharply upgraded its estimate of how much damage the
airstrikes had inflicted on Hussein's military power. The new
assessment clearly gave Clinton an opening to stop the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, over three nights of airstrikes, many targets _
including those related to Hussein's nuclear, chemical, and
biological weapons program _ remained only lightly damaged, and
several others were not attacked at all.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made his decision after his national security advisers
briefed him on these results late Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   As the fourth night of bombing got under way, Defense Secretary
William S. Cohen said the attacks have ``substantially degraded''
the Iraqi leader's ability to wage war.
</P>
<P>
   General Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
declared himself ``very pleased with the results'' and reported
``significant success.'' The upbeat words were explicitly meant to
reverse the glum impression of Friday's news briefing, when Cohen
said he was merely ``satisfied'' and Shelton allowed that ``not
all'' the strikes had ``gone according to plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the brighter picture, other officers said, was due to
the results of Friday night's ferocious barrage of bombs and cruise
missiles, some of which struck targets that they had missed or just
lightly damaged before.
</P>
<P>
   Part of it was also due to revisions by intelligence analysts,
who, the day before, had not had time to examine satellite photos
of all the targets.
</P>
<P>
   As of Saturday morning, US and British bombs and missiles had
attacked 97 targets and done at least some damage to all of them.
</P>
<P>
   This marked an advance over the day before, when 89 targets had
been attacked, of which 12 received no damage.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 cruise missiles, each costing nearly $1 million, were
fired from B-52 bombers and ships at sea. An untold number of
laser-guided bombs, but probably at least 300, were dropped by F-14
and F-18 combat planes flying off the USS Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Only cruise missiles were used over Baghdad, reflecting the US
commanders' extreme caution in this operation. Officials Saturday
said no planes were shot down.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, top US officials said the goal of Operation
Desert Fox was to ``degrade'' and ``diminish'' Hussein's ability to
threaten his neighbors with chemical, nuclear, or biological
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen Saturday uttered both of those magic words, saying the
attack ``substantially degraded'' his military capabilities and
``diminished'' his ability to threaten his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   These words gave the president the option to declare the war
over.
</P>
<P>
   As the Pentagon revealed more about what kinds of targets were
being hit and not hit, Operation Desert Fox came to look less like
a comprehensive attack on Hussein's ability to make weapons of mass
destruction, and more like an attempt to destabilize his grip on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the airstrikes were aimed at Hussein's private security
apparatus, the transmitters that let him communicate with soldiers
in the south of Iraq, and his intelligence headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen has denied that destabilization was the operation's goal.
However, he acknowledged that would certainly be a ``consequence''
of degrading Hussein's military power.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, key elements of what officials said was the main
target _ Hussein's ability to make chemical, nuclear, and
biological weapons _ went untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen acknowledged Saturday that ``dual-use'' facilities _
plants that produce both chemical weapons and civilian products _
were not attacked at all, in order to avoid hurting the Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
   It is generally believed dual-use facilities are the only
chemical sites remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Sites that may be producing nuclear and biological weapons were
also untargeted, if such things exist.
</P>
<P>
   Airstrikes were mounted, however, on sites believed to be
developing and building the missiles that could deliver these
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   As of Saturday morning, the Pentagon said forces attacked 11
such sites, inflicting severe damage on one, moderate damage on
five, and light damage on one. The strikes did not fully destroy
any.
</P>
<P>
   However, General Thomas Wilson, the Joint Chiefs' intelligence
director, said Saturday that the strikes have set back Iraq's
ability to build long-range missiles by ``at least a year.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Wilson also noted that those facilities can now build
only short-range missiles _ which are allowed by United Nations
resolutions _ and that, even if there were no airstrikes, it would
take ``a couple of years'' for the Iraqis to convert them to
long-range weapons. He did emphasize that they seem to have
``plans'' to try to make this conversion.

IMPEACHMENT IS ONLY LATEST BATTLE IN `CULTURAL WAR' 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The last time the House impeached a president, it
was a direct result of the Civil War. This time, the historic act
was an indirect result of a cultural war.
</P>
<P>
   President Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1868 primarily because
he rejected radical Reconstruction plans for the South. He was
spared removal from office by a single vote in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was impeached Saturday by a narrow, almost
strictly party-line vote on two articles, claiming perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   In that debate, Republicans may have contended that the case
against Clinton hinged on lying under oath and other official
misdeeds, while Democrats argued it was all about sex. But not far
beneath the surface of the historic political drama loomed a
broader, more transcendent issue.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is in the dock now, in part, because of a nasty national
battle over values that has waxed and waned for almost 30 years. In
many ways, House consideration of impeaching Clinton was the 1960s
coming home to roost.
</P>
<P>
   To many Republicans in the House and beyond, Clinton is a
classic ``if it feels good, do it'' baby boomer. To the social
conservatives who now hold sway in the GOP, Clinton is situational
ethics and moral relativism incarnate, be the issue the current
dispute about sex and lying or his older controversial actions _
draft evasion, anti-war activism and smoking marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   To many Democrats, the Republican majority _ and independent
counsel Kenneth Starr _ are direct descendants of the late Arizona
Sen. Barry Goldwater dictum that ``extremism in the defense of
liberty is no vice.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri even hinted at
the earlier ugly phenomenon of McCarthyism when he spoke of
``inquisition'' and demanded that the politics of ``smear and slash
and burn must end.''
</P>
<P>
   And as the impeachment vote neared Saturday, the split arose
sharply as House Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, characterized the House
debate as ``relativism vs. absolute truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., rose to counter that the
House was ``losing sight of the distinction between sins, which
ought to be between a person and his family and his God, and
crimes, which are the concern of the state and of society as a
whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Other elements of the cultural divide echoed earlier in the
debate.
</P>
<P>
   When a Democrat, Rep. Tom Lantos of California, said that
impeachment for lying about sex violated ``the principle of
proportionality,'' a Republican, Rep. Merrill Cook of Utah, replied
that ``a lie is a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook derided the idea that Clinton's oath before his January
deposition or his August grand jury testimony committed him only to
``the truth that's convenient.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans don't think much of attempts to make bank shots
about deeper cultural divisions off the impeachment debate. They
are quick _ and correct _ to point out that were it not for
Clinton's smarmy White House dalliances with former intern Monica
Lewinsky and his attempts to conceal them, the president would not
be caught up in the first impeachment debate in the full House in
130 years.
</P>
<P>
   But experienced social commentators believe the additional
social perspectives present in the debate are unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't just an easy theory, it is absolutely part of our
times. It's playing out right now, every day, before our eyes,''
said Haynes B. Johnson, the former Washington Post reporter who
chronicled the mood of the last decade in his ``Sleepwalking
through History: America in the Reagan Years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more than just this moment. It's much more than just
Bill Clinton,'' Johnson said. The ``cultural war'' spoken of by
conservative commentator Pat Buchanan ``is really true.''
</P>
<P>
   George Shipley, an international corporate strategist and
Democratic adviser based in Austin, Texas, said the two sides of
the impeachment debate broadly represent the classic dichotomy from
the 1960s: ``Those people who expressed a liberated lifestyle and
those who were repelled from it.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, 30 years later, Shipley said, the parameters of that
debate have shifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moral corset worn in public by these Republicans is not
very attractive,'' Shipley said, and could result in a backlash.
``The American people have sent them a message: Get off the
president's back. They haven't heard that message. It cost them the
(Newt Gingrich) speakership, and it may well cost them the Congress
in the 2000 election.``
</P>
<P>
   Susan Rasky, former chief congressional correspondent of the New
York Times and now a journalism professor at the University of
California at Berkeley who studies cultural developments, called
the current impeachment debate ``the other bookend of the cultural
revolution'' that rocked the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, she said, is ``the poster boy of everything that
(Republicans and conservatives) found hateful'' about the era. ``He
is the embodiment of everything that began to go wrong with the
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than producing a generation tempered by world war and the
Depression _ the 1960s sent forth a generation ``tempered by
nothing except prosperity,'' Rasky said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, she observed, the GOP right, which is
controlling the impeachment process, is ``the indigestible lump of
Republicanism,'' which makes the party unacceptable to a broad
swath of America.
</P>
<P>
   The animosity of conservative Republicans against Clinton has a
historic grounding, several social analysts agreed, going back to
the 1964 presidential election and the drubbing of Republican
nominee Goldwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a transcendent moment for liberalism in America,''
Haynes Johnson said. Looking at the House Republicans, he observed:
``These are Goldwater boys and girls in many ways.''
</P>
<P>
   But the political landscape quickly began to shift, beginning
with the election of Ronald Reagan as governor of California in
1966. Reagan took on the college demonstrators and what he saw as
permissive educators. Incumbent Democratic Gov. Pat Brown's attempt
to label Reagan an extremist failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under Goldwater they tasted defeat,'' Rasky said of
conservatives, ``but with Reagan they found out how to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Quickly the phenomenon took on national implications. Richard
Nixon played on similar cultural themes in the national election of
1968 and rallied ``the silent majority'' shocked by the antiwar
protests and other civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   Even that era echoed in the House debate Friday, as a Vietnam
veteran, Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, rose to speak in favor of
impeaching Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you serve in the Vietnam War?'' Hyde asked Johnson,
drawing the unspoken comparison with Clinton, who resisted military
service in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Johnson said, and earlier in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much time did you spend in a prison camp in Hanoi?'' Hyde
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly seven years,'' Johnson answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're qualified to talk about the military service,''
said Hyde, his broader, deeper meaning lost on almost no one. &QL;

 CLINTON CITES SUCCESS, HALTS AIR WAR
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hours after being impeached by the House of
Representatives Saturday, President Clinton declared victory in his
air war on Iraq and brought his bombing-campaign to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident we have achieved our mission,'' Clinton
proclaimed, adding that the attacks ``inflicted significant
damage'' on Saddam Hussein's ability to threaten his neighbors with
nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   However, the president emphasized, ``We will remain vigilant . .
. prepared to use force'' again if it seems Hussein resumes
aggressive activities. He said that sanctions, which have deprived
Iraq of $120 billion so far, would continue.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he hoped Hussein would allow United Nations
inspectors to reenter Iraq, but said he would continue to encourage
Iraqi opposition factions that seek to overthrow Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference a few hours before Clinton's announcement,
the Pentagon sharply upgraded its estimate of how much damage the
airstrikes had inflicted on Hussein's military power. The new
assessment clearly gave Clinton an opening to stop the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, over three nights of airstrikes, many targets _
including those related to Hussein's nuclear, chemical, and
biological weapons program _ remained only lightly damaged, and
several others were not attacked at all.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made his decision after his national security advisers
briefed him on these results late Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   As the fourth night of bombing got under way, Defense Secretary
William S. Cohen said the attacks have ``substantially degraded''
the Iraqi leader's ability to wage war.
</P>
<P>
   General Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
declared himself ``very pleased with the results'' and reported
``significant success.'' The upbeat words were explicitly meant to
reverse the glum impression of Friday's news briefing, when Cohen
said he was merely ``satisfied'' and Shelton allowed that ``not
all'' the strikes had ``gone according to plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the brighter picture, other officers said, was due to
the results of Friday night's ferocious barrage of bombs and cruise
missiles, some of which struck targets that they had missed or just
lightly damaged before.
</P>
<P>
   Part of it was also due to revisions by intelligence analysts,
who, the day before, had not had time to examine satellite photos
of all the targets.
</P>
<P>
   As of Saturday morning, US and British bombs and missiles had
attacked 97 targets and done at least some damage to all of them.
</P>
<P>
   This marked an advance over the day before, when 89 targets had
been attacked, of which 12 received no damage.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 cruise missiles, each costing nearly $1 million, were
fired from B-52 bombers and ships at sea. An untold number of
laser-guided bombs, but probably at least 300, were dropped by F-14
and F-18 combat planes flying off the USS Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Only cruise missiles were used over Baghdad, reflecting the US
commanders' extreme caution in this operation. Officials Saturday
said no planes were shot down.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, top US officials said the goal of Operation
Desert Fox was to ``degrade'' and ``diminish'' Hussein's ability to
threaten his neighbors with chemical, nuclear, or biological
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen Saturday uttered both of those magic words, saying the
attack ``substantially degraded'' his military capabilities and
``diminished'' his ability to threaten his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   These words gave the president the option to declare the war
over.
</P>
<P>
   As the Pentagon revealed more about what kinds of targets were
being hit and not hit, Operation Desert Fox came to look less like
a comprehensive attack on Hussein's ability to make weapons of mass
destruction, and more like an attempt to destabilize his grip on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the airstrikes were aimed at Hussein's private security
apparatus, the transmitters that let him communicate with soldiers
in the south of Iraq, and his intelligence headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen has denied that destabilization was the operation's goal.
However, he acknowledged that would certainly be a ``consequence''
of degrading Hussein's military power.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, key elements of what officials said was the main
target _ Hussein's ability to make chemical, nuclear, and
biological weapons _ went untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen acknowledged Saturday that ``dual-use'' facilities _
plants that produce both chemical weapons and civilian products _
were not attacked at all, in order to avoid hurting the Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
   It is generally believed dual-use facilities are the only
chemical sites remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Sites that may be producing nuclear and biological weapons were
also untargeted, if such things exist.
</P>
<P>
   Airstrikes were mounted, however, on sites believed to be
developing and building the missiles that could deliver these
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   As of Saturday morning, the Pentagon said forces attacked 11
such sites, inflicting severe damage on one, moderate damage on
five, and light damage on one. The strikes did not fully destroy
any.
</P>
<P>
   However, General Thomas Wilson, the Joint Chiefs' intelligence
director, said Saturday that the strikes have set back Iraq's
ability to build long-range missiles by ``at least a year.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Wilson also noted that those facilities can now build
only short-range missiles _ which are allowed by United Nations
resolutions _ and that, even if there were no airstrikes, it would
take ``a couple of years'' for the Iraqis to convert them to
long-range weapons. He did emphasize that they seem to have
``plans'' to try to make this conversion.

COWBOYS FACE SEASON'S DEFINING MOMENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
``''December is the month that defines the teams that are going to
go on and have success in the playoffs. I think if you are going to
have success in the playoffs, you need to play well in
December.'''' _ Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman on Nov. 30
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman's pre-December
soliloquy has begot cornerback Deion Sanders' pre-Christmas
reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in getting to the playoffs and being able to
turn it on,'' said Sanders, sounding more like the Grinch than Kris
Kringle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to build up to that point. Right now, we are built up
to level of coming right back home in the first round. That's the
way we are playing right now.''
</P>
<P>
   A three-game losing streak _ built on losses the past two weeks
to New Orleans and Kansas City and the Thanksgiving Day setback to
Minnesota _ has redefined the Cowboys (8-6) as more first-round
playoff fodder than the Super Bowl contenders they seemed to be a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now they face what many Cowboys players are calling a must-win
game against the Philadelphia Eagles (3-11) today to finally clinch
the NFC East. More important, a victory could begin the process of
changing the Cowboys' December definition.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys clinched a playoff berth yesterday when Tampa Bay
lost to Washington, 20-16. However, the team's focus isn't on just
qualifying for the playoffs, but on making a lengthy playoff run.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones is calling today's
game as ``big a game as we've had at Texas Stadium in the past two
years.'' He expresses confidence his struggling team can turn it
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not concerned with just getting to the playoffs,'' Jones
said. ``I'm about playing well against the Eagles and playing well
when we get to the playoffs. And we are running out of time to get
to point where we are playing well enough to make a long run in the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys will clinch the NFC East title for the sixth time in
the past seven seasons with a victory today. Or they could back
into the division title with a loss by the second-place Arizona
Cardinals in one of their final two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to do it \Rtoday\S,'' Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin
said. ``Right now we have to concentrate on losing this first deal.
That's the reality of it all. The last thing we want to do is go
into the last game of the season saying we need to win this game to
get where we want to go. We don't want to put ourselves in that
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Aikman's pre-December statement, history shows the
Cowboys can have success in the playoffs without steamrolling teams
before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Cowboys were 2-2 in December, including a 1-2 mark
in their last three games. However, they made it to the NFC title
game. In 1995, the Cowboys won the Super Bowl after going 2-2 in
December.
</P>
<P>
   But, in contrast, the Cowboys were 2-1 in December in 1996 _
with the loss in a give-up season finale in which they sat out most
of the starters to get ready for the playoffs. But they lost in the
divisional round to Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, who called the past few weeks painful, used this history
lesson to revise his position.
</P>
<P>
   ``The season is not lost by any means,'' Aikman said. ``If we go
out and win \Rtoday\S, we are right back where we want to be. We
win the East. We are in the playoffs. And anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Though confident the Cowboys still have reason for hope, Aikman
agrees the faith will ring hollow if the Cowboys don't make a
marked improvement in their play of late _ which has included a
paltry running game, an inability to make a big play in the passing
game, a porous run defense and a nonexistent pass rush.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey has said he is shocked by the recent
difficulties, especially on offense. Running back Emmitt Smith, who
has rushed for 44, 6 and 42 yards in the past three games,
respectively, said the problems blindsided him as well.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, also at a loss for explanation, is taking solace in the
team's experience of playing tough games _ saying that ``just like
it turned bad, we can flip it and make it happen the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will be fine,'' he continued. ``I'm confident we
will have that sense of urgency. It's that Custer thing, the last
stand. Either you stand or sit for a while. But right now, we've
got to get there and win this one game first.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the stakes more ``acute'' against the Eagles, Jones said,
are the questions surrounding the status of Sanders, whose absence
the past three games with a sprained left big toe is considered a
reason for the Cowboys' problems. If they clinch the title against
the Eagles, the Cowboys likely will hold Sanders out of the season
finale against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Having Sanders healthy for the playoffs is partly why Jones is
confident the recent slide has not totally defined his team's
postseason chances.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who is doubtful for the Eagles game, said he is getting
frustrated with ``sitting on the sideline watching us play and
losing games.'' The Cowboys are 0-6 the past two seasons without
Sanders in the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sanders refused to view himself as the savior and said
the Cowboys must not only win the next two games but look good
doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to blame it on the absence of a few players. We
are playing terrible football right now,'' Sanders said. ``It will
help to get some guys back. But we are playing terrible football.
We need to play better. Anything is possible in the playoffs, but
these next two games are important in according to how you are
going to compete in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   And to how the Cowboys will be ultimately defined _ or
redefined.

COWBOYS-EAGLES CAPSULES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COWBOYS (8-6) Can the Cowboys repeat their 34-0 drubbing of the
Eagles on Nov. 2?
</P>
<P>
   A shutout of any team is highly unlikely, even of the Eagles,
who are averaging 10.1 points per game. The Cowboys held the Eagles
to 200 yards of total offense the last time. They had three sacks
and two interceptions in their most dominating performance of the
season. But that was a long time ago. In the midst of a three-game
losing streak, the Cowboys have yielded 100 yards rushing in each
game. They have forced only three turnovers. And they have only
three sacks. The Cowboys don't need to create a whole lot of mayhem
to beat the lowly Eagles. But they will certainly need to make a
big play early to keep the Eagles from gaining momentum.
</P>
<P>
   What are the Cowboys going to do at cornerback?
</P>
<P>
   Much depends on whether Deion Sanders can play. He missed most
of the past week nursing the most famous sprained big toe in the
Fort Worth-Dallas area. Regardless of whether Sanders can play or
not, Kevin Mathis is expected to start at left cornerback. Kevin
Smith, who has returned from a back injury, has normally been the
left cornerback, but the club moved him to right cornerback during
practice last week. Of course, that position is owned by Sanders.
If Sanders plays, he'll line up next to Mathis. If Sanders can't
play, it probably will be Smith at right cornerback and Mathis at
left.
</P>
<P>
   What should we expect from the running game?
</P>
<P>
   This is the one aspect of the Cowboys that has puzzled coach
Chan Gailey. The Cowboys have rushed for 188, 168, 224, 151, 162
and 173 yards this season. They've also had totals of 68, 58, 8 and
51. The latter three totals came in the past three games, so the
Cowboys are definitely on the downside of a trend. In the last
outing against the Eagles, Emmitt Smith had 23 carries for 101
yards. Even though the Cowboys are struggling, it would be an upset
if Smith did not get close to 100 again today. He has rushed for
more yards against the Eagles than any other NFL team.
EAGLES (3-11) How different is the Eagles' offense than the one
that didn't score in the first game against the Cowboys?
</P>
<P>
   The club made Koy Detmer the starter at quarterback in Week 13
and the team is averaging 16.7 points per game. They had averaged
8.4 points per game in the first 11 weeks under Rodney Peete and
Bobby Hoying. Duce Staley replaced Charlie Garner as the starting
running back the week after the Cowboys game and has averaged 80.5
yards per game in his six starts since. Staley, in fact, has become
the club's most consistent offensive weapon. He leads the team in
rushing (901) and receptions (49). The only change the club has
made on the offensive line is replacing left guard Jermane Mayberry
with former Cowboy George Hegamin.
</P>
<P>
   Is Koy Detmer the answer at quarterback?
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles are trying to find out. The former Mission High
School star has started the past three games, throwing five
touchdowns and two interceptions. He has been sacked twice. His
inspired play at Green Bay nearly led the Eagles to an upset
victory. In 11 games, Rodney Peete and Bobby Hoying combined for
two touchdown passes (both by Peete) and 13 interceptions. They
were sacked 52 times. But Eagles coach Ray Rhodes is cautioning
against getting too giddy about Detmer. ``Let's not get too
antsy,'' Rhodes said. ``Let's let him play the season out.''
</P>
<P>
   How bad is it for the Eagles?
</P>
<P>
   At 3-11, the Eagles have their worst record at this point in the
season since they were 2-11-1 in 1972. They have been shutout three
times, 38-0 against Seattle, 34-0 against Dallas and 20-0 against
the Giants. The losses to the Cowboys and Seahawks represented the
first time in NFL history a team suffered two home shutout losses
of at least 30 points or more. The Eagles have scored more than 20
points only once, in a 24-21 loss against Kansas City. The last
time they went a full season without scoring 20 points at least
twice was in 1956.
ONES TO STOP COWBOYS DEFENSIVE TACKLE LEON LETT
</P>
<P>
   He's playing his first full season since 1994 and was selected
to his second Pro Bowl. He has plenty of notches on his belt this
season. In the last game against the Eagles, he had four tackles
and five quarterback pressures. He has tied his career-high with
four sacks this season, seven tackles for loss, and 17 quarterback
pressures. EAGLES WIDE RECEIVER IRVING FRYAR
</P>
<P>
   Fryar is the NFL's seventh all-time leading receiver with 776
receptions, but has struggled this year. The 15-year veteran has
only 40 receptions for 459 yards. But he has scored a touchdown in
each of his past two games, and you can bet he'll want to test a
Cowboys secondary that may include Kevin Mathis and Charlie
Williams.

   ANALYSIS Mike Fisher NFL beat writer
</P>
<P>
   Key Cowboys including Troy Aikman and Daryl Johnston are taking
the lead this week, strongly insisting that no matter what
outsiders think this year's winter freeze on victories is
completely unrelated to last year's winter freeze on victories. OK.
Here's the chance to prove it. A month ago, the Cowboys were 8-3,
with Minnesota next up. Figure a loss there, and then a four-game
season's end featuring have-nots New Orleans, Kansas City,
Philadelphia and Washington. Give the Saints a little credit? Fine.
Give the Chiefs a little credit? Fine. Give the lowly Eagles a
chance to win this game? Better not. Cowboys 24, Eagles 13

<P>
   There is absolutely no way the Cowboys can lose today. Of
course, I felt the same way about the Cowboys in New Orleans and
Kansas City. But this is different, isn't it? The Cowboys are at
home. They are playing another woeful NFC East opponent. And for
the first time in the Chan Gailey era, they are desperate for a
victory. Yeah, they've got injuries. But sometimes, you have to win
because you are the better team. Period. The Cowboys, by far, have
the better team. Cowboys 23, Eagles 3
Clarence E. Hill Jr. Cowboys beat writer
</P>
<P>
   Let's see, the Cowboys beat the Eagles 34-0 the last time. The
Eagles are playing better and the Cowboys are playing worse. Deion
Sanders probably won't play. But the Eagles have nothing to play
for and their coach, Ray Rhodes, is telling everyone that he
deserves to be fired. The NFC East title is on the line for the
Cowboys, who are also motivated to play better because they want to
make a playoff run. Hmmm.

BLUES LOSS IS COYOTES' LOSS, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - St. Louis defenseman Chris Pronger's two-handed slash
to the head of Coyotes assistant captain Jeremy Roenick in the
Blues' 3-2 win Thursday night has proven costly.
</P>
<P>
   But so did a calculated gamble by the Coyotes, as they prepared
to host the New York Islanders today at 1 p.m. in America West
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes, who will try to shake the effects of their first
two-game losing streak of the season against the Islanders, tried
to slip young defenseman Bryan Helmer through waivers for the
purpose of reassigning him to Las Vegas of the IHL, but St. Louis
claimed him on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Colin Campbell, NHL vice president and director of hockey
operations, leveled a four-game suspension on Pronger Saturday for
his slash, which fortunately didn't cause serious damage to
Roenick. In addition to a $1,000 fine, Pronger will lose $66,145.83
in salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Pronger swung his stick in an extremely reckless and
dangerous manner, and his stick made contact with the Phoenix
player's head,'' said Campbell, explaining the penalty.
``Deliberate blows to the head will not be tolerated under any
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the 6-foot-6, 220-pound Pronger decided to use the 6-0,
200-pound Roenick's head for a T-ball remains a question. Roenick
claims he did nothing to incite Pronger, but speculated Pronger
might have grown frustrated by physical play by the Coyotes.
Pronger has refused comment.
</P>
<P>
   Pronger's loss coupled with that of defenseman Chris McAlphine
to injury against the Coyotes, left the Blues thin at the blueline
when Helmer became available.
</P>
<P>
   Helmer, scoreless in 11 games with Phoenix, was thought a
promising prospect when Coyotes General Manager Bobby Smith signed
him as a free agent from the defense-rich New Jersey Devils in
July.
</P>
<P>
   His brief career here was a rollercoaster. He was twice
reassigned to Las Vegas only to be recalled before he ever reached
airport, and once was sent to Las Vegas and recalled the following
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we acquired Bryan we knew he would be up and down all
year,'' Smith said. ``To guarantee we would have him we would have
had to keep him with us all year, which we weren't willing to do.
St. Louis claimed him and that's the way it goes. We didn't want to
lose him. It's a chance you have to take sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like our top five defensemen (Teppo Numminen, Jyrki Lumme,
Keith Carney, Oleg Tverdovsky and Gerald Diduck), and with Deron
Quint and Jason Doig, we feel we have to young players who can give
us a sixth defenseman and an excellent defensive corps.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes are merely dropping by home today for a game against
a suddenly redhot opponent and a change of clothes. After today's
game, they play their next three on the road at Detroit, Chicago
and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   They have played eight of their last nine games on the road,
going 3-3-2 away from America West, and were noticeably leg weary
when their Eastern Canadian road swing ended in St. Louis Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's was a tiring and hard road trip,'' Smith said. ``We
didn't play as well as we have at other parts of the season. We
missed our jump in the first periods, even in the win at Ottawa. We
were fortunate Nikolai Khabibulin played an excellent game there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to get it back again. It might be we're
paying a price right now for the earlier part of our season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes two straight losses have come with Captain Keith
Tkachuk sidelined with a groin straight. Tkachuk was on the ice for
Saturday's light workout at the Ice Den and thinks he will play
against the Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   But to cover his bases, Smith recalled left wing Louie DeBrusk
Saturday from Las Vegas, where he registered three goals and nine
points and a staggering 153 penalty minutes in 23 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders are trying to complete their four-game road trip
unbeaten. They whipped San Jose 1-0 and the Los Angeles King 5-4 in
overtime, then battled to an overtime tie with Anaheim Friday
night. &QL;

FREE AGENTS MIGHT HAVE TO LOWER SIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sentiment is growing around the NHL that player salaries
actually may stay at a semi-reasonable plateau when this summer's
batch of unrestricted free agents searches for gold.
</P>
<P>
   Too many clubs are reporting huge financial losses and simply
won't be able to keep raising the salary bar every year. Only the
handful of market-rich teams, led by the free-spending New York
Rangers, will continue to make gluttons of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   That can't be good news for free agents such as Calgary's
 &UR; Theo Fleury, the Rangers'  &UR; Brian Leetch, Colorado's  &UR; Patrick Roy
and Montreal's  &UR; Vincent Damphousse. Or for the next talent tier of
players such as the Coyotes' hard-working  &UR; Bob Corkum, a Selke
Trophy candidate this season as the league's top defensive forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the offers are going to be less and fewer this
summer,'' Carolina Hurricanes General Manager  &UR; Jim Rutherford said,
``because we're all at the point where our payrolls are out of
whack.''
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at what has happened in Anaheim, where the
Disney-owned Mighty Ducks are expected to lose money _ probably
about $8 million _ for the first time in their history. Their
payroll has increased to $31.5 million from $25.5 million a year
ago and $16.5 million in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an industry, our revenues are not catching up the inflation
of salaries to the point where most teams, the great majority of
teams, are losing significant amounts of money, and we are now one
of them,'' said  &UR; Pierre Gauthier, Ducks president and general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Glen Sather, general manager for the financially burdened
Edmonton Oilers, said last week's trade sending  &UR; Chris Gratton, who
received a $9 million signing bonus, from Philadelphia back to
Tampa Bay is an example of what may come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really hope this changes things,'' Sather said. ``These guys
blow their brains out on a long shot and every time there's a
signing like this, everyone in the league suffers.'' &QL; 
The Ironmen &QL; 
Coyotes defenseman  &UR; Teppo Numminen said he was sad to see
 &UR; Mark &UR; Recchi's iron man streak end this past weekend. After playing
in 570 consecutive games, which had been the longest active streak
in the NHL, Recchi sat out his second straight game Monday against
the Coyotes because of lingering effects from pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the game. The healthier you can be and the less
games you miss, the better you are,'' said Numminen, who will play
in his 242nd straight regular season game today against the
visiting New York Islanders. ``It's too bad his streak had to end,
but sooner or later, it happens to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Numminen, who hasn't missed a game since the 1995-96 season,
doesn't think anyone will catch Recchi.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing. To go through that long with nothing
happening?'' Numminen said. ``It's really great. I don't think
that's going to happen again for a long, long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's  &UR; Rod Brind-Amour is the new leader with 433
consecutive games.  &UR; Doug Jarvis, now an assistant coach with the
Dallas Stars, holds the NHL record with 964 straight games. Former
Roadrunners Coach  &UR; Garry Unger, the former record holder, is second
with 914.
</P>
<P>
   Blake's mistake &QL; 
Imagine  &UR; Rob Blake's disappointment after drawing a three-game
suspension for slashing Vancouver's  &UR; Harry York last week in his
first game back from missing a month because of a broken foot.
Blake called the suspension ``a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to whack his stick and at the last second, he reached
out for the puck,'' Blake said. ``I don't think it was that bad,
but he went down like he was shot.''
</P>
<P>
   York suffered a minor bruise, but that's all. Blake, meanwhile,
was forced to forfeit $82,304 of his $5.3 million salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to say it was a baseball swing,'' Kings Coach
 &UR; Larry Robinson said. ``If that's a baseball swing, he must be
hitting singles.'' &QL; 
Goalie for hire &QL; 
The Calgary Flames have been battling a war of attrition with their
netminders. Veteran  &UR; Ken Wregget has been out for two months
because of back spasms. Last weekend, rookie No. 1  &UR; Tyler Moss went
down because of a groin injury. Their top goalie in the minors,
 &UR; Igor Karpenko, also is hurt.
</P>
<P>
   That left them with youngster  &UR; Jean-Sebastien Giguere, a rookie
who routinely gets dehydrated and vomits before and sometimes
``during'' games. Such was the case last Saturday in Florida, when
Giguere got sick during the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Coach  &UR; Brian Sutter, who recalled another rookie, 20-year-old
 &UR; Tyron Garner, all the way from Oshawa in the juniors as an
emergency backup, was seeing red. He purposely kept trainer  &UR; Terry
Kane from running out on the ice to check on Giguere, who was
doubled over in the crease. But he finally relented, albeit with a
message for Kane to deliver to Giguere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told TK, `First of all, leave him in there. And second of
all, tell him to suck it up and do something about it,' '' Sutter
said. ``The greatest goalie that ever played the game,  &UR; Glenn Hall,
used to get sick before every game, every night, every period.'' &QL;

BASS TOURNAMENTS CAN BE HARMFUL TO FISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Bass fishing tournaments create their own problems
during the winter and summer months.
</P>
<P>
   The tournaments are no-kill operations; the goal is to release
the bass back into the lakes. Catch bass, weigh them in and return
them to the lake. It's an admirable goal, but it often doesn't
happen.
</P>
<P>
   In the winter, bass go deep. They often are caught in 60 feet of
water. When they are brought up, their float or swim bladders _ the
things that help them stabilize and operate in the water _ fill
with air from the rapid rise from the depths. They float on the
surface, belly up, and often die. It's something like nitrogen
narcosis, or the bends, which affects humans when they are brought
to the surface from great depths without decompression.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer, when night tournaments are prevalent, the bass
sometimes die from lack of oxygen in faulty live wells. The live
wells in bass boats pump air into the water but sometimes don't
inject enough to keep fish alive. Stress kills the fish.
</P>
<P>
   Fish brought from great depths are a problem addressed by
tournament sponsors. Hypodermic needles are used to penetrate their
swim bladders and release the air, supposedly allowing the bass to
adjust to the rapid rise in depth.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Jim Warnecke, fish program manager for the
Arizona Game and Fish Department in the Mesa region, the swollen
bladders are only one of many problems bass suffer when brought up
quickly from deep water.
</P>
<P>
   Warnecke cited an article in ``In-Fisherman'' magazine that
quoted a study by two researchers from California Polytechnic State
University who tested bass in a simulator in depths from 30, 60 and
90 feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   The fish suffered from expanded bladders, external hemorrhaging
and ruptured stomach tissues at all three simulated depths. Fish
tested at 60 to 90 feet also bled internally, and some suffered
from popped-out eyes and everted stomachs.
</P>
<P>
   When raised from 30 feet, about 25 percent of the bass died
after a delay of one or two days. When raised from 60 to 90 feet,
more than 40 percent died within a few hours. Hemorrhaging and gas
bubbles in the blood apparently were more dangerous than bladder
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Bass under 10 inches were more likely to die than larger fish.
</P>
<P>
   Warnecke said the study proved that bass caught at depths
greater than 60 feet shouldn't be released because of a poor
survival rate. Internal damage kills the fish.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the fish caught in 35-40 feet can be released
successfully, although a hypodermic needle might not be the best
method of releasing air from the bladder; it could puncture organs
and vessels. That method also does nothing to reduce the gas
bubbles in the blood that can cause blockages in the heart and
other organs.
</P>
<P>
   Warnecke wrote that the preferred alternative is to recompress
bass by lowering them to at least 33 feet without puncturing the
swim bladder. This reduces the size of the bladder by half and
squeezes the air bubbles from the blood.
</P>
<P>
   The method is to use an inverted metal or weighted plastic milk
crate at the end of a 40-foot rope. Take the fish to 40 feet or
more of water and place three to five floating bass in the crate.
Lower the fish to at least 33 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Don't puncture the bladder. It's not necessary. The fish will
right themselves at that depth and swim out of the crate. The bass
will have a greater chance of survival.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't science wonderful? &QL;

REDSKINS OPEN DOOR FOR CARDS

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Thanks to an assist from the Washington Redskins, the
Cardinals are a third of the way home to ending the NFL's longest
playoff drought.
</P>
<P>
   They will clinch their first playoff berth since moving to
Arizona and first since 1982 if they beat the New Orleans Saints
today at Sun Devil Stadium and if the Kansas City Chiefs beat or
tie the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins' 20-16, come-from-behind victory over Tampa Bay
gives the Cardinals (7-7) a half-game lead over the Buccaneers
(7-8) for the NFC's third and last wild card playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great the Skins won, but we have to handle our
business,'' offensive tackle James Dexter said. ``We've just got to
go out and win. We beat the Saints and take care of the Chargers
next week, that's it. We don't have to worry about anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington's victory left the Giants (6-8) still in the playoff
hunt. They would win any tiebreaker over the Cardinals because they
swept the season series.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints (6-8) also remain in the race. They would earn a
berth by winning their final two games. They would have victories
over the Cardinals and Buccaneers and a better NFC record than the
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's playoff hopes are slim as the result of the loss.
The Buccaneers need to win, to have the Cardinals lose twice or to
have the winner of today's Cards-Saints game to lose its regular
season finale.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's victory Saturday clinched NFC playoff berths for
Dallas (8-6) and Green Bay (9-5). The Cowboys need to win one of
their final two games to clinch the NFC East title. &QL;

&HT;        PA LAWMAKERS MIRROR CONGRESS IN VOTES TO IMPEACH CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service, 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Dec. 19, -- Pennsylvania Republican Congress members
voted to impeach President Clinton, despite protest from embattled
Democrats in the state delegation, who walked out briefly with
their party in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Mirroring Congress, lawmakers from the state voted essentially
along party lines to impeach President Clinton for obstruction of
justice and lying under oath about his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky. Rep. Chaka Fattah, D-Philadelphia started the tumultuous
day by speaking out against character assassination-style politics.
His remarks followed Speaker-designate Bob Livingston's resignation
at the heels of admitting extra-marital affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing is the politics of personal destruction,''
Fattah said. ``How many other speakers have to resign? It is an
example of the hatred that eats at the Republican party that led us
to this impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Philadelphia, who voted to impeach Clinton,
said it was as a ``sad day for the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a difficult day for me and my colleagues,'' Weldon
said. ``I am not convinced that the President's act of perjury mean
that he should be removed from office.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he believes under the constitution, the House of
Representatives does not have the power to censure a president.
</P>
<P>
   Fattah was joined by Reps. Bob Borski, D-Philadelphia, John
Murtha, D-Johnstown, and Bob Brady, D-Philadelphia, when members of
the party walked out after Republican House leaders denied
considering a censure alternative to impeachment. The Democrats
streamed outside the Capitol and walked in front of onlookers,
cheering visitors and television cameras. Shortly after that, they
returned to the House floor to vote on the articles of impeachment.
``It was the only way to visually show our displeasure,'' Fattah
said. ``Many from our state delegation joined me out there.'' With
one member bucking party lines, several remaining undecided until
the final hour, and others adhering fiercely to party loyalty,
Pennsylvania's delegation became a cross-section of Congress in the
impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, outgoing Rep. Paul McHale, D-Lehigh Valley, who
was the first Democrat in the House of Representatives to call for
the resignation of the president, said the right thing was done for
the nation. ``The system worked today as our founding fathers
intended,'' said McHale, who voted for impeachment. ``On a personal
level, I'm drained. I voted for Clinton twice. I had few policy
differences with him. Had he admitted what he had done and come
forward with it, I would have perhaps voted differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Bud Shuster, R-Everett, supported impeachment for the second
time in his Congressional career.
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman Congress member in 1974, Shuster intended to vote
to impeach Republican President Richard Nixon, had he not resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty four years later, Shuster, who waited until the last
minute to make up his mind, voted to impeach Clinton. ``[This] I
believe demonstrates my belief that a constitutional issue of this
gravity should not be decided on a partisan basis,'' Shuster said.

PLAYOFF MENTALITY: NEW ADDITIONS GIVE CARDS NEW ATTITUDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Larry Centers has seen all manner of mug, pug and
thug parade through the locker room. Many, he believed, had no
business wearing Cardinals red.
</P>
<P>
   Centers, a fullback in his ninth Cardinals season who became the
team's all-time pass receiving leader last week, was not crushed to
see them go. He is among the few who has stayed, or been allowed to
stay, through a succession of deeply depressing seasons to the
brink of hope.
</P>
<P>
   A Cardinals win today over New Orleans and a New York Giants
loss or tie will put the Cardinals into the playoffs for the first
time in a non-strike season since 1975, ending the longest drought
in the NFL. If the Cardinals win today but don't clinch a playoff
spot, the Cardinals will secure a berth with another victory at
home next Sunday over San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   That's new ground for this young team. Forty-five players on the
53-man roster have been acquired during the past three years.
Twenty-eight were not yet in the league when Vince Tobin became
coach in 1996. And 12 players have some sort of playoff experience.
Those players know what it takes to have a playoff mentality.
</P>
<P>
   Centers is at once grateful that the newcomers have put the
playoffs finally within reach and bitter that it took so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can definitely blame them,'' Centers said of some Cardinals
players past. ``We're paid to give 100 percent. When you see
someone fail to give it, you have to question if they're
professional. It's a cancer on your team. It eats at the fiber of
your team.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody on the roster has appeared in a postseason game as a
Cardinal, and only 12 have been there with other teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I think experience is overrated,'' said
receiver/return specialist Eric Metcalf, who as a rookie in 1989
returned a kickoff for a touchdown that lifted the Cleveland Browns
to a playoff win over Buffalo. ``Even if you've been there, you
still have to make plays, and we have lots of guys on this team who
can do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This situation reminds me of my rookie year because we had to
win out to go to the playoffs. We just got prepared to play and we
played. That's all we have to do here, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The team has grown up quickly, Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their mental approach is more mature,'' Tobin said. ``Each
time that you are in a situation where you have to win, you mature
a bit. Really, it was the same stakes last week at Philadelphia.
This game is every bit as important to New Orleans as is to us.
We'll both be playing extremely hard to get that last playoff
spot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saints (6-8) are out of the race if they lose. If they win,
their record will be the same as the Cardinals (7-7) going into the
final week. The Saints would hold the tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having been here eight years,'' said Aeneas Williams, the
five-time Cardinals Pro Bowl cornerback, ``I don't know if I could
express what it means to me in terms of our opportunity this
weekend. It's overwhelming. We realize we have the opportunity to
do something this team hasn't done since I've been here. Our motto
this week can't be `We want it,' but `We have to have it.' This is
an opportunity we can't afford to let slip by.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if New Orleans is big-game proven, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a young football team, and probably by design,'' Saints
Coach Mike Ditka said. ``I'd rather be young and rambunctious and
take my chances. I have coaches even on my staff who say we need
more experience. You get experience by playing. You can't say
you'll draft a kid and he will be ready in two years. He won't be
ready in two years unless he plays. He may make mistakes, but
talent and enthusiasm can overcome experience.''
</P>
<P>
   That thought was echoed by Terry Bradshaw, a Fox TV analyst who
quarterbacked Pittsburgh to four Super Bowl titles in the 1970s.
Bradshaw suffered through a 5-9 record as a rookie in 1970 and 6-8
his second season. In his third, Bradshaw and a strong defensive
front took the Steelers to the AFC championship game with an 11-3
mark. Two years later, the Steelers won the first of their four
Super Bowls during the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were young, but so what?'' Bradshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradshaw said the young guys became believers when they opened
1972 with a win over Oakland, followed at midseason by another big
one over Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be an established team to beat one,''
Bradshaw said. ``But once you do, then you get everybody believing,
and that's the point the Cardinals need to get to next.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals aren't to be confused with the Steelers at the
dawning of their championship era. The only similarity so far is
that the group has struggled through its initial two seasons
together. None of the Cardinals' seven victories this year is over
a winning team. And their foe today isn't to be confused with the
Raiders or Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   But in scale, the stakes for the Cardinals approximate those
described by Bradshaw that put the Steelers over the hump. Like the
Steelers, the Cardinals are built around a promising young
quarterback, Jake Plummer, and a potentially dominating defensive
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like everybody is focusing and getting ready to move
on to the next level,'' said Lomas Brown, the seven-time Pro Bowl
left tackle who went to the playoffs while with Detroit. ``I think
they're handling it well considering it's a group of guys that has
never been in this situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was going through it the first time, the most
eye-opening thing to me was the tempo and the intensity that guys
play with. It's now at the point where they look at it as it's
either you or me. That's the attitude they take out there with
them. You see a lot more cutting.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals backup middle linebacker Mark Maddox, who was on three
Super Bowl teams with Buffalo, said he is encouraged by the change
he has seen in the locker room since training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``What matters is not the age of the players, but that we have
played 14 games together and we have grown,'' Maddox said. ``When
you look at where we are compared with where we started, we have
come a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Devlin, who played with Maddox in the Super Bowl at
Buffalo, said this team has one vital characteristic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hungry,'' Devlin said. ``If you've never been there and
you don't have a lot of guys who've been there, the one thing
you've got to be is hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   Devlin said his teammates should relish this opportunity. He
recalls his in the Super Bowl as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just remember trying to take in every little thing because I
didn't know if it was ever going to happen again _ knowing
everybody's watching, the excitement, being one of the first guys
out there on the kickoff return team,'' Devlin said. ``I was on the
wedge. The ball was in the air, and I didn't even hear a thing it
was so loud. Just little things like that, if you never experience
it, you never know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we can get there, then it's going to have a snowball
effect. To me, that's why this game so pivotal. This is like a
playoff game. That game we played against Dallas was sort of like
that. To me, this should be 10 times better than that. This is the
kind of game that turns around franchises. This is the kind of game
that gets teams on that 10-year streak, in my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   While some teammates know the feeling, Centers and other
Cardinals long-timers can only imagine it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Words really can't explain how good the feeling would be once
the playoff berth becomes a reality,'' Centers said. ``We don't
have enough time to tell you what it would mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the ups and downs, the ins and outs around here, the
disappointing days. Weeks. Months. Years. After all those, going to
the playoffs would be the most special thing in my career. In
reality, the final three weeks of our season have been playoff
time, and we have gained the mentality that we need to carry us
over the hump.''

HUNTER HAS KEPT HIS TROOPS IN LINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Billy Hunter can spew obtuse phrases like ``escrow
tax,'' and ``BRI'' with the best of them. And he does. But scrape
away all the lawyer-speak and finance mechanism double-talk, and
the director of the NBA players' union is, at his core, the one
thing his clients needed most:
</P>
<P>
   A politician.
</P>
<P>
   History will show Hunter failed in his lone foray into
professional politics _ an unsuccessful attempt in 1990 to unseat
Oakland Congressman Ron Dellums. But as the appointed figurehead of
430 NBA players, Hunter has proven to be an adept leader of a
complex constituency.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-year-old former U.S. attorney has done exactly what his
opponent, NBA Commissioner David Stern, presumed couldn't be done:
maintained the unity of his troops _ from the superstars to the
scrubs, the $33 million franchise player down to the $272,000 12th
man.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Hunter has so far protected the financial gains of
NBA players _ and protracted the league's lockout. How you judge
those results depends on your point of view.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing is certain: season or no season, good deal or bad,
Hunter has become a force equal to Stern in the basketball
marketplace and has justified his rank as the 40th most powerful
person in sports in a recent magazine poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has great political skills, the players respect him, he's
an ex-athlete, he's quite eloquent, he's tough, he's a no-nonsense
kind of guy,'' says agent Marc Fleisher. ``The vibe I'm getting
from players is they're willing to stand shoulder to shoulder with
him and fight the fight, which is something a number of us were not
sure of early on.''
</P>
<P>
   That shoulder-to-shoulder stance is the players' greatest
leverage in this $2 billion standoff. United they profit; divided,
they'd settle for less.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter knew this when he took the job in 1996. A battle-tested
lawyer who once represented the tobacco industry, Hunter was a
newcomer to labor negotiations. But as a one-time agent to former
rap stars Hammer and Bobby Brown, he knew the power held by the
paid talent.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the talent was a group of 400-plus athletes, so he
began his term by logging frequent-flier miles. Like any
politician, he needed to kiss some babies to win support.
</P>
<P>
   So Hunter visited all 28 NBA cities to meet with players, many
of whom felt burned by former director Simon Gourdine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent two years developing trust among my players and
proving that I could do the job in a competent and professional
manner,'' Hunter says. ``My only agenda was to demonstrate that I
was available to them.... When I go into a locker room, I talk to
every guy. I don't just go to the superstars. Everybody is
important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years and one lockout ago, things were different.
Superstars fought union leaders, powerful agents like David Falk
led a drive to decertify the players' association. Gourdine, a
former NBA attorney, was viewed with distrust by players.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the deal signed by players and owners under that
cloud in 1995 proved just as problematic as many feared. Top player
salaries skyrocketed _ Shaquille O'Neal got $121 over seven years,
unproven Kevin Garnett got $126 million, Michael Jordan began
signing one-year deals in excess of $30 million per season _ but
the middle class disappeared as one-fourth of the union's members
signed minimum-salary deals.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's job, then, combined impossible elements: protect the
gains of the superstars and restore the middle class at the same
time, all the while somehow meeting the concerns of NBA owners, who
were spending themselves into a ditch.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tall order for someone negotiating his first collective
bargaining agreement, but Hunter has never shied away from a
challenge. Or an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager growing up in Cherry Hill, N.J., Hunter attended
a school with fewer than 20 other African-Americans and a handful
of Jews. His circle of friends included both, and that coalition of
minorities was sometimes forced to protect its honor the
old-fashioned way _ in fistfights with less-progressive white
students.
</P>
<P>
   In his professional life, Hunter proved just as aggressive. He
prosecuted surviving members of the Jim Jones cult 20 years ago and
helped convince President Jimmy Carter to pardon Patricia Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in private practice in Oakland, Hunter represented R.J.
Reynolds and Philip Morris as a member of the tobacco industry's
litigation team.
</P>
<P>
   But he also donated his time to friends and neighbors and sought
out public service, traveling around the world on trade missions
for the Oakland Port Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think I'm an eclectic person,'' Hunter says with a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing, it would seem, could sufficiently prepare Hunter
for his next career move, leaving private practice to become the
figurehead for perhaps the richest labor union in the known
universe.
</P>
<P>
   But as in the past, Hunter has been tireless in pursuit of his
clients' interests. That has meant seven-day work weeks, heading
home at 11 p.m. some nights, traveling a week or two each month to
visit players and no vacation in 2{ years, save the occasional long
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing short of that would suffice, though. Unlike Stern, whose
clientele is limited to 29 owners, Hunter's employer has 430
mouths. Add several dozen agents on top of that, all with opinions
and interests of their own, and you wonder if Hunter's reported
$675,000 salary is perhaps insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter has taken his share of abuse. He's viewed by the public
as the apologist for the greedy '90s athlete, by many NBA officials
as a tool of agent David Falk and by some of his own constituents
as beholden to the superstars.
</P>
<P>
   There have been chinks in Hunter's armor of unity.
Lower-salaried players and a handful of agents have taken
occasional shots at union leadership. Former union presidents from
Bob Cousy to Isiah Thomas have become outspoken critics.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter is unfazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are guys who are employed by the league (as TV
commentators),'' he said of Cousy and Thomas. ``They've been sent
out to do the bidding of the owners.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering players have lost $400 million to date, one might
expect widespread mutiny by now. But within current player ranks,
voices of dissent have been few even as the season nears possible
cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy Hunter has done a masterful job of keeping 400 guys
unified,'' said agent Steve Woods, but the compliments end there.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, perhaps the union's most vocal critic, said Hunter spent
time unifying players when he should have been learning the
league's finances and forging relationships with Stern and NBA
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's strategy, Woods said, is fatally flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unity that exists with the NBA players right now exists
upon a phantom platform of rhetoric, divisiveness and ignorance of
the facts,'' he charged, predicting, ``this is (Hunter's) first and
last sports labor negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other critics of the union, Woods argues that Hunter's
leadership has sacrificed the interests of the lower-salaried
players while alienating owners and killing the storied
``partnership'' forged by Stern and players 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baloney,'' counters Fleisher, the agent and son of former
union director Larry Fleisher. ``Total baloney. The only way the
players ever got anything was from one of three ways: litigation,
the threat of striking the playoffs and All-Star Game and the
threat of decertification.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which, of course, requires a unified front.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter has had his missteps, including failed litigation and
labor grievances this summer which only delayed negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But he's proven Stern's equal in the art of the deal. When Stern
ordered team executives to contact and lobby their players, Hunter
fired off memos and phone calls to make sure they heard the union's
version.
</P>
<P>
   And when Stern late last week overnight-mailed a nine-page
contract proposal directly to players, circumventing Hunter, the
union responded quickly with a 19-page retort and analysis that
also went straight to the membership.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's letter picked apart Stern's appeal section by section
and in typical Hunter fashion, he used the opportunity to rally the
troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason (the owners) have not been able to completely
impose their will upon us,'' he wrote, ``is because the players
have stayed strong through several missed paychecks, and shown once
and for all that we will stand up for our principles, even if it
involves sacrificing the season.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that last part, about the canceled season, that worries
players most. It's not just the $1 billion in lost salaries. It's
the long-term effects. And the backlash. Players already are losing
the public relations battle in this war, and they will be the ones
blamed if the season _ and the league _ goes into the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, the former advocate for Big Tobacco, is thus in familiar
territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know everyone is not going to like what I do,'' he says.
``I'm not trying to win any kind of contests where I've gotta have
people liking me. What I have to do is make sure my constituents
are happy with the job I'm doing. To quote Harry Truman, `If you
can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.' ''

 &HT;    Clinton impeached; Senate to decide final fate
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett and Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House of Representatives, riven with partisan
anger and stunned by the sudden resignation Speaker-elect Bob
Livingston (R-La.), impeached President Clinton Saturday for ``high
crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton became only the second president in the nation's history
to be impeached, setting the stage for a Senate trial that the
country has not seen in 130 years. Clinton's fate now rests with
the 100 members of the Senate who can convict the president and
expel him from office with a two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
   Showing no signs of giving up, Clinton stood shoulder to
shoulder with Democrats at the White House following the vote and
vowed to continue his work as commander in chief until ``the last
hour of the last day'' of his presidency. He later announced the
the bombing in Iraq was over.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Democratic leaders continued to press for a
punishment short of impeachment, such as censure. But Senate
majority leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) signaled the Senate would take
the initial step of swearing Senators under oath to ``do impartial
justice according the Constitution,'' the first step of an
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing (of a trial) will depend greatly on the president
and lawyers,'' Lott said in a statement following the House's
historic vote. Lott pledged to attend to the ``people's business''
during the prelude to any impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's vote unfolded in an atmosphere drama, bitterness and
solemnity. Livingston shocked colleagues by announcing his
resignation only days after admitting to extramarital affairs, and
challenged Clinton to follow his example.
</P>
<P>
   Minority leader Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.) pleaded one last time for
a House vote on censuring the president and called for an end to
the ``politics of personal destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to stop destroying imperfect people at the alter of an
unattainable morality,'' Gephardt said. ``We are now rapidly
descending into a politics where life imitates farce, fratricide
dominates our public debate and America is held hostage to the
tactics of smear and fear.''
</P>
<P>
   But Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) warned members not to
confuse ``private acts of infidelity'' with public acts of
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the chief executive trivializes the oath, justice is
wounded, you are wounded and our children are wounded,'' said Hyde,
moments before the House proceeded toward the vote. ``Follow your
conscience and you will have served your country.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans defeated a procedural motion that would have forced
vote on censure, prompting Democrats to stage a brief walk out,
before proceeding to a vote of the four articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Voting almost entirely on party lines, the Republican-controlled
House voted to impeach Clinton on two separate counts for lying to
a federal grand jury and obstructing justice in independent counsel
Ken Starr's investigation of Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The House defeated two other articles charging that Clinton
perjured himself in Paula Jones's sexual harassment lawsuit and
lied to Congress in his written response to questions about his
testimony. Article two was defeated 229 to 205. Article four was
defeated 285 to 148.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the House completed voting, Hyde and other
Republican leaders carried the two approved articles from the House
side of the Capitol to the secretary of the Senate, there to await
action by the Senate in early January.
</P>
<P>
   The articles were written on parchment and tucked inside two
blue binders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very sad day, but it shows our Democratic process
works,'' Hyde said just before the procession to the Senate began.
``And I think we are strong enough to handle the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost simultaneously, House Democrats traveled en masse up
Pennsylvania Avenue to attend a rally at the White House and stand
shoulder to shoulder with Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared outside the White House after the vote, looking
haggard but showing no signs that he will heed GOP calls to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the American people to know today that I am still
committed to working with people of good faith and good will of
both parties to do what's best for our country, to bring our nation
together, to lift our people up, to move us all forward together,''
Clinton said. ``It's what I've tried to do for six years. It's what
I intend to do for two more until the last hour of the last day of
my term.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the final votes were tallied, Democrats and
Republicans began arguing the outcome of a potential Senate trial.
Democrats argued that the defeat of the second impeachment article,
alleging Clinton lied in his Jones deposition, weakened the overall
case against the president because the evidence that Clinton lied
was strongest in the second article.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loss of article two puts a big hole in the case,'' said
Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), a member of the Judiciary Committee.
``That is very significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton still, however, must contend with seven allegations that
he obstructed justice by influencing the testimony of his personal
secretary and trying to silence Lewinsky with help in securing her
a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence is overwhelming and substantial,'' said Rep.
Steve Buyer (R-Ind.), who along with Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) will
serve as House prosecutors in the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, Buyer and the 11 ``floor managers,'' or prosecutors, said
they will push the Senate hard to conduct a trial and not drop the
impeachment articles.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats, meanwhile, signaled that they will pursue the
censure alternative. Republicans outnumber Democrats in the Senate
55 to 45.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be several points early in the Senate proceedings
when the Senate could choose to substitute a strong censure
resolution,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.). ``If that does not
happen, we are headed for a difficult and lengthy trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said Clinton's
actions merited ``serious punishment,'' but said the president
should not resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot allow any president, Republican or Democrat, to be
forced from office by a party line vote in the House,'' Daschle
said. ``In America, the president serves at the will of the people,
not the pleasure of the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Three House members _ Reps. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), Jim
Bunning (R-Ky.) and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) _ will have the
opportunity to also vote in the Senate, having been elected
senators of their respective states. Schumer voted against all four
articles, while Bunning and Crapo both voted for.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, only five Democrats _ all but four from the South _
broke ranks to vote for the two articles of impeachment ultimately
adopted by the House. The Democrats were Reps. Ralph Hall and
Charlie Stenholm of Texas, Gene Taylor of Mississippi, Virgil Goode
of Virginia and Paul McHale of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   On the article dealing with grand jury perjury, which passed 228
to 206, only five Republicans voted against impeachment:
Christopher Shays of Connecticut, Peter King and Amo Houghton of
New York, Connie Morella of Maryland and Mark Souder of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   On the article dealing with obstruction of justice, 12
Republicans voted no. That article passed with only a five-vote
majority, 221-212, meaning that it would have failed if no
Democrats had defected.
</P>
<P>
   President Andrew Johnson was the first and only other president
ever impeached in 1868. He was acquitted in the Senate when
Senators failed by one vote to convict him with the necessary
two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
   President Nixon resigned before articles of impeachment voted by
the House Judiciary Committee reached the full House for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Although they fought bitterly over the fairness of the House
proceeding and the ultimate votes, Democrats and Republicans
appeared to share many of the same feelings of sadness and
solemnity that accompanied the historic vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no cheers when the 218 was hit,'' said Rep. Jim
Leach (R-Iowa), referring to the point at which the first
impeachment article officially carried. ``I don't think there is a
single member who didn't understand the solemnity of this event.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.), from Clinton's home state of
Arkansas, said he took ``a deep breath'' before he cast his first
vote to impeach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not respectful of our Constitution,'' said Rep. Bill
Delahunt (D-Mass.), a judiciary committee member, after the vote.
``History will look with disdain on what happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad day,'' said Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) ``It's a
day of idiocy. I've never seen a deliberative body act in such a
bizarre way.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Robert Livingston, who rocked the House on
Thursday with his revelation that he had had adulterous affairs,
stunned the Capitol again Saturday by saying that he would not
serve as speaker and would quit Congress in six months.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans moved swiftly to fill the leadership vacuum and by
Saturday night, Rep. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, an affable
conservative who is perceived as a pragmatist, was the
all-but-acclaimed successor.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston jolted his colleagues, standing in the well of the
House he has served for two decades and outlining his reasons why
he would vote to impeach President Clinton, when he veered
unexpectedly into calling on the president to resign. This drew
boos and catcalls from Democrats who shouted that he should quit
instead.
</P>
<P>
   He then did just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was prepared to lead our narrow majority as speaker, and I
believe I had it in me to do a fine job,'' he said. ``But I cannot
do that job or be the kind of leader that I would like to be under
the current circumstances. So I must set the example that I hope
President Clinton will follow. I will not stand for speaker of the
House on Jan. 6.''
</P>
<P>
   The move was so unexpected that it momentarily eclipsed, at
least in the House, both the vote to impeach the president, which
had seemed inevitable for days, and the bombing in Iraq, which was
deemed so momentous this week that the House postponed its vote on
impeachment until Saturday. Members were reeling from sensory
overload as they staggered off the House floor in between the four
impeachment votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been so many bombshells,'' said Rep. Michael
Castle, a Delaware Republican. ``We have bombshells in Baghdad and
we have bombshells in the House of Representatives. You can't turn
your back for 10 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Members were surprised not only by Livingston's gesture but by
its timing, leaving the Republicans and the House with no leader in
the midst of a process that could result in the removal of the
president from office. The speaker is second in line to the
presidency after the vice president. Next in line is the president
pro tempore of the Senate, who at the moment is Sen. Strom
Thurmond, the 96-year-old Republican from South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the impeachment debate sought quickly to exploit
Livingston's resignation. Republicans who favored impeaching
Clinton pointed to Livingston as an example of courage and said the
president should likewise put the country first and resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understood what this debate was all about _ it's about
honor and decency and integrity and the truth,'' said Rep. Tom
DeLay, the majority whip.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, fearing that Livingston's resignation could escalate
calls for Clinton to quit too, immediately pleaded with Livingston
to reconsider and cast him as a good man destroyed by a savage
system.
</P>
<P>
   In a stirring speech applauded even by Republicans, Rep. Dick
Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, praised Livingston as
a ``worthy, good and honorable man'' and said his resignation was a
grave mistake. ``It's a terrible capitulation to the negative
political forces that are consuming our political system and our
country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerry Nadler, Democrat of New York, said of the
resignation: ``It is a surrender to a developing sexual
McCarthyism. Are we going to have a new test if someone wants to
run for public office _ are you now or have you ever been an
adulterer?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the president would follow Livingston's example, Joe
Lockhart, Clinton's spokesman, said: ``The president is going to do
what's in the best interest of the country. It would be wrong to
give in to this insidious politics of personal destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert began lobbying on the House floor within moments of
Livingston's resignation. By late afternoon, Hastert had the public
backing of the current leadership, including Reps. Dick Armey and
DeLay of Texas and Newt Gingrich, the current speaker. About 100
members, including conservatives like Steve Largent of Oklahoma and
a few moderates like Castle, declared their support for him
Saturday night after he assured them that he had no skeletons in
his closet.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's decision was so sudden that even Hastert, according
to aides, did not know of his plans when he left the Capitol at 11
p.m. Friday.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Leaders were eager to fend off fears that a leadership shakeup,
following several weeks of upheaval after the disappointing Nov. 3
midterm elections, would further destabilize the Republicans as
they try to control the House with the slimmest majority in years.
</P>
<P>
   By evening, Rep. Christopher Cox of California had decided not
to challenge Hastert for the speakership. In a sign of the
Republicans' division, the party could not even agree when to pick
a new speaker. At a closed meeting shortly after the impeachment
votes were counted, 60 Republicans voted to hold a new election for
speaker on Tuesday; 61 voted to hold it Jan. 5, a day before
Congress returns and was to install Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   Most members left town with no intention of returning before
January, but leadership aides said that Hastert had the speakership
``wrapped up.'' Technically, Gingrich remains speaker until Jan. 6,
but he has folded his tent and removed removed himself from the
daily operations of the House.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, the No. 3 in the House Republican leadership, was
expected to fill the power vacuum at least temporarily, indeed if
not in title. He said he would not run for speaker because that
would force him to move from Texas to Washington, which would make
him ineligible to keep his foster children. But DeLay is viewed as
too partisan to step into the role of speaker, and Armey is viewed
as too weak.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Larry Flynt, publisher of Hustler, the sex magazine,
told a news conference in Los Angeles that his investigators had
found four women who said they had been involved with Livingston
over the last 10 years. Flynt, who said he wanted to expose the
``hypocrisy'' on Capitol Hill, had offered $1 million to anyone who
could prove sexual indiscretions by members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing makes me happier,'' Flynt said in a statement
Saturday, ``than to think I might have contributed to the
resignation of that right-wing radical.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ William Jefferson Clinton was impeached on charges
of perjury and obstruction of justice Saturday by a divided House
of Representatives, which recommended virtually along party lines
that the Senate remove the nation's 42nd president from office.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after the vote, Clinton, surrounded by Democrats,
walked into the South Lawn of the White House, his wife, Hillary,
on his arm, to pre-empt calls for his resignation. The man who in
better days had debated where he would stand in the pantheon of
American presidents said he would stay in office and vowed ``to go
on from here to rise above the rancor, to overcome the pain and
division, to be a repairer of the breach.'' Later, Clinton called
off the bombing in Iraq, declaring the mission accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton became only the second president in history to be
impeached. At 1:22 p.m., the House of Representatives, after two
days of angry and emotional debate, approved, 228-206, the first
article of impeachment, accusing Clinton of perjury for misleading
a federal grand jury last Aug. 17 about the nature of his
relationship with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In the noisy House chamber, a lone Republican applauded. Five
Republicans crossed party lines to vote against impeachment. Five
Democrats broke with their party to support it.
</P>
<P>
   The margin was enough to forestall charges that the president's
fate might have been different if the vote were delayed to the
106th Congress, which will have five more Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   A second article of impeachment, charging Clinton with
obstruction of justice, passed on a narrower vote of 221-212. It
accused him of inducing others to lie in order conceal his affair
with Ms. Lewinsky. This time 12 Republicans voted no, while five
Democrats voted yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president of the United States has committed a serious
transgression,'' said Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, the House majority
leader. ``Among other things, he took an oath to God to tell the
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, and then he
failed to do so, not once, but several times.'' To ignore this, he
said, is to ``undermine the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Two more charges against Clinton were defeated. An article
accusing the president of perjury in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment lawsuit was rejected, 229-205, with 28 Republicans
breaking ranks.
</P>
<P>
   And the House overwhelmingly rejected, 285-48, an accusation of
abuse of power stemming from Clinton's legalistic answers to 81
questions put to him by the House Judiciary Committee. Eighty-one
Republicans defected from their party. Only one Democrat deserted
his.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate would conduct only the second impeachment trial of a
president in the 209-year history of the Republic. Clinton will be
the only elected president put on trial. Andrew Johnson, impeached
and acquitted by one vote in 1868, had been elected vice president
and succeeded to the White House on Abraham Lincoln's assassination
in 1865.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, announced just
after the House vote that senators ``will be prepared to fulfill
their constitutional obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said, ``There are steps that precede the beginning of an
impeachment trial. Once the Senate is organized as an impeachment
proceeding, there will be pleadings and motions that come before
the taking of evidence. That makes it difficult to determine at
this time when an actual trial will begin.''
</P>
<P>
   The House acted on a crisp pre-Christmas Saturday when American
politics seemed to be descending into the very cannibalism that
Speaker Newt Gingrich had warned of when he was toppled a month
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Clinton was impeached for his efforts to cover up
his affair with Ms. Lewinsky, Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., who
had been chosen to succeed Gingrich as speaker, shocked the House
by announcing he would leave Congress because of revelations of his
own adulterous affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was Livingston on Saturday who called for Clinton's
resignation from the House floor. Charging that Clinton had
undermined the rule of law and damaged the nation, Livingston said,
``I say that you have the power to terminate that damage and heal
the wounds that you have created. You, sir, may resign your post.''
</P>
<P>
   As some Democrats shouted back, ``You resign,'' Livingston said,
``I was prepared to lead our narrow majority as speaker and I
believe I had it in me to do a fine job. But I cannot do that job
or be the kind of leader that I would like to be under current
circumstances. So I must set the example that I hope President
Clinton will follow.''
</P>
<P>
   With a sex scandal now consuming one of their own, the House's
impeachment debate turned more than ever into a discourse on sin
and morality in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the House majority whip, who had helped
make the speaker-designate and has been one of the fiercest critics
of Clinton, choked back tears as he praised Livingston. He said his
friend ``understood what this debate was all about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about honor and decency and integrity and the truth,''
DeLay said, his voice breaking, ``everything that we honor in this
country. It was also a debate about relativism versus absolute
truth.'' He charged that the president's Democratic defenders would
lower the standards of society.
</P>
<P>
   Equally passionate, Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the House
minority leader, said men were imperfect, and he asked Livingston
not to resign, for a moment drawing a bipartisan standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our founding fathers created a system of government of men,
not of angels,'' Gephardt said, his face reddening with emotion as
he spoke. ``No one standing in this House today can pass a
puritanical test of purity that some are demanding that our elected
leaders take. If we demand that mere mortals live up to this
standard, we will see our seats of government lay empty and we will
see the best, most able people unfairly cast out of public
service.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When he finished he walked slowly up the Democratic side of the
aisle, Democrats applauding him and hugging him as he moved along.
The Republicans remained fixed in their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's votes were the penultimate step in the most serious
conflict between Congress and a president since Richard Nixon
resigned in the face of impeachment and certain conviction on Aug.
9, 1974.
</P>
<P>
   But while that case spun out from a 1972 break-in at Democratic
headquarters in the Watergate complex, this began with a murky land
deal in Arkansas in 1978. Through the efforts of Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel, under the law enacted in the wake of
Watergate, the investigation spread to examine Clinton's affair
with an intern.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a finger-wagging performance last January at the
White House, told the nation he did not have sexual relations with
``that woman,'' Ms. Lewinsky. He denied sexual relations with her
in a deposition in the sexual harassment case brought against him
by Paula Corbin Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Only in August, after it became known that Ms. Lewinsky had
preserved a blue dress that provided evidence of their affair, did
Clinton tell the nation and a grand jury that he had had an
``inappropriate relationship'' with her.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans took great pains to distinguish Clinton's case from
Livingston's revelations that ``on occasion I strayed from my
marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, who himself saw a past affair come to light as he
presided over the House's nine-week impeachment inquiry, said:
``Infidelity, adultery is not a public act, it's a private act, and
the government, the Congress, has no business intruding into
private acts.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that Clinton had become a commander in chief who by
lying in legal forums ``trivializes, ignores, shreds, minimizes the
sanctity'' of his oath of office. Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., said
``there can be no justice without the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats argued back that the president's actions were wrong
and deserved censure but did not rise to the level of impeachment.
Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., the House minority whip, said
Republicans were trying to ``hijack an election and hound the
president out of office.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments before the impeachment votes, Democrats tried to bring
to the floor their own proposal to censure Clinton. But after some
debate, their motion was held to be not germane to impeachment and
ruled out of order by Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., whom Gingrich named
to preside over the impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats appealed the ruling, expecting to lose because
such appeals are considered a challenge to the right of the
majority party to run the House. Their motion failed 230-204. Two
Republicans, Constance Morella of Maryland and Peter King of New
York, broke with precedent and crossed party lines to vote with the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   As their motion failed, the Democrats briefly marched out of the
House chamber in protest. But they returned to vote on the four
articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   For one year the Lewinsky scandal has preoccupied the capital
despite an immense disconnect with public opinion. Since the
scandal became public last January, polls have shown the public
opposed impeachment and wanted the inquiry brought to an end. Even
on Friday night, after a 13-hour debate, a CBS News Poll of 548
persons showed only 38 percent wanted their representative to vote
for impeachment; 58 percent wanted a no vote.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict now enters uncharted seas. The Nixon resignation,
for one, cut the matter short, and the Andrew Johnson trial
occurred more than 100 years ago, in a different America, one
without nuclear weapons or cable television or public opinion
polls.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Lott's recent assurances that he will move ahead, some
wonder whether the Senate may yet flinch from a trial because of
the popular will. But Republicans have steadfastly ignored the
polls all year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., the newly elected chairman of the
House Republican conference, said in debate Saturday, ``What's
popular isn't always right. You say polls are against this. Polls
measure changing feelings, not steadfast principle. Polls would
have rejected the Ten Commandments. Polls would have embraced
slavery and ridiculed women's rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``You say we must draw this to a close,'' Watts continued. ``I
say we must draw a line between right and wrong, not with a tiny
fine line of an executive fountain pen, but with the big fat lead
of a No. 2 pencil. And we must do it so every kid in America can
see it. The point is not whether the president can prevail, but
whether truth can prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for all of the Democrats' charges of excessive partisanship
Saturday, enough Republicans did pick and choose among articles of
impeachment to send only two of the four that had come out of the
House Judiciary Committee on to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Republicans said they did not think a perjury charge
in Ms. Jones' civil case warranted impeachment, particularly since
Clinton's deposition had been held by a judge to be immaterial.
Many of them also looked dimly at impeaching the president for
abuse of power _ a term taken from the proceedings against Nixon in
1974 _ simply because his answers to 81 questions from the
Judiciary Committee were legalistic and evasive.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Hobson, R-Ohio, said he supported impeachment of the
president for lying to a grand jury but not in the Jones case.
``Even if it's true, I worry whether it rises to the same threshold
for impeachment,'' he said. ``I didn't want to pile on.''

HOUSE SETS UP SENATE TRIAL WITH IMPEACHMENT OF CLINTON 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican-controlled House of Representatives
impeached President Clinton on Saturday, setting the stage for a
trial in the Senate for only the second time since the nation's
founding.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of votes largely along party lines, the House
approved two articles of impeachment formally accusing Clinton of
lying to a grand jury and of obstructing justice in trying to
conceal an affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Two other articles, one accusing Clinton of perjury in a civil
lawsuit, the other alleging abuse of power, were rejected when
moderate Republicans sided with Democrats to vote against the
allegations, drawn up by some of the GOP's most conservative
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do not label lawlessness, our children cannot recognize
it. And if we do not punish lawlessness, our children will not
believe it. How can we tell our children that honesty is the best
policy if we do not demand honesty as a policy,'' J.C. Watts,
R-Okla., told the House before the voting.
</P>
<P>
   Voting on the four articles _ each required a separate roll call
of House members _ began at 1:09 p.m. EST. In a little over an
hour, the voting on each of the articles had ended.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who were rocked by leadership tumult Saturday,
immediately delivered the impeachment documents to the Senate,
whose members could end Clinton's presidency after a trial. To do
so, however, would require a two-thirds majority vote _ 67
senators.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton vowed to fight to remain in office
``until the last hour of the last day'' of his term, which ends in
Jan. 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Joined by dozens of congressional Democrats who for weeks have
fought the Republican impeachment juggernaut, Clinton rejected
calls for his resignation and urged an easing of partisan tensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must stop the politics of personal destruction,'' Clinton
said. ``We must get rid of the poisonous venom of excessive
partisanship, obsessive animosity and uncontrolled anger.''
</P>
<P>
   The president pledged to work with the Senate to find a
``reasonable, bipartisan and proportionate'' resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Unless a deal is reached, the Senate would begin a trial with
the 55 Republican and 45 Democratic senators sitting as jurors, and
Chief Justice William Rehnquist presiding. It would be the first
impeachment trial of a president since Andrew Johnson in 1868.
Johnson's Senate trial lasted 74 days and ended with acquittal, by
one vote.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, the House Judiciary Committee recommended articles of
impeachment against President Nixon. He resigned before a vote in
the House.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has said that any
trial would be ``governed both by the Constitution and by our rules
and precedents.'' He cautioned senators to ``be judicious in any
discussions'' of the House action and impending trial.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, hundreds of people packed the visitors galleries to
witness the debate, which at times reached lofty tones and at
others bogged in parliamentary minutiae. Outside, thousands
gathered on the lawn east of the Capitol chanting, ``Witch hunt!
Witch hunt!'' and waving signs saying, ``Shame on Congress'' and
``Impeach the Liar.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, as the impeachment debate neared full throat, members
were stunned into silence, some shedding tears, when Rep. Bob
Livingston, R-La., announced that he would not accept the
speakership when the new Congress convenes in 2 1/2 weeks and would
quit the House in six months. He was selected in November after
Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., announced he was leaving the House.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Livingston, who only two days earlier confirmed
his own marital infidelities to the chagrin of some conservatives
in his party, was known in advance by only by a handful of close
allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only challenge you in such fashion if I am willing to
heed my own words,'' Livingston said in seeking the president's
impeachment. ``So I must set an example that I hope President
Clinton will follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans were visibly distraught.
</P>
<P>
   Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, fought tears. Rep. John Mica,
R-Fla., wiped his eyes, then walked off the floor.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, a driving force behind the impeachment process as
Livingston took a back seat, rose a few minutes later and said
Livingston's decision proved the House was on the right course in
seeking to oust Clinton. Livingston ``understood what this debate
was all about _ honor and decency and integrity and the truth,''
DeLay said. ``It was also a debate about relativism versus absolute
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats compared Livingston's situation to Clinton's troubles
and urged Republicans to bring the national nightmare to an end by
dropping impeachment and instead supporting a resolution rebuking
the president's behavior. The request was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the case to impeach Clinton, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.,
cautioned colleagues to avoid confusion between what he called
``private acts of infidelity and public acts'' involving a
government official who lies when under oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when you have a serial violator of the oath who is the
chief law enforcement officer of the country, who appoints the
judges and the Supreme Court, the attorney general, we have a
problem,'' said Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But House Democratic leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri said:
``We are on the brink of the abyss. The only way we stop the
insanity is through the force of our own will, ... for all of us to
finally say, `Enough.'
</P>
<P>
   ``May God have mercy on this Congress and may Congress have the
wisdom and the goodness to save itself today.''
</P>
<P>
   Likening impeachment to a peaceful coup d'etat, some Democrats
spiced their defense of Clinton with warnings of political
recriminations against Republicans from a scandal-weary electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Spanish phrase for a coup, ``golpe de estado,'' Rep.
Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., told of growing up in the public housing
projects of the South Bronx. ``I know a bunch of bullies when I see
them,'' Serrano said, turning to the Republican side of the
chamber. ``The bullies get theirs, and you're going to get yours,
too. The people are going to rise up, from California to New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   When voting began, Democratic House members staged a brief
walkout to protest the refusal of Republicans to allow a vote on
censure as an alternative to impeachment. All but one of the
Democratic members left the chamber, and about half left the
building, then returned less than 10 minutes later to vote against
each article of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're offended by this process,'' said Gephardt, who led his
Democratic colleagues down the Capitol steps. ``They have
disregarded the clear will of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   The first article of impeachment, which accused Clinton of lying
to a federal grand jury investigating his affair and efforts to
hide it, was approved 228-206, with five Democrats voting for
impeachment and five Republicans voting against.
</P>
<P>
   The article accusing Clinton of obstruction of justice passed
221-212. This article alleges that he tried to cover up his affair
with Lewinsky by inducing her and others to lie. Twelve
Republicans, less persuaded by the evidence on this charge, voted
no but five Democrats again voted yes.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Saturday ``a bizarre day in the House,'' Rep. Ken
Bentsen, D-Texas, said when Americans look at what happened ``they
will think we're nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Bentsen called the partisan rancor over Clinton's impeachment
``a culmination of the viciousness of American politics'' that
began more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Before adjourning, the House selected 13 Republican members to
act as managers, or prosecutors, when Clinton's case goes to trial
in the Senate. The managers are led by Hyde and include other
members of the Judiciary Committee: Reps. Bob Barr of Georgia; Ed
Bryant, Tennessee; Steve Buyer, Indiana; Charles Canady, Florida;
Chris Cannon, Utah; Steve Chabot, Ohio; George Gekas, Pennsylvania;
Lindsey Graham, South Carolina; Asa Hutchinson, Arkansas; Bill
McCollum, Florida; James Rogan, California; and James
Sensenbrenner, Wisconsin.

 &HT;    Clinton impeachment no vindication: For Barr, it's about
`upholding the law'
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just a year ago, Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) was the lone
``impeacher'' in Congress, urging the removal of President Clinton
months before the nation even heard the name Monica.
</P>
<P>
   With the House's decision Saturday to impeach the president for
perjury and concealing his affair with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky, Barr is now suddenly part of a chorus of
impeachers. And it looks like the conservative Georgian's role will
only expand in the 106th Congress with his appointment to be one of
13 floor managers running the Senate trial of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Barr's call for impeachment last year may have been about
alleged fund-raising abuses, not perjury, but in the world
according to Bob Barr, that is a mere detail.
</P>
<P>
   To Barr, the end game is the same: The president has been
publicly shamed and humiliated in becoming the second president in
the history of the nation to be impeached by the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very sad day,'' said Barr, during the vote to impeach
the president.
</P>
<P>
   But Barr's detractors say he has perhaps never looked so
energized as he did striding across the U.S. Capitol with Judiciary
Commitee Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) to deliver two articles of
impeachment against Clinton to the office of the Secretary of the
Senate for a trial.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton faces an uncertain future, Barr's political position
appears to be rising. After just two terms in Congress, Barr has
become a fixture on the national stage as one of the more outspoken
members of the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   During the panel's four-month impeachment inquiry, Barr was a
regular on the likes of CNN, trotting out to tell audience after
audience why the president should be removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we accept that this inquiry is merely about sex and
politics, we have already failed in our constitutional
responsibility,'' said Barr, during one of his numerous floor
statements on impeaching the president. ``This is about the rule of
law. It is about accountability. It is about American citizens
being free from fear that a high government official can tap them
on the shoulder, escort them into a room, force them to succumb to
the official's wishes and then obstruct that citizen's right to
seek justice in our courts.''
</P>
<P>
   But how much impact that recognition will have on Barr's career
long term remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Staff aides on both sides of the aisle note that Barr has toned
down his arguments, presenting cogent, albeit fiercely partisan,
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Political scientists deliver a more mixed reaction to Barr's
polemic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the leading spokesperson for the hardest of the hard
right,'' said Norm Ornstein, a scholar at the American Enterprise
Institute in Washington. While Barr's push for impeachment has won
him national recognition, Ornstein questions what it means from a
public policy perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that there are lots of people saying he has been
vindicated as he moves from the wilderness to national prominence,
but he won't have an impact on policy,'' Ornstein said.
</P>
<P>
   William Connelly, professor at Washington &AMP; Lee University in
Virginia has documented the GOP takeover of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion, Barr overplayed his hand on the impeachment
committee by calling for impeachment before the facts handed over
by independent counsel Kenneth Starr were proven. He would have
been wiser, Connolly said, to have taken a more centrist position
like that of fellow Republican Rep. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Barr has been an attack dog for impeachment from the
beginning,'' Connelly said. ``Barr has always been on the fringe,
chomping on the bit to remove the president. I don't think his
performance on the committee was particularly enlightening.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Barr's gain will be among the fringe, not among the
two-thirds of America who do not want the president impeached,
Connelly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Barr has had his 15 minutes of fame and I think we've seen
him for what he is: a man of moderate talents who caters to the
right wing conservatives,'' Connelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Barr's crusade for impeachment has certainly spawned the wrath
of Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   One Atlanta-based group _ called the Committee to Dis-Barr
Georgia _ has created a Web site casting Barr as a ``white
racist,'' a violator of campaign fund-raising laws and philanderer
who has failed to pay child support.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site serves up the latest news about Barr's own personal
life. For example, on July 8, 1998 is an item about potential
marital discord. Another one posted on January 1, 1998 describes a
well-known event some years ago where Barr was seen licking whipped
cream off the chest of a woman during a Leukemia Society
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think he's a hypocrite,'' said Steve Anthony,
executive director of the Georgia Democratic Party, who has known
Barr since their days as competing party chairmen in Cobb County,
Ga.
</P>
<P>
   In the same turn, Barr is often approached by citizens and
commended for his stern view of Clinton's actions. ``You are doing
God's work,'' one woman said to him at a recent Judiciary Committee
hearing on impeachment. ``We are so glad that you are here.''
</P>
<P>
   But a look at Barr's background does reveal a puzzle of
contradiction.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Barr talks about racial equality, but he spoke to
the Council of Conservative Citizens, a group that believes
interracial marriage results in a white genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Barr espouses a conservative family values agenda, but has been
married three times.
</P>
<P>
   As a Reagan-appointed U.S. Attorney, he upset the leaders of his
own party by going after former Rep. Pat Swindall on perjury
charges.
</P>
<P>
   It is a list that Barr openly shrugs at. His enemies in the
White House are out to get him with ``another one of their smear
campaigns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barr's attack on the White House has brought him few friends
among members of the opposite party.
</P>
<P>
   Where Barr is an ardent foe of Clinton, Democratic Rep. John
Lewis is an ardent supporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's good or healthy for American leaders to be
appearing before separatist groups or racist groups,'' said Lewis,
a former Civil Rights leader whose district abuts Barr's. ``We
should send the strongest possible message that we believe in
bringing people together, not dividing them along racial lines.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Barr denied knowing about the group's views until
he arrived at their convention in Charleston, S.C. on June 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ludicrous to think that I would believe that,'' Barr said
of the group's views on racial matters.
</P>
<P>
   But the next day, the group's chief executive officer said Barr
was given copies of the group's magazine in advance. Most of the
magazine's issues espouse the racist attitudes of the group. Once
again, Barr denied knowing about the group's beliefs, handing
reporters copies of what he had received.
</P>
<P>
   The material mentioned conservative causes, such as opposing
school busing, but it did not overtly outline the group's belief
that whites are supreme over blacks. Barr said he did not find out
about the group's beliefs until he arrived to deliver his speech on
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, who has spoken before the ultra-conservative John Birch
Society several times in the past, said he did not walk out because
if he walked out of every group that he disagreed with he'd never
be on a panel.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the impeachment vote, Barr delivered an address
invoking the words of former President John F. Kennedy during the
civil rights movement. In that speech Kennedy said the rule of law
should be used to enforce the integration of blacks and whites.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing Barr use his uncle's words, Rep. Patrick Kennedy
(D-R.I.) shouted at Barr in front of a group of reporters. Later he
called Barr a ``racist and a liar.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr responded by pointing out that as a former U.S. Attorney in
Atlanta he persecuted White supremacists. He called Kennedy a
``young punk.''
</P>
<P>
   For a member of Congress to appear before this group and say
they didn't know about it is impossible,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are plenty of people who admire Barr's politics,
respecting him for the way he has been firm on the conservative
agenda. He fought hard against the federal recognition of same sex
marriages and to limit the reach of the federal law enforcement
during the 104th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   During the 105th Congress, Barr spent much of his time on the
House Government Reform and Oversight Committee investigating the
campaign fund-raising abuses of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   That has prompted some to ask about what he has done on local
issues.
</P>
<P>
   But issues such as transportation and education are the
responsibility of local, not federal government, said Matthew
Glavin, president of the Southeast Legal Foundation, where Barr
once worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barr is a person with very deep convictions,'' Glavin said.
``He is someone willing to lead, rather than be followed. He was
out in front of this parade. Now, the president seems to be in deep
trouble and all the plans that the White House has have unraveled
and we can look at Bob Barr and say: You were right.''
</P>
<P>
   That is clearly not what William Waldrop thinks. As the chairman
of the Cobb County Democratic Party, Waldrop is in charge of
running candidates to run against Barr.
</P>
<P>
   In November's election, an insurance agent won 45 percent of the
vote against Barr with less than $13,000. Waldrop says it is
because Barr has ignored the issues of the 7th district.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Barr is truly an embarrassment to our district,'' he said.
``All he does is attack the president over and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking it all in stride is the way Barr works. He often sleeps
on the floor of his office, commuting home each weekend to see his
wife, Jeri.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his office on the day that Clinton ordered air
strikes in Iraq, Barr seemed concerned that the Republican
leadership might postpone the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``They certainly know how to snatch defeat from the jaws of
victory,'' Barr said, almost depressed.
</P>
<P>
   Why does he dislike Clinton so? Where does that come from?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't dislike him, I just believe in the Constitution and
everything it stands for,'' he said. And that means making sure
that the president is not ``above the law.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been grueling fight, a long battle. Does he feel
vindicated?
</P>
<P>
   No, he says. ``It's all about upholding the law.''

WHEN IT COMES TO PREGAME, CBS SHOULD PUNT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few weeks into the season, a CBS Sports executive begged for
patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give our NFL pregame show some time,'' he said, ``and you'll
see the results.''
</P>
<P>
   We've seen the results: It's not worth our time.
</P>
<P>
   Just when NFL teams are gearing up to be at their best, the NFL
pregame shows should be doing the same. Yet CBS' ``NFL Today'' is
by far the worst of the group, and it is not getting better. As a
connoisseur of the genre, I submit that _ considering its lack of
lively debate, humor, entertainment and information _ it's the
worst NFL pregame show ever.
</P>
<P>
   The cheese factor is huge on all three of the big Sunday morning
shows: ESPN's Chris Berman is a carnival barker, but he's made
cornball seem cool; the fraudulent canned-laugh exchanges between
Fox's Terry Bradshaw and James Brown are painful, but at least
they're sometimes funny.
</P>
<P>
   But the CBS team of Jim Nantz, Marcus Allen, Brent Jones and
George Seifert? The latter three are ex-jocks and rookie
broadcasters, and Jones is the only one with a track record of even
having a sense of humor. Seifert is somnolent. Nantz is nothing
more than a handsome game-show host. In person, Allen's demeanor is
classy, but here he's a blank slate.
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiasm on the Fox and ESPN shows is too often fake. The
``So-and-so told me exclusively'' stuff is grating. And, given the
resources _ remember, the three networks each spent a fortune to be
part of the $2.2 billion bid for the NFL on TV _ shouldn't these
shows have the same humor, warmth, polish and professionalism of a
``Seinfeld'' or a ``Drew Carey Show''?
</P>
<P>
   CBS' offering lacks all of it. There is no enthusiasm, save for
Jones' ramblings. There is no real reporting, with the quirky
exception of the recent addition of ex-Browns exec Mike Lombardi,
who had been a behind-the-scenes info guy but now bumps Seifert
from the set. And there is a decidedly ``who cares'' atmosphere, as
if the boys running this morgue-like show know nobody's watching,
so what's the point?
</P>
<P>
   So CBS continues its fight for ratings with a tiny stick,
battling with ESPN's ideal combination of outspokenness in Sterling
Sharpe, analysis in Tom Jackson, reporting in Chris Mortensen and
showbiz in Chris Berman. (I can't figure out what Jim Kelly
offers.) And battling Fox' appealing-to-the-masses team of
Bradshaw, Brown, Howie Long (who has more true star quality than
all the rest of all these guys combined) and Cris Collinsworth. (I
can't figure out what he offers, either.)
</P>
<P>
   Some advice: You know what the best football show in TV is? It's
ESPN's ``Prime Time'', the postgame wrapup. It's trim, sleek,
funny, insightful. It's Berman and Jackson, by themselves, putting
the whole league _ every team, every score, every game _ in one
neat package.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it: On the other network shows, I have a tough time
getting scoring updates; on ESPN's postgame coverage, I get
ad-libbed analysis of everything.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what I want in my pregame show: Everything.
</P>
<P>
   ONE MAN'S PRO BOWL BALLOT
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to say which players should've been on the Pro Bowl
teams. It's tougher to say it and then follow up by selecting which
players should've been removed. Example: An ESPN analyst this week
said Miami inside linebacker Zach Thomas got robbed by not making
it, and in the next breath said how deserving San Diego's Junior
Seau and Baltimore's Ray Lewis are as they made it. Huh? Here's a
few of my ins and outs:
</P>
<P>
   Remove San Francisco receiver Jerry Rice. Replace him with San
Francisco receiver Terrell Owens.
</P>
<P>
   Remove Denver linebacker Bill Romanowski. Replace him with
Denver linebacker John Mobley.
</P>
<P>
   Remove New Orleans defensive end Joe Jackson. Replace him with
St. Louis defensive end Kevin Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Remove Dallas guard Nate Newton. Replace with, oh, all sorts of
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   And now, one man's Pro Bowl ballot: NFC
QB _ Steve Young, San Francisco RB _ Jamal Anderson, Atlanta; Barry
Sanders, Detroit WR _ Randy Moss, Minnesota; Antonio Freeman, Green
Bay TE _ Mark Chmura, Green Bay OT _ Larry Allen, Dallas; Todd
Steussie, Minnesota OG _ Randall McDaniel, Minnesota; Kevin Gogan,
San Francisco C _ Jeff Christy, Minnesota DE _ Reggie White, Green
Bay; Michael Strahan, Giants DT _ John Randle, Minnesota; Bryant
Young, San Francisco OLB _ Kevin Greene, Carolina; Derrick Brooks,
Tampa Bay ILB _ Jessie Tuggle, Atlanta CB _ Deion Sanders, Dallas;
Ray Buchanan, Atlanta S _ Leroy Butler, Green Bay; Robert Griffith,
Minnesota Specialists: P Brad Maynard, Giants; K Gary Anderson,
Minnesota; KR Glyn Milburn, Chicago. AFC QB _ Doug Flutie, Buffalo
RB _ Terrell Davis, Denver; Marshall Faulk, Indianapolis WR _ Jimmy
Smith, Jacksonville; Eric Moulds, Buffalo TE _ Shannon Sharpe,
Denver OT _ Tony Boselli, Jacksonville; Tony Jones, Denver OG _
Ruben Brown, Buffalo; Bruce Matthews, Tennessee C _ Dermontti
Dawson, Pittsburgh DE _ Bruce Smith, Buffalo; Michael Sinclair,
Seattle DT _ Darrell Russell, Oakland; Ted Washington, Buffalo OLB
_ Mo Lewis, Jets; John Mobley, Denver ILB _ Ray Lewis, Baltimore CB
_ Ty Law, New England; Aaron Glenn, Jets S _ Rodney Harrison, San
Diego; Lawyer Milloy, New England Specialists: P Craig Hentrich,
Tennessee; K Jason Elam, Denver; KR Jermaine Lewis, Baltimore.
NUMBERS GAME 21 _ Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre, the winner of
the past three MVP awards, leads the NFC with 21 interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   268 _ Indianapolis running back Marshall Faulk needs 268 yards
to break the NFL single-season record for yards from scrimmage.
TRIVIAL PURSUIT Six quarterbacks, three from each conference, were
voted into the Pro Bowl: Denver's John Elway, the New York Jets'
Vinny Testaverde, Buffalo's Doug Flutie, San Francisco's Steve
Young, Minnesota's Randall Cunningham and Atlanta's Chris Chandler.
How many of them are with their original teams?
</P>
<P>
   None.
QUOTABLE Minnesota receivers coach Hubbard Alexander knows he
caught heat in Dallas for not developing receivers. Now does he
deserve some credit for Randy Moss? ``I've got six championship
rings in my lifetime, three from Super Bowls with the Cowboys,''
Alexander said. ``I don't have to apologize to anybody. \RIn
Dallas\S, they're making me the scapegoat.''
CHECK OUT ... The concept of ``refereeplay'' for the playoffs,
thankfully dead. But give commissioner Paul Tagliabue high grades
for P.R. spin here. The owners were squawking, the coaches were
squawking, the players were squawking, the media was squawking, the
fans were squawking. So with owners possibly ready to put the
needed 24 votes where their mouths were, here comes the Competition
Committee needing to first approve sending it to the owners. The
movement loses, 7-1. So no vote is legal _ and the commissioner can
at least say he tried.
NFC BUZZ Look deeper inside Carolina linebacker Kevin Greene's
sideline attack on assistant coach Kevin Steele last week, and
Greene's action seems even more the work of a selfish player. There
are indications the dispute had something to do with Carolina's
wishes that Greene _ Pro Bowl-bound because of his sack prowess _
focus more on stopping the run. ... By the way, does anybody else
find it strange that grabbing a coach earns Greene a one-game
suspension, the same suspension given to Panthers running back Fred
Lane after he made an obscene gesture in the end zone? Should
grabbing one's coach be handled the same as grabbing one's crotch?
... The Rams have four wins, three of them against AFC East
contenders New England, Buffalo and the Jets. ... The Redskins have
won five of seven as Norv Turner pushes to save his job. ... Coach
Mike Holmgren has a $4 million-a-year invitation to stay with the
Packers, but logic says he will wait until he hears other offers
before he even considers remaining. ... Carolina rumor: Coach Dom
Capers is out, Florida's Steve Spurrier is in. Good one, except
there are indications Spurrier hasn't even been contacted yet. ...
Look for the Bears to offer Todd Sauerbrun a new contract that will
allow him to join the Oilers' Craig Hentrich as the sport's only $1
million punters. ... No, the Packers say, they still aren't giving
up the ship. ``I'm not a statistical person,'' says Packers GM Ron
Wolf. ``But I believe the best defense in the NFC belongs to the
Green Bay Packers. That gives you a chance.'' ... Some Rams players
are using Isaac Bruce's hamstring injury _ so bad it caused him to
miss all but five games this year and now has him on the injured
reserve list _ as evidence that coach Dick Vermeil's practices are
too grueling. ... Philadelphia at Dallas: The Eagles have lost 16
consecutive road games. ... In four of 12 games, the Saints'
defense has outscored its offense. ... Detroit would like to give
as much work as possible to rookie QB Charlie Batch, but his back
problems may alter their plans. ... San Francisco QB Steve Young
needs four TD passes in the final two weeks for a career-high total
of 36. Young had 35 in 1994. ... Update on the Not Ready For The
Big-Time Players: Arizona has won consecutive games only once this
season, and has yet to beat a team with a winning record. ... Tampa
Bay at Washington: Two teams on three-game win streaks, both riding
hot Trents. Tampa Bay's Trent Dilfer has 13 TD passes in his past
seven games; Washington's Trent Green has thrown 14 TDs to only two
interceptions. ... Vikings receiver Randy Moss is the only rookie
voted to the Pro Bowl.
AFC BUZZ Kordell Stewart has created an awkward situation for
himself by his tears. You can cry when you're in pain. You can cry
after you lose. You can cry when you talk to the media about a
family tragedy. But _ it's an unwritten rule in the macho world of
professional football _ you cannot cry because you've been taken
out of a game. ``It happened, so be a man about it,'' Stewart said,
explaining his emotional outburst after being pulled during a 16-3
loss at Tampa Bay. ``I told \Rmy teammates\S) I'm still Kordell,
I'm still a fighter and not a loser.'' But ask Steelers insiders
about the aftershock of Stewart's sideline breakdown last Sunday.
They'll tell you that Stewart's future as a top-notch quarterback
is an uphill battle; his six interceptions in his past three starts
has fueled speculation that Mike Tomczak might get another chance
at QB with Stewart reprising his old ``Slash'' role as a
passer/runner/receiver. And they'll also tell you Stewart's days as
a leader are over. ... The Jets beat good teams. They're 7-1
against teams with winning records. ... Oakland at San Diego: The
No. 2- vs. No. 1-ranked defenses in the NFL, but the Raiders are
slumping, with one win in their past six games after a 6-2 start.
... Baltimore receiver Floyd Turner caught only 10 passes for 166
yards and one touchdown in his first 10 games. In his past three
games, Turner has 297 yards and four scores. ... Indianapolis at
Seattle: The Colts have allowed only 15 sacks; the Seahawks lead
the NFL with 49 sacks. ... Jets coach Bill Parcells is upset with
``Sports Illustrated'' because he thought he had a deal with them
to not put his picture on the cover. ``Yeah, I requested purposely
not to be on that cover,'' said Parcells of the edition released
before the Jets-Miami matchup. ``I said I really didn't want to do
the article if it was going to be on the cover. As recently as last
week I took a photo for them with a guarantee that it would not be
on the cover.'' A ``Sports Illustrated'' spokesman said it would
never enter into such an agreement. Conclusion: Control freak
Parcells overstepped his bounds. ... Odd situation for the
Chargers, who must motivate themselves while playing under a
lame-duck head coach in June Jones, who has taken a job at the
University of Hawaii. ... Seattle's 12 touchdowns by return
(fumbles, interceptions and special teams) is an NFL record. ...
Buffalo is poised to become only the fourth team in NFL history to
make the playoffs after starting 0-3. ... In addition to Detroit's
Scott Mitchell, mark down Kansas City's Elvis Grbac as a guy who
might end up as Cleveland's starting QB in 1999. Grbac, however,
might get playing time in the final two weeks although Rich Gannon
has led Kansas City to 30 points or more in three consecutive
games.
THE PLAYOFF PICTURE The Jacksonville Jaguars have a chance to
continue their march toward ``model franchise'' status tonight, as
they travel to Minnesota (13-1). The Jaguars are 10-4 and in charge
of the AFC Central. The title is theirs with a win or a tie in
Minnesota and a Tennessee loss or a tie (the Oilers are at Green
Bay). While Jacksonville's expansion partner, Carolina, has
experienced the highs and lows of the NFL (an NFC title game
appearance two years ago and 2-12 this season), Jacksonville
figures to be the most formidable AFC playoff obstacle facing
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Other key games include:
</P>
<P>
   Jets (10-4) at Buffalo (9-5): A New York victory gives the Jets
their first division title since 1969. New York won the earlier
meeting, 34-12, in Week 10.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco (11-3) at New England (8-6): The Patriots will
play without QB Drew Bledsoe, but have a chance to clinch a playoff
spot with a win and a Tennessee loss. The 49ers still trail Atlanta
(12-2) in the NFC West. Atlanta is at Detroit, where a victory
gives the Falcons a division title for only the second time in the
franchise's 33-year history.

STERN FIGHTS TO SAVE NBA EMPIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Recite David Stern's successes, and the list
starts to sound almost cliche.
</P>
<P>
   The storied rise of the NBA with Stern as commissioner is so
well-documented, so oft-cited, the average fan could play
word-association games with Stern's resume and without hesitation
complete the following sentences:
</P>
<P>
   Before Stern took over, the NBA played ... to half-empty arenas.
</P>
<P>
   Before Stern took over, the NBA Finals were broadcast ... on
tape delay.
</P>
<P>
   Before Stern took over, the league was viewed as ... a
collection of drug users and thugs.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when Stern became NBA commissioner in 1984, it would
have seemed fantasy to suggest the league would one day wilt under
the immense weight of its prosperity, as opposed to crumbling under
the weight of its problems.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is the state of the NBA today _ a league too successful
for its own good, its incredible fortunes having begotten the most
damaging labor war in its history.
</P>
<P>
   Stern, players and owners, who just 14 years ago forged a
partnership that gradually burgeoned into a multibillion-dollar
global enterprise, have shut down their money machine because they
cannot agree on how to divide the $2 billion annual fortune.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's nearly six-month-old lockout threatens to wipe out the
entire 1998-99 season. Stern himself will have to make that fateful
decision _ probably within the next 14 days if no progress is made.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the lockout has badly tarnished the NBA's reputation
and threatens to destroy everything Stern helped create. Yet you
would hardly know it by listening to Stern's detached assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an economic model that needs some remodeling,'' he
says flatly, almost comically underplaying the crisis that has
wiped out 300-plus games and counting. ``Successful companies have
labor problems at one time or another.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the voice of ``Easy Dave,'' as he dubbed himself during
the 1995 labor negotiations. The commissioner is renowned for
profanity-laced tirades behind closed doors but in public it's all
statesman and salesman.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the NBA has canceled games over labor issues for
the first time in history, or that it may become the first pro
sports league to cancel a season.
</P>
<P>
   Easy Dave's sales pitch right now is this: lockout or no, things
could be far worse. He knows. He's been there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest crisis this league faced was ... in the late '70s
and early '80s (when Stern was NBA general counsel). We were a
league that had very little following, and predictions of our
demise were widespread,'' Stern said during a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were viewed as having too many African-American players, we
were viewed as the only place in the country where drugs was an
issue and where players earned too much money _ about $200,000
apiece.... The only time we ever made the evening news was if a
player got hit by another player, or a story on race or empty
arenas or drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the last year has brought the NBA more bad publicity
for drug abuse (Allen Iverson, Isaiah Rider) and violence (Latrell
Sprewell). But it took the lockout, imposed by owners July 1, to
really smear the league's image and close the book on a decade and
a half of unbridled growth.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that, for the 1983-84 season, average attendance was
10,620 per game, ticket sales were about 10 million and arenas were
filled to about 60 percent of capacity. In 1997-98, attendance
averaged 17,135, ticket sales reached close to 20 million and
arenas were filled past 90 percent capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum salary was $272,500, the median was about $1.3
million, and the top players commanded $10 to $20 million a year.
Coaches too are prospering _ all but four cleared $1 million last
year _ and Stern himself reportedly makes about $7 million (though
he is declining paychecks during the lockout).
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately, the commissioner's paycheck has grown with the
value of the sport he governs. Stern himself grew up with the NBA,
beginning in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-born Stern was 24 when he landed a $7,800-a-year
job with the law firm that handled the league's legal matters. By
1978 he rose to general counsel for the league under Commissioner
Larry O'Brien and six years later succeeded him.
</P>
<P>
   The ascension did not exactly come as a surprise to those who
watched him grow up.
</P>
<P>
   Suns owner Jerry Colangelo recalls, ``I came into the NBA in
1966 with the startup of the Chicago Bulls. David joined the NBA as
in-house counsel a year later, so I have seen him grow and develop
over those 31 years. I recognized early on that he was very bright,
articulate and was an excellent lawyer and saw him develop other
skills, like becoming very adept at a marketing sense and how to
sell a product, which was new ground for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it has been Stern's business and sales acumen as much as
his lawyer skills that has characterized the era. Creation of
subsidiaries, NBA Properties and NBA Entertainment, gave the league
a marketing machine and television production company. Stern also
planted seeds of the league around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   He played a role in the 1976 settlement that brought free agency
to the NBA, helped create the salary cap system that possibly saved
the league and instituted pro sports' first drug policy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Stern didn't turn a flailing league into a
multibillion-dollar corporation on his own. For that, he owes much
to Magic, Larry and Michael. But Stern helped channel all that
charisma, skill and drama into an entertainment dynasty.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Regardless of how these negotiations turn out, Stern's place in
sports history is cemented in the same bracket as the NFL's Pete
Rozelle.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Stern, I think, is one of the most brilliant sports
executives in the history of modern-day sports,'' said Steve Wood,
a player agent and professor of sports business at Clark Atlanta
University.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the lockout nears the six-month mark and polls show
increasing disdain and disinterest in the league, the intertwined
fortunes of the league and its esteemed leader are in peril.
</P>
<P>
   Is the presumed genius of Stern finally failing? Not exactly. In
fact, quite possibly the opposite. Some observers, including
agents, say he's never been more effective than during this
lockout.
</P>
<P>
   He planned ahead by securing a four-year, $2.6 billion
television contract that provided the league income even without
games being played. He's strategically refused to set a drop-dead
date for saving the season to keep his adversary off kilter.
</P>
<P>
   And he has done his best to undermine the union by playing off
the lower- and middle-income players against the superstars, whose
salaries he wants to cap. Late last week he took that approach to
the extreme, directly mailing a nine-page proposal, aimed at the
middle class, to all 430 players, circumventing union leadership.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part the players have stood firm, but in recent
weeks, having missed three paychecks, several have broken ranks
with the union. In a union conference call, numerous agents lobbied
union head Billy Hunter to compromise and settle.
</P>
<P>
   And while Stern continues to publicly posture about how far
apart the two sides are, it is the players' association that has
arguably made the most concessions to date _ among them, a cap on
some superstar salaries, a decrease from 20 percent to 10 percent
on annual pay raises and longer rookie contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Stern's strategy is long term, and the lesson here is the NBA is
trying to avoid the fate of other pro sports leagues, notably Major
League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball owners lost their fight for salary controls during the
1994 strike, and the result is the current spending spree that's
created a huge competitive chasm between rich teams and poor teams.
The current hand-wringing among baseball owners could portend a
labor battle for the ages in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Stern is trying to avoid the same Band-Aid approach baseball
took, only to have things get worse.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he'll spend his days watching the league he
resurrected take daily beatings from media and fans, knowing the
damage could be permanent if his gambit doesn't get the desired
results.
</P>
<P>
   Stern's success is the league's success, and likewise the
league's failings will be tied to the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Stern's image) is already tarnished,'' said agent
Marc Fleisher. ``I don't think David could ever get back to where
he was prior to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Colangelo: ``Is his stomach churning over this whole state
of events? Sure it is. As is mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Stern lets it show.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I took it personally, I wouldn't be able to do it,'' he
says. ``I've been doing this since 1967, and we've been in some
real donnybrooks. This is one of the best.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to come out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   So says Easy Dave.

BRONCOS STILL SEE GREATNESS AHEAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few weeks before last Sunday's loss to the New York Giants, a
team of reporters asked the Denver Broncos about their chance of
becoming just the second team in modern NFL history to go
undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we play like we can,'' linebacker Bill Romanowski was
saying back then, ``nobody out there can beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to think we line up every week as the better team,''
backup quarterback Bubby Brister was saying back then, ``which
gives us a great shot at going unbeaten.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan is to not only go 16-0, but to get into the playoffs,
then through the Super Bowl, and go 19-0,'' cornerback Ray Crockett
was saying back then. ``That'd make us the greatest team ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Shy, reticent types, these Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, they're so reluctant to talk about greatness that now,
even after the loss, they're still talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   Says Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe: ``I'll take an 18-1
record \Rregular season and postseason combined\S and we're still
better than the '72 Dolphins.''
</P>
<P>
   Them's fightin' words in Miami, where the Broncos play for win
No. 14 tomorrow night. But they shouldn't come as a shock, because
the Broncos' plan remains the same: Denver, 13-1 after the Giants
loss, can still forge a season that allows it to rank with ``the
greatest teams ever.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at a bigger picture now,'' Crockett said.
``Combine what we've done before with what we have a chance to do
now, and history will still remember us as something special.''
</P>
<P>
   Because even NFL historians have short memories _ pro football
may be the ultimate ``What have you done for me lately?'' business
_ it takes a moment to recall how strange it is that this
collection of NFLers would be the team that threatened immortality.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback John Elway, 38, considered retirement before this
season and has been banged up enough that backup Brister might as
well be considered Denver's co-starter. The offensive line lost
Brian Habib to free agency and Gary Zimmerman to retirement, two
good reasons to figure running back Terrell Davis wouldn't be as
good as he was in 1996 or '97, when he rushed for 1,117 and 1,750
yards, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, Sharpe has caught at least 53 passes per season. But
the starters at wide receiver, Rod Smith and Ed McCaffrey, don't
have that kind of pedigree. Smith was not drafted out of college.
McCaffrey was picked up off waivers. The debate rages in Denver
whether their present success is a product of their talent or of
teaming with Elway in coach Mike Shanahan's system.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, linebacker John Mobley and lineman Trevor Pryce are
future stars, and safety Steve Atwater and end Neil Smith are
backside-of-their-career stars. But otherwise, Romanowski's
well-orchestrated campaign to be known as a Butkus-like linebacking
monster notwithstanding, it's hardly a celebrity-studded group.
</P>
<P>
   So, entering this year _ though it required study beyond just
press clippings _ there were legitimate questions about how good
this team was, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Combine all that with the normal challenge of following a Super
Bowl title season with a similarly charged effort, and America
should be more surprised at the Broncos' excellence than it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the result of what Mike Shanahan does,'' Crockett said.
``He's the guy who sets the tone of being low-key but having high
expectations. We expect to be great, so we handle winning pretty
matter-of-factly.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, privately, some of the Broncos simply assume their trip
to Miami will result in another victory as they march toward the
inevitable. The presence of coach Jimmy Johnson and quarterback Dan
Marino on the opposition add some luster to the battle, to be sure.
But. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's how you do it,'' said Sharpe, mockingly helping any
team attempting to repeat what the Giants did. ``Somehow stop
Terrell Davis. Then you hope John Elway has a cold and Bubby
Brister's on vacation. It's your only hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants proved that boast incorrect. But the Broncos do win
most on-paper battles with the Dolphins. Then comes the Week 16
meeting with Seattle. And then the postseason, where the Jaguars
and the Broncos have become each other's nemesis. Could the likely
showdown be a great matchup? Sure. But the game will be at Mile
High Stadium, in January, when the Broncos increase their
psychological edge. Oh, and by the way: Denver already played the
potent Jags once this year, and beat them, 37-24.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've felt the same way for a long time around here,'' Sharpe
said. ``We're a team destined to do something special. We're a team
with a purpose.''

WHEN COWBOYS' GROUNDHOG PEEKS, HE MAY SEE MUSHROOM CLOUD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In keeping with local custom, sometime around dusk today the
official Valley Ranch groundhog, Punxatawney Jerry, will emerge
from his luxury burrow and survey the surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   If the sun is setting on his beloved Cowboys, you know what that
means:
</P>
<P>
   Two more weeks of the NFL season. Tops.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, they'll probably beat the Philadelphia Eagles today. It'll
amount to a mercy killing, judging from the way that Philly coach
Ray Rhodes has been talking.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles are 3-11 and scorching the end zone at the rate of 10
points per game, which sounds like a misprint but isn't.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether rumors of his coaching demise have been
exaggerated, Rhodes answered last week, ``Let's be realistic. We've
had a terrible season. What do you expect is going to happen?''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles learned the other day that, for the first time in 27
years, the franchise would not have a representative in the NFL's
Pro Bowl. However, six former Eagles have been selected to play,
representing their new teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles' seasonlong plunge has not stopped Cowboys owner
Jerry Jones from declaring today's scrimmage ``as big a game as
we've had here at Texas Stadium in the past two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jones is no stranger to hyperbole, but maybe he simply
sees the train coming from the other end of the tunnel. It's been
that kind of month.
</P>
<P>
   A more intriguing assessment figures to come in January,
whenever the (a) mushroom cloud or (b) hand of the Almighty
disappears from above the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cowboys aren't a Super Bowl team, if they don't even get
to the game's threshold, what does it mean?
</P>
<P>
   Will the new generation of Cowboys fans accept it? Better still,
will the brain trust at Cowboys, Inc.?
</P>
<P>
   Let's see. The last time that a major reconstruction took place
at Valley Ranch, they began by firing Tom Landry. So that's out.
</P>
<P>
   They traded Herschel Walker. Can't pull that scam again.
</P>
<P>
   And they drafted Troy Aikman. Eureka _ a lifeboat.
</P>
<P>
   Except that Cowboys diehards refuse to accept the notion that
this team needs a major retooling. They point to the injuries of
this season _ who knew Aikman and Deion Sanders would each miss
five or more games? They point to the twin 13-12 defeats at the
hands of Oakland and Chicago. They point to new blood like Flozell
Adams and Michael Myers.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what they're pointing at, though. Are they saying
the current Cowboys are better than 8-6, or that the future already
appears brighter?
</P>
<P>
   It's much too early to proclaim the latter. And the former
point, let me suggest, doesn't really matter.
</P>
<P>
   This is a trophy kind of town, and there is no jewelry that
comes with losing in the second round of the NFC playoffs. Cowboys
apologists can say that the Super Bowl was never the prize, that
all along this was only to be a season of healing from the Switzer
era, but how convenient.
</P>
<P>
   No, the common chant being heard in September at Valley Ranch
was that, armed with a new coach, the Cowboys possessed playoff
talent that, by December, would be deemed artful enough to make
their familiar Super Bowl run.
</P>
<P>
   Haven't heard that one in weeks, however.
</P>
<P>
   So now what?
</P>
<P>
   Around the league, writers are calling the Cowboys old and
saddlesore. That's not entirely correct. Guard Nate Newton is 37
and qualifies as old. He has had a lackluster month.
</P>
<P>
   But you'd think there should be an earnest playoff sweat left in
Aikman, who is 32, and in Michael Irvin (32), Daryl Johnston (32),
Sanders (31), Smith (29) and Leon Lett (30).
</P>
<P>
   Next year they will all be a year older, with no replacements in
sight.
</P>
<P>
   Chan Gailey can't afford to make the mistakes (see the 1995
draft) that the former regime made. The Cowboys will need help just
to get this far in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, it's only Ray Rhodes and the already
plucked-and-basted Eagles making a Christmas visit this time.
</P>
<P>
   A big game? Well, if the owner insists.
</P>
<P>
   But come back in two weeks and see the mushroom cloud.

HUNTER HAS KEPT HIS TROOPS IN LINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Billy Hunter can spew obtuse phrases like ``escrow
tax,'' and ``BRI'' with the best of them. And he does. But scrape
away all the lawyer-speak and finance mechanism double-talk, and
the director of the NBA players' union is, at his core, the one
thing his clients needed most:
</P>
<P>
   A politician.
</P>
<P>
   History will show Hunter failed in his lone foray into
professional politics _ an unsuccessful attempt in 1990 to unseat
Oakland Congressman Ron Dellums. But as the appointed figurehead of
430 NBA players, Hunter has proven to be an adept leader of a
complex constituency.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-year-old former U.S. attorney has done exactly what his
opponent, NBA Commissioner David Stern, presumed couldn't be done:
maintained the unity of his troops _ from the superstars to the
scrubs, the $33 million franchise player down to the $272,000 12th
man.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Hunter has so far protected the financial gains of
NBA players _ and protracted the league's lockout. How you judge
those results depends on your point of view.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing is certain: season or no season, good deal or bad,
Hunter has become a force equal to Stern in the basketball
marketplace and has justified his rank as the 40th most powerful
person in sports in a recent magazine poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has great political skills, the players respect him, he's
an ex-athlete, he's quite eloquent, he's tough, he's a no-nonsense
kind of guy,'' says agent Marc Fleisher. ``The vibe I'm getting
from players is they're willing to stand shoulder to shoulder with
him and fight the fight, which is something a number of us were not
sure of early on.''
</P>
<P>
   That shoulder-to-shoulder stance is the players' greatest
leverage in this $2 billion standoff. United they profit; divided,
they'd settle for less.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter knew this when he took the job in 1996. A battle-tested
lawyer who once represented the tobacco industry, Hunter was a
newcomer to labor negotiations. But as a one-time agent to former
rap stars Hammer and Bobby Brown, he knew the power held by the
paid talent.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the talent was a group of 400-plus athletes, so he
began his term by logging frequent-flier miles. Like any
politician, he needed to kiss some babies to win support.
</P>
<P>
   So Hunter visited all 28 NBA cities to meet with players, many
of whom felt burned by former director Simon Gourdine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent two years developing trust among my players and
proving that I could do the job in a competent and professional
manner,'' Hunter says. ``My only agenda was to demonstrate that I
was available to them.... When I go into a locker room, I talk to
every guy. I don't just go to the superstars. Everybody is
important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years and one lockout ago, things were different.
Superstars fought union leaders, powerful agents like David Falk
led a drive to decertify the players' association. Gourdine, a
former NBA attorney, was viewed with distrust by players.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the deal signed by players and owners under that
cloud in 1995 proved just as problematic as many feared. Top player
salaries skyrocketed _ Shaquille O'Neal got $121 over seven years,
unproven Kevin Garnett got $126 million, Michael Jordan began
signing one-year deals in excess of $30 million per season _ but
the middle class disappeared as one-fourth of the union's members
signed minimum-salary deals.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's job, then, combined impossible elements: protect the
gains of the superstars and restore the middle class at the same
time, all the while somehow meeting the concerns of NBA owners, who
were spending themselves into a ditch.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tall order for someone negotiating his first collective
bargaining agreement, but Hunter has never shied away from a
challenge. Or an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager growing up in Cherry Hill, N.J., Hunter attended
a school with fewer than 20 other African-Americans and a handful
of Jews. His circle of friends included both, and that coalition of
minorities was sometimes forced to protect its honor the
old-fashioned way _ in fistfights with less-progressive white
students.
</P>
<P>
   In his professional life, Hunter proved just as aggressive. He
prosecuted surviving members of the Jim Jones cult 20 years ago and
helped convince President Jimmy Carter to pardon Patricia Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in private practice in Oakland, Hunter represented R.J.
Reynolds and Philip Morris as a member of the tobacco industry's
litigation team.
</P>
<P>
   But he also donated his time to friends and neighbors and sought
out public service, traveling around the world on trade missions
for the Oakland Port Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think I'm an eclectic person,'' Hunter says with a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing, it would seem, could sufficiently prepare Hunter
for his next career move, leaving private practice to become the
figurehead for perhaps the richest labor union in the known
universe.
</P>
<P>
   But as in the past, Hunter has been tireless in pursuit of his
clients' interests. That has meant seven-day work weeks, heading
home at 11 p.m. some nights, traveling a week or two each month to
visit players and no vacation in 2{ years, save the occasional long
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing short of that would suffice, though. Unlike Stern, whose
clientele is limited to 29 owners, Hunter's employer has 430
mouths. Add several dozen agents on top of that, all with opinions
and interests of their own, and you wonder if Hunter's reported
$675,000 salary is perhaps insufficient.

LOS ANGELES: perhaps insufficient. 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hunter has taken his share of abuse. He's viewed by the public
as the apologist for the greedy '90s athlete, by many NBA officials
as a tool of agent David Falk and by some of his own constituents
as beholden to the superstars.
</P>
<P>
   There have been chinks in Hunter's armor of unity.
Lower-salaried players and a handful of agents have taken
occasional shots at union leadership. Former union presidents from
Bob Cousy to Isiah Thomas have become outspoken critics.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter is unfazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are guys who are employed by the league (as TV
commentators),'' he said of Cousy and Thomas. ``They've been sent
out to do the bidding of the owners.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering players have lost $400 million to date, one might
expect widespread mutiny by now. But within current player ranks,
voices of dissent have been few even as the season nears possible
cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy Hunter has done a masterful job of keeping 400 guys
unified,'' said agent Steve Woods, but the compliments end there.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, perhaps the union's most vocal critic, said Hunter spent
time unifying players when he should have been learning the
league's finances and forging relationships with Stern and NBA
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's strategy, Woods said, is fatally flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unity that exists with the NBA players right now exists
upon a phantom platform of rhetoric, divisiveness and ignorance of
the facts,'' he charged, predicting, ``this is (Hunter's) first and
last sports labor negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other critics of the union, Woods argues that Hunter's
leadership has sacrificed the interests of the lower-salaried
players while alienating owners and killing the storied
``partnership'' forged by Stern and players 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baloney,'' counters Fleisher, the agent and son of former
union director Larry Fleisher. ``Total baloney. The only way the
players ever got anything was from one of three ways: litigation,
the threat of striking the playoffs and All-Star Game and the
threat of decertification.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which, of course, requires a unified front.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter has had his missteps, including failed litigation and
labor grievances this summer which only delayed negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But he's proven Stern's equal in the art of the deal. When Stern
ordered team executives to contact and lobby their players, Hunter
fired off memos and phone calls to make sure they heard the union's
version.
</P>
<P>
   And when Stern late last week overnight-mailed a nine-page
contract proposal directly to players, circumventing Hunter, the
union responded quickly with a 19-page retort and analysis that
also went straight to the membership.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's letter picked apart Stern's appeal section by section
and in typical Hunter fashion, he used the opportunity to rally the
troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason (the owners) have not been able to completely
impose their will upon us,'' he wrote, ``is because the players
have stayed strong through several missed paychecks, and shown once
and for all that we will stand up for our principles, even if it
involves sacrificing the season.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that last part, about the canceled season, that worries
players most. It's not just the $1 billion in lost salaries. It's
the long-term effects. And the backlash. Players already are losing
the public relations battle in this war, and they will be the ones
blamed if the season _ and the league _ goes into the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, the former advocate for Big Tobacco, is thus in familiar
territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know everyone is not going to like what I do,'' he says.
``I'm not trying to win any kind of contests where I've gotta have
people liking me. What I have to do is make sure my constituents
are happy with the job I'm doing. To quote Harry Truman, `If you
can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.' ''

POSTCARDS FROM THE LEDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ricky Williams in the house and Roger Clemens maybe on the way.
What next, a change in the Rangers colors to say, burnt orange? A
hook-'em-Horns banner across Home Run Porch?
</P>
<P>
   Things haven't gotten that drastic, although it began to look
that way last week when the Rangers risked losing a utility
infielder who could very well make their 25-man roster next spring
in order to acquire University of Texas' Heisman Trophy winner
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   And who spent last weekend schmoozing and celebrating with
Williams after he won the Heisman in New York? Rangers' owner/UT
mover-and-shaker Tom Hicks, that's who.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance certainly was that Hicks had pulled off the
biggest act of cronyism by a Rangers' owner since Brad Corbett
ordered general manager Eddie Robinson to protect his buddy John
Ellis, who was rehabbing from a badly broken ankle, in the 1977
expansion draft and lost promising right-hander Jim Clancy to
Toronto instead.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, says general manager Doug Melvin. It's just a case of a
GM knowing what might please his owner and acting on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all my idea,'' Melvin claims. ``I'd tried to work a
trade with Philadelphia to get him and couldn't do it. This
\Rgetting Williams from Montreal for $100,000 cash after the Expos
took him in the Rule V draft last week at the winter meetings\S was
better because it didn't cost us any players.''
</P>
<P>
   It almost did. The Rangers had to bump shortstop Scott Sheldon _
who hit 29 home runs at Triple A last year and is expected to
battle for a job as backup to Royce Clayton this spring _ off the
40-man roster and place him on waivers, meaning Sheldon could have
been claimed by another team. Fortunately, the Rangers found out
yesterday that he had cleared waivers and assigned him to the
Oklahoma roster. It would have been a crime if Sheldon had been
lost because of this move.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, expected to be one of the top two or three picks in
the NFL draft next April, has struggled in his two brief stints in
the Phillies' farm system since being selected in the eighth round
in June of '95.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has good bat speed and he can run,'' Melvin said, ``plus
I'm a character guy. When we asked him who his favorite football
player was growing up, he didn't have one. But when we asked him
about baseball, he immediately said Tony Gwynn.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was only a mediocre football player, I think he'd be
playing baseball, period.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when Melvin told Hicks that he was getting Williams,
the Rangers' owner was delighted.
</P>
<P>
   You could call it brown-nosing, but burnt-orange nosing might be
more accurate. ...
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Williams will get an invitation to spring training. Too bad
Will Clark won't be there to address the subject of Ricky's
dreadlocks in ``The Thrill's'' inimitable way. ...
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmm. Manager Johnny Oates made it to Austin for the big PR
bonanza at the Williams' announcement, but couldn't stick around an
extra day for a little Christmas cheer at the team's annual holiday
luncheon with the media. What, we eat one too many Bloomin' Onions
or something?. ...
</P>
<P>
   Here's the skinny on the holdup on the Clemens deal with the
Rangers, according to someone who should know: If the Rangers
refuse to give up Ivan Rodriguez, Rusty Greer or Ruben Mateo, then
the Blue Jays want the pitcher they get back in the trade to be
upgraded to 20-game winner Rick Helling. The Rangers, so far, have
stuck to offering Esteban Loaiza. ...
</P>
<P>
   Agent Jeff Moorad (Steve Young, Troy Aikman, Pudge Rodriguez,
Clark, et al) has sent out beautiful cards featuring photos of
himself, his wife and two great-looking kids. On his desk are of a
couple of props for the photo, including a very readable plaque
that says: ``Show Me The Money!'' And you thought it might say
something seasonal like, ``Peace on Earth, Good Will Toward
Men?''...
</P>
<P>
   One reason to worry about the Frogs against Southern Cal at the
Sun Bowl: The Trojans put nine men on the line against Notre Dame,
dared the Irish to pass the ball, and stuffed their running game.
TCU threw for two touchdowns all season and starting quarterback
Patrick Batteaux didn't get his first until the final game against
winless UNLV. ...
</P>
<P>
   Ted Davis, the former Mavs' radio play-by-play man? His bio in
the Milwaukee Bucks' media guide also lists him as a former ``radio
voice of the Texas Rangers.'' He did once spell the late Mark Holtz
for a week when Alice was ill, but we're a little sensitive about
who gets to be called ``voice of the Rangers'' and Teddy, while a
nice guy, isn't one of them. ...
</P>
<P>
   Remember minor-league second baseman Warren Morris, who went to
Pittsburgh for Loaiza? He just hit .307 (fifth) in the Arizona Fall
League with 8 home runs (tied for second) and 27 runs batted in
(fifth) and impressed his manager, Reds coach Ken Griffey Sr.
``He's a flat-out, bona fide hitter,'' Griffey said. ``I don't see
any problems with his game.'' The Pirates will start Morris at
Triple A this season and hope he'll be their starting second
baseman in 2000. ...
</P>
<P>
   Keep an eye on this: Jim Bronner, agent for Rangers outfielder
and A.L. MVP Juan Gonzalez, isn't exactly beating down Melvin's
door, trying to get a contract extension for his client. ``He's not
pushing it at all,'' Melvin says, which could mean Bronner intends
to prod Gonzalez toward free agency and a move-over-Kevin Brown
contract....
</P>
<P>
   And a very merry Christmas to my new hero, Mavs forward Chris
Anstey, who had a quote in this section last week that bears
repeating: ``What's the difference if you make $10 million a year
or $9 million a year?'' Anstey told our Dwain Price. ``How much
difference does it make to your lifestyle? It's going to be more
than most people see in a lifetime anyway. Everyone should just be
thankful for what they've got and play the game they love.''
</P>
<P>
   A tip of the egg nog glass to Chris and the happiest of holidays
to you and and yours.
REVO'S RIMSHOTS Based on Kevin Greene's choke hold on a Panthers
assistant coach last weekend, he'll definitely have post-football
career opportunities in politics. Maybe even as Jesse ``The Body''
Ventura's running mate in a future tag-team assault on the White
House. Let's see somebody talk impeachment then.
</P>
<P>
   Nate Newton selected to the Pro Bowl? It's the punch line to a
Jay Leno joke, right? Obviously the votes must have been taken
before the Cowboys' past two games.
</P>
<P>
   So how Will Clark, Albert Belle and Cal Jr. co-exist in that
surly Baltimore clubhouse? Clark and Belle are both from Louisiana
but that doesn't mean they'll like each other. And if Will tries
his ``Sheriff'' act on Ripken, he's liable to get his badge taken
away.
</P>
<P>
   So Jerry Jones would like to bring back instant replay, and the
sooner the better. Maybe the call he'd most like to see under
review is the one he made when he hired You-Know-Who back in '94.

TENNESSEE PATIENCE PAID OFF IN VICTORIES  
 VOLUNTEERS GREW INTO THEIR NO. 1 RANKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ The early road to Tempe was filled with
caution signs and construction zones. But by the midway point,
Tennessee went full throttle.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about a team that sent eight players to the NFL in the
off-season prompted the Volunteers to play it safe in the early
going. They limited what new quarterback Tee Martin was allowed to
do, and they waited patiently as an inexperienced defense matured.
</P>
<P>
   It was a winning formula. Tennessee capped an undefeated season
with a No. 1 ranking and a spot in the Fiesta Bowl. The 12
victories include six over ranked teams, and the last three were by
a combined 89 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the season, nobody thought we'd be at the point we
are now,'' linebacker Eric Westmoreland said. ``People were
second-guessing us because of all the players we lost, including a
starting quarterback, to the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the eight who advanced to the pros, three were first-round
picks: quarterback Peyton Manning, wide receiver Marcus Nash and
defensive back Terry Fair, a South Mountain High School product.
</P>
<P>
   Most preseason polls had Tennessee ranked near 10th, but Coach
Phillip Fulmer believed his team could finish higher if three goals
were met:
</P>
<P>
   Run the football well enough to lead the Southeastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Improve turnover ratio.
</P>
<P>
   Lead the league in scoring defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers led the SEC in rushing with a 211.3 yards
average. They wound up with a plus-16 turnover margin (sixth in the
nation) after ranking 10th in the league a season ago. And they
allowed 14.4 points a game, just three-tenths short of SEC leader
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seniors, I really challenged them, personally and
publicly,'' Fulmer said. ``They bought into the approach. Then we
started answering all the `ifs.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest ifs involved Martin, who had never started, and a
defense that lost seven starters, including three in the
secondary. &QL; 
Tee time &QL; 
Early in the season, Tennessee took an ultra-conservative approach
with Martin, a junior who had attempted only 12 passes as Manning's
backup last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to ask you to win games for us,'' Fulmer told
him early. ``I'm going to ask you not to lose any.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first four games, Martin completed 35 of 79 passes for
509 yards. The 44 percent effort was the lowest passing percentage
at Tennessee in 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers kept the game plan simple. And as Martin's
confidence grew, their conservativeness drove him crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating. I felt like I was being held back by my
own coaches,'' he said, smiling. ``It was like jail.''
</P>
<P>
   By Game 5, the coaching staff's confidence in Martin matched the
quarterback's. He completed 16 of 26 passes against Georgia and 10
of 14 vs. Alabama. Against South Carolina, he connected on an
NCAA-record 23 straight passes before missing his final attempt and
finishing 23 of 24.
</P>
<P>
   In the Volunteers' final seven games, Martin passed for 1,499
yards, 10 touchdowns and two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's become a real field general,'' cornerback Steve Johnson
said. ``He's got a lot of confidence. It wasn't like that the first
couple of games.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said, ``I think I've exceeded my expectations. I came in
wanting to be the most fundamental quarterback, play smart football
and not lose any games.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that came and more. We had a dream of being undefeated and
competing for a national championship. We got it all. Now here I am
on the Number 1 team in the nation.'' &QL; 
Give me a `D' &QL; 
The Volunteers' defensive concerns included a secondary with three
new starters and a front with questionable health.
</P>
<P>
   The backfield worried the staff most. Cornerback Dwayne Goodrich
was the only one with starting experience. Safety Fred White and
cornerback Steve Johnson had played but were in few big-game
situations.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the season, senior linebacker Al Wilson said, ``They're
going to have to grow up immediately, and I expect them to grow up
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was right,'' White said. ``We didn't have any respect. We
didn't have any big-game experience. We had to come out and show
people that we were going to fight as hard as we had the years
before. And we did.''
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a fast, hard-hitting defense that
specializes in big plays.
</P>
<P>
   There was a four-down, goal-line stand after a turnover against
Georgia. A 90-yard interception return for a touchdown by defensive
end Shaun Ellis against Auburn. And Wilson's 12-tackle performance
vs. Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Defensive coordinator John Chavis) came into this season
knowing we were great athletes but not knowing what kind of team we
were going to be,'' Johnson said. ``He wanted to give us our own
identity. He met with us before the season and said, `We're going
to be a very aggressive defense. If you don't like to be in the
quarterback's face, then you better transfer.'' &QL; 
Odds and ends &QL; 
Fulmer emphasized that the 12-0 record is a product of a team
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Few have been as exciting as wide receiver Peerless Price, who
caught 10 touchdown passes and surpassed 100 yards in three of the
Volunteers' final six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peerless is doing as much with the football as anyone we
have,'' Fulmer said. ``He makes as much happen, per touch, as any
receiver we've had here.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Volunteers endured without tailback Jamal Lewis, who was
lost for the season after suffering a knee injury against Auburn on
Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
   If one thing defined Tennessee in 1998, it was resilience. &QL;

LOSS TO N.C. STATE TURNS FLORIDA STATE'S SEASON AROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ The Bobby Bowden most people know is jovial,
quick-witted and slow to anger. But the Florida State coach was not
in a funny, ha-ha mood Sept. 14, two days after the Seminoles had
been upset, 24-7, at North Carolina State.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked into the team meeting that day, players sat up
straight and listened. Florida State had not lost more than two
games in a season since 1986 and had finished the previous 11
seasons ranked no lower than fourth. Bowden bluntly laid out what
was at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach told us plain and simple, `If you guys don't raise your
level of play, this program is going down,' '' said cornerback
Mario Edwards. ``That right there was enough to open every sleeping
ear.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, who keeps notes of every speech to his team, couldn't
recall exactly what he said without searching through his files.
But he remembers the tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about living off previous team's reputations,'' he
said. ``That was the keynote. (I said) `The reason we were
preseason Number 2 and Number 3 or whatever is because of what last
year's team did. It ain't nothing y'all did. You didn't contribute
anything.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That day seems far away now to the 11-1, second-ranked
Seminoles, who will play No. 1 Tennessee on Jan. 4 in the Fiesta
Bowl. But it was on that Monday when they renewed their commitment
to remaining one of the elite programs in the country.
</P>
<P>
   That day, they looked at each other and vowed not to be
responsible for the beginning of a fall from grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose a game like that, little things creep into the
back of your mind,'' offensive guard Jason Whitaker said. ``Is this
the year the dynasty will fall? It was always in the back of my
mind. I did not want to be here when the dynasty fell, if it is
going to fall.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles are usually national championship contenders, but
Bowden thought his team might be a year away from its best shot at
winning one.
</P>
<P>
   His top quarterback, Dan Kendra, had blown out a knee in the
spring game and was lost for the year. The backup, sophomore Chris
Weinke, had thrown only 13 passes the year before.
</P>
<P>
   There were only four seniors starting on defense and two on
offense. There was immense talent in the freshman and sophomore
classes, and it was thought they wouldn't mature fully for another
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles' confidence grew when they beat Texas A&AMP;M in the
opener. But when North Carolina State, an average team, upset
Florida State, Bowden decided changes needed to be made,
commitments renewed.
</P>
<P>
   Practices were tougher. Players were told that if they didn't
practice, they didn't play.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times you'll do this as a coach,'' Bowden said.
``Things will be going good for you and you're afraid somebody will
get hurt, so you start slacking off. So they have to wake up by
getting beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that game, our philosophy changed. We were going to go
out and do what it takes, not matter if all of them got hurt. We
worked a little bit harder, and we haven't backed down a day since
either.''
</P>
<P>
   There were questions, however, that tougher practices could not
answer. Most of the doubts centered around Weinke, who was
intercepted six times against North Carolina State, a school
record.
</P>
<P>
   All the work in the world wouldn't overcome a quarterback who
didn't play well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris had such a bad day that that was the big question
mark,'' Bowden said. ``Have you got the wrong quarterback? Have you
spent all this time getting this young man ready and he simply
can't play well on Saturday? Those are things going through your
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinke, however, responded. He did not throw an interception in
the next eight games, as the Seminoles proved their loss to North
Carolina State was a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   The young defense, meanwhile, developed beyond anyone's
expectations. It's first in the country in total and passing
efficiency defense and second in scoring and rushing defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to make some decisions about how important winning was
to us and how being better than average, how much that meant to
us,'' defensive coordinator Mickey Andrews said. ``I think we had
some guys who grew up, seniors that accepted more responsibility
and some juniors that acted like seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   There were difficulties along the way. The biggest came in the
10th game, when Weinke suffered a neck injury shortly before
halftime against Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   He was replaced by sophomore Marcus Outzen, who became the
full-time starter when Weinke underwent surgery and was lost for
the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden continued to preach that a national championship was
still a possibility, a theme he had repeated even after the North
Carolina State game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep down, we were thinking, `yeah, right,' '' said receiver
Peter Warrick, the team's most dangerous offensive threat. ``Then
Weinke goes down and we're thinking it's really over now. But
everything happens for a reason, and we're back where we needed to
be.''

YOUNG SCARLET KNIGHTS DONE IN BY VETERAN OWLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PISCATAWAY, N.J. _ They have won back their raucous fans who
have long made this corner of New Jersey one of the coziest,
craziest basketball bastions in the Northeast. They've won seven
games, two of them in the Big East Conference. But the Scarlet
Knights of Rutgers showed they are still a young team in need of
baby steps, crumbling 56-38 Saturday to a seasoned Temple.
</P>
<P>
   Those here in the noisy, sold-out Louis Brown Athletic Center,
however, left assured that Coach Kevin Bannon, in his second year
at Rutgers, has put together a program that is much further along
than Rutgers' surprising football team of 1998 and perhaps worthy
of the same respect that Vivian Stringer's women's team commands.
This team is better than the one that was 14-15, (6-12 Big East)
last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Scarlet Knights play tough defense and they have two budding
stars in the freshmen Dahntay Jones and Rashod Kent. But it was a
dreadful shooting collapse in the first 11 minutes of the second
half that turned an exciting, back-and-forth game into a Temple
blowout. In a span where everything from dunks to free throws
caromed off the rims, Rutgers shot two of 17.
</P>
<P>
   It was all a crafty bunch of struggling Owls needed to stretch a
three- point game into a 15-point lead and, finally, an 18-point
rout. Temple's 6-10 center, Lamont Barnes, knocked in 14 and senior
guard Rasheed Brokenborough scored 23. But it was the Owls'
intricate matchup zone that limited Rutgers to just 29 percent
shooting and kept the Scarlet Knights nearly 30 points below their
season scoring average.
</P>
<P>
   Both Rutgers and Temple needed a victory, but for very different
reasons. The Scarlet Knights wanted to prove their 7-1 start wasn't
a fluke. The team, picked by the Big East's coaches to finish
eighth, had a five-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Owls (5-4) needed to reassert themselves after an early
stretch of hard luck that may have demoralized a team many had
thought was one of Coach John Chaney's best in years. After winning
its first four games, Temple dropped four of the next five by a
combined total of 12 points _ including one-point losses at Indiana
and Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   Temple also lost sophomore guard Lynn Greer, who was averaging
10 points, when he caught an elbow in the eye against Penn State.
That injury, which required surgery early this month, will keep him
out until late February.
</P>
<P>
   Kent and Jones kept Rutgers as close as three points, 25-22, in
a deliberately played first half. Kent, 6-feet-6, 265 pounds,
knocked around Barnes and 6-9 Kevin Lyde as if they were willows.
Kent came into the game averaging 10.9 points on 82 percent
shooting from the field, and he showed how: He's never more than
two feet from the goal.
</P>
<P>
   His two offensive put-backs and bruising defense cleared the
floor for Jones, a 6-5 slasher, to score nine points on a variety
of lane splitting drives. He also had two steals and frustrated the
Owls' veteran back court of Brokenborough and Pepe Sanchez. The two
were six of 13 from the field in the first half and turned the ball
over three times.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Temple managed to shoot better than Rutgers by 38 percent
to 32 percent and make all of its free throws, - including two by
Brokenborough with no time left at the half.

IN SEVILLE, REAL BETIS REBUILDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ For nearly two years, the cathedral bell tower
La Giralda, the symbol of this Andalusian city, has been covered in
scaffolding. The large bronze statue that serves as a weather vane
and has been perched on top since the 1500s has been removed, a
victim of the elements and the centuries. Its much-debated
replacement is not scheduled to be put in place until late
December.
</P>
<P>
   But the Giralda is not the only municipal monument in Seville in
need of scaffolding. The Real Betis soccer club is under
renovation, as well, and soccer meaning what it does in Spain, the
pace of change is much faster.
</P>
<P>
   After paying the world-record sum of $35 million to Sao Paolo FC
for the Brazilian striker Denilson _ outbidding would-be rivals
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona _ Betis finds itself in 14th place in
the 20-team Spanish first division after 14 league matches.
</P>
<P>
   Seven games ago, the club hired its fourth and most recognizable
coach of the young season: Javier Clemente, the pugnacious Basque
who coached the Spanish national team for six years until he was
forced out last month in the wake of Spain's fiasco of a World Cup
and subsequent loss to Cyprus in qualifying for Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be pushed out of the national team affected me a lot
because it was unfair,'' Clemente, who reported to work in Seville
on Wednesday, said. ``The idea of going a whole year without
coaching was something I didn't like, and it was something I liked
even less after what happened to me. I hope I can turn things
around at Betis.''
</P>
<P>
   He has had some success so far, bringing Betis up from last
place. Really, though, there was only one direction to go on the
banks of the Guadalquivir. In its first seven matches, ``Beti,'' as
the s-dropping locals here call it, surrendered a league-high 13
goals and scored only 4. In the game before Clemente was hired, it
was beaten, 5-1, on the road in Valencia, which prompted not only
the resignation but the retirement of the Chilean coach, Vicente
Cantatore.
</P>
<P>
   Cantatore was not the first Betis coach to retire in the last
three months. On July 27, the widely respected Luis Aragones, the
man who was supposed to guide Betis' multibillion-peseta lineup to
new heights resigned for what he said were personal reasons, one of
which reportedly was his resistance to meddling from the club
president, Manuel Ruiz de Lopera. Aragones was replaced by Antonio
Luis Alves de Oliveira, the former coach of Porto, who lasted only
a few weeks and resigned shortly before the season began. Enter and
exit Cantatore, Betis' third coach of the preseason, which was
certainly not what the ambitious Lopera had in mind when he
approved a budget of $80 million for player acquisitions and
salaries this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not asking to be champions but for him to remove the
team from the situation it is in and put us in the top six, where
we belong,'' Lopera said after negotiating a one-year deal with
Clemente in a hurry on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately half of Lopera's budget was spent on Denilson, the
21-year-old who has played in seven league matches and two UEFA Cup
matches and has yet to score a goal or score many points with those
who appreciate value for money. Denilson is clearly a gifted
technician, but his flashy and not always effectual or generous
play has begun to make clear why Brazilian Coach Mario Zagallo
decided to use him only as a substitute during the World Cup this
summer. In a loss to Celta, he was replaced after 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The leap from South American soccer to Europe is seldom
straightforward, however, and the club's avid fans are still more
thankful than resentful that Denilson deemed their team and city
worthy enough to sign on the dotted line. It remains to be seen how
long he stays in favor with Clemente, who made a habit of
emphasizing unity over individual artistry during his tenure with
the Spanish national team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't interest me how much he cost,'' Clemente said.
``What interests me is how he plays. If he cost a lot and plays
well, great. Denilson showed in his country that he was one of the
best players in Brazil and the world. What he needs to do now is
show the same thing but with Betis.''
</P>
<P>
   Having healthy teammates would not hurt. The star striker
Alfonso missed most of the early season with a knee injury that
turned out to be more serious than first thought. Other key players
have also missed games, and losing the Croatian star Robert Jarni
to Real Madrid this summer has not helped either.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been a continuing legal battle between the club
and a construction firm over delays in the renovation and expansion
of its stadium. A Sevillan who made his fortune in real estate
development, Lopera has been the strong and soccer-savvy
personality behind Betis' revival in the 1990's. When Lopera took
over the club, it was in the second division: no isolated
occurrence for an outfit that has long been in the shadow both on
and off the field of its rival, FC Sevilla, from which it split in
the early 20th century. The year after Lopera arrived, the club was
promoted under the direction of Lorenzo Serra Ferrer, and it has
qualified for European competition ever since. Meanwhile, FC
Sevilla was relegated after the 1995-96 season, which was good for
the morale of long-suffering Betis supporters, whose club had
suddenly become fashionable, but bad for the revenue and interest
that the heated intracity rivalry generates.
</P>
<P>
   If Clemente does not continue to improve morale and
performances, Seville, one of the most passionate soccer cities in
Europe and the fourth-largest city in Spain, may again have its
local rivalry: in the second division. &QL;

STEPHENVILLE WINS CLASS 4A DIVISION II TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY PHILLIPS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The best pass-catch combination in Texas high
school football history now has the state records and trophy to
prove it.
</P>
<P>
   If any doubt remained as to whether Stephenville featured
attractions other than quarterback Kelan Luker and receiver Cody
Cardwell, its defense buried that notion.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenville (15-1) shredded the vaunted defense of La Marque
(13-1) and held the Cougars to a season-low scoring output, winning
the Class 4A Division II state championship, 34-7, yesterday at
Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   La Marque's sixth consecutive state title appearance ended
bitterly after victories the past three seasons. The Cougars are
0-3 in title games against Stephenville, having also lost to the
Yellow Jackets in 1993 and '94.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenville scored 34 unanswered points after trailing, 7-0, in
the first quarter. La Marque's previous high for points allowed was
16.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenville also snapped La Marque's 20-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   With 286 yards passing, Luker set state records for passing
yards in a season (4,697) and a career (8,294).
</P>
<P>
   Cardwell (107 catches in 1998) iced his already established
state records for season and career receiving yards, finishing with
2,422 and 4,343 yards, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been so proud of a group of players in my life,''
Stephenville coach Art Briles said. ``We've got unselfish players
who care about each other and that's how you win a state
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   After taking a 7-0 first-quarter lead on Tim Parker's 3-yard
run, La Marque went 17 minutes, 17 seconds without a first down.
Stephenville linebacker Jack Hodges, who prowled the line of
scrimmage, led a stunning defensive effort with 10 tackles (four
for losses), a sack and an interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew all we had to do was execute our defense,'' defensive
end Cal Jillson (two sacks) said. ``Our coaches were putting us in
the right spot. We were confident, even when we were losing.''
</P>
<P>
   While the defense held La Marque's running game (89 yards) well
below its season average (213), Stephenville's offense scored on
five consecutive drives to take a 27-7 lead. It began with a tight,
18-yard scoring toss by Luker to T.J. Douglas for a 7-7 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Kicker J.W. Boren's 28-yard field goal and a 33-yard touchdown
pass to Chris Evatt (five catches, 104 yards) by Luker gave
Stephenville a 17-7 halftime lead. The 17 points before the half
came within 6 minutes, 49 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still felt like we could win at halftime,'' La Marque coach
Larry Walker said. ``But we had some breakdowns and didn't
execute.''
</P>
<P>
   From Stephenville's first score until game's end, defenders
Hodges, Jillson, Clayton Harmon, B.J. Mercer, Clark Boone, Craig
Parks (blocked punt), Keith McCormick and Brady Gunn put a clamp on
La Marque that the Cougars won't soon forget.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenville's first two second-half drives resulted in a Boren
44-yard field goal for 20-7 lead. The bottom later fell out of La
Marque's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Luker converted a third-down pass to Cardwell for 10 yards and
then had all day to hit Evatt for 39 yards to the La Marque 5-yard
line. Running back Jimmy Ferrazas ran it in to give the Yellow
Jackets a 27-7 third-quarter lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a real good defense,'' Cardwell said. ``We knew our
offense was a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Luker said knowing he could throw on La Marque by halftime was a
comfort. With 4:53 to play, he was celebrating on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone works their butt off for so long,'' Luker said. ``If
you get here and don't win it, you get your heart broken. You want
it to be worth it.''

IRAQI NATIVE A U.S. CITIZEN AND CRITIC OF BOTH NATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Farouk Al-Hashimi, native of Baghdad and citizen of the United
States, is condemned as a betrayer by his Iraqi family, and perhaps
by some of his fellow Americans.
</P>
<P>
   As bombs and famine ravage the cradle of Islam, relatives see
Farouk as a brainwashed Westerner who defends the U.S. system and
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a traitor in their eyes,'' he admits sadly. ``You know
why? Because I have food. I have a car and a home. I am an enemy
because I don't feel what they feel. I don't suffer what they
suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 58-year-old Muslim may also be vilified by some
Americans because he is a bitter critic of American military and
economic strategies which, he claims, subjected his family to bombs
and hunger for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is playing games,'' Farouk says. ``America's
policy in the Middle East is ruled by two things. Oil, No. 1. And
Israel, No. 2.''
</P>
<P>
   The unemployed banker and Islamic Sunday school teacher has
straddled this unsteady fence between nations, cultures and faiths
for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife is American,'' Farouk noted. ``Her nephews fought with
American troops in Kuwait. My nephews fought for the Iraqi army in
Basra.''
</P>
<P>
   In a voice tinged with pride, humility and nostalgia, he
recounts the personal saga that led from the Arabian desert to the
Sonoran.
</P>
<P>
   Farouk said he is one of 11 children born into a Sunni family
that traces its Baghdad history 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   After enrolling at the University of Baghdad, he spent two years
reporting for a progressive Iraqi newspaper, ``The People,'' then
gained an economics degree in 1963. He was drafted into the army,
rose to the level of first lieutenant, and planned a military
career.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1968, however, Saddam Hussein and his Baath Socialist
Party came to power. Farouk fled to the United States and enrolled
at Detroit's Wayne State University, where he met Sally Eperjesy.
</P>
<P>
   A Hungarian-American Catholic woman. An Islamic Arab immigrant.
Worlds collided, merged into marriage and moved to Phoenix for a
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been a good example of how Christians and Muslims
should live together in peace and understanding,'' Farouk says.
</P>
<P>
   He attended the American Institute of Banking. Two siblings also
moved to Phoenix. But there is another family 7,600 miles away.
Farouk said he tried to reach his oldest brother before this week's
missile attacks, but could not get through.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier letters and phone calls, he added, they have told of
conditions in Baghdad. Farouk said the bread is so stale and stiff
that it cannot be chewed unless it is first dampened and warmed. He
said a niece wheezes from asthma because there is no medicine, and
his brother's high blood pressure led to a stroke for the same
reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say I am the most brainwashed American,'' Farouk added.
``They don't understand anymore what I say because of their
suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Iraqis hate Saddam, Farouk added. The dictator has executed
those who plot rebellion, including soldiers and two
brothers-in-law. He has tortured and killed imams. Farouk says
Saddam would not receive 1 percent of the vote if Iraq held open
elections.
</P>
<P>
   But starving people are more concerned with survival than
rebellion, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot lift a finger if you don't have food in your
stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, the Iraqis also despise an American government
that has blockaded supplies and bombarded cities, Farouk said.
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment is true through much of the Arab world, even among
allies.
</P>
<P>
   Farouk said Muslims see the United States as an ``arrogant
bully'' not just becaL &QC;

LENDERS SOFTENING THE RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Traditionally, the relationship between borrowers and lenders
has been defined by two assumptions, both seemingly
self-contradictory: One was that to obtain credit, a person had to
establish a good credit history. The second was that lenders
generally preferred to make loans to those who didn't need them.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, the traditional rules for lending have
softened significantly _ particularly with respect to mortgages and
home equity loans. Now, credit experts say, borrowers who are
already in debt are often welcome to borrow more. And those whose
track records have been less than perfect _ even abysmal _ are
often given another chance to prove themselves good bets as
borrowers. ``Basically, you can get a mortgage today even if you've
been through bankruptcy,'' said Gerri Detweiler, education adviser
for Debt Counselors of America, a consumer advocacy organization
based in Rockville, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Detweiler said that while there had always been lenders
willing to lend money to those with less than perfect credit, such
loans were typically short-term and at relatively high interest.
Now, however, it is possible for those who have had credit problems
to get long-term mortgages or home equity loans from lenders who in
the past would have rejected such borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   And while those with blemishes on their credit histories are
still likely to pay higher interest rates, she said, those rates
can usually be renegotiated if the borrower re-establishes a good
payment record. ``The bottom line is that there are lots of
opportunities out there for borrowers,'' Ms. Detweiler said. ``Even
borrowers with bad credit.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the less-than-perfect credit market is increasing so
significantly that Intuit, the Mountain View, Calif., company that
markets Quicken software and sponsors an Internet site for those
seeking home mortgages (www.quickenmortgage.com), recently added
lenders who specialize in so-called ``subprime'' loans to its Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``These borrowers represent from 15 to 20 percent of the
market,'' said Alison Berkley, group product manager for the
company. Ms. Berkley said borrowers who visit the Quicken Mortgage
site and whose credit history is ``less than perfect'' would be
referred to one of four new lenders affiliated with the site. ``We
have a product called the `Back on Track Loan,' '' said Shelly
Porges, executive vice president of new business initiatives for
The Money Store, a home equity lender based in Sacramento, Calif.,
that is now a participating lender on the Quicken Mortgage Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   She explained that with the new program, homeowners who have had
problems paying off high-interest credit-card debt could get a
home-equity loan to consolidate that debt. And while the interest
rate on the loan is generally higher than the rate for those with
good credit histories _ from one to several percentage points more,
depending on the severity of past credit problems _ it is typically
lower than rates charged on credit cards. Also, Ms. Porges said,
the interest rate on the loan will be steadily decreased after each
year of on-time payments.
</P>
<P>
   She added that while most conventional lenders relied upon
mathematical formulas and credit scoring to determine a borrower's
eligibility, her company, which specializes in the ``subprime''
market, also takes into consideration a borrower's personal
explanation for past credit problems. ``We often call our loans
`story loans' because we listen to the borrower's story and try to
understand the circumstances,'' she said. ``And that allows us to
be more flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   But even conventional lenders seem to be increasingly willing to
offer ``subprime'' borrowers an understanding ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The human element is unquestionably a factor in underwriting
today,'' said Oded Ben-Ami, senior loan officer for Sterling
National Mortgage, based in Great Neck, N.Y. Mr. Ben-Ami said that
while most lenders use traditional underwriting factors like
income, credit history and loan-to-value ratios to determine
whether a particular loan is acceptable, they have become more
flexible when weighing those factors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, credit-reporting bureaus usually provide
lenders a credit score for a prospective borrower. That score,
Ben-Ami said, is typically based upon a variety of factors,
including the frequency and severity of late payments, the total
amount of debt outstanding, the number of credit lines open and the
proportion of debt that is outstanding to credit available in the
form of unused credit limits on credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every factor has its own weight,'' he said, pointing out that
the last-mentioned factor _ the proportion of debt outstanding to
credit available _ is deemed quite important. ``People who are
maxed out on their credit cards are statistically regarded as
default, foreclosure or bankruptcy risks,'' Ben-Ami said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, even those who have significant
amounts of outstanding debt could be considered reasonable credit
risks if their payment history is good and their income is high
enough to allow them to continue making payments on outstanding
debt even with the additional expense of the new loan.
</P>
<P>
   And while late payments generally have a negative effect on a
borrower's credit rating, Ben-Ami said, not all late payments are
accorded the same weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're applying for a mortgage, a late mortgage payment
is the worst late payment of all,'' he said, explaining that
generally speaking, car loans and boat loans are next on the
late-payment-impact hierarchy followed by bank credit cards,
revolving charge accounts, student loans and gas credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Ben-Ami said, the weight accorded to late payments can
be minimized if a reasonable explanation is provided. While every
negative item on a credit report will have a detrimental impact, he
said, explanations are always entertained.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the underwriter wants is an exculpatory explanation,''
Ben-Ami said. ``They want to hear that the problem wasn't the
borrower's fault or that it was the result of extenuating
circumstances _ like sickness or a temporary job loss _ that are no
longer a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized that any items listed on a credit report as being
in collection or in ``charge-off'' status _ meaning that the lender
has either sent the matter to a collection agency or has given up
trying to collect the debt _ must be satisfied and removed from the
credit report before another lender will make a new loan.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, neither bankruptcy nor even a prior
foreclosure are absolute bars to borrowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Standard underwriting guidelines allow for mortgages to be
approved when there's been a bankruptcy that has been discharged
for at least three years,'' he said. Foreclosures, he said,
generally require four to five years' passage, and then only with a
very good explanation. ``Foreclosure is a mortgage lender's
nightmare,'' he said. ``There is no explanation that will be
accepted without some suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ben-Ami said, the mortgage-lending market is so
competitive _ particularly in the area of ``subprime'' lending _
that given sufficient income and equity in the property being
mortgaged, along with a willingness to pay anywhere from 2 to 8
percentage points more in interest _ even borrowers with horrible
credit histories can find a lender willing to make a loan. ``There
can be a reasonable explanation for almost anything,'' Ben-Ami
said. ``And time heals all wounds.''

PUNDITS OFTEN STUMBLE IN SEARCHING FOR MARKETS' LOGIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the questionable reasons given for the stock market's
gyrations, the impeachment angle is the most specious.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday's 126-point swoon by the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, a key theme developed by drive-time radio pundits
attributed the market's weakness to investor anxiety about the
impeachment vote. The prospect of a presidential ouster made
marketeers fearful, they opined.
</P>
<P>
   When the market rebounded Tuesday and the Dow recouped its
Monday loss despite intensifying momentum for impeachment, guess
what? The impeachment angle wasn't a subject for discussion when
drive-time commentators were explaining the market's resurgence.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday a reporter from The Wall Street Journal described
how the fears about impeachment ``promise to add more uncertainty
to an already volatile stock market.'' The reporter sought out four
Wall Street worthies willing to say, well ... yes ... maybe ... now
that you mention it ... impeachment might be a worrisome thing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the market had more than impeachment to worry about.
The administration decided to bomb Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson here for stock market players is to keep your eye on
the ball. Even if markets move for no apparent reason, talking
heads always feel compelled to offer a reason. Nobody ever came on
the evening news to announce, ``The stock market did what it did
today for no good reason whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   My favorite bit of related humor is a cartoon with a TV anchor
saying, ``Technology stocks fluctuated wildly on rumors that
technology stocks would fluctuate wildly.''
</P>
<P>
   What's interesting is how the hot-button issues affect
explanations. Those sympathetic to the president's problems, for
instance, seem to think they can help his situation by convincing
investors that impeachment is against their best interests.
</P>
<P>
   That's just not the way the world works, however. Although the
stock market tanked the last time we had an impeachment effort,
there were about a dozen good economic reasons that explained the
market's problems better than the political troubles besetting
America.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing's changed since the Nixon imbroglio. Stock prices in
normal times are mostly driven by corporate earnings. This is true
to some extent today, but with profits eroding, the market
continues to climb. Why? The Federal Reserve has taken it upon
itself to do what it must to make markets happy.
</P>
<P>
   With so much of the world in economic distress, U.S. officials
feel it's in the best interest of Americans to pursue policies that
enhance prosperity both at home and abroad. The Fed is doing its
part by tamping interest rates. This not only helps business and
consumers, but also sustains demand for stocks by making other
investments less attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, though, investors will demand higher earnings
before they bid stock prices higher. Easy money is doing the job
it's supposed to do but can take the stock market only so far.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, what happens in Washington will be a sideshow. While
it's true markets don't like uncertainty, impeachment concerns
don't necessarily translate into uncertainty. A Gore presidency
probably wouldn't be all that much different from a Clinton
presidency between now and 2000.

LAYOFF FRUSTRATES HACKETT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC coach Paul Hackett's frustration continued
Saturday over the Trojans' lackluster practice after their week
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a long ways to go,'' Hackett said. ``We are a
distracted team. We're a different football team compared to the
team that beat Notre Dame.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett blamed the layoff, the length of the season and finals
as the reasons the Trojans are far from being mentally or
physically ready for the Dec.31 Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has never done this before,'' he said. ``There's no
crispness. No tempo.''
</P>
<P>
   USC has not played in a postseason game since the 1996 Rose
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett compared USC's Saturday practice to a spring workout.
USC will have today off, then Hackett intends to have the
first-string offense and defense play against each other to help
raise the level of intensity during practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, we're going to go for it,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   The bowl schedule has also been an adjustment for Hackett, who
is used to the NFL season and was not accustomed to taking a finals
break, or trying to get a team back into shape after a brief
layoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new thing you have to deal with in college,'' Hackett
said. ``It's wonderful going to a bowl, but do we get it done and
win the bowl game? That's what I'm finding out about and it's
discouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Recruits on campus: Some big names continued their recruiting
visits Saturday. Those visiting include defensive lineman Ty Warren
of Bryan, Texas; offensive lineman Lenny Vandermade of Mater Dei;
tailback Onterrio Smith of Sacramento Grant; linebacker Chris
Prosser and lineman Regis Crawford of San Diego Morse; defensive
lineman George Heather of Hancock Junior College and kicker David
Newberry of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Also visiting are four players who already have committed: wide
receiver Kareem Kelly of Long Beach Poly, linebacker Aaron Graham
of Bakersfield and defensive tackles Bernard Riley and Sagan
Atuatasi of Los Alamitos.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbacher commits: Offensive lineman Nate Steinbacher
(6-foot-6, 330 pounds) of Esperanza High in Anaheim gave USC an
oral commitment this weekend. He is the first offensive lineman to
commit and chose USC over Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar staff: Former USC defensive line coach Jeff McInerney
has been named defensive coordinator at Nevada-Las Vegas, where he
will rejoin John Robinson. McInerney was defensive line coach at
Oregon State this past season. Ex-USC players DelVaughn Alexander
and Joe Barry are also on the UNLV coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson hired former Texas offensive coordinator Gene Dahlquist
as his offensive coordinator. Former USC assistant John Jackson is
expected to be named running backs coach and associate head coach.

   For three weeks Tiffany Brown wore a locket containing a picture
of her runaway dog, Sami, a female mixed breed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany had owned the dog for a little more than a year when
Sami ran away from home _ her father's Raytown house. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany has lived in Overland Park with her mother, Laura Brown,
since her parents divorced. Until three months ago the dog lived
there, too, even when Tiffany left for weekends with her father,
Ray Brown. But after escaping the Overland Park yard one too many
times, Sami was taken to Raytown. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the three weeks Sami was missing, Tiffany said, she never
stopped thinking: What if? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her mother and grandmother told her stories of dogs traveling
hundreds of miles to get home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany prayed each day and cried more than her share of tears. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ray Brown scoured his neighborhood, put up posters, took out a
classified ad, offered a reward and called shelters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, Sami ran away from home looking for home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Laura Brown went for the paper Friday morning, Sami
scampered from the bushes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I opened the door and said, `Sami's home.' She came running
down crying, and even the dog was crying,'' Laura Brown said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sami spent most of the day sleeping and could barely stay awake
during a bath. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The dog's journey started in northern Raytown, south of the
Truman Sports Complex, and ended near 91st Street and Antioch Road,
about a mile northeast of Oak Park Mall. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``She has been in my car riding back and forth before, but I
would never in a million years have thought this,'' Ray Brown
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Using the most direct route, Sami would have traveled about 15
miles, crossing Interstate 435, State Line Road, Metcalf Avenue and
the Blue River, among other obstacles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany called Sami's return her ``best Christmas present.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for the dog's new home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gonna keep her,'' Laura Brown said. ``She went to all
that trouble to come home. We're going to keep her.'' &QL;

WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO PRIVATE RYAN, FILMS CAN'T REVEAL TRUE
HORRORS OF WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE POPPER  
 c. 1998 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earlier this year, director Steven Spielberg's movie ``Saving
Private Ryan'' overran box offices, conquered critics, and was
hailed by many as ``the most realistic war film ever made.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amid the onslaught of publicity, however, Richard Snow, the
editor of American Heritage magazine, took a deep breath and
decided that the whole phenomenon was worth a closer look. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we should publish something that carefully examined
both the reaction to `Ryan' and the sudden return of World War II
movies,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seeking a qualified writer, Snow called one of his magazine's
contributing editors, Roger J. Spiller, the George C. Marshall
Professor of Military History at Fort Leavenworth's Command and
General Staff College. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger has thought longer and more intelligently about war than
anyone I know,'' said Snow. ``So I asked him to write an essay
placing `Ryan' in some perspective. At first, though, Roger was
bridling at the idea.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Spiller said recently, he had no desire to see the film
at all. He had been ``thoroughly chilled'' by the pre-release
publicity campaign that claimed ``Ryan'' had accomplished what no
movie had done before _ that in its first 30 minutes alone, it had
captured the true nature of combat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The combat experience is a problem I've been studying for 20
years,'' Spiller said, ``and I didn't want to see it trivialized
yet again. Too many Americans already confuse Hollywood films with
reality. Most of the critics who cheered `Private Ryan,' based
their appraisals on other war movies. I didn't want to be part of
that.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Snow, however, wouldn't be put off. ``I really hectored Roger
until he acquiesced,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Almost unspoken between the two men was the assumption that
although the article's ``hook'' would be an assessment of ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' Spiller's essay would range far beyond that
critique. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it as a chance to say something substantial about combat
and the popular misconceptions that surround it,'' Spiller said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I began studying war because it is the greatest curse mankind
experiences. And combat is the /{sine qua non/} of warfare _ its
dark, essential heart. It is a subject that has not been
particularly well-handled by either military historians or movie
makers.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spiller, 54, a soft-spoken, courtly man, began the task of
examining ``Ryan'' knowing that any significant criticism he made
of the film would be controversial. But he is no stranger to
intellectual conflict. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, for example, in a special issue of /{American
Heritage/}, Spiller literally invited controversy by asserting that
the most overrated of all American generals was Robert E. Lee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Confederate commander, he wrote, may have epitomized
gentlemanly style and conduct, but he ``was also a traitor to his
countrywho led his side from calamity to calamity.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The furious reaction to Spiller's essay surprised even a
seasoned editor like Snow. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God,'' he said recently, ``it produced the most mail of
anything we've ever done. The only way we could surpass that
response would be to print an essay on the most overrated
Savior.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many of the enraged letter writers shared a common set of
assumptions about Spiller. He was, they stated, a wimpy, elitist,
Northeastern, pot-smoking weirdo who knew nothing about war and had
never heard a shot fired in anger. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spiller, a connoisseur of misconception, quietly savored the
irony. For he is a native Texan, the son of a Texas Ranger. And he
is an Air Force veteran who has indeed heard shots ``fired in
anger.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He earned his doctorate at Louisiana State University, where he
studied military history under Pulitzer-prize winning historian T.
Harry Williams (author of /{Lincoln and his Generals/}). And in
addition to teaching at the Army's command college, he has also
served as ``personal historian'' to the chief of staff of the U.S.
Army. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Lee controversy didn't ruffle him. That dispute was a mere
squall compared to the far more substantive storm Spiller created
in 1988 when he attacked a vaunted theory first propounded by Brig.
Gen. S.L.A. ``Slam'' Marshall, one of the Army's most revered
historians. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marshall's 1947 treatise /{Men Against Fire/} contained the
alarming claim that during World War II, no more than 25 percent of
the U.S. infantrymen engaged in combat actually fired their
weapons. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marshall's data, or so he stated, had been obtained while
debriefing hundreds of combat infantry units. And his shocking
conclusion, neatly cocooned in the phrase ``ratio of fire,'' was
quickly accepted by the military. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And then along came Spiller, who in 1988 published a
myth-shattering essay in the London-based /{Journal of the Royal
United Services Institute/}, considered by many the most
prestigious military-affairs publication in the English-speaking
world. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``To put it succinctly,'' Spiller said recently, ``I wrote that
Marshall `cooked' his numbers. I could find no evidence that he did
any real field work on the subject at all. I think he believed his
assertion, but he didn't have the data so he simply made it up.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spiller's discovery, reported on the front page of the /{New
York Times/}, knocked the theory on its ear, and further convinced
Spiller himself that the combat experience was tragically
misunderstood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With that background, Spiller approached his assessment of
``Saving Private Ryan.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In some ways he was surprised. ``I thought it was a good film,''
he said. ``Not hands-down the best war film ever made, not even the
best film about World War II, but a good film made with honorable
intent.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His reservations about Hollywood's depiction of combat, however,
remained unchanged. And those feelings are clearly reflected in his
essay, ``War in the Dark,'' slated for publication in the February
issue of /{American Heritage/}. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The essay's ironic title refers not to night combat but to the
curious assumption that war can be understood by someone seated in
the darkened comfort of a movie theater. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``An impossibility,'' Spiller said. ``A movie can't tell you
what it smelled like or sounded like or really felt like at Omaha
Beach. And it can't begin to convey the fear and despair
experienced by combat soldiers who come to believe their daily hell
is endless.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a recent conversation, Spiller cited a similar conclusion
reached by movie director Samuel Fuller, a combat veteran who
landed at Omaha Beach on D-Day with the 1st Infantry Division.
Fuller later made an acclaimed film titled ``The Big Red One''
based on his unit's experience. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the kind of publicity drummed up to promote
``Saving Private Ryan,'' though, Fuller was unusually candid about
the inherent shortcomings of any war movie, including his own. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``To do it right,'' he told Time magazine in 1984, ``you'd have
to blind the audience with smoke, deafen them with noise, then
shoot one of them in the shoulder to scare the rest of them to
death.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between real war and the Hollywood version was
starkly illustrated, said Spiller, by the experience of hundreds of
combat photographers who risked their lives throughout World War II
trying to capture the essence of combat on film. They discovered
that true battlefield scenes bore no resemblance to the way
Hollywood depicted them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``So a question worth asking,'' Spiller writes in his upcoming
essay, ``is how we came to think we know more about war than we
actually do?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The answer, he writes, is that we believe what we see in the
movies. And that disturbs him, for such misconceptions have
consequences. To illustrate, Spiller cites the remarkable impact
World War II films had on their audiences. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, when young Marines were queried about their reasons for
enlisting, fully 50 percent said it was because of their respect
for John Wayne in ``The Sands of Iwo Jima.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the Vietnam War, one veteran told a researcher: ``I saw
them World War II movies. I thought war was glorious, I thought it
was glamorous. Why didn't someone tell us different? Why didn't
someone tell?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And that yawning gulf between ``Disneyfied combat'' and the real
thing gnaws at Spiller. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What readers will find in Roger's essay,'' said American
Heritage editor Snow, ``is his passionate belief that combat is a
profound and terrible human mystery, and you can't presume to learn
much about it by suffering through the first half hour of a
Hollywood film.'' &QL;

SOUNDS OF SPORTS READILY IDENTIFIABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Listen.
</P>
<P>
   Close your eyes, and concentrate. There's a game going on. Which
sport is it? Just listen. The ears will supply the answer.
</P>
<P>
   The staccato pop-pop-pop-pop of plastic on plastic in several
small, violent collisions? It must be a football game.
</P>
<P>
   The high-pitched squeak of rubber on wood, repeated in quick,
irregular intervals? It must be a basketball game.
</P>
<P>
   The crunch of steel cutting into ice? Hockey.
</P>
<P>
   The loud, reverberating crack of wood striking cowhide?
Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The thwack of club striking ball? Golf. The strum of strings
striking ball? Tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Each sport has its own unique sounds that instantly identify the
game. Each sport has sounds that when you close your eyes, you can
tell what game is being played.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a visceral level, sound is very important,'' said Dr. Phil
Anthony, a Fort Worth otologist, a specialist in medicine dealing
with the ear and its disorders. ``The pop of the pads tells you a
whole lot more what happened from the stands than seeing there was
a tackle made. I wouldn't hesitate to say that sound is a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Put a blindfold on athletes and coaches, and play the games.
They can tell you what's going on just by the sounds of sport.
Football: The hits parade The sound of pro football is the sound of
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the pads and helmets colliding against each other,''
Cowboys safety Omar Stoutmire said. ``You hear that, you know
there's a football game going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Those noises occur every time the ball is snapped, along with
the guttural sounds of large men trying to outmuscle each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear that, and you know what sport it is,'' Cowboys
receiver Patrick Jeffers said. ``That's a distinct sound, all the
grunting and groaning between the big meat up front.''
</P>
<P>
   Less common, but just as distinctive, is the sound of a
linebacker leveling a running back or a safety smacking a receiver
coming over the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hollow, helmet-to-helmet collision that you hear every so
often,'' Cowboys fullback Daryl Johnston said. ``You know that
somebody's just experienced a big hit. It's a very definite sound.
You usually get a lot of oohs from the crowd, and it'll get the
players to turn their heads to see and make sure everybody's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Punter Toby Gowin's ears are attuned to the sound of foot
striking leather.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell if there's a good pop on the ball,'' he said.
``If they don't hit it clean you can't hear it. It's a kind of a
slap. When you hear the thump, you know that someone's hit the ball
pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also more subtle sounds, such as a receiver gathering in
a pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the sound of a Troy Aikman bullet hitting you in the
shoulder pads and knocking the wind out of you, and the sound when
you catch a ball clean,'' Jeffers said. ``You can hardly hear it;
it's just that little thunk sound. As a receiver, you love to hear
that sound when you just pick it clean.'' Hockey: Ooohh Stars coach
Ken Hitchcock waxes poetic when talking about the sounds of his
sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing you hear is the swoosh of the skates, the
cutting of steel blades to fresh ice,'' he said. ``That sound is
unmistakable.''
</P>
<P>
   Every hockey player makes that sound when striding up the ice.
But those who really know the sport can recognize differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can really hear powerful skaters,'' said Hitchcock, who
includes Mike Modano in that group. ``They have a sound to their
skating that's really recognizable. They have a different sound
than anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruising defenseman Derian Hatcher also has a favorite noise,
but it has nothing to do with skating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like hearing it when you hit someone and you hear them
grunt, or you hear them go `ooohh,''' Hatcher said. ``I like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Only those close to the hit can hear the grunt, but there are
other sounds that tell the tale of a physical game, sounds like
bodies crashing into the boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the whole building shakes,'' Hitchcock said. ``The
most dynamic hitting sounds are the mid-ice collisions. They are
sounds that just wake up both teams.'' Baseball: Pillow talk
America's pastime offers a feast for the auditory sense.
</P>
<P>
   On the field there's the sharp crack of the bat at the
professional level, or the ugly ding of metal at the amateur level.
There's the pop of a fastball into the catcher's mitt, the calls of
the umpires, the chatter of the infielders.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers manager Johnny Oates notices the sound of bat hitting
ball more during batting practice than during games, and he notices
the sound of a Juan Gonzalez drive more than that of Mark
McLemore's.
</P>
<P>
   ``You notice the difference,'' Oates said. ``Even when they both
hit it well, there's a different sound of a power hitter as opposed
to a line-drive type guy. When Juan hits the ball you know it's
going to go farther. The impact, his strength, you know it's a
totally different situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The pop of the ball into the catcher's mitt has something to do
with the velocity the pitcher puts on it, but more to do with the
type of glove used.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old-time mitts with no break, you can't make it make a
sound,'' said Oates, a former catcher. ``It's like catching with a
pillow. But when Pudge \RIvan Rodriguez\S catches the ball, you can
just toss it and he can make it pop.'' Basketball: Squeaking havoc
There is basketball being played at the Landry Center, where the
Mavericks would be practicing if there was no lockout. It might be
a pickup game, but it's still basketball.
</P>
<P>
   How can Mavericks forward Samaki Walker tell?
</P>
<P>
   ``The squeaking of the shoes and the bouncing of the ball,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The high-pitched squeaking is unmistakable as players stop and
start on the hardwood floor.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks guard Steve Nash can close his eyes and tell the
quality of the game by the sound of the shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you hear all the shoes on the floor squeaking, you know
it's a serious game,'' he said. ``If you just hear a couple, it's
probably half-hearted.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other sounds. The rhythmic pounding of the ball in the
hands of a guard, the soft swish of a jumper hitting nothing but
net, the ball kissing the backboard on a bank shot, and the
rim-rattling force of a dunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``A power dunk is definitely a hard, quick sound,'' Walker said.
``It sounds like power. A soft dunk is not as hard. It may be
pretty, but it's not as hard.'' Auto racing: Good vibrations A
full-throated, racing engine is an assault on the ears. It's pure
power. It sounds like speed. It sounds, well, incredibly loud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sound is something that's always there,'' said former
Indy-car driving star Johnny Rutherford. ``It's part of the action.
It's part of what the fans like. The sound not only pierces the
ears, but it's a resonance on the body. That's part of what fans
like particularly about stock cars because they are so loud. It
almost vibrates inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Within that noise, though, there are subtleties. An expert like
Rutherford can distinguish between a Winston Cup stock car and the
open-wheeled cars of the Indy Racing League and Championship Auto
Racing Teams series just by the sound of the engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all have their different characteristics,'' he said.
``The Cup car is a throaty, V-8 sound. It's a thump. You can tell
listening to it at speed what it is. The CART cars are
turbo-charged and turn a lot more RPMs, so they've got the
high-pitched whine to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are other, not-so-pleasant sounds associated with
auto racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are the bone-chilling sounds of the tires squealing in a
slide,'' Rutherford said. ``It's not common, but when you hear it,
it's scary. Or when you're listening to a car run and suddenly it
goes silent and then you hear the thump. You know exactly what
happened.'' Tennis: String music A tightly strung racket hitting a
felt-covered ball sounds like a symphony to Tut Bartzen, who has
heard that form of music going on 50 years. And the retiredTCU
coach and current director of the Mary Potishman Lard tennis center
in Fort Worth can tell the variances in the game via the sounds of
his sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``With two baseliners playing, you're going to hear longer
intervals between hits,'' Bartzen said. ``It's going to be very
much like a metronome. It's going to be very predictable when the
contact with the ball is, because the players strive to get the
same interval between the bounce and the contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you hear a different tempo, where the intervals are much
shorter, you've got one guy coming in behind the serve or the
return of serve. And in doubles, you're going to have rapid-fire,
and without looking you could tell there's more than two guys out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The sound won't just tell when the ball is hit, but what kind of
a shot it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as you hear that ball hit, you definitely know if it's
a finesse stroke, or a medium-pace ball or a very hard ball,''
Bartzen said. ``It would also indicate how much spin there is on
the ball by the sound of it. A ball that's spinning doesn't have a
clean impact. It's more of a brushing the strings across the ball.
It's a whole different sound.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also different sounds associated with different
surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``On grass you have almost no sound,'' Barzten said. ``Hard
court, you definitely hear it. On carpet indoors, it's like
bouncing it on a rug. You don't hear as much. On clay, you
definitely hear the ball hitting because it tends to skid on the
dirt.'' Golf: Heavy metal Brian Mahon is the head professional at
the Hank Haney Golf Center at City Place, near downtown Dallas. He
hears the sound of clubs striking balls again and again, day after
day.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have to be looking to know the quality of the shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Solid shots have kind of a sharper, crisper sound to them,''
he said. ``Off-center hits tend to have a bit of a clunky sound to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   That sound has been basic to the sport since Scots invented the
game. But as technology has changed the clubs, so has it altered
the tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titanium definitely has a different sound than the original
steel heads did,'' Mahon said. ``That was a tremendous difference
in sound going from the old wooden heads to steel. Now a wooden
head sounds strange, because everybody uses steel or titanium.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to tournament golf there's another sound, that of
the gallery. And those sounds differ depending on the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of the major championships have a different sound to
them,'' Mahon said. ``The Masters is such a hallowed ground, and
the crowd size is limited somewhat. The people are more respectful,
just glad to be there. They don't necessarily roar as loudly as
they do at other tournaments. The U.S. Open and PGA don't limit
ticket sales as much, and all kinds of people tend to go. You've
got a loud, raucous crowd. The British Open is very polite, very
traditional. You get more of a polite clap and not as much of a
loud roar.''
</P>
<P>
   There are unique sounds associated with other sports. The
thundering hoofbeats of horses straining for the finish line. The
furious splashing of swimmers. The thud of a gymnast's feet landing

ball. The violent thump of foot striking leather in soccer. The
rapid-fire clack of paddles hitting plastic in table tennis.

A $500-MILLION MIXED PROJECT FOR PHOENIX 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla. )  (js) 
 By STEVE BERGSMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Construction has begun on the first new office
building in eight years in downtown Phoenix, the initial phase of a
$500-million mixed-use complex with 1.5 million square feet of
office space.
</P>
<P>
   The building will rise on land acquired as the result of an
exchange with the federal government two years ago of 108,000 acres
in Florida for 106 acres here once occupied by a school for Indian
children.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix site was acquired in 1996 by Barron Collier Co. of
Naples, Fla., which traded to the government South Florida wetlands
and scrub-pine property that it had owned since the early 1900s for
the old Phoenix Indian School property in midtown.
</P>
<P>
   It then traded 75 acres of that property to the city for 7.4
acres downtown; Barron Collier retained 15 acres, and donated the
rest to the Veterans Hospital adjoining the site. The city will
create a park with its land and the government will add the South
Florida acreage to the Big Cypress National Preserve adjacent to
the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   The mixed-use Collier Center is a joint venture of Barron
Collier and Opus West Corp. of Phoenix, a regional developer.
Barron Collier is a family-owned holding company primarily involved
in real estate development, oil and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   The project, whose first phase is expected to be completed in
2001, will include three 500,000-square-foot office towers and, in
a separate building, a major convention hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase includes a 1,500-space, three-level, below-grade
parking garage in a 520,000-square-foot office tower anchored by
Bank of America, as well as a two-story complex offering 85,000
rentable square feet of retail and restaurant space.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America will take 200,000 square feet for its
Arizona-Nevada headquarters and Quarles &AMP; Brady, a Phoenix law
firm, will move to downtown from midtown and lease 40,000 square
feet in the building. The office space is 45 percent preleased,
said Thomas Roberts, president of Opus West, with retail 60 percent
preleased. Palomino, a West Coast restaurant chain, will be among
the tenants moving into the retail space, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a core base of law firms, banks and accounting firms
that occupy space downtown, and potentially a lot of midtown
tenants could move back downtown over the next five years,'' said
Roberts, who is also managing partner of Opus Collier, a joint
venture developer. In the '80s, many companies migrated to midtown,
where a rash of new buildings rose in the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Opus West, the project's general contractor, has built more than
16 million square feet of office, industrial and retail space
throughout the West. The center was designed through a joint effort
of Opus Architects &AMP; Engineers, Jerde Partnership of Venice,
Calif., and Langdon Wilson Architecture of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The Collier Center development was supposed to have started this
summer on the heels of the opening of downtown's Bank One Ballpark,
the new home of the Arizona Diamondbacks, but commercial lending
tightened. The developers scrambled through the summer to find
financing and eventually secured a $115 million construction loan
from Bank of America. Finally, on Nov. 10, ground was turned
marking the beginning of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Turmoil in the capital markets also caused problems with the
Collier Center's attempt to attract a third major convention hotel
to downtown Phoenix. Westin Hotels had signed a letter of intent to
move into the complex in the first phase, but Westin has not yet
secured its financing. ``If we can't come to terms with Westin, we
will be looking at other hotel companies,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   The Collier Center is a welcome addition to the ongoing
``renaissance of downtown Phoenix,'' said Jerry Colangelo,
president of the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball and Phoenix Suns
basketball teams, who was an architect of the so-called
renaissance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 Colangelo opened the first downtown sports venue, the
$90 million America West Arena, to house his original sports
franchise, the Phoenix Suns. The arena, along with an office-retail
complex called the Arizona Center designed by Rouse Co. that opened
in 1990, are considered the two original pillars of this city's
downtown revitalization efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The area had been devoid of cultural, entertainment and shopping
activities until these projects came along. To make matters worse,
office tenants had been drifting toward midtown and the trendier
Camelback Corridor to the northeast. Downtown was also in danger of
losing one of its biggest companies, Arizona Public Service, the
state's largest utility.
</P>
<P>
   ``If APS decided to move out of downtown, any plans of
revitalization would have been shot,'' says James B. Fijan, a
senior vice president with CB Richard Ellis in Phoenix. ``But they
decided to stay and go over to the Arizona Center and that kicked
off that whole project'' _ two office buildings and 120,000 square
feet of retail built around a park-like setting.
</P>
<P>
   While there's still a lot of retail at the Arizona Center, most
of the space has been turned over to restaurants and pubs. It has
been a night and weekend draw since it opened. That complex was
capped off this year with the opening of an AMC 24-screen movie
theater, the first theaters in downtown in over 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   America West Arena was the second building block for downtown
revitalization. Not only has it become home to the Phoenix Suns,
but it is also residence to the Phoenix Coyotes professional hockey
team, the Arizona Rattlers indoor football team and the Phoenix
Mercury of the Women's National Basketball Association, plus
countless concerts and special events. The arena was home to 219
event nights in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Downtown revitalization is like fitting together pieces of a
puzzle,'' says Margaret Mullen, executive director of the Downtown
Phoenix Partnership, a business improvement district. ``If you have
pieces missing, the picture is never complete. We could have had a
revitalization without the ballpark or the arena, but we needed one
or the other. We needed one major sports venue downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   Bank One Ballpark attracted 3.6 million baseball fans into
downtown over the course of the Diamondbacks' inaugural season this
year. New pubs and restaurants are opening near the stadium, which
also happened when the America West Arena began operations. From
1989 to 1997, licenses to bars, restaurants, hotels and retail
jumped from 154 to 248, while downtown taxable revenues leaped from
$56.8 million to $127.4 million, according to the Downtown Phoenix
Partnership.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Symphony Hall, downtown now has three other
theaters and auditoriums for plays and concerts, including a new
Herberger Theater and the restored Orpheum and Union Hall. The $48
million Arizona Science Center, which includes a planetarium,
opened last year.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown office vacancy through the third quarter ran 12.7
percent, reports Grubb &AMP; Ellis in Phoenix. Most of that was Class C
property. Class A property carries a healthy 5.29 percent vacancy
rate and Class B, 12.78 percent. Net absorption in downtown totaled
70,584 square feet in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown boasts 4.8 million square feet of space out of 43.3
million in the whole metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Residential development may become another phase of downtown
growth. BRE Properties, a San Francisco real estate investment
trust, announced earlier this year that it would begin renovating
the old Title &AMP; Trust Building into apartments. First constructed
in 1931, the seven-story building is now the only vacant historic
structure in downtown, but a $13 million renovation is to turn it
into 90 apartments, including a 2,100-square-foot penthouse.

NEW HEAD INJURY SENDS JONSSON HOME FOR EXAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Kenny Jonsson, the Islanders' top defenseman
and best all-round player, sustained what appeared to be his second
concussion in a month during Friday night's 2-2 tie with the
Anaheim Mighty Ducks when Travis Green clipped him on the head with
a flying elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Jonsson, who was making his fourth appearance after missing
eight games with post-concussion syndrome, was retrieving the puck
from behind the Islanders' goal in the first period when Green
charged toward him, his elbow up. Green's arm collided with
Jonsson's head, immediately dropping the defenseman to the ice.
Jonsson lay motionless as several of his teammates rushed Green, a
former Islander.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a headache right away,'' said Jonsson, who returned to
Long Island Saturday. ``That was the only symptom I had. We were
concerned because I just came off of a concussion.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, there was some confusion as to the extent of
Jonsson's injury. Early reports from the locker room were that
Jonsson, who had been examined by a Mighty Ducks doctor, had
sustained another concussion. But more than an hour later, an
Islanders spokesman said Jonsson merely had a headache.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke with Kenny during the second period,'' Dr. Eliot
Pellman, the Islanders' director of medical services, said from
Long Island. ``He suffered a headache as a result of the hit. We do
not have enough information to determine whether Kenny suffered a
concussion or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, who played six seasons for the Islanders before being
traded to the Ducks late last season, was not penalized for the
hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Travis took advantage of someone who was against the ropes,''
Mike Milbury, the Islanders' coach and general manager, said. ``I
don't know what day they come to Long Island, but it's going to be
interesting. It was a cheap shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Milbury added: ``He's gutless. That's why he's not wearing an
Islander uniform anymore. He got overpaid, and that's my own
fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Milbury planned to send a videotape of the incident to Colin
Campbell, the National Hockey League disciplinarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing Mike says surprises me,'' said Green, who angered
Milbury by holding out for two straight years when he played for
the Islanders. ``I'm not going to stoop to Mike's level. I'm not
out there trying to hurt guys. It was a clean hit. He had his head
down and I was coming to finish my check. What am I going to do,
stop?''
</P>
<P>
   The sight of Jonsson laying on the ice, his hands on his head,
was what everyone feared. Because the Islanders have yet to prove
they can compete without Jonsson, who logs more ice time than any
other Islander and is a stabilizing force on the blue line, the
power play and the penalty kill. Of the eight games Jonsson missed
with the first concussion, by no coincidence, the Islanders lost
seven.
</P>
<P>
   And by no coincidence, the game turned nasty after Jonsson's
injury. Many Islanders took exception to Green's elbow, which
appeared to have been thrown late and when Jonsson's head was down.
Rich Pilon, the Islanders' toughest defenseman, took special
exception. For the remainder of the game, Pilon zeroed in on the
Ducks' star players, Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne. Pilon drilled
Kariya, who missed most of last season with post-concussion
syndrome several times and hit Selanne so hard his helmet came off
his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely a hard check,'' Pilon said. ``Kenny
definitely was not in a position to protect himself. When he was
out there, I was definitely looking for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilon added: ``Green is not an Islander anymore. Kenny is.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury to Jonsson spoiled any satisfaction the Islanders may
have received from getting their fifth point in three games on
their West Coast swing, which concludes Sunday afternoon at Phoenix
against the Coyotes.  &QL;

3-POINTERS, PREDICTIONS AND BOREDOM

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. &UR;  &LR; _ Patrick Ewing and Charles Barkley played
a casual game of one-on-one, trading taunts and missed jump shots.
Glen Rice threw up errant &UR;  &LR; 3-pointers a few feet from midcourt,
trying to guide the shots in with body English. Sitting on the
sideline, Dan Majerle and Karl Malone looked bored.
</P>
<P>
   Proving that locked-out National Basketball Association players
do indeed have a lot of free time on their hands, 16 of the game's
current and former stars showed up for the morning shoot-around
Saturday &UR;  &LR; at the Atlantic City Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   Their charity game at 9 Saturday night on Showtime was the first
organized basketball many of them had played in more than six
months. Amid the usual hype for such an event was the specter of a
lost season approaching quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner David Stern had just made some more strong comments
about that possibility, but none of the players seemed concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wants to do it, do it,'' Gary Payton said. ``If he
cancels the season, he cancels the season. He's going to hurt
himself and he's going to hurt us and the fans will be hurt, so
that would be crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said: ``Everyone wants to make it seem like a false sense
of security on the players' behalf. I think it will end in the next
week. Sometimes when it's Christmas, you're in a giving mood. We've
been doing it all summer; maybe it's their turn now.''
</P>
<P>
   The practice before the game drew fewer than 100 fans to the
12,500-seat auditorium. One middle-age woman, seated five rows from
the court, took the opportunity to nap.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of fewer than 7,000 was in the building before the
tip-off, including hundreds of children who had received free
tickets. Game organizers said hours before the game that 8,000
tickets had been sold.
</P>
<P>
   The small turnout at the morning practice made it easy for
Barkley to hold court again. As is his custom, he sounded off on a
variety of subjects, from the lockout to Michael Jordan's possible
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about a lot of money,'' Barkley said. ``The owners are
greedy and the players are greedy. I can sympathize with both. I
don't care about either one of them. I just want it to get resolved
because it's not good for the game of basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Jordan, he said: ``Michael is done. He doesn't want to give
anyone mixed messages. I've been telling you guys for three months
that he's not playing. He's had enough. He's done everything. He
made his last shot to win the world championship. What more do you
need? Let the man enjoy the rest of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan did not attend the game, though it was co-promoted by his
agent, David Falk. Jordan, who has promised not to decide whether
to retire until after the lockout is over, was playing in a golf
tournament in La Quinta, Calif. His failure to attend hurt the
proceeds of Saturday night's game, which was to benefit Unicef,
Save the Children and a group of Philadelphia-based charities.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets were sold for between $25 and $500. Because Atlantic
City traditionally slows down between Thanksgiving and Christmas,
it was unclear how much interest the game had actually generated.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many people can afford $500 around Christmas?'' Barkley
said. ``This is obviously not a big basketball market, so we should
have tried to lower the ticket prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, each player was well received during pre-game
introductions, but only a few players appeared to be in game shape.
As to the quality of basketball that would be played with no NBA
training camp for any of the players, expectations were not high.
Shawn Kemp showed up perhaps 30 pounds over his playing weight,
looking like a bookend forward instead of a svelte, skywalking
All-Star. And Ewing also needed to shed a few pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller, though, has not put on an ounce. He has boasted
that he will show the rest of the league's marksmen who the best
shooter is. Whether he would get that chance in a few weeks was
anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   With no negotiations planned, the only sure thing anyone could
take solace in was Barkley's talking and campaigning for another
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Knicks are a team I would consider,'' he said, admitting
that he had illegally contacted teams during the lockout. ``I like
the Knicks. I would love to play with Patrick and Allan Houston.
The addition of Marcus Camby is going to really help. The Knicks
are solid. I think there are five or six teams that could win the
championship. Unfortunately for me, all six want me.'' &QL;

Anderson's drug arrest demonstrates dangers of letting down guard
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JONATHAN FEIGEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Suddenly everything was clear. Everything Greg ``Cadillac''
Anderson should have seen long before, every question he should
have asked, every ``no'' he now knew he should have said had become
clear in a flash as if the triggers surrounding him had been
pulled.
</P>
<P>
   Epiphany came in the form of an FBI pistol pressed to the side
of his head, his hands pulled behind his back. And as Anderson,
just a few weeks removed from his 10th NBA season stretched out on
the hotel room floor, his face pressed against the carpet, he never
felt so foolish, so beaten, so alone.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson had let himself be drawn into a drug deal. For no
reason other than as a favor, he gambled everything he had worked
for and lost. He never saw the risk, never realized when friendship
turned to setup and finally to disaster. He never considered the
potential for prison that now is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 20, Anderson and three others pleaded guilty to
possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, an offense that
could bring a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison. Federal
sentencing guidelines in Anderson's case call for 37 to 46 months
in prison and there is reason to hope for less time. But prison is
virtually certain. There is no chance for parole in a federal drug
case.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson pleaded guilty because he said there was no denying
that he was. His crime, he said, was his fault. His fate, he
accepts, is now out of his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like, if you did it, you did it,'' Anderson said.
``They caught me red-handed. I could have said `no.' I could have
stopped this. But I didn't. I'm not in a state of thinking, Why did
this happen? I should have been saying that before it happened. I
should have said a lot of things before it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   There was a time Anderson blamed someone else. He was prone on
the casino hotel room floor filled with drug money, the room
crowded with FBI agents, his body shaking when he turned toward the
man he had considered a friend who had turned from drug dealer to
government informant and asked, ``Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did you do this to me,'' Anderson pleaded. ``What have you
gotten me into.''
</P>
<P>
   When it all began, Anderson, 34, had no intention of getting
into anything. A former Worthing High School and University of
Houston star who played for the Atlanta Hawks last season, Anderson
was used to being approached by fans who would try to become his
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson went out by himself on a Friday night to Atlanta Live,
a popular nightclub in the Buckhead section of Atlanta. That night
early in 1998, he met Howard Hill, a drug dealer from Biloxi,
Miss., and Anthony Bates, an FBI informant apparently assigned to
investigate Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody goes there, a lot of the pro athletes and people who
come to town,'' Anderson said. ``I was sitting there having a cold
beer. They knew who I was. We were laughing, joking, teasing
people. They seemed pretty cool. They told me they were from out of
town so I invited the guys to the game on Sunday. I invited a lot
of people to games and gave them tickets. But one thing led to
another. They came back again and wanted to hang out. We exchanged
phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hung around. We laughed, talked, cracked jokes. If you're
a pro athlete, you're either going to go out with a lot of friends,
or you're going to go out and probably meet a lot of friends.
Normally when you meet people out like that, somebody may want to
buy you a beer and then go about their way. It was a strange
introduction. They kind of hung around I guess to see what females
they could pick up around me or see what other stars they could
meet. At that time of the evening, nothing else dawned on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bates and Hill returned to Atlanta throughout March and April.
Anderson invited them to shootarounds and games, introduced them to
teammates Tyrone Corbin and Anthony Miller.
</P>
<P>
   They went out to eat after practices, and to the clubs at night.
When Anderson did wonder about what sort of jobs could allow Bates
and Hill time to hang around Atlanta and money to spend with an NBA
veteran, an answer was ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got kind of curious and asked what kind of work they did,''
Anderson said. ``One of the guys said they were offshore. I know
people who go offshore for two weeks, and are home for two weeks,
so it didn't dawn on me they were doing anything illegal. I know
people here (in Houston) and in Louisiana that go offshore 14 days
at a time, and will be off the same amount of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson does not know if he was targeted. Hill could have been
seeking a drug connection in Houston, or even entry to the circles
of an NBA veteran. Because he also pleaded guilty and did not have
a trial, that information is not available in public records.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Hawks lost to Charlotte in the first round of the
NBA playoffs, Anderson and Miller stopped in Biloxi on the way to
Houston to see Bates and Hill on May 5. After Miller left the
group, with Anderson's confidence long since assured, Bates and
Hill told Anderson they sold drugs in Mississippi and began asking
if Anderson could introduce them to a cocaine supplier in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started asking me if I knew people,'' Anderson said.
``They told me they do this and do that and I told them it's not my
type of life. But where I grew up, I've seen it. I've never been
involved in it before, but I've seen it. They asked me if I knew
any people back home. But they kept asking me and asking me if I
knew somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, when Anderson arrived in Houston, his estranged
wife had moved out, taking their four children and most of their
possessions. A week later, Hill and Bates arrived in Houston and
Anderson introduced them to Kevin Blackmon, an acquaintance he had
assumed could be a drug connection for his friends from
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came back home, my family was gone,'' Anderson said.
``I came back home to a house that wasn't like I left it.
Everything just moved too fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I introduced them to a guy I knew, Kevin Blackmon. We liked
cars, drag racing. We all had the same cars (Chevrolet Impala SS).
We were friends since growing up. He was a good guy. I hate that I
got him involved. I hate that I got myself involved. If I knew
these guys better, it wouldn't have happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't really know each other. They knew me from hanging
out in Atlanta. Kevin knew me from hanging out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he introduced a drug buyer to a seller, Anderson _ offered
no more than a $1,000 finder's fee for his role in the scheme _ was
likely guilty of conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance.
Blackmon sold a kilo of cocaine to Hill, who left his car in
Anderson's driveway in Houston as collateral, further involving
Anderson in a drug transaction.
</P>
<P>
   When Hill and an associate, Kevin Porter, brought the drugs to
Mississippi, agents arrested them, in possession of 16 bags of
cocaine, at a traffic stop set up by Bates and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Hill agreed to work with the FBI to further implicate Anderson,
and began calling him daily to come to Biloxi to pick up Blackmon's
money, saying his son was diabetic and in the hospital and that he
couldn't leave Mississippi. By then, every phone conversation with
Hill was recorded to further implicate Anderson, but a drug deal
was set up in a Mississippi hotel, the Grand Casino Bayview where
the FBI set up surveillance equipment and waited for Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Hill picked up Anderson at the airport, and brought him to the
hotel. Once there, in the room and scenario set up by the FBI, he
gave Anderson the $26,000 and told him someone would join them in
the room to buy the last few ounces of cocaine. Anderson said he
protested. But with one last chance to refuse, to show he knew
better, he didn't. Within seconds, officers crashed into the room,
Anderson holding $26,000 in drug money.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Get on the ground with your face down,''' Anderson
said. ``With guns in your face, you don't have any choice. It was a
legitimate rush. It was scary. I never had anybody come in on me
like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared. Here I am in Biloxi, Miss. I know nobody but
Hill. And something like this happens. I try not to (think about
it). That was the worst night of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   He waived his right to an attorney, rapidly admitting his
involvement in the drug deal. He agreed to implicate Blackmon, just
as Hill had implicated him. When he did hire an attorney, Tim
Johnson of Houston, a case for entrapment was considered, but ruled
out because Anderson had so willingly introduced a drug buyer to a
seller to traffic in drugs, and because he so thoroughly had
admitted his involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson pleaded guilty sure he would go to prison.
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Anderson doesn't know why he did not even consider the peril to
which he so rapidly thrust himself. He has no prior drug arrests,
insists he has no financial problems having made roughly $7 million
in his NBA career, $272,000 last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up working,'' Anderson said. ``Since I was 7 years old,
I had yards to cut. My dad and my mom instilled that in me and in
all my sisters and brothers. I had my bicycle with a string
attached to a mower. I was always independent. I used to fix my own
bikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``As time went on, I always worked and had my own car. When I
was in the ninth grade I had a car the old guy down the street sold
me for a dollar. It wasn't anything but a fuel pump. Once I got to
high school, I worked to have my own car, a Delta 88, '71. All
through college I worked in the offseason because I knew in order
to have what you want, you have to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony that he had fallen into the shortcut he had always
avoided, and never needed, was unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows,'' he said, ``anybody can make a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, he will become an NBA cautionary tale, a name
used as warning. He said he is comfortable with that, believing,
``To people who know me, I'm still known for what I did (in
basketball). For those who look at me for what happened on the bad
side, may God bless them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sentencing was originally scheduled for Feb. 9, but Anderson was
granted a motion to continue sentencing to May 19 to allow him to
play this basketball season in the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   But that deal fell through and the judge in the case, Walter J.
Gex III, could choose to go ahead with the sentencing Feb. 9 when
Hill, Porter and Blackmon are scheduled to be sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Anderson has prepared. He said he spends little time
thinking about the sentence he might receive or his likely time in
prison. He said friends and former teammates have been unfailingly
supportive.
</P>
<P>
   But before Thanksgiving, he told his four children, Greg Jr. 11,
Gabriel, 9, Geia 8, and Geremy 3. It was, he said, the toughest day
since his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't scare them. I just told them, `Daddy did a bad
thing,''' Anderson said. ``How do you tell kids? It was a mistake I
don't want them to make in their lives. It was hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``They love me as their daddy, Greg Anderson Sr., they look at
me as their father, whether I'm in the NBA or a truck driver.
They're understanding kids. They're Christian kids. They know it
was a mistake, something I did wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson admits that. Accepting responsibility is one of the
considerations in the federal sentencing guidelines. But Anderson
contends there is no use denying his ``mistakes,'' confident what
he did is not who he is. He also will not spend his time thinking
about the transgressions of his past or agonizing about the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in a state of thinking, Why did this happen?''
Anderson said. ``I should have been saying that before it happened.
Sometimes you don't know what the outcome is going to be. I think
about that. But I don't let that drag me down.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always have people asking, `Are you all right, are you
OK?' I'm OK. A lot of people are surprised. One of my friends I
hadn't talked to since everything happened called. He said, `Man,
you sound all right, like you ain't worried.' I said, `What's to
worry about?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever will happen will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows there were chances to prevent what happened, chances he
ignored. As he knew from the moment he was pushed to that floor in
Biloxi, it's now far too late.

Hope for NBA settlement slips away
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JONATHAN FEIGEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NBA stars, barred from their profession and unwilling to accept
deals to bring them back, played their exhibition in Atlantic City
on Saturday night, billing it as more than ``the game of the
year,'' but perhaps the ``only game of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was far from the only ``game' this week. And the week
full of NBA owners' and players' thrust and parry made the
possibility that the season's games could be lost an increasing
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   NBA commissioner David Stern prepared for his Aspen, Colo.,
vacation Friday by repeating his contention the cancellation of the
season was ``virtually inevitable.'' National Basketball Players
Association director Billy Hunter countered that Stern's prediction
is no more than a threat designed to shake the players' resolve.
</P>
<P>
   By midweek, the sides were arguing about who initiated the
successful talks of the previous week. By Thursday, Stern had sent
a letter to the players detailing the owners' proposal, only to
have Hunter send a memo to players disputing the worthiness of
every Stern contention.
</P>
<P>
   And by Saturday's made-for-cable exhibition, the steps taken
eight days earlier seemed wasted, replaced by new levels of rancor
and anger, and mistrust. Falling hard from the giddy, hopeful
moments taken from the secret bargaining sessions the week before,
both sides reacted sharply, emotionally after negotiations broke
off after 30 minutes. And the rhetoric that has followed has grown
uglier.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of arguing the unworthiness of the owners' proposals,
the players and their leadership have moved to challenge the
veracity of the owners' _ and Stern's _ motives. Even Hakeem
Olajuwon, who has been careful to chastise both sides evenly,
described Stern's vacation as a ploy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just reverse psychology,'' Olajuwon said. ``It's not
going to work. (A split within the union membership) is what the
owners are counting on. The players are not going to break. The
union is too strong for any player to want to break.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern has increased his predictions that the season has become
likely lost, even beginning his letter to the players with ``As the
1998-99 season slips away from us '' and charging that by
considering the owners' offer a bad deal ``you would prefer to lose
the entire season.''
</P>
<P>
   The players have countered that Stern is making empty threats as
negotiating ploys to rattle their resolve and inspire them to
accept an unfavorable agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be finished once they decide they want it done,''
Rockets guard Brent Price said. ``I really believe Stern holds the
power to this thing. They control the tempo. We've already
indicated we're willing to make concessions. We're the ones that
really want to get a deal. I think (Stern's vacation) is another
move on his part to show he's in control, that he's not concerned.
But he's responsible for the whole league. I have faith he's not
going to let the whole season end. That would be devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday's war of words, rather than move the players closer
to accepting an agreement, seems to have allowed Hunter the
opportunity to refute Stern's contentions and solidify his support.
</P>
<P>
   Both documents prove NBA players are and would be incredibly
well-paid, on the average better-paid than in any other U.S. team
sport, but Hunter countered that would not be enough because of the
sport's profitability. Hunter does not dispute the projections,
only that they would not be a ``fair share.''
</P>
<P>
   Players have seemed increasingly steeled by the position that
only they have made real concessions in the negotiations, citing
the position to which Hunter repeatedly alludes in his memo that
owners' concessions have been from earlier proposals while the
players' capitulation has been from the previous
collective-bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get concessions from us,'' Hunter wrote, ``they eventually
agree to come off of their demand, and thus give the appearance
that they are making a concession.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's response refers to Stern positions as a ``neat trick,''
warns ``don't be fooled,'' and concludes Stern's vacation is a
``stunt.''

GOAL PRODUCTION IS SCARCE AS THE DEVILS SALVAGE A TIE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Jacques Lemaire, the Devils' former coach, was
watching the Devils from the stands here Saturday night, and it
might have had something to do with the team's offensive
production. The Devils, who had scored 28 goals in five games
before Friday night, scored just one goal Saturday, but it was
enough for a 1-1 tie against the Montreal Canadiens, who have gone
without a victory for nine games, their longest such streak in six
years.
</P>
<P>
   Vadim Sharifijanov scored the goal for the Devils, who played
low-scoring games under Lemaire but have been scoring much more
under Coach Robbie Ftorek. But the Devils now have just three goals
in their last two games after scoring five or more in five straight
games before the loss to Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty killers and Martin Brodeur earned the tie for the
Devils (18-8-4). The penalty killers were perfect in seven manpower
advantages for the Canadiens, and Brodeur had another inspiring
performance in goal, this time with 22 saves, one in the overtime.
Brodeur's only blemish was Turner Stevenson's second goal of the
season, which tied the score with 6 minutes 14 seconds left in
regulation at the Molson Center.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur was rested in a loss to Calgary the previous night at
Continental Arena, and he was sharp when he had to be in the first
two periods Saturday night. He has always been sharp against the
Canadiens, the team he idolized when he was growing up in Montreal.
Brodeur entered the game having allowed just one goal in two starts
against the Canadiens this season, a 3-0 victory and a 1-1 tie.
</P>
<P>
   The 1-1 tie on Dec. 4 was the last game before the Devils went
on a scoring binge, building an undefeated streak of eight games
before the 5-2 loss to Calgary on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   After scoring just twice against the Flames, the Devils had
trouble scoring again Saturday. Several times they found themselves
in good scoring positions, only to have their shots sail wide or
over the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams were extremely cautious on defense for the most part,
but the Devils created more opportunities in the first two periods.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in his 14th game, Sharifijanov scored his second goal of
the season 8 minutes 17 seconds into the middle period after a pass
from Brendan Morrison. His blistering shot from the top of the
right circle hit the top of the net behind Jeff Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   Sharifijanov is a skillful player, and in the few games he has
played Ftorek has used him with players such as Sasha Lakovic, who
is primarily a fighter. Lakovic drew an assist on Sharifijanov's
goal, for his first point of the season and the second in his
28-game National Hockey League career.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils were presented with a marvelous opportunity a minute
later, when two Canadiens were sent to the penalty box, giving the
Devils a two-man advantage. But the advantage disappeared over a
minute later when Bobby Holik was penalized for roughing.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils played without Bob Carpenter for the second game in a
row. Carpenter's bruised right foot must be really bruised, because
he was left home Friday night after the loss to Calgary. His place
was again taken by Denis Pederson, who centered for Jay Pandolfo
and Brian Rolston. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SLAP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman KEVIN DEAN returned after missing six games with a
groin injury that he had aggravated the last time the Devils met
the Canadiens. . . . BRENDAN MORRISON was back in the lineup after
he was a healthy scratch against Calgary.  &QL;

A FAREWELL FOR GRETZKY LEAVES RANGERS CHILLED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RANDI DRUZIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ In the days preceding Wayne Gretzky's last game here
at the storied Maple Leaf Gardens, anticipation built like a
gathering storm. But in the end, the Toronto Maple Leafs stole
Gretzky's thunder, jumping out to a 4-0 lead in the first period
and beating the Rangers, 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   In spoiling Gretky's final appearance at the arena where he
attended games as a child, the Leafs beat the Rangers for the first
time in 11 games and chased Mike Richter from goal with 13 minutes
left to play.
</P>
<P>
   The local news media had heralded Gretzky's return; newspapers
ran lengthy stories detailing his visits to the Gardens, from his
first, when he was 6 years old and sat in the furthest reaches of
the arena with his grandmother, to his most recent, when he scored
the tying goal with 26 seconds left in a 6-6 tie.
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs, however, were not intimidated. Toronto jumped to a
1-0 lead when the former Islander Derek King scored at 1 minute 57
seconds on the game's first shot, and the Leafs fired three more
goals past a harried Richter before the Rangers scored.
</P>
<P>
   When New York did get on the board, it was Gretzky who worked
his magic behind the net, setting up Adam Graves for his 13th goal
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Key to Toronto's first-period explosion was the former Devils
prospect Alyn McCauley, who finished the night with 4 points. In
the opening flurry he scored once, when his shot went off Ulf
Samuelsson's stick on the power play, and assisted on two goals by
King. Tie Domi made the Leafs' lead 4-0 at 14:10.
</P>
<P>
   That was the game, though the Leafs got insurance markers from
Steve Thomas, Mike Johnson and Darby Hendrickson. Hendrickson's
goal, at 7:59 of the third period, made the score 7-1 and drove
Richter from the game. Richter, who faced 26 shots, was replaced by
Dan Cloutier.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers made the score more respectable with late goals from
Petr Nedved, who collected his fifth, Niklas Sundstrom and Mike
Knuble. The last goal, in the final minute, came on another assist
from Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   The former Ranger Glenn Healy started in goal for Toronto and
collected his second victory, making 22 saves. The Leafs outshot
New York, 31-26.
</P>
<P>
   Maple Leaf Gardens will close in February with Gretzky as the
hands-down leader in points by a visiting player, with 77 in 30
games. He is tied with the former Chicago star Steve Larmer with 30
goals.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky said that despite the poor showing by the Rangers in his
final game here, he will miss the Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to miss playing here,'' he said. ``I've got to tell
you, the fans have been great to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gardens, opened in 1931, will be replaced by the $265
million Air Canada Center.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The sendoff from the Toronto fans was cordial. Gretzky was
applauded during pre-game introductions, when he took the game's
ceremonial opening face-off and when he skated off at game's end.
</P>
<P>
   It was a radically different reaction than the one he
encountered in his years with the Edmonton Oilers and Los Angeles
Kings, when he was a familiar target of the boo birds. He has often
said his best game ever came here: his hat-trick performance to
lead the Kings past the Leafs, 5-4, in Game 7 of the 1993 Campbell
Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was probably more surprised as a kid when I saw Bobby Orr
getting booed here,'' Gretzky said.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, who grew up in nearby Brantford, Ontario, brought his
wife and children to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted my family and kids to be here, to see what it is like
to play hockey in Canada in this special place,'' he said.
``They've never seen that.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning five games in a row to open the month, the Rangers
have now lost four of their last five. They come home to play
Carolina on Wednesday night before going on the road again for four
games, beginning next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs had not defeated the Rangers in almost six years,
since a 3-1 victory here on Jan. 30, 1993. They improved their
record to 18-11-2 and reclaimed first place in the Northeast
Division from Buffalo, which lost to Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers fell to 11-13-7.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto Coach Pat Quinn, while satisfied with the victory, was
unhappy with the late New York goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a 7-1 game and turned it into a 7-4 game,'' Quinn
said. ``Our goalie deserved better than that.''
