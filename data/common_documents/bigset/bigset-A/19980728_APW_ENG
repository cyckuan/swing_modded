Albright confronts Myanmar, China on human rights abuses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fresh comments from Chinese foreign minister,
DELETES now redundant first reference to Tang &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM RAUM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright confronted several Asian nations during an international
conference, criticizing Myanmar for blocking the movements of
opposition leader Ang San Suu Kyi and China for jailing dissidents
after President Bill Clinton's visit.
	   She said turmoil in Myanmar, still called Burma by U.S.
officials, was posing ``a threat to the stability of the region.''
	   China's representative, meanwhile, said the Asian economic
crisis ``will stay at a low ebb for a period of time.'' He said
recovery will come, but could be endangered by too much high-risk
new investment in the region at today's bargain-basement prices.
	   ``Over-speculation by international hot money poses a new
challenge,'' said Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan. He said
Asia's recovery must come from within for it to be lasting and
Asian nations must ``adhere to effective practices.''
	   As for his own country, Tang told a wrap-up session on Tuesday
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and some of their
powerful neighbors, ``The financial crisis in Asia will not slow
down the pace of China's reform and opening-up, nor has it done
so.''
	   As ministers of 20 Asian and Western countries and the European
Union met Monday at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
Regional Forum, Nobel laureate Suu Kyi spent a fourth day Monday
stuck in a car on a rural Myanmar highway surrounded by government
security personnel. She was arrested Friday on her way to a meeting
with supporters.
	   In denouncing the military-ruled government of Myanmar _ a
participant in the conference _ Albright said Monday that the
United States would hold it ``directly responsible'' for the health
and welfare of Suu Kyi.
	   Albright went public with her complaints after Myanmar Foreign
Minister Ohn Gyaw defended his nation's actions in a closed-door
session with participants.
	   Ohn Gyaw was asked by The Associated Press to comment on
Albright's concerns for Suu Kyi. ``Nothing will happen to her,'' he
said of the opposition leader.
	   The conference host, Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo
Siazon, said later that Albright's statement of concern was ``just
too vague'' for the rest of the group to adopt.
	   ``We have not seen any deterioration in (Suu Kyi's) health or
capacity to think,'' Siazon said.
	   Recounting her conversation with the Chinese foreign minister,
Albright told reporters she noted that China had released some
prisoners, but ``I made ... quite clear that arresting people is
not the way that we see follow through.''
	   A senior U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said Albright was concerned about the arrests of about 20
dissidents after Clinton returned from 10 days in China earlier
this month. The Chinese delegation didn't respond directly to her
concerns, but ``they couldn't miss it'' as criticism, the official
said.
	   Despite Albright's sharp words for Myanmar and China, the annual
security forum of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
produced much agreement _ both on the need to do something to stop
Asia's economic crisis and a statement that ``strongly deplored''
nuclear tests in May by India and Pakistan.
	   In a statement, ministers from 19 of the countries plus the
European Union said the tests heightened tension in a region
already on edge from a growing economic crisis. The statement did
not mention the nations by name, only referring to two countries in
South Asia.
	   ``Since we know our geography too well, it was not necessary to
identify them,'' said Siazon said.
	   India dissented from the report and defended the tests it
carried out in May ``because the nonproliferation regime had turned
flawed and discriminatory.'' Pakistan was not a member of the
conference.
	   Albright said she made U.S. concerns over human rights known in
a meeting with Tang, the Chinese foreign minister.
	   ``While we both consider, and I especially, (that) one of the
major successes of the president's trip was to raise human rights
issues publicly in China, ... I did raise our concerns about some
of the recent arrests,'' she said.
	   Albright said she and Tang also discussed the House vote last
week endorsing Clinton's extension of normal-trade relations, a
vote Albright praised.
	   Meanwhile, Tang assured the United States it will follow through
on its pledge to stop targeting the 13 nuclear missiles it has
aimed at U.S. cities, although he did not say when _ or whether it
had already done so.
	   ``The Chinese people are a people who always honor our
commitments,'' Tang told reporters during a picture-taken session
at the start of the breakfast meeting with Albright.
	   The summit between Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin a
month ago yielded an agreement to stop aiming nuclear missiles at
each other.
	   Albright also discussed the upcoming summit meeting in Moscow in
September between Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
	   ``We have a mature partnership now,'' she said of the
U.S.-Russian relationship. ``We can hit the ground running,''
echoed Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who shared a news
conference podium with her.
	   High on the agenda of the September meeting, Albright said, will
be nonproliferation issues, the nuclear tests by Iran and Pakistan,
violence in Kosovo and the current financial crisis.
	   For his part, Primakov said Russia would work hard to fight its
way out of its own financial crisis. ``We, too, will have to
swallow that bitter pill,'' he said.
	   Of the highway standoff in Yangon, Myanmar, Albright said:
``Members of legal political parties are being prevented from
traveling in their own country,'' Albright said. ``The Burmese
economy is falling apart. ... Burma is a country in great and
growing stress today.''
	   Albright made her views known both in a speech to the conference
and at a news conference.
	   ``The Burmese representative here has just ... responded to the
allegations, and I think his response is quite typical of an
authoritarian government that just doesn't get it, that blames the
victim for the problem,'' Albright told reporters.

China calls for ``do or die'' effort against floods
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos

<TEXT>
	   WUHAN, China (AP) _ China's government has called for a ``do or
die'' effort against dangerous floods threatening millions of
people along the Yangtze, its largest river, state media said.
	   With waters on the mighty river continuing to rise, hundreds of
thousands of people have been mobilized to watch or help strengthen
embankments to make sure they hold firm, the Xinhua News Agency
said late Monday.
	   More than 100,000 soldiers and armed police officers _ dubbed
``suicide squads'' by the media _ were performing the most
dangerous flood-prevention work, Xinhua said.
	   Floods caused by rains that fell heavier and earlier than usual
have killed more than 1,145 people so far this year. Almost a
million people have been forced from their homes in the three
worst-hit provinces _ Hunan, Hubei and Jiangxi.
	   As the third flood crest this month roared down the Yangtze
through central China, the government ``called for a do or die
effort in protecting major cities and river and lake embankments,''
Xinhua said.
	   The flood peak was the Yangtze's second-largest since 1954, when
floods killed 30,000 people and affected 10 million others, Xinhua
said.
	   ``People are holding their breath as the third flood peak
passes,'' it said.
	   In Wuhan city, central China's largest industrial center with
more than 7 million residents, water levels were 2.5 meters (8.25
feet) above the danger mark on Monday night, Xinhua said.
	   To release pressure on dikes weakened by weeks of rain and high
water, authorities were considering whether to blow up levees
upstream to divert flood waters into farm districts and save cities
from flooding.
	   Military boats, trucks and aircraft were working day and night
to deliver relief goods, and medical workers were working to
prevent possible epidemics of disease, Xinhua said.
	   Over the past 200 years, the 6,300-kilometer- (3,900-mile-) long
Yangtze has been hit by a devastating flood every 10 years, it
said.

Sautin wins second Goodwill diving gold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Dmitry Sautin, repeating his 3-meter
and platform double from the 1998 World Championships, won the
Goodwill Games platform diving Monday night.
	   The Russian easily defeated a pair of Chinese divers in the
platform, where he also is the 1996 Olympic champion.
	   Sautin had 665.49 points for the gold medal, while Tian Liang
had 623.01 and Sun Shuwei 598.80 for the silver and bronze.
	   Three Americans _ Mark Ruiz, Kevin McMahon and Kyle Prandi _
finished sixth, seventh and eighth. Ruiz won the bronze medal in
the 1-meter event.
	   Sautin had at least one judge's award of 8.5 on all of his 21
dives except one in his two events _ his next-to-last dive on
Monday. His best mark on a reverse 3 1/2 was 7.5.
	   But he came back with all 8's, 8.5's and 9.0's on his last dive
_ an inward 3 1/2 with a high 3.4 degree of difficulty _ to score
87.36 points, his highest in either the 3-meter or platform.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian men's softball player Dane
Lalic has received a two-year Olympic ban for refusing to undergo
an out-of-competition drug test two years ago.
	   The period of sanction dates back to Oct. 15, 1996, when Lalic
refused to undergo the test, which carries the same penalty as a
positive sample, the National Sports Dispute Center said Tuesday.
	   Although men's softball is not an Olympic sport, Lalic was
sanctioned under the Australian Olympic Committee's anti-doping
policy because the Australian Softball Federation is a member sport
of the AOC. (djp)

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A 20-year-old German tourist suffered a
fractured skull when she was hit by falling debris from the
construction of Bangkok's first commuter rail line, local papers
reported Tuesday.
	   Isabel Gacso was hit Monday by a piece of a sling used to lift
building materials to the elevated train. She had just arrived in
the city and was leaving her hotel to shop on Sukhumvit Road, a
major avenue, The Nation newspaper reported.
	   Ital-Thai, the company building the rail line, has been heavily
criticized by Bangkok governor Bhichit Rattakul and city residents
for creating unsafe and unclean conditions at the railway
construction sites.
	   There have been several accidents at the sites. Earlier this
year, a taxi driver was killed and another injured when a steel
beam weighing more than a ton fell from the building area on
Sukhumvit Road.
	   In Monday's incident, Gacso's friend, Rene Hancke, also suffered
a slight shoulder injury. They have filed a criminal complaint
against Ital-Thai, The Nation reported.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A teacher in a Thai provincial school
has apologized to the family of a fourth grade schoolgirl who was
forced to be kissed by all the boys in her class as punishment for
failing to do her homework, local papers reported Tuesday.
	   The 11-year-old girl had been refusing to go to school after the
teacher, Sathaporn Saengchai, imposed the kissing punishment on
July 17, The Nation newspaper reported.
	   The teacher said he did not think the punishment would make the
girl too embarrassed to attend class at the school in Nong Khai
province, 510 kilometers (320 miles) northeast of Bangkok near the
border with Laos.

Layden returns to coaching with Starzz
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG BEACHAM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ Some say Frank Layden saved the Utah Jazz.
Now he'll try to do the same for the team's WNBA counterpart.
	   Layden, a former NBA Coach of the Year with the Jazz, was hired
on Monday to coach the Utah Starzz. He replaces Denise Taylor, who
was fired after compiling a 13-34 overall record, including a 6-13
mark this year.
	   ``There's been a void in my life since I left coaching,'' said
Layden, who stepped down from the Jazz in November 1988 after parts
of eight seasons as coach. ``I miss the competitive spirit.''
	   The popular Layden jumped right into the job later Monday,
leading the Starzz to a 90-80 win over the Phoenix Mercury before
an adoring Delta Center crowd. Layden will retain his position as
president of the Jazz, but he stressed that his new job was not
temporary.
	   ``This is not an interim position,'' Layden said. ``This is a
position I plan to hold for a long time to come.''
	   Layden, 66, has never coached women's basketball, but he has
been the color commentator on Starzz television broadcasts this
season. He retained Fred Williams, Taylor's assistant and a former
head coach of the women's team at Southern California, as his
associate coach.
	   Taylor's firing came as no surprise in Utah, where attendance
has dropped as the team struggled despite the presence of 7-foot-2
Margo Dydek and a talented group of players.
	   All told, the Starzz have the world's tallest player in Dydek,
an all-WNBA second-teamer in Wendy Palmer, the MVP at this summer's
World Championships in Russian Elena Baranova and a deep backcourt.
	   They also have the worst franchise record of any of the WNBA's
original eight teams. After a league-worst 7-21 season in 1997
under Taylor, the Starzz are stuck in the Western Conference
basement again this year.
	   Taylor's dismissal came shortly after the team returned home
from a 2-2 Eastern road trip. The Starzz lost to Cleveland 69-59 on
Saturday despite leading the Rockers by four points in the closing
minutes.
	   The firing is the second in the WNBA in less than a week. The
Washington Mystics fired coach Jim Lewis on July 23.
	   Layden was named the Jazz's general manager in 1979, a month
after the team announced plans to move from New Orleans to Salt
Lake City. The former player, coach and athletic director at
Niagara became head coach in December 1981 and quickly made Utah
competitive.
	   The Jazz won their first Midwest Division title in 1984, and
Layden was named Coach of the Year. After four more .500 or better
seasons, Layden relinquished the job to Jerry Sloan.

Rod Laver suffers stroke during TV interview
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Tennis Hall of Famer Rod Laver suffered a
stroke Monday while doing an interview with ESPN, a network
spokesman said.
	   The 59-year-old Australian, whose 11 Grand Slam singles titles
are one fewer than all-time leader Roy Emerson, was taken to UCLA
Medical Center, ESPN spokesman Rob Tobias said.
	   His family requested that no information about his condition be
released, according to a nursing supervisor who declined to be
identified.
	   Laver is the only player in history to twice sweep the four
Grand Slam events in one year. He did it as an amateur in 1962 and
as a pro in 1969.
	   He won four Wimbledons, three Australian Open titles, two U.S.
Open championships and two French Open titles in singles. He also
won nine Grand Slam doubles titles.
	   During his 23-year career, he won 47 pro singles titles and was
runner-up 21 times. He also starred for Australia in Davis Cup
competition, compiling a 16-4 record in singles and a 4-0 mark in
doubles
	   Laver, who lives in Newport Beach, California, was the world's
top-ranked player in 1961, 1962, 1968 and 1969 and earned dlrs 1.5
million during his career.
	   He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in
1981.

U.S. military attache freed after villagers detained him in
</HEADLINE>
Chiapas &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEJANDRO RUIZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ The assistant military
attache at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico and a female embassy employee
have been freed after pro-government residents of a village in
Chiapas state held them against their will, officials said Monday.
	   The detention of Assistant Attache Thomas Gillen for about 10
hours Sunday comes amid a government campaign of blaming foreigners
for fanning the state's 4-year-old rebel conflict, discouraging
foreigners from visiting disputed communities and deporting
foreigners from Chiapas.
	   Leftist Zapatista rebels staged a brief armed uprising in
Chiapas in January 1994, demanding greater democracy and Indian
rights.
	   U.S. Embassy officials here Monday confirmed the detention and
subsequent release of the pair, which occured on what officials
said was one of the regular visits embassy staff make throughout
Mexico.
	   ``After a few hours, the situation was resolved. In no way do we
consider this to have been a hostage situation,'' said an Embassy
official, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Foreigners have previously reported being harassed in Chiapas by
government supporters since the campaign _ which the government
says is needed to discourage meddling in the conflict by foreign
activists _ began in February.
	   Interviewed Monday at his hotel in this Chiapas city, Gillen
said ``that happened yesterday ... I can't talk about it right
now,'' Gillen said.
	   Moises Diaz, Chiapas state's northern regional delegate, said
residents of Los Platanos, a village in El Bosque about 23 miles
(37 kilometers) north of here, detained Gillen and U.S. embassy
staff member Sgt. Elizabeth Krug because ``they were acting
suspiciously.''
	   The villagers held them because the two Americans refused to
open the cases they were carrying, according to another local
government official who asked to remain anonymous.
	   The Embassy official said the pair was blocked from leaving the
village by people trying to inspect their luggage. The Americans
had diplomatic immunity and refused to comply.
	   They were detained until villagers could contact local
government officials for instructions. The pair was released after
several hours of negotiations with a local farm official.
	   Mexican immigration agents have established checkpoints to
screen foreigners on roads leading into areas of Chiapas where
support for Zapatista rebels runs high.

group of Italian observers who defied government orders not to
visit the pro-Zapatista Chiapas community of Taniperlas.

Reports: Sumitomo Bank, Daiwa Securities to form investment bank
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sumitomo confirming it is talks with Daiwa;
Finance Minister comment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sumitomo Bank Ltd. confirmed Tuesday it is in talks
with Daiwa Securities Co. on a possible alliance, amid news reports
that the two companies have agreed to jointly launch a
Western-style investment bank.
	   Japanese media reported early Tuesday that the two financial
giants will spin off their capital market and corporate-client
divisions, combining them in an investment bank offering
sophisticated financial services to corporate customers.
	   The new company will provide securities underwriting, trading,
mergers and acquisitions services and derivative transactions, the
reports said.
	   Sumitomo confirmed that it was in talks with Daiwa on a possible
joint venture, but declined to say if a definite agreement had been
reached. Daiwa refused to comment.
	   Quoting sources at the two companies, the respected Nihon Keizai
business daily said the venture would be announced later Tuesday.
	   Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga reportedly welcomed the
prospect of a linkup between two of Japan's top financial
institutions.
	   ``It is admirable that the nation's financial institutions make
efforts to strengthen their management bases, amid development of
the Japanese `Big Bang' financial reform,'' Kyodo quoted Matsunaga
as saying.
	   Japan has been introducing a series of financial deregulation
reforms, dubbed the ``Big Bang,'' aimed at invigorating the economy
by opening up markets to greater competition.
	   Sumitomo and Daiwa are also reportedly studying a possible
consolidation of overseas securities units, while Sumitomo is
considering merging its securities subsidiary, Sumitomo Capital
Securities Co., into the new company, the Nihon Keizai said.
	   The two are also seeking to form a tie-up with an overseas
institution, the paper said.
	   Sources at the two financial giants said the new venture is
expected to start operating in April of next year with
capitalization of 300 billion yen (dlrs 2.1 billion), Kyodo News
service reported.
	   Daiwa will have a 60 percent stake while Sumitomo will take the
remaining 40 percent, Kyodo said, quoting the sources.
	   The reported move is the latest in a continuing consolidation in
Japan's financial industry.
	   Banks and other financial institutions are scrambling to form
new alliances with both domestic and overseas companies in line
with the reforms.
	   Last month, Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. announced that it will
form Japan's largest asset management company early next year
	   Foreign financial companies are also moving rapidly to take
advantage of the sweeping deregulation. U.S. securities company
Merrill Lynch and Co. is expanding its brokerage business here
after hiring some 2,000 employees of failed Yamaichi Securities
Co., Japan's fourth-largest brokerage.
	   Yamaichi folded late last year after revealing more than 250
billion yen (dlrs 1.8 billion) in hidden losses.

Tibetan monk arrested in crackdown dies after torture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Tibetan monk arrested two years ago for
protesting a Chinese-ordered ban on photos of the Dalai Lama has
died after being tortured in prison, a monitoring group reported
Tuesday.
	   Yeshe Samten died May 12, six days after he was released,
limping on crutches and with two broken ribs, from Trisam prison,
just west of the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, the London-based Tibet
Information Network reported.
	   The group did not report a cause of death and said it was not
known why Samten, 22, had been tortured in prison. He performed
forced labor, raising pigs and farming, at Trisam, which TIN
estimated houses 50 political prisoners.
	   Samten began his formal Buddhist studies at age 12, entering
Ganden monastery, one of Tibet's highest centers of learning and a
hotbed of anti-Chinese sentiment.
	   On May 6, 1996, Ganden monks attacked and drove out Chinese
officials trying to enforce a ban on displaying photographs of the
Dalai Lama, the leader of Tibet's theocracy living in exile in
India. Troops returned the next day, arresting 60 monks, Samten
included.
	   The confrontation at Ganden, 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of
Lhasa, marked the start of a Chinese government campaign to
discredit the Dalai Lama and purge his supporters from Buddhist
monasteries. As many as 100 monks have been expelled from Ganden,
Tibet Information Network said.
	   Despite 47 years of often harsh Chinese rule, Buddhist monks and
nuns have been in the forefront of protests for Tibetan
independence.

Man jailed for fatally suffocating wife during sex
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A man who fatally smothered his
wife with a pillow while having sex with her was sentenced to 18
months in jail, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   A court in the northern state of Perak on Monday handed down the
sentence to P. Kanatazan, 33, after he pleaded guilty to
suffocating Lim Set Lee, 36, in a hotel room in a Cameron Highlands
holiday resort on Aug. 27 last year, New Straits Times said.
	   Lim died due to compression of the neck and asphyxia, the
newspaper said.
	   Prosecutors had told the court that Kanatazan had pressed the
pillow on Lim's face to keep her from making loud noises. After
about five minutes he realized that Lim was motionless.
	   Kanatazan initially fled the hotel, but later confessed to the
killing when questioned by police. Kanatazan's lawyer had pleaded
leniency, saying his client was not a murderer and had pleaded
guilty.

<TEXT>
	   EAST MEADOW, New York (AP) _ The father of the young Chinese
gymnast paralyzed in a practice fall at the Goodwill Games said
Monday he is confident his daughter will compete again.
	   Sang Shisheng and his wife, Chen Xiufeng, gave their first
interview since arriving in the United States on Saturday, four
days after 17-year-old Sang Lan landed head-first while practicing
for the vault. It was the first time either had left China.
	   Sitting rigidly and slowly curling and tightening her fingers
around one another, Chen, a factory worker, spoke in a soft voice
of when she first saw Sang after the accident.
	   ``When I first saw my daughter laying on the sick bed, my heart
was so hurt that she looked at me and said, `Mother, don't worry
about me because the doctor here and the medicine here is very,
very good. You have to have confidence. You have to have courage to
allow me to recover,''' Chen said.
	   During that first visit, Sang Shisheng said his daughter was
concerned only with others.
	   ``When my wife saw my daughter, she started crying,'' he said
through an interpreter. ``So my tears also dropped and my daughter
saw us crying and she said: `Mother, Father, don't cry, be strong,
OK?' She asked about the results of the other gymnasts. She also
asked her mother, `When you come over to America, who takes care of
your work? Be strong.'''
	   Sang Shisheng, a government housing officer, was certain his
daughter would compete again, let alone walk.
	   ``I am sure she will be back to the competition circle because
she is very courageous and with the excellent medical (care), the
doctors and hospitals in America, I am sure she will one day be
back to the contest,'' he said.
	   But Sang Lan's doctors on Monday dismissed earlier speculation
that she had regained feeling in her toes.
	   ``There is no change in her neurological exam,'' Dr. Brock
Schnebel, head physician of the Goodwill Games, told The Associated
Press after discussing treatment options with the parents.
	   Schnebel said Sang was on pain-killers but slept well after a
full day spent with her family and other visitors.
	   ``It's hard to shut her up and keep her calm, actually,'' he
said of the woman described by her parents as ``athletic and
courageous.''
	   Schnebel said Sang's parents have not decided whether to move
her back to China and continue the treatment with the experimental
nerve-building drug she is now receiving, or to start her
rehabilitation in the United States.
	   She could be ready to fly as early as next week, he said.
	   ``I think her young age makes treatment easier,'' Schnebel said.
	   Sang, China's 1997 national vault champion, had seven hours of
surgery Saturday at Nassau County Medical Center to stabilize bones
in her spine that shattered last Tuesday when she fell.
	   On Sunday night, she had other visitors besides her parents.
	   ``The team manager, the trainer and the coach and all the
members of the team went to see her, and many of them, they cannot
hold themselves, they cried a little bit,'' Sang Shisheng said.
``But Sang Lan, she did not have even one drop of tears. Rather,
she asked her fellow gymnasts what medals did they get; did you get
gold medal or what? And, also asked the coach: `Why did I fail this
time?'''

German tourist injured by debris from Bangkok construction site

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A 20-year-old woman on vacation from
Germany suffered a fractured skull when she was hit by falling
debris from the construction of Bangkok's first commuter rail line,
police said Tuesday.
	   Isabel Gacso was hit on Monday by a piece of a sling used to
lift building materials to the elevated train. She had just arrived
in the city and was leaving her hotel to shop on Sukhumvit Road, a
major avenue.
	   Ital-Thai, the company building the rail line, has been heavily
criticized by Bangkok governor Bhichit Rattakul and city residents
for creating unsafe and unclean conditions at the railway
construction sites.
	   Bhichit visited Gacso at a local hospital on Monday, police
said.
	   There have been several accidents at the sites. Earlier this
year, a taxi driver was killed and another injured when a steel
beam weighing more than a ton fell from the building area on
Sukhumvit Road.
	   In Monday's incident, Gacso's friend, Rene Hancke, also suffered
a slight shoulder injury. They have filed a criminal complaint
against Ital-Thai, police said.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with soccer quotes, Cuban cyclist missing, interview
with parents of Chinese gymnast paralyzed in accident. &QL; 
 &UR; By MELISSA MURPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Mia Hamm continued scoring and the
U.S. women's soccer team continued its string of firsts.
	   With Hamm scoring both goals, the United States beat China 2-0
Monday night to win the gold medal in the debut of soccer at the
Goodwill Games.
	   The U.S. women's soccer team also won the first gold medal at
the Olympics and the world championships.
	   The United States had an 11-2 advantage in shots on goal over
China and extended its domestic winning streak to 38 games before a
crowd of 11,307 at Mitchel Field. It was the largest crowd so far
at a Goodwill Games event.
	   ``It was a tremendous effort,'' Hamm said. ``China is a very
athletic club. They play a frantic style.''
	   While it was a relatively light day for sports, there was plenty
of action away from the arenas.
	   Ivan Dominguez, a member of the Cuban cycling team, was reported
missing after failing to return home with the squad.
	   Games officials and members of the Cuban delegation said
Dominguez was last seen Sunday night when he left the team's hotel.
	   New York police, the U.S. State Department and the Immigration
and Naturalization Service all said they had no information on the
case.
	   Meanwhile, the parents of paralyzed Chinese gymnast Sang Lan
said they were confident their daughter would compete again.
	   ``I am sure she will be back to the competition circle because
she is very courageous and with the excellent medical (care), the
doctors and hospitals in America, I am sure she will one day be
back to the contest,'' said Sang Shisheng, her father.
	   Doctors, however, said Sang's condition had not changed.
	   Norway defeated Denmark 4-2 in a shootout for the soccer bronze
medal after a 1-1 tie in regulation.
	   The Americans, who beat China 2-1 for the gold at the 1996
Olympics, improved to 11-3-4 against the Chinese and remain
unbeaten in their last nine meetings.
	   Hamm's 97th international goal in the 87th minute was an
unassisted blast from 35 yards (31.99 meters) that curled into the
back of the net over the head of China goalie Zhao Yan.
	   Hamm scored her first goal in the 66th minute on an assist from
Kristine Lilly. She scored on a breakaway from 14 yards (12.80
meters), beating Zhao into the left corner of the net.
	   ``When you play with somebody so long, you know exactly what
they want to do with the ball,'' Lilly said of her teammate of 11
years.
	   Hamm tied teammate Michelle Akers with 97 career goals and
finished with five goals in two games.
	   ``Mia Hamm turned in a Michael Jordan-like performance
tonight,'' U.S. coach Tony DiCicco said. ``In fact, I think China
took the game over and had more quality chances than we did, but
then Mia scored the brilliant goal.''
	   The U.S. team controlled the ball in China's end, outshooting
their opponent 12-1 in the first half, but Zhao made lunging saves
on the first five shots.
	   That seemed to frustrate the United States, which then missed
easier opportunities. Akers missed a wide open shot from 25 yards
(22.85 meters) over the top of the net in the 24th minute, and
Tiffeny Milbrett had two near misses, one wide right and another
cross from the left side in the 33rd and 35th minutes. Lilly missed
wide right two minutes later.
	   U.S. goalie Briana Scurry made a one-handed save at the top of
the crossbar in the 55th minute on a free kick by Sun Wen. China
had a chance to tie in the 78th minute, but Scurry came out of goal
to cut off the angle, forcing Zhang Ouying's open shot wide right.
Scurry, who had two saves, got her ninth shutout in her last 14
games.
	   ``China had two very good goal opportunities, but we were unable
to score,'' coach Ma Yuanan said. ``Mia Hamm is very fast and agile
and caused havoc on our defense.''
	   The U.S. team last lost on home soil to defending World Cup
champion Norway on Feb. 4, 1996 in Jacksonville, Florida.
	   In earlier meetings with China this year, the teams tied 0-0 in
China, and the United States won 4-1 two months later in Portugal
on a hat trick by Hamm on her 26th birthday.
	   The Goodwill Games boxing tournament began, and an American
scored a quick upset.
	   Bantamweight Antonio Rodriguez of Waianae, Hawaii, outpointed
world championship bronze medalist Soner Karaaoz of Turkey 9-1 in
the quarterfinals.
	   Other American winners included heavyweight DaVarryl Williamson
of Aurora, Colorado, whose bout against Italy's Giocahino Mocerino
was stopped when Williamson landed a punch to the head;
welterweights Miguel Espino and Larry Mosely; lightweight Jacob
Hudson; bantamweight Jose Santa Cruz; and heavyweight Malcolm Tann.
	   Light-flyweight Jose Navarro of Los Angeles lost 9-2 to world
championship silver medalist Roel Velasco.
	   Dmitry Sautin, repeating his 3-meter and platform double from
the 1998 World Championships, won the platform diving.
	   The Russian easily defeated two Chinese divers in the platform,
where he also is the 1996 Olympic champion.
	   Sautin had 665.49 points for the gold medal, while Tian Liang
had 623.01 and Sun Shuwei 598.80 for the silver and bronze.
	   Three Americans _ Mark Ruiz, Kevin McMahon and Kyle Prandi _
finished sixth, seventh and eighth.

Accidents on the rise in Vietnam

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Traffic accidents killed 3,300 people and
injured nearly 13,000 others in Vietnam in the first six months
this year, local press reported Tuesday.
	   The Ho Chi Minh City Police newspaper quoted the Traffic Police
Department as reporting 11,172 traffic accidents in the first half,
up 11 percent from the same period last year. The number of deaths
increased by 258, or 8.5 percent.
	   The paper blamed the increases on poor infrastructure, aging
vehicles and a sharp increase in the number of vehicles.
	   Vietnam, one of the world's poorest countries, now has 420,000
cars, up from 251,725 in 1990.
	   The number of motorbikes has risen to 4.8 million from more than
1 million eight years ago, an annual average increase of 14.1
percent, according to the Road Transport Department.
	   Cars and motorbikes also fight for space with more than 10
million bicycles, foot-powered cyclo taxis and 20,000 tractors.

Finance Minister: Malaysian rating downgrades too pessimistic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim
said the views of Standard and Poor's and Moody's Investors Service
on Malaysia's economy were too pessimistic.
	   ``I think they probably haven't taken the measures either
announced or in the process of being implemented into account,''
Anwar told reporters Tuesday.
	   Moody's on Friday knocked Malaysia's long-term foreign currency
rating down three notches, just two levels above junk status. It
was quickly followed by a downgrade by Standard and Poor's. Both
agencies forecast a negative outlook for the economy.
	   The move forced Anwar to postpone a planned roadshow to drum up
support for a dlrs 2 billion government bond issue which would have
financed a scheme to help debt-ridden banks recover.
	   Last week, Malaysia's policy-making panel, the National Economic
Action Council, unveiled a recovery plan which emphasized currency
and price stability, while also pledging to help out troubled
companies. Raising money overseas was crucial to the plan's
success.
	   The plan envisaged increased lending by banks and more
government spending on infrastructure and construction works to
generate jobs and future projects.
	   Anwar this month forecast a recession for 1998, with the economy
shrinking by up to 2 percent. But independent analysts say it could
contract by 5 percent.

Capriati taking different path in comeback attempt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with night matches &QL; 
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STANFORD, California (AP) _ A few years ago, Jennifer Capriati
was a center-court attraction at Grand Slam tournaments. Now, she
has to play qualifying matches just to get into tour events.
	   Capriati reached the main draw of the dlrs 450,000 Bank of the
West tournament Monday by winning a qualifying match against
Mercedes Paz, who was playing the last singles match of her 15-year
pro career.
	   ``I'm in the best shape that I have been in a while,'' said
Capriati, ranked 117th in the world after having reached as high as
No. 6 as a teenager in the early 1990s.
	   ``It's been frustrating, though, because every time I get in
shape and things are going well, something happens to set me back
like an injury. I'm working out now to make sure I don't get
injured.''
	   Capriati was 14 in 1990 when she reached the semifinals of the
French Open in her first Grand Slam event. She had earned dlrs 1
million and won an Olympic gold medal by shortly after her 16th
birthday.
	   But she fell victim to burnout and drugs, dropping off the
circuit in 1993. She made a comeback attempt in late 1994 that
lasted just one match. Her latest comeback began in 1996, but has
been slowed by injuries.
	   This year, she has failed to get past the quarterfinals of any
tournament. She returned to Wimbledon for the first time since
1993, losing in the second round.
	   Now 22, Capriati said she's motivated again and trying to spend
more time on the practice court.
	   ``Actually, I'm being more serious now,'' she said. ``I'm trying
to get back up to the top. That's what I really want.''
	   Capriati, who did not lose a set in her three qualifying
matches, defeated Paz 6-2, 6-4. She will face Corina Morariu in a
first-round match Tuesday night.
	   Paz, 32, who is focusing on doubles as her career winds down,
said the loss to Capriati will be her last singles match. After
being overpowered by Capriati, she wished the victor luck in her
comeback attempt.
	   ``I think it's a good challenge for Jennifer and it's very good
that she has tennis,'' Paz said.
	   Another player trying to make a comeback, Steffi Graf, is seeded
fourth in the tournament despite falling to No. 57 in the world
since having reconstructive left knee surgery last year.
	   Graf and top three seeds Lindsay Davenport, Monica Seles and
Venus Williams all have first-round byes and will not play until
Wednesday at the earliest.
	   Monday night's first-round matches featured a pair of players
with Stanford connections.
	   Sixth-seeded Joannette Kruger of South Africa won 1-6, 6-2, 6-4
over Lilia Osterloh, who won the 1997 NCAA singles title as a
Stanford freshman.
	   And Marissa Irvin, who will be a freshman at Stanford this fall,
lost 6-1, 4-6, 6-0 to seventh-seeded Elena Likhovtseva of Russia.

Rod Laver suffers stroke during TV interview
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS style on Grand Slam events in 6th graf; ADDS that no
details available from ESPN &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Tennis Hall of Famer Rod Laver suffered a
stroke Monday while doing an interview with ESPN, a network
spokesman said.
	   The 59-year-old Australian, whose 11 Grand Slam singles titles
are one fewer than all-time leader Roy Emerson, was taken to UCLA
Medical Center, ESPN spokesman Rob Tobias said.
	   Laver's family requested that no information about his condition
be released, according to a nursing supervisor at the center who
declined to be identified.
	   Tobias said no details were available on the circumstances
surrounding Laver's stroke.
	   Laver, nicknamed ``Rocket'' for his powerful groundstrokes, is
the only player in history to twice sweep the four Grand Slam
events in one year. The left-hander did it as an amateur in 1962
and as a pro in 1969.
	   He won four Wimbledons, three Australian titles, two U.S.
championships and two French titles in singles. He also won nine
Grand Slam doubles titles.
	   During his 23-year career, he won 47 pro singles titles and was
runner-up 21 times. He also starred for Australia in Davis Cup
competition, compiling a 16-4 record in singles and a 4-0 mark in
doubles
	   Laver, who lives in Newport Beach, California, was the world's
top-ranked player in 1961, 1962, 1968 and 1969 and earned dlrs 1.5
million during his career.
	   He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in
1981.

Indonesia imposes 3-week ban on exports of subsidized commodities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian government has imposed
a ban on exports of several subsidized commodities to ensure
adequate domestic supply and price stability, a news report said.
	   The ban, beginning Tuesday, covers fish powder, unhusked rice,
milled rice, cracked rice, wheat, wheat flour, rice flour,
soybeans, sugar and kerosene, the Jakarta Post daily reported.
	   The paper quoted Minister of Trade and Industry Rahardi Ramelan
as saying Monday that the ban would run until August 16 when it
will be replaced by an export tax.
	   According to Ramelan, Indonesia's monetary crisis has created
price disparities between the local and international markets,
triggering an outflow of goods, including products which are
subsidized by the government.
	   ``Although the export ban is not the correct measure, it must be
taken by the government to secure the nation's interests,'' he
said.
	   He said commodities already given export taxes, such as crude
palm oil and its derivatives, were not included on the export ban
list.
	   The International Monetary Fund's director for the Asia-Pacific,
Hubert Neiss, has said that the export ban was agreed to by the IMF
as a temporary measure to prevent subsidized goods from being
exported out of the country.

Washington State football player arrested in rape investigation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PULLMAN, Washington (AP) _ A Washington State football player
has been arrested for investigation of rape, burglary and theft.
	   Taeao Salausa, 21, a 6-foot-5 (1.96 meters), 284-pound
(128.82-kilo) defensive tackle from Long Beach, California, was
taken into custody Sunday and released Monday after an appearance
in Whitman County District Court.
	   Prosecutors have 48 hours to file charges. He was suspended from
the team.
	   A police report issued late Monday said a 29-year-old female
student at Washington State told officers Salausa entered her home
and raped her July 11, after which she found some of her
possessions missing. The report said they were acquainted.
Detective Fred Baker told the Spokesman-Review of Spokane she
indicated she had met Salausa earlier that evening.
	   In agreeing to release Salausa, Judge David Frazier ordered that
he avoid contact with the woman, refrain from using alcohol or
other drugs and remain in the area.
	   Salausa was suspended from the team ``until I have the
opportunity to meet with him and the local police agencies,'' Coach
Mike Price said. ``Making any long-range decision regarding his
Cougar football future before meeting with the authorities would be
premature and unfair to everyone involved.''
	   Salausa made 13 tackles and one interception last season,
appearing in all 12 games, including the Rose Bowl. He made one
start and was considered a potential starter this fall.
	   He attended Long Beach Poly high school, spent two years at Long
Beach City College and transferred to Washington State last year.

Sprewell gets home detention in reckless driving case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES that Sprewell reportedly has moved to Milwaukee &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MARTINEZ, California (AP) _ Latrell Sprewell was sentenced to
three months of home detention Monday after pleading no contest to
a reckless driving charge.
	   Sprewell, who was originally suspended for one year and had his
dlrs 24 million contract terminated by the Golden State Warriors
last season for choking coach P.J. Carlesimo, also was placed on
two years probation, fined dlrs 1,000 and ordered not to have a gun
in his possession.
	   Sprewell, who could have been sentenced to six months in jail,
told KGO-TV he agreed to plead no contest in order to put the case
behind him.
	   ``It's just been unfortunate,'' Sprewell said. ``I'm just trying
to move on. It seems like every day it's something new again.''
	   Sprewell swerved out of an exit-only lane on a Walnut Creek
freeway on March 1 and struck another car, injuring a couple.
	   The couple has said they intend to sue Sprewell in civil court.
	   Defense attorneys suggested the plea bargain to avoid
gavel-to-gavel coverage on Court TV. Jury selection was to have
begun Tuesday.
	   Last week, Municipal Court Judge Bruce Mills allowed Court TV's
request to televise the trial as long as it did not interfere with
the proceedings. However, because the charges were misdemeanor,
Sprewell would not have been required to attend the trial.
	   It was not immediately known when Sprewell's home detention
would begin, which will involve an electronic ankle monitoring
device. He has moved from Northern California to Milwaukee, the
Contra Costa Times said.

Goodwill Games swimming has unusual team format
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BILL BARNARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Since swimmers get little of the
endorsement and appearance money enjoyed by other athletes, dlrs
50,000 should be quite an incentive for them.
	   That amount is what organizers are offering swimmers who have
completed their college eligibility if they can set a world record
at the Goodwill Games.
	   U.S. swimmers, however, seem to have more important things on
their mind as the meet begins tonight with a unique dual-meet team
format.
	   ``It would be nice, but you don't get into swimming for the
money, you do it for fun,'' said Lenny Krayzelburg of Los Angeles,
who won the 100-meter and 200 backstroke at the world championships
this year. ``You might see more swimmers go for it on the
international teams if they prepared for this meet.''
	   Most of the Americans are looking ahead to the U.S. national
championships in Clovis, California, as the most important of the
summer. Teams for four international meets in 1999 will be selected
based on those results.
	   ``Sometimes records just happen when you don't expect them, but
most of the U.S. team is pointing for the nationals,'' Krayzelburg
said.
	   Krayzelburg, who moved with his family to the United States from
Ukraine 10 years ago when he was 13 and became a U.S. citizen six
years later, said the older swimmers have their eyes on the dlrs
50,000 in prize money to be split by the winning men's and women's
teams.
	   Just four of the 18 U.S. women and 10 of the 18 men are out of
college and eligible for prize money.
	   ``I'm just looking at that dlrs 5,000,'' Bill Pilczuk said of a
male's share of the prize.
	   Pilczuk failed to make the 1996 Olympics, but he finally made a
splash internationally in January when he broke Russian Aleksandr
Popov's seven-year unbeaten string and won the world championship
in Perth, Australia.
	   ``Life has gotten a lot easier for me since then,'' Pilczuk
said, referring to the stipend the national swimming federation
gives to top performers. ``I don't have to worry about where the
money is coming from. I finally got rid of my old Pontiac. I got a
car with air-conditioning, which is good because it has been the
hottest summer in Alabama history.''
	   Popov and Pilczuk meet again at the Goodwill Games, although the
dual-meet format will have them both racing in the 50 twice against
other teams before they swim against each other Sunday.
	   ``I look at this as more of a fun matchup,'' said Pilczuk, of
Auburn, Alabama. ``The only real big races are the Olympics and the
world championships. I feel like I won the big rivalry race this
year, and the next one isn't until the Olympics. He might look at
it differently since I beat him this year.''
	   Popov, the world record-holder for 100 meters, is regarded as
something of a distance swimmer by Pilczuk, who doesn't swim
anything but the 50.
	   ``I'm aerobically challenged,'' Pilczuk said. ``The 100 is too
long for me.''
	   The U.S. women will swim against China tonight, an international
All-Star team on Thursday and Germany on Saturday.
	   The U.S. men will face Germany on Wednesday, an All-Star team on
Friday and Russia on Sunday.
	   The men's All-Star team has swimmers from Cuba, Puerto Rico,
South Africa, France, Italy, Brazil, Canada, Hungary, Britain,
Venezuela, Ukraine and the Netherlands.
	   The women's All-Star team is from South Africa, France, Ukraine,
Russia, Egypt, Japan, Slovakia, Costa Rica, Spain, New Zealand and
the Netherlands.
	   ``This format gives me three chances on three different days to
prove myself, and if I have a bad day, I can make up for it,''
Pilczuk said.

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ DaVarryl Williamson celebrates his 30th birthday
Saturday, a day after he hopes to collect a boxing gold medal at
the Goodwill Games.
	   Williamson, a heavyweight from Aurora, Colorado, began his quest
with a victory Monday, the referee stopping his bout with Italy's
Giocahino Mocerino at 1:19 of the first round after the American
landed a pair of big rights to the head.
	   ``I though I hurt him with the first right,'' Williamson said.
``The coaches wanted me to stay behind the jab. I did that and
caught him with the next right. I don't think I looked that good.
But I did throw a lot of punches.''
	   Williamson is one of three Americans in the heavyweight group,
which also includes four-time world champion and two-time Olympic
gold medalist Felix Savon of Cuba. The Colorado veteran knows it
will be a tough battle to get to Friday's final.
	   ``I turn 30 Saturday, so for a birthday present I was hoping for
a good bracket,'' he said. ``I'll tell you all if I got it on
Saturday.''
	   Teammate Antonio Rodriguez scored the biggest upset of the first
day, outpointing world championship bronze medalist Soner Karaaoz
of Turkey 9-1 in a bantamweight quarterfinal.
	   ``I went in and fought smart,'' said Rodriguez, from Waianae,
Hawaii. ``He was a strong fighter, He took some of my best shots,
but I thought it would have been a lot tougher. He had a reach over
mine.''
	   Other U.S. winners included lightweight Jacob Hudson over Kwon
Kee-duk of South Korea and welterweight Miguel Espino over Neil
Gough of Ireland.
	   World championship runner-up Jean-Paul Mendy of France stopped
Randy Griffin of Philadelphia at 1:59 of the second round of their
middleweight bout.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; CHINA CONFUSION: &LR;  China's swimming roster for the Goodwill
Games included the name Yan Chen. But U.S. Swimming officials,
realizing that China has two swimmers with that name, used the
birth date to try to determine which one was coming.
	   The Yan Chen born in 1981 is a world record-holder in the 400
individual medley who won two individual gold medals at this year's
World Championships. The Yan Chen born in 1978 finished no better
than fifth in an individual event in the world meet.
	   Noting that 1978 was the year of birth on the original
application, the lesser Yan Chen was included in the media guide.
But the final entry application has 1981 as the year of birth, so
officials had to scramble Monday to update reporters that the more
accomplished swimmer would compete Tuesday.
	   At least, they think so.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; SANDY SAMBA: &LR;  Brazil will have the top-ranked women's team in
the world as it goes for a sweep of Goodwill Games beach volleyball
gold medals.
	   The International volleyball federation's rankings released
Monday showed Shelda Bede and Adriana Behar No. 1, after a
second-place finish in a weekend meet in Marseille, France. They
received the top seed in the Goodwill A pool.
	   Holly McPeak and Lisa Arce of the United States are the next
highest-ranked team in the Goodwill field, at No. 4, and were
placed atop the B pool, The tournament opens Wednesday.
	   The world's top-ranked men's team of Brazilians Guilherme
Marques and Para Ferreira won the Goodwill men's tournament Sunday
over American veterans Karch Kiraly and Adam Johnson.

Chinese performing arts reformer wins Magsaysay award
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo Available &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A former vice minister for culture
who encouraged reforms in China's performing arts was named winner
Tuesday of the 1998 Ramon Magsaysay Award covering the fields of
journalism, literature and the creative arts.
	   The awards board cited Ying Ruocheng, chairman and president of
the China Arts Festival Foundation, for ``enhancing China's
cultural dialogue with the world-at-large and with its own heritage
through a brilliant and persevering life in the theater.''
	   The award, named for the late Philippine President Ramon
Magsaysay, is the Asian equivalent of the Nobel Prize.
	   The awards board said that as vice minister of culture between
1986 and 1990, Ying, an actor, director and translator, used his
East-West cultural orientation to reform the performing arts in
China.
	   He encouraged independence and artistic freedom in the country's
3,000 government-sponsored performing arts troupes and fought
against cultural bias and bureaucratic censorship, the awards board
said.
	   Ying, dubbed his country's ``cultural ambassador,'' founded the
Beijing People's Art Theater in 1952 and mastered Chinese and
Western plays. He has also appeared in some Western films,
including Bernardo Bertolucci's The Last Emperor.
	   But during the tumultuous Cultural Revolution, he was jailed for
three years and spent another 10 years in a re-education camp. When
the turmoil subsided, he restarted his career.
	   The awards board earlier named Nuon Phaly of Cambodia the winner
for community leadership, Thai banker Sophon Suphapong for public
service and Pakistani doctor Adibul Hasan Rizvk for government
service.
	   The winners will be honored at the 40th presentation ceremonies
for the awards in Manila on Aug. 31, Magsaysay's birthday. The
popular Philippine president died in a plane crash in 1957.
	   The winners of the awards each receive a certificate, medallion
and dlrs 50,000.

Rod Laver suffers stroke during TV interview

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES 4th graf with details about TV interview &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Tennis Hall of Famer Rod Laver suffered a
stroke Monday after doing an interview with ESPN, a network
spokesman said.
	   The 59-year-old Australian, whose 11 Grand Slam singles titles
are one fewer than all-time leader Roy Emerson, was taken to UCLA
Medical Center, ESPN spokesman Rob Tobias said.
	   Laver's family requested that no information about his condition
be released, according to a nursing supervisor at the center who
declined to be identified.
	   Tobias said Laver was stricken after being interviewed for an
upcoming ESPN series about the greatest athletes of the 20th
century. Tobias said he didn't know exactly where or when the
interview took place.
	   Laver, nicknamed ``Rocket'' for his powerful groundstrokes, is
the only player in history to twice sweep the four Grand Slam
events in one year. The left-hander did it as an amateur in 1962
and as a pro in 1969.
	   He won four Wimbledons, three Australian titles, two U.S.
championships and two French titles in singles. He also won nine
Grand Slam doubles titles.
	   During his 23-year career, he won 47 pro singles titles and was
runner-up 21 times. He also starred for Australia in Davis Cup
competition, compiling a 16-4 record in singles and a 4-0 mark in
doubles
	   Laver, who lives in Newport Beach, California, was the world's
top-ranked player in 1961, 1962, 1968 and 1969 and earned dlrs 1.5
million during his career.
	   He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in
1981.

Hyundai Motor unionists refuse to return to work
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Hyundai Motor Co.'s assembly lines
remained idle for the ninth day Tuesday as 26,000 striking workers
refused to return to work, protesting planned layoffs.
	   Hyundai had hoped to resume operations Tuesday at its plants in
Ulsan, 280 kilometers (175 miles) southeast of Seoul, after closing
them for the past eight days to ease labor tension.
	   But its workers rejected management's appeal for a negotiated
settlement and said they would stay off the job until the company
cancels a plan to lay off several thousand employees.
	   Hyundai, the nation's leading automaker, seeks to shed 2,678
workers this month. A total of 859 workers took early retirement in
the past week, reducing the number to be laid off to 1,819.
	   The company also plans to put an additional 530 employees on
unpaid two-year leave this weekend. The company fired some 5,000
workers earlier this year.
	   Hyundai's management distributed leaflets urging workers to
return to work, while some 5,000 union members continued to picket
the plants.
	   Armed with plastic shields and batons, thousands of helmeted
riot police stood guard outside the plants for possible clashes
between the two sides. There were no immediate reports of violence.
	   With domestic sales dropping sharply in the midst of a national
economic crisis, Hyundai's auto plants are operating at 40 percent
of their capacity of 1.25 million units a year.
	   South Korea's economy was bailed out by the International
Monetary Fund in December. With bankruptcies mounting, more than
1.5 million workers have been driven out of their jobs.
	   Hyundai Motor was the first major South Korea company to
announce mass layoffs. Other big companies are expected to follow
suit.

Sosa's home runs power Cubs past Diamondbacks, 6-2

	   PHOENIX (AP) _ Sammy Sosa hit his 39th and 40th home runs,
including his first career grand slam, and drove in all of
Chicago's runs Monday night as the Cubs beat the Arizona
Diamondbacks 6-2.
	   Sosa's eighth-inning shot to straightaway center-field ended the
longest streak of homers without a slam from the start of a career
in major league history.
	   Sosa had hit 246 homers without a grand slam before he hit
reliever Alan Embree's first pitch 438 feet (133.50 meters) over
the wall. Earlier, his two-run opposite field homer tied it at 2 in
the sixth.
	   Sosa set a major league record with 20 homers in June, but had
hit only four in July until homering Sunday against New York at
Wrigley Field.
	   He matched his career best of 40 homers. He has 102 RBIs,
surpassing the 100 mark for the fourth consecutive season. Sosa
tied a career high with six RBIs.
	   Mark McGwire of St. Louis leads the majors with 44 home runs.
	   Winner Steve Trachsel (10-5) gave up just three hits in eight
innings. Willie Blair (4-15) took the loss.
 &UR; Braves 3, Reds 2 &QC; 
	   In Cincinnati, Ozzie Guillen singled home the go-ahead run in
the 10th inning as the Atlanta Braves recovered from a late blown
lead and beat the Cincinnati Reds.
	   Guillen's two-out single off Gabe White, his third of the game,
drove in Curtis Pride from third and left the Braves 2-3 in
extra-inning games this season.
	   Cincinnati absorbed its second consecutive 10-inning loss _ both
by Stan Belinda (4-8) _ and its 10th loss in the last 11 games
overall.
	   Rudy Seanez (2-0) pitched a perfect inning in relief of Tom
Glavine to get the victory, and Kerry Ligtenberg got the final
three outs for his 14th save.
 &UR; Astros 9, Marlins 1 &QC; 
	   In Houston, Jose Lima pitched a six-hitter and Moises Alou had
four hits, including a solo homer and RBI single, to lead the
Houston Astros over the Florida Marlins.
	   Lima (9-6) pitched his second complete game of the season,
striking out six and walking none.
	   Jeff Bagwell and Derek Bell each homered and drove in three runs
for the Astros, who had 14 hits.
	   Brian Meadows (9-8) allowed seven runs and seven hits in four
innings. He left with a strained groin after giving up two
consecutive hits to open the Houston fifth.
 &UR; Rockies 8, Pirates 7, 13 innings
	   In Denver, Jeff Reed doubled home the winning run in the bottom
of the 13th inning, and Vinny Castilla homered twice and doubled as
the Colorado Rockies beat the Pittsburgh Pirates.
	   The Rockies rallied from a five-run deficit and won for the
sixth time in seven games.
	   Todd Helton led off the 13th with a single against Jeff McCurry
(0-1). Two outs later, Reed hit a line drive that left fielder
Steve Bieser cut off in the gap. Bieser threw to shortstop Lou
Collier, but Reed beat the relay to the plate.
	   Curtis Leskanic (5-3) pitched two scoreless innings.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Strongman Hun Sen's party claimed a
landslide victory Tuesday in Cambodia's parliamentary elections,
but the opposition called the result fraud, setting the stage for
more turmoil in the troubled country.
	   Though official results had still not been released, the
Cambodian People's Party claimed it had won 66 of 122 seats in the
National Assembly, a commanding majority over 40 for Prince Norodom
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC and 16 for the Sam Rainsy Party.
	   Ranariddh and former finance minister Sam Rainsy, who have been
on-again, off-again allies, held a strategy session at the prince's
house, then went outside and were applauded by a crowd of
motorcycle taxi drivers who have been among the most dedicated
opposition supporters.
	   Ranariddh complained of counting irregularities and said the
opposition wanted a thorough investigation, claiming that only
seven seats should separate the top parties.
	   ``We will not recognize the result of the election,'' Ranariddh
said. ``Yesterday, in the morning, until about 11 or 12 o'clock,
FUNCINPEC was leading everywhere. We were clearly leading. But in
the afternoon, the situation was reversed.''
	   The Hun Sen-dominated National Election Committee was to have
released preliminary official results late Monday but then
postponed the disclosure, prompting fears of tampering in favor of
Hun Sen. When an announcement was finally made Tuesday, the figures
covered only nine communes from two of the country's 21 provinces.
	   ``Any results suggesting that this party wins or this party
loses will affect the minds of voters,'' said Samraing Kimsan, the
NEC spokesman.``The NEC (thinks) this kind of behavior can
undermine public order.''
	   The Committee for Free and Fair Elections in Cambodia, the
country's top independent election monitor, said its figures showed
that Hun Sen's party had taken 40 percent to 50 percent of the
vote.
	   Hun Sen's party claimed to have received 1.8 million votes,
compared to 1.4 million for FUNCINPEC and 583,000 for the Sam
Rainsy Party. Assembly seats are allotted under a complicated
formula not entirely reflecting the popular vote.
	   The normally talkative Sam Rainsy, asked if he accepted the
claims, said simply, ``No.''
	   If the results are not accepted by Hun Sen's rivals or the
millions of Cambodians who voted Sunday, the outcome could be more
turmoil for a country that has suffered 30 years of civil war and
the Khmer Rouge genocide of the 1970s.
	   Without waiting for the results, the group coordinating 678
foreign observers from 40 countries declared the process free and
fair Monday, though the campaign had been marked by violence,
including murder, and intimidation by Hun Sen's supporters against
the opposition.
	   The Joint International Observers Group, dominated by the
European Union, the main foreign donor bank-rolling the elections,
issued a declaration saying ``all parties should accept and honor
the results of the election without any attempt to undermine the
original outcome.''
	   Hun Sen refused to accept defeat in U.N.-sponsored polls in 1993
and forced the winner, Ranariddh, to accept a co-premiership or
face civil war. A year ago, Hun Sen ended their tense arrangement
by sending tanks into the streets and deposing Ranariddh in two
days of fighting.
	   The international endorsement was an important step toward Hun
Sen's goal _ restoration of international legitimacy and aid lost
because of his bloody coup.
	   Opponents said for months that Hun Sen had rigged the outcome.
The United States, which said violence flawed the process from the
outset, has indicated it may issue a separate judgment, though
State Department spokesman James Rubin said in Washington it was
too early.
	   At least 90 percent of the 5.4 million registered voters cast
ballots Sunday, showing faith in the democratic process.
	   But U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned that
process could still unravel.
	   ``The real test of Cambodia's democracy will come after the
ballots are counted,'' she said in Manila, the Philippines.
	   Election day was not free of violence. An attack on a military
outpost by die-hard remnants of the Khmer Rouge left 10 people
dead. But more significantly, thousands of former guerrillas who
have made peace over the past two years voted for the first time in
their lives.

Germany's Commerzbank invests in Korea Exchange Bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Germany's Commerzbank AG signed a
formal agreement Tuesday to invest dlrs 250 million in financially
troubled Korea Exchange Bank, the South Korean bank said.
	   Under the agreement, Korea Exchange Bank issued 70 million new
shares Tuesday, which Commerzbank bought for dlrs 3.57 per share.
The new shares will be listed on the stock exchange on Aug. 10.
	   The deal gave the German bank a 29.79 percent stake in the
Korean bank and made it the second largest stockholder after the
Seoul government, whose share will drop to 33.62 percent after the
capital increase.
	   The Korea Exchange Bank will yield two board seats and two
non-standing board seats to Commerzbank for participation in key
decisions on risk management and lending policy, it said in a news
release.
	   Korea Exchange was among seven commercial banks ordered by the
government to improve their finances or face closure.
	   Tuesday's deal was the second major capital inflow into South
Korea's banking sector since a financial crisis hit the country
late last year.
	   The International Finance Corporation, a World Bank sister
organization, injected capital worth dlrs 77 million in two South
Korean banks in bonds and equity participation in June.
	   South Korean banks began seeking foreign investment after many
major businesses collapsed last year, saddling them with a huge
amount of non-performing loans.
	   South Korea was forced to accept a dlrs 58 billion bailout fund
from the International Monetary Fund in December. In return, it
promised to reform its bloated industries and finance sector.
	   Since then, the government has ordered the closure of five
financially shaky commercial banks, 14 finance companies and 55
other companies.

	   YUEYANG, China (AP) _ As flood waters roared through central
China's rich farmland and heavy industry center Tuesday, Beijing
called for a ``do or die'' effort to ensure the safety of millions
of people along the Yangtze River.
	   With waters on the mighty river continuing to rise, nearly 5
million people in five provinces were mobilized to help ensure that
anti-flood embankments held firm, the official Liberation Army
Daily said Tuesday.
	   Floods caused by rains that fell heavier and earlier than usual
have killed more than 1,145 people so far this year. Almost a
million people have been forced from their homes in the three
worst-hit provinces _ Hunan, Hubei and Jiangxi.
	   Worried that a flood crest, the third this month, would
undermine dikes weakened by heavy rains and high waters, the
government ``called for a do or die effort in protecting major
cities and river and lake embankments,'' the state-run Xinhua News
Agency said in a report late Monday.
	   The flood peak was the Yangtze's second-largest since 1954, when
floods killed 30,000 people and affected 10 million others, Xinhua
said.
	   ``People are holding their breath as the third flood peak
passes,'' it said.
	   The flood peak went through Yueyang city, on the edge of the
heavily swollen Dongting Lake, without incident early Tuesday and
was moving through Wuhan, central China's largest industrial center
with more than 7 million residents, state television said.
	   Water levels were 2.5 meters (8.25 feet) above the danger mark
in Wuhan on Monday night, Xinhua said.
	   To release pressure on the dikes, authorities were considering
whether to blow up levees upstream to divert flood waters into farm
districts and save cities from flooding.
	   Military boats, trucks and aircraft were working day and night
to deliver relief goods, and medical workers were working to
prevent possible epidemics of disease, Xinhua said.
	   In the interests of safety in flood-hit areas, police along the
Yangtze were ordered to step up patrols and crack down on thefts of
anti-flood equipment, the Liberation Army Daily said. They also
were ordered to ensure that prisoners did not escape from detention
centers, the official newspaper said.
	   The Finance Ministry, meanwhile, ordered stepped up supervision
of flood relief funds to ensure they are not diverted or wasted,
the People's Daily said.
	   Over the past 200 years, the 6,300-kilometer- (3,900-mile-) long
Yangtze has been hit by a devastating flood every 10 years, it
said.

Anti-Beijing activists seek government help to enter China

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A dozen anti-Beijing activists who claim they
have been blacklisted by mainland China appealed to a top Hong Kong
official on Tuesday to help them get permission to visit the
country.
	   The request would force the Hong Kong government to make public
its stance towards anti-Communist activists in the territory, one
of the most contentious issues after Hong Kong was returned to
Chinese rule last year.
	   ``We're Chinese. We should have the right to go back to China,''
said Szeto Wah, who is chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in
Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China.
	   The group has been branded subversive by Beijing. Szeto also is
a veteran legislator and a party whip of the Democrats, the
territory's largest party.
	   Despite fears before the handover, anti-Beijing protest remains
legal in Hong Kong and the government never has openly denounced
political activism. However, police presence is notably heavier at
protests.
	   Michael Suen, the government's secretary for constitutional
affairs, met behind closed doors with leaders of Szeto's group,
which was formed shortly after the 1989 military crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators near Tiananmen Square in Beijing.
	   It has helped mainland dissidents escape China, and sponsors an
annual candelight vigil to commemorate the hundreds, if not
thousands, who were slain.
	   Szeto said Chinese authorities had confiscated or refused
renewal of travel documents for visiting the mainland belonging to
many group members and other political activists. Some have been
detained for hours and turned away. At least several of the
activists have sought permission to visit relatives living on the
mainland.
	   Albert Ho, another leader of the organization, said some Hong
Kong residents with the same or similar names as prominent
activists also had been detained at the border. Szeto said he
believed Beijing has a blacklist of people deemed dangerous to the
country.
	   No authorities have explained why the activists have been denied
entry, Szeto said. Suen told legislators at a recent session that
the Hong Kong government has no say in the mainland's immigration
policy.
	   Szeto said that answer wasn't good enough.
	   ``They need to take a stance as to whether the (Hong Kong
government) has the responsibility to help its citizens,'' he said.
Hong Kong officials should ask Beijing to tell them in writing why
some people are barred from the mainland, he said.
	   Szeto quoted Suen as saying he would meet with the local Beijing
office in charge of Hong Kong and Macau affairs.
	   ``If they still can't resolve this, they need to go to the
higher-level offices until the message reaches (Chinese President)
Jiang Zemin,'' he said.
	   Szeto said activists would try to force their way into China
without permission if the government refused further help.

Observers endorse vote, but not the big picture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ International observer groups
Tuesday praised the voting process in Cambodia's parliamentary
elections, but disagreed sharply over the bigger picture.
	   The assessments by groups monitoring Sunday's vote came rolling
in well before preliminary official results, though the ruling
Cambodian People's Party was claiming a landslide victory while the
opposition cried fraud.
	   The groups generally praised the fairness of the actual voting
Sunday, when 90 percent of the 5.4 million registered voters cast
ballots, and the initial counting stages Monday.
	   But looking back at the violence that preceded the vote, when
strongman Hun Sen was accused of using murder and fear to ensure
victory, or ahead to post-election stability, they offered
different views.
	   A small but prestigious group, whose co-leader is former
Australian Ambassador Tony Kevin, issued a more-or-less unqualified
endorsement.
	   The statement from the Volunteer Observers for the Cambodian
Elections, which fielded 28 observers, said it believed the
election ``was an authentic expression of the Cambodian people's
choice.''
	   The group, widely seen as sympathetic to Hun Sen, dismissed
claims that there had been intimidation of the opposition or that
ballot counting was fraudulent.
	   ``VOCE believes that all governments which claim to have the
best interests of the Cambodian people at heart should now accept
the results of this election without any qualification'' and resume
aid, their statement said.
	   Another group, the Asian Network for Free Elections, was more
critical and withheld final judgment.
	   ``The people of Cambodia have demonstrated their commitment to
the democratic process by participating in the voting,'' ANFREL
said.
	   ``It is now up to their leaders to resolve outstanding issues''
related to the campaign and to ensure a peaceful transfer of power,
ANFREL said.
	   ANFREL said it had checked 247 polling station in four provinces
and believed that voting and counting had ``taken place in a
basically free atmosphere.''
	   But it also took note of complaints of ``grave human rights
violations'' and suggested the campaigning period had been too
short.
	   The ad hoc group coordinating the 678 foreign observers wrangled
over a statement for seven hours Monday, finally urging all parties
to accept the result and saying the vote was ``free and fair''
enough to reflect the will of the Cambodian people.

Singapore soccer league suspects match-fixing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's local soccer league has approached
the country's corruption watchdog with suspicions of match-fixing,
the league's head said Tuesday.
	   S-League chief executive officer Chris Chan told The Associated
Press that he notified the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau
in early June about ``two or three'' suspicious instances earlier
this year.
	   ``If I smell a rat, basically I just give (the authorities) a
call,'' Chan said, adding that ``sometimes if I feel a player is
not playing to form, and the results of the matches are unusual,
then something could be amiss.''
	   Singapore has been plagued with a number of match fixing cases
in recent years, since the formation of the island republic's
domestic soccer league in 1996.
	   Last September, a bookie convicted of fixing two S-League
matches was jailed 18 months and fined 200,000 Singapore dollars
(dlrs 116,000), while the football player who colluded with him was
jailed four months and fined 40,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs
23,000).
	   Over the next two months, five players from the Balestier
football club were brought to court in several match fixing cases,
and two of them were jailed and fined.
	   There have not been any arrests or charges during the current
season, which began in April, but some unusual results have raised
eyebrows.
	   ``We had two matches, one was 9-3 and the other 8-3, and some
people questioned those results,'' Chan said.
	   But he added that he had not yet heard anything from the Corrupt
Practices Investigation Bureau on their possible investigations.
	   Chan also said that he did not think there was a pattern of
widespread corruption this season, since the suspicious incidents
occurred early in the season and there have not been any more
since.
	   ``It's something very routine,'' Chan added. ``That's my working
relationship with the authorities ... so long as I have my
suspicions, I will call them.''
	   Season play ends this weekend, followed by regional competition
involving the Singapore national side in Vietnam this August and
September, and the S-League's tournament competition in November.
	   Officials from the anti-corruption body were not immediately
available for comment.

Southeast Asian nations seek more aid to recover from economic

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Southeast Asian countries asked the
world powers on Tuesday for new financing and investment to help
the region recover from its economic crisis.
	   But the United States, Japan and other countries did not
announce any new aid packages and said that while they will
continue to help, Southeast Asian countries themselves must
persevere with painful political and economic reforms if they are
to recover.
	   The turmoil, which has dragged many of the region's once-vibrant
economies into recessions, dominated the opening of annual talks
among the nine-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations and a
group of nine richer Asian and Western nations plus the European
Union.
	   The conference chairman, Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo
Siazon, said the rich countries had a ``paramount role'' in
restoring economic vibrancy to the region.
	   ``In addition to keeping their markets open, injecting new
investments and sustaining fresh financing, our dialogue partners
are urged to assume leadership in restoring economic vitality in
the region,'' he told the conference.
	   Siazon said the United States should increase its share of
funding to the International Monetary Fund. The IMF's reserves have
been depleted by major bailouts of several Asian nations in the
past year.
	   He said Japan's new government should more quickly carry out its
fiscal stimulus package and reform its financial and income tax
system. ASEAN officials have said that the stability of the yen and
Japanese demand for imports from Southeast Asia are crucial to the
region's recovery.
	   Southeast Asian nations appreciate China's commitment to
maintain the stability of its currency, and are relying on Europe's
economic strength to support their recovery, Siazon said.
	   The crisis began in July 1997, when Thailand's devaluation of
the baht sparked a wave of speculative attacks against currencies
in the region. ASEAN ministers have warned of further social unrest
and violence, such as that which toppled Indonesia's President
Suharto in May, if the world's economic powers do not quickly
extend more assistance.
	   In her statement, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
said democracy and free market policies are critical to recovery.
She said nations that have given their people the greatest say in
political decisions have had the greatest success in preserving
stability and in getting support for tough policies.
	   ``Official assistance can help countries in this region get
through the worst days of the economic crisis,'' she said. ``But we
also have to recognize that it is not going to solve the deeper,
long-term problems they face. The crisis is not going to be solved
by aid alone.''
	   She said the key ingredient for restoring investor confidence in
Asia is transparency _ ``an expectation that in a climate of
openness, economic decisions will be shaped by market forces, and
not distorted by corruption.''
	   Another key, she said, is for industrialized countries to
increase imports from Southeast Asia, and that no nation has a
bigger contribution to make than Japan.
	   Despite its own economic woes, Japan already has pledged more
than dlrs 42 billion in a variety of programs to help Asian
countries recover ``and is determined to continue its assistance as
much as possible,'' said Japan's vice minister of foreign affairs,
Masahiko Komura.
	   Komura said Japan is convinced that Southeast Asia will recover
because of basic favorable conditions, including diligent
workforces, high savings rates and rich natural resources.
	   But these countries first must regain the confidence of
investors through economic and financial reforms, he said.
	   ``No matter how painful it may be, we must have the courage to
accomplish these reforms,'' Komura said.
	   The EU will provide ``technical assistance'' if requested, said
its representative at the talks, Austrian Vice-Chancellor and
Minister for Foreign Affairs Wolfgang Schuessel. He did not
elaborate.
	   ``The EU is aware that this crisis is more severe and more
difficult to overcome than expected even six months ago and that
the social side effects of the economic crisis have still not
reached their peak,'' he said.
	   ASEAN groups Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Brunei,
Singapore, Myanmar, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Laos.

Russia favors return of Kosovo autonomy within Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo available

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Russia supports broad autonomy for
the Albanian-majority province of Kosovo, but not secession from
Serb-dominated Yugoslavia, Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said
Tuesday at a security conference of Asian and Western nations.
	   The status of Kosovo had been regarded by Moscow in the past as
an internal question for the Yugoslavian federation to decide, and
Primakov's statement was in agreement with recent offers made by
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   ``In our view, the issue of the status of Kosovo could be solved
through granting the province a broad autonomy,'' Primakov said.
``We oppose any solution which would lead to the secession of
Kosovo from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Serbia.''
	   Kosovo enjoyed a high-level of autonomy and equal rights with
other provinces in Yugoslavia under Communist dictator Josip Broz
Tito. But that status was abolished under Milosevic's nationalist
Serb policies in 1989. Milosevic has recently offered to restore
Kosovo's autonomy.
	   Extremist elements of an ethnic Albanian resistance movement are
seeking to secede from Yugoslavia, which they accuse of abusing the
human and political rights of ethnic Albanians comprising 90
percent of the province's population. More moderate ethnic Albanian
groups also want independence but may settle for political
autonomy, which the U.S government also supports.
	   Primakov told other foreign ministers from Europe, Asia, North
America and the South Pacific, that Russia opposes ``any outside
intervention with the use of force'' to settle the problem.
	   He said the main task now is to resume, ``without preconditions,
the interrupted negotiating process'' between the Yugoslav leaders
in Belgrade and the leaders of Kosovo Albanians.
	   Primakov also confirmed that Russia will participate in the next
international peacekeeping operation, subject to a double chain of
command for its contingent separate from the American leadership.
	   One of the priorities in Bosnia is to work out by the end of
this year ``a new platform for securing the peace process in Bosnia
...,'' he said.
	   He spoke at the Post-Ministerial Conference of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations, also attended by the U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, and representatives of Japan, China,
Australia, Canada, the European Union and others.

Chinese gymnast starts rehabilitation, is confident of recovery
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EAST MEADOW, New York (AP) _ Speaking in a soft voice, the
father of the Chinese gymnast paralyzed in a practice fall at the
Goodwill Games spoke of a daughter who could never sit still as a
child. Now his daughter, Sang Lan, is unlikely ever to walk again.
	   ``I was sure she would be very athletic and loved gymnastics,''
said Sang Shisheng, a government housing officer. She enjoyed
watching sports on TV, he said: ``skating, ping pong, and anything
that is active.''
	   In their first interview since arriving in the United States a
day earlier, Sang's mother said Monday that she had been desperate
to know their daughter's chances or recovery.
	   ``We were so worried we could not sleep or eat and kept
wondering whether she'll be able to stand or not,'' said Chen
Xiufeng, who lives in the eastern city of Ningbo, some 740 miles
(1190 kilometers) from the capital, Beijing, ``We were anxious to
come to America to find out what happened, and how it happened.''
	   Sang's parents, making their first trip outside China, arrived
four days after the accident. They saw Sang Lan sitting up, her
neck immobilized after a seven-hour operation to rebuild the bones
and take pressure off the nerves in her spine.
	   The 17-year-old feels nothing below chest level, and doctors say
she is unlikely to walk again, let alone return to gymnastics.
	   But Sang is optimistic that his energetic daughter will do both.
	   ``I am sure she will compete again because she is very
courageous and is getting excellent medical care from the doctors
and hospitals in America,'' he said.
	   However, Sang Lan's doctors on Monday dismissed earlier
speculation that she had regained feeling in her toes.
	   ``There is no change in her neurological exam,'' Dr. Brock
Schnebel, head physician of the Goodwill Games, told The Associated
Press after discussing treatment options with the parents.
	   Sitting rigidly, curling and tightening her fingers slowly
around one another, Chen spoke in a soft and occasionally unsteady
voice of the moment she first saw her Sang after the accident.
	   ``When I first saw my daughter lying on the sick bed, my heart
was so hurt that she looked at me and said, `Mother, don't worry
about me because the doctors here and the medicine here are very,
very good. You have to have confidence. You have to have courage to
allow me to recover,''' said Chen, who works in a leather goods
factory.
	   Any recovery will be slow, Schnebel said, adding that Sang is on
painkillers and sleeps well after days spent talking to a stream of
visitors.
	   ``It's hard to shut her up and keep her calm, actually,'' he
said of the woman described by her parents as ``athletic and
courageous.''
	   Schnebel said Sang's parents have not decided whether to move
her back to China and continue the treatment with the experimental
nerve-building drug she is now receiving, or to start her
rehabilitation in the United States.
	   She could be ready to fly as early as next week, he said.
	   Sang, China's 1997 national vault champion, underwent seven
hours of surgery Saturday at Nassau County Medical Center to
stabilize bones in her spine that shattered last Tuesday when she
fell.
	   On Sunday night, she had other visitors besides her parents.
	   ``The team manager, the trainer and the coach and all the
members of the team went to see her, and some cried a little,''
Sang Shisheng said. ``But Sang Lan, she did not cry a single tear,
Rather, she asked her fellow gymnasts what medals did they get; did
you get gold medal or what?
	   ``And she asked her coach: `Why did I fail this time?'''

Rod Laver suffers stroke during TV interview

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Tennis Hall of Famer Rod Laver was in
critical condition Monday night after suffering a stroke during an
interview with ESPN.
	   Laver, 59, was taken to UCLA Medical Center.
	   ``His family is with him and he's resting comfortably,'' nursing
supervisor Denny Rubianes said.
	   Laver was stricken while being interviewed for an upcoming ESPN
series about the greatest athletes of the 20th century, network
spokesman Rob Tobias said.
	   Tobias said he didn't know exactly where or when the interview
took place.
	   Laver won 11 Grand Slam singles titles, one fewer than all-time
leader Roy Emerson, and he is the only player in history to sweep
the four Grand Slam events in two different years. The Australian
left-hander did it as an amateur in 1962 and as a pro in 1969.
	   Laver, nicknamed ``Rocket'' for his powerful groundstrokes, won
four Wimbledons, three Australian titles, two U.S. championships
and two French titles in singles. He also won nine Grand Slam
doubles titles.
	   During his 23-year career, he won 47 pro singles titles and was
runner-up 21 times. He also starred for Australia in Davis Cup
competition, compiling a 16-4 record in singles and a 4-0 mark in
doubles
	   Laver, who lives in Newport Beach, California, was the world's
top-ranked player in 1961, 1962, 1968 and 1969 and earned dlrs 1.5
million during his career.
	   He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in
1981.

More than 1,000 women recalled in smear test fears
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ More than 1,000 women at risk of cervical cancer
have been recalled to a hospital amid fears of life-threatening
errors in a screening program.
	   The women received letters Monday, and their doctors alerted,
after a five-month review involving the examination of records of
5,000 women going back 10 years.
	   An inquiry was launched at St. George's Hospital in south London
after it emerged that an unusually high number of women given the
all-clear went on to develop cancer.
	   Dr. Graham Barker, a senior doctor, has been suspended by
hospital chiefs after 19 women with advanced cancer were
identified. Two of the women are reported to have died.
	   An independent review has confirmed that in 12 of the 19 cases,
including one of the women who died, the early treatment given was
``unsatisfactory'' or ``gave cause for concern.''
	   The blunders occurred when women whose smear tests already
showed abnormalities could have been wrongly treated.
	   Smear tests are carried out to detect cervical cancer at its
early stages so that the chances of survival can be improved. But
over the past five years, several testing centers in Britain have
been criticized for failing to accurately analyze the tests.
	   In Britain's worst smear test scandal, eight women died and
90,000 were recalled in 1996 after screening errors at the Kent and
Canterbury Hospital led to women with early signs of cancer being
missed.

Report: Lootings of oil palm continue in Sumatra
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Looting at a state-owned palm
plantation as well as at private companies in northern and western
Sumatra has yet to stop, a report said Tuesday.
	   At least two million tons of fresh palm fruit from private
companies have been stolen in North Sumatra province on the island,
the daily Kompas said.
	   It quoted Derom Bangun, a local official at the Association of
Oil Palm Businessmen, as saying the stolen fruit was equivalent to
400,000 tons of cooking oil, or 20 percent of the annual 10
million-ton output of 76 private firms in the province.
	   Also in North Sumatra, mobs looted a state-run plantation of
palm fruit worth 500 million rupiah (drls 35,700) from July 7-23,
Kompas said.
	   The report said the looters were believed to be backed by
security personnel. It did not elaborate.
	   In West Sumatra, about 300 villagers in Pasaman regency occupy a
palm plantation owned by a private firm, PT. Tri Sangga Guna.
	   The villagers, claiming the company had taken their land without
compensation in 1992, vowed to stay there and keep harvesting.
	   Lawlessness has increased after waves of riots and protests
forced Suharto, who had ruled with an iron hand for 32 years, to
quit as president in May amid Indonesia's worst economic crisis in
three decades.
	   Looting has also been reported in other parts of the country.
	   Villagers have tried to claim back land used for golf courses
and other developments, including a prestigious cattle ranch owned
by Suharto in West Java. They claimed that the lands were taken
with little or no compensation.
	   The powerful armed forces have warned they will not tolerate
attempts to seize land or to loot property.
	   On Monday, police set up a 250-strong task force to curb
widespread lootings in Jakarta and its environs.
	   Chief police detective Maj. Gen. Dai Bachtiar said lootings
could never be justified.
	   ``If looting is left uncontrolled, the plunders will
increasingly become more brutal,'' Bachtiar said, adding that
``stern actions and a legal solution are needed.''
	   Last week, police shot dead an alleged looter of shrimp and
arrested two others at a shrimp pond in the West Java town of
Tangerang, just west of Jakarta.

Diplomat picked as Georgia's No. 2 leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ President Eduard Shevardnadze picked a
prominent diplomat Tuesday to serve as the country's No. 2 leader.
	   Vazha Lordkipanidze, the former Soviet republic's ambassador to
Russia, was offered the job of Minister of State _ the top Cabinet
post, similar to that of prime minister.
	   Lordkipanidze has asked for two days to consider the offer
before accepting it formally, said government spokeswoman Lela
Bakhturidze.
	   Nearly all members of the Georgian Cabinet have submitted their
resignations in recent days at Shevardnadze's request. He has said
that economic reforms are moving into a new stage and new leaders
are needed.
	   Shevardnadze has said he expects the Cabinet reshuffle to take
several weeks, likely ending in mid-August. The ministers of
defense, interior and security have not been asked to resign and
remain in their posts.
	   Georgia suffers from many of the same economic woes as other
former Soviet republics, plus it is battling separatists in the
Black Sea province of Abkhazia.
	   Lordkipanidze has been active on the Abkhazian issue, conducting
negotiations with separatist representatives in Moscow.

Gunmen kill eight Hindus in Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ Armed men stormed into a villager's house in
Kashmir and sprayed the occupants with gunfire, killing eight
people and wounding three others, police said Tuesday.
	   It was the seventh time this year that suspected Muslim
guerrillas have attacked civilians in the predominantly Hindu
region of Jammu-Kashmir, India's only state with a Muslim majority.
	   No one immediately claimed responsibility for Monday night's
killing in Doda district, but police blamed the Harkat-ul-Ansar and
Hizbol-Mujahideen militant organizations. Both seek to separate
Kashmir from India and unite it with neighboring Pakistan, an
officially Islamic state.
	   Police fanned out across towns in the district to prevent
Hindu-Muslim riots in response to the latest assault. Hindus and
Muslims are nearly equal in number in the area.
	   Police said the masked gunmen broke into the house in Thakrai, a
remote village 225 kilometers (140 miles) northeast of Jammu, the
state's winter capital, and opened fire with Kalishnikov automatic
rifles.
	   Five residents died immediately and three others a short while
later. Police flew three injured people by helicopter to a Jammu
hospital.
	   Since 1989, dozens of guerrilla groups have been fighting Indian
security forces, leaving more than 16,000 people dead. In recent
months, police say, guerrillas have moved out of the
Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley to the Jammu region, long considered
a safe haven for Hindus.

Fires burn out of control in Russian Far East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Forest fires raging in Russia's Far East have
engulfed nearly 300,000 acres (120,000 hectares), a news agency
said Tuesday.
	   The fires are particularly severe in the Khabarovsk region,
which is covered by a smoke cloud hundreds of kilometers (miles)
long, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The smoke is making it difficult to use aircraft to fight the
blazes, many of which continue to burn uncontrolled, the report
said. A state of emergency has been declared.
	   The Far East has been ravaged by forest fires this summer
because of an unusually dry winter and spring. Specialists say that
without significant rain, the fires may continue until winter.

BMW, VW reach compromise over rights to Rolls-Royce name
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German automaker BMW lost out to
Volkswagen in its bid to buy Britain's luxury Rolls-Royce line, but
it's at least getting the name.
	   In a surprise deal, Volkswagen and BMW said Tuesday they had
reached a compromise under which BMW will buy the Rolls-Royce name
rights from the present owner, Rolls-Royce PLC, and license them
exclusively at no charge to VW until the end of 2002.
	   BMW has an airplane engine joint venture with Rolls-Royce PLC.
	   Starting in 2003, VW will market its luxury line under the
Bentley name, the two automakers said in a joint statement.
	   That will allow BMW to use the Rolls-Royce name for a new luxury
car business it plans for Britain.
	   BMW will continue to supply engines and components to VW for
Rolls-Royce cars until the end of 2002 and for the new Bentley
Arnage until the end of its product cycle.
	   The compromise would solve a major problem VW inherited when it
outbid BMW for the British luxury car maker.
	   Shortly after VW finalized the acquisition of Rolls-Royce Motor
Cars Ltd. this month from the Vickers PLC holding company, BMW said
it would stop supplying engines and components to Rolls-Royce Motor
Cars as of July 9, 1999.

Divided opposition blamed for apparent Cambodian election defeat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBIN McDOWELL &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A disappointed Prince Norodom
Ranariddh said Tuesday that Cambodians showed they wanted change
when they voted Sunday in parliamentary elections, but that
divisions in the opposition cost them their chance.
	   Though official results were not yet in, Ranariddh noted that
the combined votes apparently received by his royalist FUNCINPEC
and the Sam Rainsy Party, the other main opposition group, were
higher than the tally achieved by the Cambodian People's Party led
by strongman Hun Sen.
	   That was according to the figures advanced by Hun Sen's party,
which claimed to have won a clear majority of the 122 National
Assembly seats, with the Ranariddh group coming second and Sam
Rainsy's followers a distant third.
	   ``We should learn a bitter lesson from the present situation,
which is that the division of the democrats allowed the CPP to win
in several places,'' Ranariddh told reporters and a cluster of
motorcycle taxi drivers who gathered outside his home Tuesday.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy were both FUNCINPEC members when the
party finished first in U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993. Hun Sen
refused to accept defeat and forced his way into a co-premiership
by threatening civil war.
	   Sam Rainsy was forced out of the finance minister's post, the
National Assembly and then FUNCINPEC for his criticism of
corruption on both sides. He eventually formed his own party.
	   Ranariddh was deposed by Hun Sen as co-prime minister last year
in a bloody coup. Hun Sen permitted him to return from exile to
participate in new elections in an effort to win back legitimacy
and aid.
	   While in exile, Ranariddh and other opposition members,
including Sam Rainsy, formed an uneasy coalition to oppose Hun Sen
but personal differences pulled them apart and they went into the
campaign independently.
	   The prince showed reporters preliminary poll results in Phnom
Penh that showed the vote was evenly divided between the CPP,
FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party.
	   ``But if the two democrats were united, we have doubled the
voice compared to the CPP, exactly the same as in 1993,'' Ranariddh
said. ``Because of our division or inconsistencies, we allow the
CPP to win.''
	   The prince, who closely resembles his father, King Norodom
Sihanouk, remains popular in the countryside. Sam Rainy, a
media-savvy former Paris banker, tends to be popular with the young
and educated.

Investigators of Japan food poisoning look into mass murder theory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KOZO MIZOGUCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The killer who slipped cyanide into a pot of curry
at a festival in western Japan, fatally poisoning four people,
might have been aiming at mass murder rather than targeting
specific victims, investigators said Tuesday.
	   The killings Saturday in Wakayama, a small coastal city 453
kilometers (283 miles) southwest of Tokyo, were major news in
Japan, where memories are still fresh of the 1995 nerve gas attack
on the Tokyo subways that killed 12 people.
	   The poisoning forced the cancellation of similar annual
festivals in the area for fear of copycat crimes, and prompted
officials in Wakayama and the Tokyo area to urge farmers with
access to dangerous chemicals to keep a close eye on their
supplies.
	   Funerals were held Tuesday for two of the victims, Takatoshi
Taninaka, 65, head of the residents' association, and his deputy,
Takaaki Tanaka, 53, at their homes in Sonobe, the suburb of
Wakayama where the attack occurred.
	   Also killed were a 10-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl.
Officials said Tuesday that 43 of the 60 others sickened in the
attack were still hospitalized. None was in serious condition.
	   Investigators at first suspected that the killer might have
targeted the two neighborhood officials in a dispute over local
parking rights, media reports said.
	   But the difficulty in targeting individuals at a potluck meal
means the attacker might have been trying to kill as many people as
possible. Kyodo News agency reported Tuesday that the two officials
had served themselves.
	   ``We are investigating now with all possibilities in mind,
including indiscriminate mass murder with cyanide,'' said Hideaki
Goto, spokesman for the Wakayama prefectural police, adding that
investigators did not have any suspects yet.
	   For some, the crime provided more evidence of moral breakdown in
Japan, which has been suffering from higher crime rates in recent
years and a sudden increase in attacks by troubled young people.
	   ``No time should be lost in bringing the perpetrator to justice,
not just to ease the concerns of the local community, but to shed
light on our social ills,'' the national newspaper Asahi urged in
an editorial Tuesday.
	   The investigation has focused on when the killer might have been
able to slip the poison into the curry. Witnesses say at least two
or three people were by the curry at all times, guarding against
dogs or cats at the picnic.
	   The three pots of curry were prepared Saturday morning at a
local resident's garage by a group of housewives, and then taken to
the lot where about 100 people gathered for the festival, which
also featured a karaoke contest and a lottery.
	   Residents told police no strangers had been spotted in the area
before or during the festival, press reports said. Sankei newspaper
reported Tuesday that 100 dead fish had been discovered in a nearby
rice field, suggesting the killer may have tested the cyanide
before the attack.
	   The investigators also found that four people who cooked the
curry fell ill and were taken to a hospital after they ate it prior
to its sale at the festival site, Kyodo News reported. It was
unclear why the curry was still put on sale.

Miyazawa reportedly set to accept finance ministry portfolio

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A former premier and ruling party economics expert
was reportedly ready Tuesday to accept the job as Japan's finance
chief, triggering a rally in Tokyo markets and boosting efforts by
incoming prime minister Keizo Obuchi to piece together a Cabinet
this week.
	   Former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, considered a top Liberal
Democratic Party financial specialist, had been reluctant to take
over the reins of the powerful Finance Ministry on the grounds that
he was too old.
	   But Kyodo News reported Tuesday that concerns over Japan's
severe economic crisis had persuaded Miyazawa to accept the post,
one that is considered instrumental in efforts to lift Japan out of
recession and restore stability to the ailing banking system.
	   The news that Miyazawa was being tipped as finance minister was
welcomed by Japan's gloomy financial markets, with the benchmark
Nikkei stock average gaining more than 1 percent and the yen
gaining ground against the dollar.
	   ``Miyazawa's not the best answer, but compared to the other
candidates, he's the best,'' said Takashi Nakauchi, foreign
exchange manager at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
	   Foreign Minister Obuchi, who won the LDP presidency last week
and is expected to be voted prime minister Thursday in Parliament,
has reportedly been lobbying Miyazawa himself to accept the finance
job.
	   The choice is a crucial one. The country is facing its worst
recession in decades, with record-high unemployment, increasing
bankruptcies, and a financial system weighed down by mountains of
bad debt.
	   But Japan's tortuous path to economic recovery could turn the
finance portfolio into political minefield. Anyone who takes the
job can expect to come under intense criticism if the economic
crisis worsens.
	   Miyazawa, who has served in the past as finance minister, is a
main architect of Japan's efforts to reform its banking system.
Many consider his economic expertise essential to counterbalance
Obuchi's relative inexperience in the field.
	   The former Japanese premier has also cultivated strong relations
with top finance officials in Washington.
	   Many other leading candidates for the post have also reportedly
balked at overtures to take up the post _ once considered the most
desirable in the Cabinet outside the premiership itself.
	   Another possible candidate, Koichi Kato, former LDP
secretary-general, has said can't take the job because of his
responsibility for the LDP's defeat in elections to the upper house
of Parliament earlier this month, the newspapers said.
	   That electoral humiliation forced Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto to announce his resignation, which lead to Obuchi's
election as party president.
	   Analysts said that Kato's refusal may indicate that he is
protecting his reputation as he grooms himself to become prime
minister sometime in the future.
	   The third candidate Obuchi has been considering, former Chief
Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama, may still be offered the post
but he also appears unlikely to accept it.
	   Kajiyama had come in second after Obuchi in the LDP's divisive
election for a new party president. His outspoken calls for radical
``surgery'' to cure Japan's economic ills quickly turned him into
the darling of the financial markets.

BMW, VW reach compromise over rights to Rolls-Royce name
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German automaker BMW lost out to
Volkswagen in its bid to buy Britain's luxury Rolls-Royce line, but
it's at least getting the name.
	   In a surprise deal, Volkswagen and BMW said Tuesday they had
reached a compromise under which BMW will buy the Rolls-Royce name
rights from the present owner, Rolls-Royce PLC, and license them
exclusively at no charge to VW until the end of 2002.
	   BMW already has an airplane engine joint venture with
Rolls-Royce PLC.
	   Starting in 2003, VW will market its luxury line under the
Bentley name, the two automakers said in a joint statement.
	   That will allow BMW to use the Rolls-Royce name for a new luxury
car business it plans for Britain.
	   Both carmakers, though, will cooperate to produce the latest
Rolls-Royce model, the Silver Seraph, the two companies said.
	   BMW will continue to supply engines and components to VW for
Rolls-Royce cars until the end of 2002 and for the new Bentley
Arnage until the end of its product cycle.
	   The compromise would solve a major problem VW inherited when it
outbid BMW for the British luxury car maker.
	   Shortly after VW finalized the acquisition of Rolls-Royce Motor
Cars Ltd. this month from the Vickers PLC holding company, BMW said
it would stop supplying engines and components to Rolls-Royce Motor
Cars as of July 9, 1999.
	   To enable BMW to market the Rolls-Royce name, Rolls-Royce Motor
Cars Ltd. will be renamed Bentley Motor Cars Ltd. at the end of
2002. BMW will found a new Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd.
	   The current Rolls Royce production facilities in Crewe will
remain in the hands of Volkswagen.

Bank of Japan decides to keep easy money policy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Bank of Japan's nine-member policy board on
Tuesday decided by majority vote to keep the current easy monetary
policy unchanged, the fourth consecutive meeting that the members
agreed to keep the current policy by majority vote.
	   Quelling market fears about credit shortage remains the central
bank's main concern. It has provided funds extending into the
fiscal half beginning Oct. 1 in an attempt to soothe funding demand
around that time.
	   While the board members have shown an increasingly severe
assessment of the Japanese economy, the majority still favors
keeping a policy change as the last resort. But debate on whether a
further easing was needed has intensified in recent meetings.
	   Many members still believe that the current policy _ in place
since September 1995 to keep the official discount rate at the
record low 0.50 percent and overnight call money rates ``on
average'' below 0.50 percent _ is the best possible monetary
option.
	   The bank has instead its focus on more fiscal spending by the
government as a direct impetus for economic activities.
	   The meeting took place as Japan's government is in flux.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto announced on July 13 that he
would resign, and Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi won the presidency
of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party _ meaning he is nearly
certain to become prime minister when Parliament votes on Thursday.
	   Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami has said that whoever is
appointed as prime minister, the top priority is to swiftly
implement banking reforms and economic stimulus steps.

 &UR; At least 7 dead, eight injured in bus crash in southern France
 &UR; EDS: LEDES with details throughout, lowers number of critically
injured to eight &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTELIMAR, France (AP) _ Three buses packed with tourists
rammed into each other early Tuesday in a deadly pileup on a
highway in southern France, killing seven people and critically
injuring eight others, police said.
	   Some of the passengers were thrown from the buses as a result of
the impact, and limbs of the dead and injured were scattered across
the blood spattered highway.
	   The accident was set in motion after a truck carrying fish ran
off the A7 highway near Montelimar about 600 kilometers (370 miles)
south of Paris. The driver had apparently fallen asleep and part of
his vehicle impeded the roadway.
	   A Dutch and a German bus managed to slow down to avoid hitting
the truck. They were rammed from behind by a second Dutch bus about
1:30 a.m. (2330 GMT), said Col. Alain Hurtevent, head of the police
in the Drome region.
	   The Dutch bus that hit the two others was traveling at more than
120 kilometers (74 miles) an hour, above the legally allowed limit
of 110 kilometers (67 miles) per hour for vehicles of that type,
Hurtevent said.
	   The German bus was cut in half and lay sprawled across the
highway.
	   A small contingent of police and rescue workers who were already
at the scene to deal with the truck accident quickly put out a red
alert.
	   Seven people were killed, including three Germans, of whom one
was a 12-year-old girl, a small Russian boy traveling in the German
bus, and three Dutch citizens.
	   Eight other people were critically wounded and were taken by
helicopter to nearby hospitals. Another 30 were treated at the
scene of the accident for their injuries.
	   The three buses were carrying about 140 people. The two Dutch
buses came from the towns of Enschede and Herwen, while the German
bus came from Leer. All three were on their way to Spain.
	   Plans were being made to help the passengers return to their
country of origin.
	   An investigation has been opened, and the drivers of the two
buses that were hit were questioned by police.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ Two occupants of a light aircraft were
killed during a crash landing at Barcelona's Prat airport Tuesday.
	   The plane was flying too low and hit the airport's perimeter
fence, airport spokesman Josep Barrero said. He was unable to
confirm news reports identifying both victims as Spanish men about
30 years old.
	   The aircraft was transporting newspapers from the Mediterranean
island of Mallorca to this northeastern city, Barrero said.

Gunmen kill eight Hindus in Kashmir

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ Armed men stormed into villagers' homes in
Kashmir and sprayed the occupants with gunfire, killing 16 people
and wounding five others, police said Tuesday.
	   The raids marked the seventh time this year that suspected
Muslim guerrillas have attacked civilians in the predominantly
Hindu region of Jammu-Kashmir, India's only state with a Muslim
majority.
	   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the killings, but
police blamed the Harkat-ul-Ansar and Hizbol-Mujahideen militant
organizations. Both seek to separate Kashmir from India and unite
it with neighboring Pakistan, an officially Islamic state.
	   On Tuesday morning, gunmen burst into a house in Sarwan, a
village 210 kilometers (130 miles) northeast of Jammu, the winter
capital of Jammu-Kashmir state. They fired Kalashnikov assault
rifles at the sleeping occupants, killing eight men and injuring
two women, police said. Five other occupants were missing.
	   A few hours earlier on Monday night, gunmen attacked another
house in the nearby village of Thakrai, killing eight people.
Police flew three others who were injured to a Jammu hospital.
	   Officers fanned out across towns in Doda district to prevent
Hindu-Muslim riots in response to the latest assault. Hindus and
Muslims are nearly equal in number in the area.
	   Since 1989, dozens of guerrilla groups have been fighting Indian
security forces, leaving more than 16,000 people dead. In recent
months, police say, guerrillas have moved out of the
Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley to the Jammu region, long considered
a safe haven for Hindus.

Myanmar lashes out at U.S. Secretary of State
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-ASEAN &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Lashing out at U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, Myanmar accused Washington Tuesday of acting as
a ``judge, jury and executioner'' in its stance toward the
military-run nation.
	   Speaking at a regional meeting in Manila Monday, Albright
criticized Myanmar for blocking the movements of opposition leader
Aung San Suu Kyi. She said turmoil in Myanmar posed ``a threat to
the stability of the region.''
	   ``The accusations ... thrown against Myanmar are a typical way
of a sole superpower carrying out a witch hunt and acting as a
judge, jury and executioner to justify her own unfair activities,''
a statement from the regime said.
	   The statement, sent to The Associated Press in Bangkok, said
Myanmar was being ``unjustly demonized'' for not serving the
interests of the United States.
	   Albright spoke at the annual security forum of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations as Nobel laureate Suu Kyi spent a fourth
day Monday stuck in a car on a rural Myanmar highway surrounded by
government security personnel. She was stopped Friday on her way to
a meeting with supporters.
	   Albright said the United States would hold Myanmar _ a
participant in the conference _ ``directly responsible'' for the
health and welfare of Suu Kyi.
	   The government statement called the blocking of Suu Kyi's travel
``an isolated minor incident'' that was being exaggerated by her
National League for Democracy party and some foreign media to make
it appear as if Burma was on the brink of upheaval.
	   Increased tension is expected in the country, formerly known as
Burma, as democracy advocates mark the 10th anniversary of a
nationwide uprising against military rule. The military bloodily
crushed the revolt.
	   Suu Kyi, who has been subjected to harassment and house arrest
over the past decade, has called on the military to convene by Aug.
21 the Parliament that was elected in 1991.
	   After her party scored a landslide victory in the polls, the
military refused to convene the Parliament and began to formulate
its own, still unfinished Constitution.

Singapore's investment in China soars
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's investments in China surged by 65
percent in this year's first half from January-June 1997, The
Business Times reported Tuesday.
	   Citing official Chinese sources, the newspaper said Singapore
investors channeled dlrs 1.48 billion into Chinese projects in this
year's first six months, up from dlrs 899 million in last year's
first half.
	   But contractual investment plunged 42 percent in the same
period, to dlrs 1.45 billion.
	   The sharp rise in Singapore's actual investment can be
attributed to China's decision to restore duty-free privileges for
capital equipment imports by investors, said Dong Songgen, an
official at the Chinese Embassy in Singapore.
	   But he added that the fall in contractual investment is
worrisome, and could cause actual investment to fall for the first
time since Singapore began investing in China in the late 1970s.

Roadside explosion kills SLA member, civilian wounded
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ A roadside bomb was detonated Tuesday in
southern Lebanon, killing a member of the Israeli-allied South
Lebanon Army militia, Lebanese security officials said.
	   A civilian was wounded in retaliatory shelling, they added.
	   The officials said the explosion occurred at 620 a.m. (0320 GMT)
at Beit Yahoun, which is inside Israel's self-styled ``security
zone'' in the south. The officials spoke on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the
incident, saying in a statement that it killed or wounded a number
of the occupants of an enemy military vehicle.
	   In retaliation, Israeli and SLA gunners shelled suspected
guerrilla hideouts north of the security zone.
	   A Lebanese civilian was wounded in the shelling, the officials
said.
	   The area is about 25 kilometers (15 miles) southeast of the
coastal city of Tyre.
	   The Shiite Muslim Hezbollah, or the Party of God, has led the
fight to try to oust about 1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500 SLA
militiamen from south Lebanon. Israel set up the security zone in
1985 to try to protect northern Israeli communities from guerrilla
attacks.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Setting the stage for more turmoil
in one of the world's most troubled countries, strongman Hun Sen's
party claimed a landslide victory in parliamentary elections
Tuesday while the opposition accused him of massive fraud.
	   There was no immediate official result. After a day of counting,
the Hun Sen-packed National Election Committee released partial
tallies for two of the 21 provinces. Opposition parties had feared
tampering when the committee postponed the release of preliminary
results Monday.
	   But the two main opposition leaders, Prince Norodom Ranariddh
and Sam Rainsy, accepted that the official tally would resemble
figures put out by Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party _ an
acknowledgement of the party's grip on the levers of power and
refusal to let them go.
	   The figures showed the ruling party taking 67 of the 122
National Assembly seats, a commanding majority in what had looked
like a tight three-way race. According to the figures, Ranariddh's
royalist FUNCINPEC took 42 seats and the Sam Rainsy Party just 13.
	   ``They stole our vote, and we will disagree with whatever their
result,'' Sam Rainsy told a crowd of motorcycle taxi drivers who
have been stalwart opposition supporters. ``Had there not been any
fraud, we would be in the majority.''
	   The prince and Sam Rainsy, on-again, off-again allies, said they
would boycott the National Assembly, denying the CPP the two-thirds
of members needed to hold meetings.
	   The dispute raised the prospect of more turmoil in a country
that suffered the Khmer Rouge genocide of the 1970s and 30 years of
civil war and strife. In the latest round, Hun Sen had deposed
Ranariddh as co-prime minister last year in two days of fighting in
the capital.
	   The co-premiership emerged from U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993
meant to usher in a new era of peace and democracy.
	   Ranariddh won, but Hun Sen, who came to power in 1985 under the
harsh Vietnamese occupation that followed the Khmer Rouge, forced
his way into a coalition by threatening war.
	   Hun Sen called the elections in a bid to win back international
aid and legitimacy, but used violence, including murder, against
opposition activists and intimidation of voters to ensure his
victory.
	   Ranariddh and Hun Sen both said they would reject another
co-premiership, calling it a recipe for disaster.
	   Foreign observer groups noted the pre-election violence but said
that relatively peaceful voting and initially smooth counting
Monday signaled an election fair enough to represent the will of
Cambodians.
	   But most issued their endorsements before even the barest
official returns came in.
	   ``We have followed our own schedule,'' said Sven Linder,
spokesman for the group coordinating 678 observers from 40
countries. ``I am confident we are not premature.''
	   The opposition complained of counting irregularities and
demanded an investigation, claiming that only seven seats should
separate the top two parties.
	   Sam Rainsy said that together, his party and FUNCINPEC should
have been able to form a majority with the prince as prime
minister.
	   ``We will not recognize the result of the election,'' Ranariddh
said. ``Yesterday, in the morning, until about 11 or 12 o'clock,
FUNCINPEC was leading everywhere. We were clearly leading. But in
the afternoon, the situation was reversed.''
	   The election committee stressed that official results were not
in and that premature claims by parties could ``undermine public
order.''
	   ``Any results suggesting that this party wins or this party
loses will affect the minds of voters,'' said spokesman Samraing
Kimsan.
	   After last year's coup, a renegade member of Ranariddh's party,
Foreign Minister Ung Huot, accepted Hun Sen's offer to fill the
co-premier's chair. He was widely seen as a puppet.
	   Despite papering Phnom Penh with campaign posters and staging
some relatively large rallies _ sometimes joining Hun Sen's _ Ung
Huot failed to win a National Assembly seat under his own party.
	   He sent a representative to the opposition news conference
Tuesday to protest irregularities.

Advocacy group urges ban of diabetes drug
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURAN NEERGAARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Some consumer advocates want the government to
follow Britain's example and pull a popular diabetes drug off the
market, saying it causes dangerous liver toxicity that has killed
at least 26 people worldwide.
	   The consumer advocacy group Public Citizen condemned the Food
and Drug Administration's plan to instead upgrade warnings to
doctors that patients who are prescribed the diabetes drug Rezulin
must be watched closely for signs of liver damage.
	   ``How many more Americans will have to die or require liver
transplants before Parke-Davis and the FDA take action to protect
people in this country by banning the drug?'' wrote Public
Citizen's Dr. Sidney Wolfe in a petition filed Monday with the FDA.
	   But Rezulin, widely hailed as a unique treatment for Type II or
adult-onset diabetes, offers an important benefit for patients who
aren't adequately treated with other medicines, the FDA responded.
	   The problem is that doctors aren't following the agency's
repeated warnings to closely test every diabetic to see whether
Rezulin is harming his or her liver, said FDA's Dr. Florence Houn.
	   Deaths ``have persisted since the first warning, the majority of
which showed there was not proper monitoring,'' Houn said. ``More
education for health care providers is needed.''
	   Manufacturer Parke-Davis insists Rezulin is safe when used
properly. It will send letters Tuesday to 500,000 doctors saying
the FDA has upgraded its warning for Rezulin: Doctors should test
patients' livers for signs of toxicity monthly for the first eight
months of Rezulin therapy. Stopping Rezulin when liver tests show
signs of toxicity can prevent permanent damage.
	   ``People have to remember there are 18 million patients with
diabetes out there, and they need treatment,'' said spokesman
Stephen Mock.
	   But Public Citizen said warnings aren't enough.
	   As of June 5, the FDA had received reports of at least 21 deaths
among Rezulin users, 100 hospitalizations for liver toxicity and
three liver transplants in the first 15 months the drug was sold,
Wolfe said.
	   FDA's Houn said 14 deaths linked to Rezulin involved Americans.
The other seven occurred in Japan, the only other country where
Rezulin is sold, Wolfe said. Since June 5, details of another five
American deaths have been sent to the FDA for evaluation, he added.
	   Rezulin was taken off the market in Britain last December, when
doctors worldwide had reported just six deaths.
	   Last month, the National Institutes of Health abruptly canceled
a study of whether Rezulin could prevent Type II diabetes in
high-risk patients because one of the patients being studied died
from drug-induced liver toxicity.
	   Rezulin, known chemically as troglitazone, is the first drug to
attack the underlying trigger of Type II diabetes.
	   With this form of the disease, the body's natural insulin _ a
hormone that converts blood sugar into energy _ gradually loses its
ability to work. Blood sugar rises, risking kidney damage,
blindness, heart disease and other complications. Insulin shots
control many patients' blood sugar, but an estimated 1 million Type
II diabetics need additional help.
	   Rezulin somehow resensitizes the body to insulin _ helping to
lower blood sugar enough that many patients report needing fewer
daily injections of insulin and a few even have quit taking it.
	   The FDA approved Rezulin in December 1996. In October 1997, it
issued the first warning about liver toxicity. Two months later, it
issued a second warning, telling doctors to test patients' liver
function for the first six months of Rezulin use.
	   With additional deaths, the FDA last week ordered two more
months of patient liver testing. Houn said if toxicity doesn't
occur within the first eight months of treatment, it probably
won't.

China worried about AIDS spread as HIV carriers top 10,000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese authorities urged greater efforts to slow
the spread of AIDS as the official tally of people infected with
the virus that causes the disease topped 10,000, an official
newspaper said Tuesday.
	   The Health News also said the actual number of people infected
with HIV may be as high as 300,000, or 100,000 more than previous
estimates.
	   The official tally of people who tested positive for HIV stood
at 10,676 at the end of June, a 22 percent increase from last
October and surpassing 10,000 for the first time, the newspaper
said.
	   As of March this year, 290 people had developed AIDS and 173 had
died, the newspaper said.
	   The virus' spread has accelerated, and local health authorities
have been ordered to speed up education and prevention campaigns,
it said.
	   The HIV virus was first detected in China in 1985. About
two-thirds of reported cases of HIV infection are due to
intravenous drug use _ a growing problem in China. Transmission
through sexual intercourse and blood transfusions accounted for the
other cases of infection, the newspaper said.

Ukraine determined to keep the hryvna within exchange corridor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine is determined to keep its embattled
national currency, the hryvna, within the previously set exchange
corridor, the central bank chairman said, according to a news
report Tuesday.
	   The bank ``is so convinced in its strategy on the financial
market that it is not even discussing any other version of the
corridor,'' National Bank head Viktor Yushchenko said Monday.
	   The hryvna's value has decreased by 8.7 percent since the
beginning of 1998 and the currency is now trading at about 2.1 to
the U.S. dollar, Yushchenko said in remarks cited by the Interfax
news agency.
	   Ukraine's National Bank and the government have vowed to keep
the hryvna within the exchange corridor of 1.8 to 2.25 to the U.S.
dollar until the end of the year.
	   The hryvna is facing pressures now because of foreign investors'
mistrust of Ukrainian financial markets. The government is
releasing substantial sums in redemption payments for domestic
bonds, and investors are believed to use the money to buy foreign
currency.

Observers endorse vote, but not the big picture

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with statement from U.S. observer group; adds byline;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ International observer groups
Tuesday praised the voting process in Cambodia's parliamentary
elections, but disagreed sharply over the bigger picture.
	   Pending investigation of opposition charges of irregularities in
vote-counting, they appeared ready to regard Sunday's poll as
representative of the will of the Cambodian people.
	   A leading opposition figure, Sam Rainsy, said an early
assessment by one umbrella organization was misconceived.
	   ``Their numbers were too small, they came too late and they made
their assessment too early,'' Sam Rainsy said of a generally
positive judgment by the Joint International Observer Group.
	   A consensus has emerged among the international groups, which
sent almost 700 observers, that voting Sunday was conducted in a
fair and efficient manner.
	   At the same time, serious concerns were expressed by some
regarding pre-election violence and intimidation against opposition
parties and the allegations of vote-counting irregularities.
	   The assessments came rolling in well before any substantive
official results, though the ruling Cambodian People's Party was
claiming a landslide victory while the opposition cried fraud.
	   A statement from the bipartisan, non-government U.S. delegation
from the democracy promotion institutes of the Democratic and
Republican parties found the voting climate ``upbeat.''
	   But it added that such an accomplishment could not ``negate the
violence, extensive intimidation, unfair media access and ruling
party control of the administrative machinery.''
	   Stephen Solarz, a former U.S. congressman who is co-leader of
the delegation, said, however, that the ruling party's control over
the electoral machinery ``does not appear to have been used to
fundamentally distort the results.''
	   He said allegations of fraudulent vote-counting should be
immediately and thoroughly investigated to determine if they were
extensive enough to affect the election's legitimacy.
	   A small but prestigious group, whose co-leader is former
Australian Ambassador Tony Kevin, issued a more or less unqualified
endorsement.
	   The statement from the Volunteer Observers for the Cambodian
Elections said it believed the election ``was an authentic
expression of the Cambodian people's choice.''
	   The group, widely seen as sympathetic to Hun Sen, dismissed
claims that there had been intimidation of the opposition or that
ballot counting was fraudulent.
	   ``VOCE believes that all governments which claim to have the
best interests of the Cambodian people at heart should now accept
the results of this election without any qualification'' and resume
aid, their statement said.
	   Another group, the Asian Network for Free Elections, was more
critical and withheld final judgment.
	   ``The people of Cambodia have demonstrated their commitment to
the democratic process by participating in the voting,'' ANFREL
said.
	   ``It is now up to their leaders to resolve outstanding issues''
related to the campaign and to ensure a peaceful transfer of power,
it added.

Russian activists call for boycott of chess tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian activists say the politician who has
organized an international chess tournament is also involved in
human rights abuses and massive corruption, and they urged a
boycott of the competition set for September.
	   The chess Olympiad, an annual team competition, is to be staged
in the impoverished southern region of Kalmykia, where the
republic's young, millionaire president, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, also
happens to be head of the World Chess Federation.
	   The president sees the event as a way to showcase his isolated
territory, and has spent large sums to build the Chess City complex
that will house an estimated 2,000 competitors and officials, The
Moscow Times newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   But activists have accused the president's administration of
human rights violations and corruption. In addition, a journalist
critical of the president was recently murdered, and two suspects
who worked for the president have been arrested, the newspaper
reported.
	   Chess City ``has been constructed on money obtained by
violations of all conceivable ... human rights laws,'' said a
letter signed by prominent activists such as Sergei Kovalyov, the
former human rights adviser to Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
	   ``We consider it our duty to explain to you what a blunder your
participation there may be,'' read the letter, sent to 79 national
chess federations around the world.
	   Sixty teams have announced plans to take part in this year's
chess Olympiad, the newspaper said.
	   The activists claimed that Chess City has been built with
federal money earmarked for industrial and agricultural programs in
Kalmykia, which is on the Caspian Sea.
	   Ilyumzhinov has not been charged with any wrongdoing. But he has
come under close scrutiny from the Russian media since the June 7
stabbing death of Larisa Yudina, the editor of Kalmykia's only
opposition newspaper and an outspoken critic of the president.
	   Ilyumzhinov and his administration have denied involvement in
her death.
	   Yeltsin has called it a ``political'' killing and took the
unusual step of ordering federal prosecutors to handle the
investigation. He said local officials ``cannot be fully trusted.''
	   The Russian media have accused Ilyumzhinov of running his
territory like a medieval baron, flaunting his wealth and promoting
himself while stifling dissent and ignoring the republic's social
problems.
	   Emmanuel Omuku, the executive director of the World Chess
Federation, said the organization continued to support the
Kalmykian president.
	   ``No charge has been brought against him,'' Omuku, who is
currently in Moscow, told The Moscow Times. ``Even if it was, a man
is innocent until proven guilty.''

Tokyo stocks end higher, dollar declines
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late dollar, bond &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The dollar slipped against the yen and Tokyo stocks
gained Tuesday as Japanese markets welcomed news that former
Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa was ready to accept the
position of finance minister.
	   The dollar bought 141.94 yen in late afternoon, down 0.40 yen
from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate of
142.41 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained
170.18 points, or 1.07 percent, closing at 16,114.54. On Monday,
the average had lost 417.53 points, or 2.55 percent.
	   The dollar fell after Kyodo News, quoting an unidentified
official in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, reported that
Miyazawa was expected to accept Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi's
request to serve as finance minister, traders said.
	   Yen-buying on that news immediately sent the dollar to its
intraday low of 141.50 yen. Its high for the day was 142.72 yen.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Obuchi, who is almost certain to succeed
outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, was reported having
trouble finding an appropriate finance minister for his new
Cabinet, expected to be formed Thursday.
	   Miyazawa, 78, reportedly declined Obuchi's initial approach
because of his age. Obuchi sought him because Miyazawa, a former
Finance Ministry bureaucrat who has been finance minister as well
as premier, has long been regarded as an expert in economic
affairs.
	   News that Miyazawa had changed his mind also helped push up
prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 8.24 points, or 0.67 percent, to 1,242.22. It had
tumbled 24.03 points, or 1.95 percent, the previous day.
	   Advances outnumbered retreats 662 to 409, with 195 issues
unchanged. Volume on the first section was estimated at 345 million
shares, down from 378.38 million Monday.
	   ``Expectations are also strong that with Miyazawa leading the
Finance Ministry, that will help stabilize the ailing financial
industry,'' said Masaru Arai, general manager at Ryoko Securities
Co.
	   The brokerage sector posted strong gains amid expectations of
accelerating business alliances and mergers.
	   Shares in Daiwa Securities and Sumitomo Bank gained on reports
that they will form an alliance in the investment banking business.
Daiwa stock was up 27 yen (19 cents) at 613 yen (dlrs 4.32), while
Sumitomo Bank added 14 yen (10 cents) to 1,335 yen (dlrs 9.42).
	   The companies later formally announced their alliance.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.310 percent from Monday's finish of 1.315 percent,
driving its price up to 111.03 yen from 111.00 yen.

ABB wins dlrs 600 million contract in United States
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swedish-Swiss electrical engineering
group Asea Brown Boveri said Tuesday it has won a turnkey contract
to build a plant to produce ethylene and propylene in Port Arthur,
Texas in the United States.
	   The contract is worth more than dlrs 600 million and was placed
by a U.S. joint venture of BASF Corporation in Mount Olive, New
Jersey, and FINA Inc. in Dallas, Texas, ABB said.
	   The new equipment will be able to produce approximately 860,000
metric tons of ethylene and 860,000 metric tons of propylene per
year, according to ABB.
	   Construction is planned to begin later this year, and completion
is scheduled for the year 2000.
	   ABB will deliver the process technology and provide the
engineering, procurement, and the supply of all equipment and
material. ABB will also be responsible for the construction of the
plant and commissioning services at start-up, the group said.

North Korea replaces 65 percent of its legislators in elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea replaced 65 percent of its
legislators in weekend elections in an apparent move to strengthen
leader Kim Jong Il's grip on power, analysts said Tuesday.
	   ``To sum up, it's a transfusion of young, loyal blood into the
rule of Kim Jong Il,'' said Huh Moon-young, a senior analyst at the
state-run Research Institute for National Unification.
	   South Korean government officials saw Sunday's elections as a
prelude to Kim's long-awaited rise to the office of president, the
first hereditary power succession in a communist country.
	   His late father, Kim Il Sung, ruled North Korea with an iron
fist for nearly a half-century until his death in 1994.
	   Since then, the 56-year-old son has been ruling the reclusive
nation as supreme military commander and head of the ruling
Workers' Party, but has yet to assume the presidency.
	   South Korean analysts believe that the junior Kim will assume
that title around the 50th anniversary of the founding of the
North's government on Sept. 9.
	   In Sunday's elections, the first since 1990, 687 legislators
were selected, the same number chosen in the last parliamentary
balloting in 1990, South Korean officials said.
	   Of the total, 447 members, or 65 percent, are new, many of them
young military, factory and farm leaders representing an extensive
generational change, Seoul officials said.
	   In the 1990 elections, 214 members, or 31.4 percent were
replaced, they said.
	   Only one party-nominated candidate was allowed to run in each
constituency in Sunday's elections. Those who failed to gain
nomination for the elections included former senior government and
party officials who have been reported sick or purged.
	   They include former Premiers Kang Song San and Kim Dal Hyun; Jon
Kum Chol, a vice president of the Committee for the Promotion of
External Trade, and Choe Yong Hae, head of the Kim Il Sung
Socialist Youth League.
	   Also missing from the list was Kim Sung Ae, stepmother of Kim
Jong Il. They are reportedly on bad terms.
	   New entries include several dozen young army generals, including
Vice Marshals Kim Yung Chun and Hyun Chul Hae. Kim Yung Chun is a
likely candidate to be the North's next defense minister.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ A doctor and two divers died Tuesday
when an explosion in a hyperbaric chamber at a hospital released a
cloud of noxious fumes, the Anatolia news agency said.
	   The cause of the explosion was not immediately known and
officials at Capa hospital refused comment.
	   The chamber uses pressurized oxygen to treat divers who have a

Two Frenchmen held since June 5 in Somalia expected in Dijbouti
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DJIBOUTI (AP) _ Two French men who were kidnapped by Somali
militiamen as they attempted to sail from Marseille to La Reunion
were expected in Djibouti Tuesday after they were released from 52
days in captivity, a French Embassy spokesman said.
	   Michel Tretout said Bernard Perrin and Jean-Francois Peyrani
were released Monday to United Nations officials in the
northeastern Somali town of Bossaso and would be received by
Ambassador Bernard Le Tourneau.
	   Reports from neighboring Somalia said the release came after
politicians and clan elders exerted pressure on the gunmen who
seized the two and their sailboat June 5 in the Gulf of Aden off
the northern Somali coast after a chase in a speedboat.
	   Efforts were increased to obtain the release of the two men
after reports July 2 that one was seriously ill and the other had
begun a hunger strike.
	   The kidnappers had demanded dlrs 75,000 for their release. There
was no indication whether the demand had been met.
	   Tretout said the sailboat was returned with the men and was in
safe-keeping in Bossaso.
	   In the beginning of July, a source close to the negotiations
said they had been complicated by the fact that businessmen in the
Somali port had offered the kidnappers dlrs 80,000 for the
sailboat.
	   Earlier, the elders had contemplated an armed rescue not only to
release the hostages, but as a deterrent to would-be kidnappers.
But the idea was ruled out because it was feated the hostages might
be harmed.
	   The region where the Frenchmen were kidnapped 200 kilometers
east of Bossaso is relatively peaceful, but piracy by freelance
gunmen is rampant. Local warlords have also had fishing boats
seized on charges of illegal fishing.
	   At the end of June, the captain and crew of a Taiwanese vessel
were freed after a ransom of drls 320,000 was reportedly paid to
the Somali Salvation Democratic Front faction that controls the
coastline of northeastern Somalia.
	   Somalia has had no central government since the 1991 ouster of
the late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and the country's subsequent
disintegration into clan-based fiefdoms.

Rockets fall on Kabul airport; no injuries reported
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ZAHEERUDDIN ABDULLAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Kabul residents cowered in their
basements during an overnight rocket barrage of the airport, and
the opposition said Tuesday it would continue attacks until the
Taliban stopped using the airport for military flights.
	   No injuries or deaths were reported, and the extent of damage
was not clear. Seven to eight rockets fell on the airport compound,
but Taliban planes were able to use the runway Tuesday morning.
	   ``We spent all night in the basement, waiting to die,'' said
Mohammad Zaheer, who lives near the airport. Civilians areas were
spared Monday night, though in the past people living near the
airport have been killed by stray rockets.
	   Taliban bombers regularly take off from the airport to attack
opposition positions north of the capital.
	   Mohammad Haref, spokesman for ousted military chief Ahmed Shah
Masood, said attacks on the airport would continue so long as it
was considered a military target. But he said the Red Cross and the
United Nations had been assured the airport would be safe to use
for aid flights on Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday mornings.
	   ``We gave them a 100-percent guarantee,'' he said by telephone
from the Panjshir Valley, where Masood and President Burhanuddin
Rabbani retreated after the Taliban religious militia drove them
from Kabul on Sept. 27, 1996.
	   Haref denied a report in Monday's New York Times that Masood was
getting military supplies from Russia. The Times had quoted unnamed
U.S. officials as saying that Russia's key client was Masood _ the
militia leader most responsible for forcing Soviet troops back
across the border in 1989.
	   Afghan factions turned on each other after the retreat of the
Soviets, who had come to try to prop up a Communist government.
	   Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Andreyev, speaking
to The Associated Press Monday, denied allegations that Russia is
supplying heavy weapons or training to Afghan fighters battling the
Taliban.
	   Russia has a long-standing fear of Islamic fundamentalism and
does not want the Taliban version of Islam to spread into the
former Soviet republics in Central Asia. The Times said Russia may
also be backing the anti-Taliban alliance in hopes of reasserting
influence over the region's natural gas and oil reserves.

	   YUEYANG, China (AP) _ As flood waters roared through central
China's rich farmland and heavy industry center Tuesday, Beijing
called for a ``do or die'' effort to ensure the safety of millions
of people along the Yangtze River.
	   With waters on the mighty river continuing to rise, nearly 5
million people in five provinces were mobilized to help ensure that
anti-flood embankments held firm, the official Liberation Army
Daily said Tuesday.
	   Floods caused by rains that fell heavier and earlier than usual
have killed more than 1,145 people so far this year. Almost a
million people have been forced from their homes in the three
worst-hit provinces _ Hunan, Hubei and Jiangxi.
	   Zhou Ming, a spokesman for the Ministry of Civil Affairs, said
the death toll from flooding was expected to rise, but not by a
large margin.
	   Flooding is the latest in a series of natural disasters _
including storms, landslides and earthquakes _ that had killed
2,571 people as of July 26, the official China Daily said.
	   The disasters also destroyed 3.86 million houses, forced 8.65
million people to relocate, and caused 153.1 billion yuan (dlrs
18.5 billion) in losses, the newspaper said, quoting a Ministry of
Civil Affairs report.
	   Worried that a flood crest, the third this month, would
undermine dikes weakened by heavy rains and high waters, the
government ``called for a do or die effort in protecting major
cities and river and lake embankments,'' the state-run Xinhua News
Agency said in a report late Monday.
	   The flood peak was the Yangtze's second-largest since 1954, when
floods killed 30,000 people and affected 10 million others, Xinhua
said.
	   ``People are holding their breath as the third flood peak
passes,'' it said.
	   The flood peak went through Yueyang city, on the edge of the
heavily swollen Dongting Lake, without incident early Tuesday and
was moving through Wuhan, central China's largest industrial
center, with more than 7 million residents, state television and
Xinhua said.
	   Water levels were 2.5 meters (8.25 feet) above the danger mark
in Wuhan Monday night, Xinhua said.
	   To release pressure on the dikes, authorities were considering
whether to blow up levees upstream to divert flood waters into farm
districts and save cities from flooding.
	   Military boats, trucks and aircraft were working day and night
to deliver relief goods, and medical workers were working to
prevent possible epidemics of disease, Xinhua said.
	   In the interests of safety in flood-hit areas, police along the
Yangtze were ordered to step up patrols and crack down on thefts of
anti-flood equipment, the Liberation Army Daily said. They also
were ordered to ensure that prisoners did not escape from detention
centers, the newspaper said.
	   The Finance Ministry, meanwhile, ordered stepped up supervision
of flood relief funds to ensure they are not diverted or wasted,
the People's Daily said.
	   Over the past 200 years, the 6,300-kilometer- (3,900-mile-) long
Yangtze has been hit by a devastating flood every 10 years, it
said.

Russia will keep grain imports low in 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will not import large amounts of foreign
grain in 1998, despite a crop-wrecking summer drought and
expectations of a smaller harvest than last year.
	   Grain yields will total some 70 million metric tons (77 million
tons) in 1998, almost 20 million metric tons (22 million tons) down
from last year, the ITAR-Tass news agency said, citing the Russian
Agriculture and Food Ministry.
	   However, the ministry said Russia's regions have adequate grain
stores left over from 1997 to counter the drop.
	   This year's drought will mostly affect grain exports,
particularly of barley, the ministry said. Last year Russia sold
1.5 million metric tons (1.65 million tons) of barley, and plans to
sell only 300,000 metric tons (330,000 tons) this year.
	   Any imports in 1998 will be used as fodder in Russia' Far East,
where foreign grain is cheaper to buy than grain transported from
the west of Russia, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Last year, Russia imported only about 2 percent of the grain it
consumed.

Roadside explosion kills SLA member, civilian wounded
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ A roadside bomb exploded Tuesday in
southern Lebanon, killing a member of the Israeli-allied South
Lebanon Army militia, Lebanese security officials said.
	   A civilian was wounded in retaliatory shelling, they added.
	   The officials said the blast occurred at Beit Yahoun, which lies
inside Israel's self-styled ``security zone'' in the south. The
officials spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas claimed responsibility for the
incident, saying in a statement that it killed or wounded a number
of the occupants of a military vehicle.
	   In retaliation, Israeli and SLA gunners shelled suspected
guerrilla hideouts north of the security zone.
	   A Lebanese civilian was wounded in the shelling, the officials
said.
	   The area is about 25 kilometers (15 miles) southeast of the
coastal city of Tyre.
	   The Shiite Muslim Hezbollah, or the Party of God, has led the
fight to try to oust about 1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500 SLA
militiamen from southern Lebanon. Israel carved out the security
zone in 1985 to try to protect northern Israeli communities from
guerrilla attacks.

Seven dead, eight injured in bus crash in southern France
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with quotes from passenger, rescue official &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTELIMAR, France (AP) _ A Dutch bus packed with tourists
rammed into two other tour buses early Tuesday on a highway in
southern France, killing seven people and critically injuring eight
others, police said.
	   Some of the passengers were thrown from the buses as a result of
the impact, and limbs of the dead and injured were scattered across
the blood spattered highway.
	   ``I was woken up when the bus braked brutally,'' said Eric
Verzatvoort, a passenger in the Dutch bus that hit the others. ``My
daughter was thrown under the seat by the shock. Everybody was
crying.''
	   The accident was set in motion after a truck carrying fish ran
off the A7 highway near Montelimar about 600 kilometers (370 miles)
south of Paris. The driver had apparently fallen asleep and part of
his vehicle impeded the roadway.
	   A Dutch and a German bus managed to slow down to avoid hitting
the truck. They were rammed from behind by a second Dutch bus about
1:30 a.m. (2330 GMT), said Col. Alain Hurtevent, head of the police
in the Drome region.
	   The Dutch bus that hit the two others was traveling at more than
120 kilometers (74 miles) an hour, above the legally allowed limit
of 110 kilometers (67 miles) per hour for vehicles of that type,
Hurtevent said.
	   The German bus was cut in half and lay sprawled across the
highway.
	   A small contingent of police and rescue workers who were already
at the scene to deal with the truck accident quickly put out a red
alert.
	   ``We needed more than two hours to cut free the wounded,'' said
Phillip Bertrand, head of the fire department in the Drome region.
	   Seven people were killed, including three Germans, of whom one
was a 12-year-old girl, a small Russian boy traveling in the German
bus, and three Dutch citizens.
	   Eight other people were critically wounded and were taken by
helicopter to nearby hospitals. Another 30 were treated at the
scene of the accident for their injuries.
	   The three buses were carrying about 140 people. The two Dutch
buses came from the towns of Enschede and Herwen, while the German
bus came from Leer. All three were on their way to Spain.
	   Plans were being made to help the passengers return to their
country of origin.
	   An investigation has been opened, and the drivers of the two
buses that were hit were questioned by police.

Sumitomo, Daiwa announce tie-up in investment banking business
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES throughout with formal announcement &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese financial giants Sumitomo Bank and Daiwa
Securities Co. announced Tuesday that they will form an alliance in
the investment banking business.
	   It was the latest move in a continuing consolidation in Japan's
financial industry following a series of financial deregulation
reforms, dubbed the ``Big Bang,'' aimed at invigorating the economy
by opening up markets to greater competition.
	   Sumitomo and Daiwa will establish three joint-venture companies
that will start operations next April, Sumitomo said in a news
release.
	   One company will be in the capital market business for corporate
clients, one will deal in derivatives, and the other will handle
asset management, company officials said.
	   Daiwa also announced that next April, it will become the first
financial company in Japan to become a holding company since a ban
was lifted last year. Daiwa will manage the three joint ventures
and other units under the umbrella of the holding company, it said.
	   The capital markets joint venture, tentatively called Daiwa
Securities SB Capital Markets, is to be capitalized at around 300
billion yen (dlrs 2.12 billion). Daiwa will take a 60 percent stake
and Sumitomo Bank 40 percent.
	   The brokerage and the bank will transfer their corporate and
capital market operations into the new company. Sumitomo Bank will
merge its securities unit, Sumitomo Capital Securities Co., with
the joint venture.
	   The derivatives joint venture is to be formed with working
capital of 50 billion yen (dlrs 353 million). Sumitomo and Daiwa
will each have an equal share in this venture.
	   The asset management company will be established by combining
the investment advisory and investment trust subsidiaries of
Sumitomo and Daiwa.
	   ``The new joint ventures will improve their competitiveness by
adopting a management style that meets global standards, studying
the formation of a global alliance with foreign financial
institutions, and recruiting talent from outside,'' Sumitomo said
in the statement.
	   Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga reportedly welcomed the linkup
between two of Japan's top financial institutions.
	   ``It is admirable that the nation's financial institutions make
efforts to strengthen their management bases amid development of
the Japanese `Big Bang' financial reform,'' Kyodo quoted Matsunaga
as saying.
	   Banks and other financial institutions are scrambling to form
new alliances with both domestic and overseas companies in line
with the reforms.
	   Last month, Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. announced that it will
form Japan's largest asset management company early next year.
	   Foreign financial companies are also moving rapidly to take
advantage of the sweeping deregulation. U.S. securities company
Merrill Lynch and Co. is expanding its brokerage business here
after hiring some 2,000 employees of failed Yamaichi Securities
Co., Japan's fourth-largest brokerage.
	   Yamaichi folded late last year after revealing more than 250
billion yen (dlrs 1.8 billion) in hidden losses.

 &UR; BMW buys Rolls-Royce brand name, leaving VW to produce Bentleys &QL; 
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The grandest name of British motoring,
Rolls-Royce, was shaken up Tuesday in a deal that will see separate
German automakers producing Rolls-Royce and Bentley models early in
the next century.
	   BMW will make Rolls-Royces after buying the rights to the famous
brand and announcing plans to create a new Rolls-Royce company,
while Volkwswagen AG will keep the old Rolls-Royce factory it just
bought and continue producing the Bentley line of luxury cars.
	   VW paid 479 million pounds (dlrs 790 million) for Rolls-Royce
Motor Cars Ltd. early this month, but Europe's biggest automaker
faced one big hurdle: It didn't get the rights to the Rolls-Royce
brand name and logo.
	   Those were held by the British jet engine maker Rolls-Royce PLC,
which all along had hoped the luxury carmaker would be sold to
Germany's BMW. Rolls-Royce PLC announced a deal Tuesday to sell the
Rolls-Royce auto brand to BMW for 40 million pounds (dlrs 66
million).
	   BMW said Tuesday that VW can use the Rolls-Royce name for free
until Dec. 31, 2002, but after that BMW will take the name away and
create a new Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd.
	   VW will keep the Rolls-Royce factory in Crewe, England, but the
company's name will be changed to Bentley Motor Cars Ltd. and VW
will produce Bentleys, the other line of luxury cars now made by
Rolls-Royce.
	   It remains unclear where BMW will set up the new Rolls-Royce
company; a joint statement from VW and BMW had no details and the
companies did not immediately return phone calls.
	   Bosses of the three companies _ Ferdinand Piech of Volkswagen
AG, Bernd Pischetsrieder of BMW AG and Sir Ralph Robins of
Rolls-Royce PLC _ planned a midday news conference in London.
	   Rolls-Royce Motor Cars was put up for sale last autumn by the
British conglomerate Vickers PLC, which wanted out of the
automotive business to focus on other operations including defense
contracting.
	   VW outbid BMW in the spring, but Rolls-Royce PLC made it clear
that it favored selling the company to BMW, its partner in a jet
engine venture.
	   Rolls-Royce PLC was separated from the motor car business in an
early 1970s restructuring _ so it had no stake in the company
except for the rights to the all-important brand name.
	   ``Today's agreement is an Anglo-German success and fully meets
the objectives of both BMW and Rolls-Royce, as well as those of
VW,'' Robins said in a statement. ``We have said consistently, as
sole legal owner of the Rolls-Royce name and trademarks, that we
attach the greatest importance to their preservation and
protection.
	   ``These are key assets in our own business and today's agreement
strengthens the future management of the brand.''
	   Rolls-Royce reiterated its belief that BMW would be a better
``custodian of the Rolls-Royce name and trademarks.''
	   The sale of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars to the Germans drew angry
patriotic outbursts from many Englishmen, as well as a couple of
failed attempts to keep the famous company British.
	   As part of Tuesday's deal, BMW withdrew its earlier threat to
cut off engines it supplies to Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.
	   BMW said it will sell engines for Rolls-Royce models through
Dec. 31, 2002, when it then will begin using the brand name at its
own new company. BMW said it's willing to keep providing engines
for the Bentley Arnage models as long as VW continues to make them.
	   The German automakers said that after BMW starts making
Rolls-Royces and VW concentrates on making Bentleys, they will
cooperate on producing Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph models at the old
factory in Crewe.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Bank of Japan's policy board voted Tuesday to
keep the country's record-low interest rates unchanged in an effort
to reflate the recession-bound economy.
	   Quelling market fears about a credit shortage remains the
central bank's main concern. It has provided funds extending into
the fiscal half beginning Oct. 1 in an attempt to soothe funding
demand around that time.
	   Current policy, in place since September 1995, keeps the
official discount rate at the record low 0.50 percent and overnight
call money rates ``on average'' below 0.50 percent.
	   Signs that Japan's economy is only worsening have stirred debate
recently about whether the bank should cut rates even further. With
prices actually falling nationwide, economists point out that
there's little danger of sparking inflation.
	   The bank has instead favored more fiscal spending by the
government as a direct impetus for economic activities.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Germany's Commerzbank AG signed a
formal agreement Tuesday to invest dlrs 250 million in financially
troubled Korea Exchange Bank, the South Korean bank said.
	   Under the agreement, Korea Exchange Bank issued 70 million new
shares Tuesday, which Commerzbank bought for dlrs 3.57 per share.
The new shares will be listed on the stock exchange on Aug. 10.
	   The deal gave the German bank a 29.79 percent stake in the
Korean bank and made it the second largest stockholder after the
South Korean government, whose share will drop to 33.62 percent
after the capital increase.
	   The Korea Exchange Bank will yield two board seats and two
non-standing board seats to Commerzbank for participation in key
decisions on risk management and lending policy, it said in a news
release.
	   Korea Exchange was among seven commercial banks ordered by the
government to improve their finances or face closure.
	   Tuesday's deal was the second major capital inflow into South
Korea's banking sector since a financial crisis hit the country
late last year.
	   The International Finance Corporation, a World Bank sister
organization, injected capital worth dlrs 77 million in two South
Korean banks in bonds and equity participation in June.
	    &UR; ___
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Bangkok Bank, Thailand's biggest bank,
predicted Tuesday the country's economy will contract by 8.5
percent this year, exceeding the gloomy forecasts of the
International Monetary Fund and the government.
	   Thailand is in the midst of its worst economic crisis in modern
times. The IMF, which is leading a dlrs 17.2 billion bailout for
the country, has said it expects the economy to shrink by 7
percent. The government has predicted 6 percent shrinkage.
	   Bangkok Bank said the IMF had greatly underestimated the
contraction because companies were still facing a liquidity squeeze
despite inflows of funds from the IMF and other agencies to the
central bank.
	   Bangkok Bank also predicted that inflation would reach 10.4
percent, investment would drop by 13.8 percent and consumption
would drop by 7 percent.
	   Exports were forecast to shrink by 4.6 percent, but the current
account should show a surplus of 4.9 percent of gross domestic
product because imports will decline by 38.4 percent, it said.
	   The liquidity crunch has contributed to several factory closings
in recent weeks that have added thousands of Thais to the
unemployment rolls.
	   More than a million Thais have been left unemployed by the
economic crisis, according to the Ministry of Labor and Social
Welfare.
	    &UR; ___
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai Investment and Securities plans to
announce next month a deal with prospective foreign partners
including Japan's Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, a senior executive at the
Thai finance company said Monday.
	   Chirapa Parawongse, executive vice president, said Thai
Investment and Securities is close to completing negotiations with
prospective partners but declined to provide further details.
	   However, she denied local press reports that the finance company
will let Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank take a 75 percent stake. She also
denied reports that Bankers Trust of the United States had sold its
20 percent stake in the finance company to the Tokyo-based bank.
	   Thai Investment and Securities plans to increase capital by 2
billion baht (dlrs 47.6 million) to 3 billion baht (dlrs 68.4
million). To raise capital, the company said it will issue 200
million new shares with 10 baht (dlrs 0.25) par value. The company
plans to offer all the new shares in a private placement to
institutional investors.
	   Like many local finance companies, Thai Investment and
Securities is looking for foreign partners to help it raise capital
and survive the country's financial crisis.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian government has imposed
a ban on exports of several subsidized commodities to ensure
adequate domestic supply and price stability, a news report said.
	   The ban, beginning Tuesday, covers fish powder, unhusked rice,
milled rice, cracked rice, wheat, wheat flour, rice flour,
soybeans, sugar and kerosene, the Jakarta Post reported.
	   The newspaper quoted Minister of Trade and Industry Rahardi
Ramelan as saying Monday that the ban would run until Aug. 16, when
it will be replaced by an export tax.
	   According to Ramelan, Indonesia's monetary crisis has created
price disparities between the local and international markets,
triggering an outflow of goods, including products that are
subsidized by the government.
	   He said commodities already given export taxes, such as crude
palm oil and its derivatives, were not included on the export ban
list.
	   The International Monetary Fund's director for the Asia-Pacific,
Hubert Neiss, has said that the export ban was agreed to by the IMF
as a temporary measure to prevent subsidized goods from being
exported from the country.

Strong earthquake topples houses in far western China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A strong earthquake toppled walls in a town in
far western China Tuesday and sent rescuers hurriedly looking for
casualties, a government seismologist said.
	   There were no reports of deaths or injuries as of late Tuesday
afternoon, four hours after the quake of preliminary magnitude 5.5
shook Baicheng County in the Xinjiang region at 12:51 p.m. (0451
GMT), said Xu Senzhou of the county seismology bureau.
	   ``Walls fell over and some house walls cracked pretty
severely,'' said Xu. He said emergency teams were checking Baicheng
town and the epicenter, a farming community 30 kilometers (18
miles) to the southwest, for damage.
	   Baicheng lies on the edge of the snowcapped Tian Mountains as
they slope toward the Tarim Basin, a France-size swath of desert
and wasteland 2,900 kilometers (1,700 miles) west of Beijing.

Four get amnesty for 1993 killing of American student Amy Biehl
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Four men who beat and stabbed
American student Amy Biehl to death have been granted amnesty for
the 1993 killing, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission said
Tuesday.
	   Biehl, 26, died in the Guguletu black township outside Cape Town
when a crowd of blacks stoned her car, then beat and stabbed her.
The killing drew international attention to South Africa's racial
violence.
	   Vusumzi Ntamo, Ntobeko Peni, Mzikhona Nofemela and Mongezi
Manqina, during testimony before the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission last year, admitted killing Biehl and asked her family
for forgiveness.
	   Biehl's parents, Peter and Linda Biehl, in a statement from
their home in Newport Beach, California, supported the decision to
grant amnesty to the killers.
	   ``In the cases of the four amnesty applicants in Amy's murder,
we hope they will receive the support necessary to live productive
lives in a non-violent atmosphere. In fact, we hope the spirits of
Amy and of those like her will be a force in their new lives,'' the
Biehls said in their statement.
	   The Truth Commission can grant amnesty for full confessions that
shed light on abuses during the country's apartheid era, when the
white-minority government clashed with black militants. The crimes
must be deemed political.
	   Biehl, a Fulbright scholar, was in South Africa to help with
voter registration for the nation's first all-race election in 1994
that ended apartheid.
	   The four killers, convicted and sentenced to 18 years in prison
for the murder, testified at their amnesty hearing that they
believed their political leaders wanted them to attack whites _
also called ``settlers'' by black militants _ to highlight
grievances of blacks.
	   They cited the ``one settler, one bullet'' slogan of the Pan
Africanist Congress, a radical black group they supported.
	   The Biehls, who traveled to South Africa for the amnesty
hearing, said their daughter would have supported the commission's
mission to resolve the nation's racial division.
	   Manqina, who admitted he delivered the fatal stab wound, sat
with his head on a desk and wiped tears from his eyes as Mrs. Biehl
testified at his amnesty hearing.
	   In their statement, the Biehls expressed hope that South
Africans would be able to resolve their differences and learn to
live in harmony.
	   ``Amy was drawn to South Africa as a student and she admired the
vision of Nelson Mandela of a `Rainbow Nation.' It is this vision
of forgiveness and reconciliation that we have honored,'' said the
Biehls, who continue to do volunteer work in South African in
memory of their daughter.
	   ``We are concerned, therefore, about the violence which still
exists and which surely will escalate as the 1999 elections
approach. Amy was one of many killed in the violent political
climate preceding the 1994 elections. Unfortunately we are seeing
today similar power struggles ...,'' the Biehls said.
	   ``Violence remains the order of the day in promoting certain
political agendas. Violence and fear are never hallmarks of a
democratic way of life,'' they said.
	   Biehls parents urged South Africans to accept the decisions of
the amnesty commission and to work to step up the pace of
reconciliation.
	   ``We must never forget people who lost their lives in the
struggle,'' the Biehls said. ``We must honor them in discovering
new approaches _ non-violent partnerships - to create the South
African which Nelson Mandela, Amy and those who perished dreamed of
- a new, multi-racial, democratic nation.''

	   Brokers said share prices continued to fall on concerns over
whether the new Japanese administration of Keizo Obuchi will be
able to carry out economic reforms.

	   Among properties, Cheung Kong fell 50 Hong Kong cents to 34.00,

Coal miners take mine chief hostage in Russian Far East
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE ECKEL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) _ Disgruntled coal miners in the
Russian Far East took the director of their mine hostage Tuesday to
press demands for payment of nine months of back wages, a news
agency reported.
	   About 10 workers at the Nagornaya mine in the town of Partizansk
occupied the director's office Tuesday and said they would not
permit him to leave.
	   ``We'll be here until we get our money,'' Viktor Grubov, a
spokesman for the miners, told The Associated Press by telephone.
	   The director, Viktor Trukhin, said he is being held against his
will but supports the miners' demands. He and the miners plan to
meet Wednesday with local officials and the mine's biggest debtor,
the electric company Dalenergo.
	   The incident was one of several ongoing miners' protests in
various regions of Russia, which has experienced sporadic miners'
strikes since early May.
	   Farther north, miners on the island of Sakhalin continued to
block coal shipments to the region's major power plant, demanding
that energy officials pay for coal that has already been delivered,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Because of the delayed payments, coal miners say they have not
been paid in eight months.
	   The miners have blocked the delivery of more than 70 rail cars
carrying 4,000 tons of coal, Yuri Kuzin of the Sakhalinenergo
company told the Interfax news agency. Kuzin said the plant may
have to shut down on Friday unless its fuel supplies are
replenished.
	   Other miners' protests include two rail blockades _ one in the
town of Osinniki in the Siberian Kuzbass mining region, and another
near the Ural Mountains city of Chelyabinsk.
	   The most visible protest is in Moscow, where a group of about
200 miners have been camped outside the government's main
administration building since early June.
	   The protests have been largely uncoordinated and have not
inflicted significant damage on the economy.

Serb forces encircle rebel stronghold in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with 20,000 Albanian refugees reported on the
move; TRIMS outdated material. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian guerrillas
counterattacked government forces near a major road which Serb
police regained after a two-month rebel blockade. More than 20,000
refugees were on the move Tuesday to escape the fighting.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency said Kosovo Liberation Army
fighters launched a strong attack late Monday near Kijevo, just
south of the highway linking this provincial capital with Pec, 80
kilometers (50 miles) to the west.
	   Elsewhere, Serb police and Yugoslav troops sealed off the rebel
stronghold of Junik, 80 kilometers (50 miles) to the southwest
along the Albanian border.
	   Loudspeakers mounted on government camouflaged armored vehicles
prowled the hills above the village late Monday, demanding
``surrender, surrender.'' But the Albanians refused.
	   Serbian police estimate that there are about 2,000 people
trapped in Junik, including about 1,000 are ``highly trained'' KLA
troops. The rest are local residents and refugees who fled recent
fighting elsewhere.
	   Reporters who reached Junik late Monday saw eight bodies lying
near a small stream. Police said they were shot earlier Monday
trying to flee into Albania from Kosovo.
	   On Monday, police regained control of the Pristina-Pec road from
KLA fighters, who erected barricades in early May. Police convoys
traveling eastward from Pec and westward from Pristina linked up
near Kijevo.
	   But on Tuesday, police were turning back reporters who tried to
drive along the road westward from Pristina, indicating the route
was not fully secure.
	   Fighting along the strategic highway, which bisects the heart of
KLA-controlled territory, prompted an estimated 20,000 Albanian
civilians to join the tens of thousands of others who have left
their homes since President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown
on Albanian separatists in February.
	   Albanian families, some on foot and others crowded on flat-bed
carts pulled by small tractors, could be seen Monday lining the
road between Pristina and Pec, heading for KLA strongholds deeper
into the rugged mountains.
	   The rebels are fighting for the independence of Kosovo, whose
population of 2 million people is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
Kosovo is located in southern Serbia, the dominant of two republics
that make up what remains of Yugoslavia.
	   According to the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center, at
least five KLA members were killed in the latest Serb offensive,
launched Friday. The Yugoslav Army said in a statement that three
of its soldiers had been killed since Saturday and five were
injured.
	   Albanian analysts believe Milosevic wanted to deliver a blow to
the rebels before agreeing to future talks with moderate Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova on the fate of the province.
	   While the rebels admitted they suffered losses, they showed no
signs of giving in.
	   ``It's true that we have had losses during the clashes,'' Jakup
Krasniqi, a KLA spokesman told Albanian television late Monday.
``But the enemy has also had many losses _ both in people and
materials _ though they try to minimize them.''
	   ``The KLA will come out of this Serb offensive stronger than
before,'' he said.
	   So far, the rebel organization has refused to endorse Rugova's
leadership because he opposes violence to gain independence for
Kosovo.
	   As fighting escalated, special U.S. envoy Christopher Hill
returned Monday to Pristina to continue efforts to cobble together
an Albanian delegation for talks with Milosevic.
	   Hill, the American ambassador to neighboring Macedonia, said the
new fighting ``simply increases the urgency of a political
solution.''
	   ``The more people who are killed, the more embittered certain
people are, the more reluctant they are to agree to any negotiation
that at the end of the day has to involve a certain amount of trust
and good will,'' Hill told The Associated Press.
	   Milosevic has offered to restore Kosovo's autonomy, which he
abolished in 1989, but he opposes independence for the province.
	   The Americans and Europeans also oppose independence, fearing it
will lead to greater demands by the ethnic Albanians to unite with
Albanian communities in other Balkan countries, thereby
destabilizing the entire region.

Cambodian ruling party shrugs off boycott threat after victory

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with ruling party member saying government will go on
despite opposition boycott threat, grafs 2-3. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Setting the stage for more turmoil
in one of the world's most troubled countries, strongman Hun Sen's
party claimed a landslide victory in parliamentary elections
Tuesday while the opposition accused him of massive fraud.
	   The Cambodian People's Party shrugged off opposition threats to
boycott the new National Assembly and suggested a coalition.
	   ``If they don't, the current government will go until probably
2003, but I think they should uphold national interests and join a
coalition government,'' said Svay Sitha, a CPP steering committee
member.
	   After a day of counting, the Hun Sen-packed National Election
Committee had released partial tallies for only two of the 21
provinces. Opposition parties had feared tampering when the
committee postponed the release of preliminary results Monday.
	   But the two main opposition leaders, Prince Norodom Ranariddh
and Sam Rainsy, accepted that the official tally would resemble
figures put out by the Cambodian People's Party _ an
acknowledgement of its grip on the levers of power and refusal to
let them go.
	   The figures showed the ruling party taking 67 of the 122
National Assembly seats, a commanding majority in what had looked
like a tight three-way race. According to the figures, Ranariddh's
royalist FUNCINPEC took 42 seats and the Sam Rainsy Party just 13.
	   ``They stole our vote, and we will disagree with whatever their
result,'' Sam Rainsy told a crowd of motorcycle taxi drivers who
have been stalwart opposition supporters. ``Had there not been any
fraud, we would be in the majority.''
	   The prince and Sam Rainsy, on-again, off-again allies, said they
would boycott the National Assembly, denying the CPP the two-thirds
of members needed to hold meetings.
	   The dispute raised the prospect of more turmoil in a country
that suffered the Khmer Rouge genocide of the 1970s and 30 years of
civil war and strife. In the latest round, Hun Sen had deposed
Ranariddh as co-prime minister last year in two days of fighting in
the capital.
	   The co-premiership emerged from U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993
meant to usher in a new era of peace and democracy.
	   Ranariddh won, but Hun Sen, who came to power in 1985 under the
harsh Vietnamese occupation that followed the Khmer Rouge, forced
his way into a coalition by threatening war.
	   Hun Sen called the elections in a bid to win back international
aid and legitimacy, but used violence, including murder, against
opposition activists and intimidation of voters to ensure his
victory.
	   Ranariddh and Hun Sen both said they would reject another
co-premiership, calling it a recipe for disaster.
	   Foreign observer groups noted the pre-election violence but said
that relatively peaceful voting and initially smooth counting
Monday signaled an election fair enough to represent the will of
Cambodians.
	   But most issued their endorsements before even the barest
official returns came in.
	   ``We have followed our own schedule,'' said Sven Linder,
spokesman for the group coordinating 678 observers from 40
countries. ``I am confident we are not premature.''
	   The opposition complained of counting irregularities and
demanded an investigation, claiming that only seven seats should
separate the top two parties.
	   Sam Rainsy said that together, his party and FUNCINPEC should
have been able to form a majority with the prince as prime
minister.
	   ``We will not recognize the result of the election,'' Ranariddh
said. ``Yesterday, in the morning, until about 11 or 12 o'clock,
FUNCINPEC was leading everywhere. We were clearly leading. But in
the afternoon, the situation was reversed.''
	   The election committee stressed that official results were not
in and that premature claims by parties could ``undermine public
order.''
	   ``Any results suggesting that this party wins or this party
loses will affect the minds of voters,'' said spokesman Samraing
Kimsan.
	   After last year's coup, a renegade member of Ranariddh's party,
Foreign Minister Ung Huot, accepted Hun Sen's offer to fill the
co-premier's chair. He was widely seen as a puppet.
	   Despite papering Phnom Penh with campaign posters and staging
some relatively large rallies _ sometimes joining Hun Sen's _ Ung
Huot failed to win a National Assembly seat under his own party.
	   He sent a representative to an opposition news conference
Tuesday to protest irregularities.

Russia, South Korea settle spy dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Russia and South Korea on Tuesday
settled a diplomatic row over spying that has disrupted
arrangements for high-level diplomatic meetings and progress on
most other issues between the two countries during the past month.
	   South Korea agreed to allow the return of a Russian diplomat
expelled from Seoul in retaliation for Russia's deportation of a
South Korean on espionage charges.
	   The Russian diplomat will remain in Seoul until ``his
replacement arrives in the near future,'' Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov told reporters after a 17-minute closed-door
negotiation with South Korean Foreign Minister Park Chung-soo.
	   The South Korean diplomat will not return to Moscow ``because he
was caught red-handed,'' Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Vladimir Rakhmanin added.
	   The meeting in a room of the Manila Hotel on the sidelines of a
Southeast Asia security conference ended with the sound of hand
clapping from behind the closed doors. As the dozen diplomats and
aides emerged, Park prompted his Russian colleague to shake hands
``with a wide smile,'' then left Primakov to explain the agreement
to reporters.
	   Primakov said through an interpreter they had agreed ``that
people sent to the two countries in an official capacity to
maintain connections with the special services of each country will
not be engaging in intelligence-gathering activity.''
	   He said, ``This page has been turned in our bilateral
relations,'' and the countries will now proceed to arrange a visit
to Moscow by Park. The dates and issues will be concluded later.
	   The row started July 4, when Russia ordered the expulsion of a
South Korean diplomat in Moscow after he reportedly was caught
accepting classified documents from a Russian contact.
	   The Russian was arrested on treason charges.
	   South Korea retaliated four days later by expelling a Russian
diplomat in Seoul, saying he had engaged in ``activities that go
against his status as a diplomat.''
	   Then, on July 20, South Korea withdrew five more officials from
Russia under an agreement to limit the number of intelligence
agents each country assigns to its diplomatic missions.
	   South Korean officials had hoped that would end the dispute.
	   But at the foreign ministers' meeting in Manila, Russia raised
the issue again and asked South Korea to retract its earlier
decision that expelled the Russian diplomat in Seoul.

Miner killed in the eastern Ukrainian coal region of Donetsk
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A miner was killed Monday in the eastern
coal region of Donetsk, the Emergency Situations Ministry said.
	   The miner from Oleksandrivska mine in the city of Yenakievo died
due to neglect of safety rules, the ministry said. It did not
elaborate.
	   Monday's accident brought to nearly 225 the number of Ukrainian
miners killed at work this year, according to Coal Ministry
statistics.
	   A total of 23,600 accidents involving people occurred at
Ukrainian mines in the first half of 1998, of which 211 were fatal,
the ministry said.
	   The number of deaths has been steadily increasing in recent
years as mines lack the money to replace outdated equipment and
implement safety measures.

Albright says too early to declare victory in Cambodia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright voiced skepticism Tuesday over claims by Cambodian
strongman Hun Sen that his ruling party had won a clear-cut
victory, saying ``any declarations of victory are premature.''
	   ``The only thing we know for a fact is that the Cambodian people
voted in large numbers as they did in the previous election,'' she
said.
	   In Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Hun Sen claimed a landslide victory in
parliamentary elections Tuesday for his Cambodian People's Party,
prompting allegations of fraud by the opposition.
	   A senior U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said that ``a very small percentage of the votes are in'' and that
it might take days until enough votes are counted to be able to
declare a winner.
	   He said the joint observer group had not yet been heard from.
	   ``All of the parties are making statements based on their own
exit polling,'' the official said.
	   Asked about the claims by reporters, Albright said, ``I think it
is premature for anyone to declare major victory, because as far as
I know not a large percentage of the vote has been counted.
	   ``And we have not specifically heard from the observers who are
there in order to be able to declare whether the election has been
free and fair and how the vote count is going.''
	   Though official results had still not been released, the
Cambodian People's Party claimed it had won 66 seats in the
122-member National Assembly, while Prince Norodom Ranariddh's
party had won 40 seats and the Sam Rainsy Party took 16.
	   ``The only people who at this stage deserve congratulations are
the people of Cambodia who turned out to vote in heavy numbers,''
she said.
	   Albright was in the Philippines attending a diplomatic
conference.

Taiwan regards Chinese defense policy review as threatening
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Officials said Tuesday that China had
failed to conceal a covert intent to retake Taiwan by force in a
defense policy review intended to ease worries about its potential
threat to world peace.
	   ``Their purpose is to create a false scenario of peace,''
Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Kung Fan-ting told a news
conference. ``It will not be conducive to easing cross-strait
tensions.''
	   In issuing its first public defense policy review in three
years, China on Monday renewed a threat to retake Taiwan by force.
It also reiterated that China wants a stable world order to pursue
its primary goal of economic development, and vowed never to attack
or invade unless first attacked.
	   It was notable for bringing a modicum of transparency to the
largely secretive workings of the world's largest standing army.
	   The United States and other countries have urged China to
publish more information about the People's Liberation Army more
often to dispel suspicions about Chinese intentions.
	   Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of Taiwan's government Mainland
Affairs Council, said the policy review revealed little to improve
understanding of the military balance between Taiwan and China.
	   He said he believed the issuance was a goodwill gesture to the
United States following President Bill Clinton's visit.
	   Lin Yu-fang, a military specialist and opposition lawmaker, said
the report served as a declaration to Taiwan that ``no matter what
rapprochement China has reached with the West, it shall not commit
to renouncing the use of force to retake Taiwan.''
	   Lin, of the New Party, said it also served to assure the Chinese
public, especially hard-liners, that China has not and will not
make any concessions on the Taiwan issue despite its detente with
the United States.
	   ``The paper serves more political and diplomatic purposes than
military ones,'' Lin told reporters. But he said Taiwan should
encourage China to move further toward military transparency.

Study finds borax in food sold at Bangkok markets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A random inspection by health officials
of 10 Bangkok markets found borax powder, harmful to the liver and
kidneys, in about 30 percent of food samples tested, the Bangkok
Post reported Tuesday.
	   Using borax as a food preservative is against Thai law, with
violators subject to a maximum of 10 years in prison and a 20,000
baht (dlrs 487) fine.
	   Health Department officials said, however, that it is commonly
used to make meats and vegetables look fresh. The substance was
found mostly in ground pork, chicken, beef, sausages, fish cakes,
meatballs and some varieties of sweets, the Post said.
	   Of 352 food samples taken, health officials found 107, or nearly
30 percent of them, tested positive for borax, it said.
	   Department officials said they would ask Bangkok Governor
Bhichit Rattakul to launch a crackdown on vendors selling
borax-laced food, the paper added.

Sri Lankan capital virtually sealed off for regional summit

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Fearing attacks by Tamil separatists
during a summit of South Asian leaders, police virtually shut down
the capital on Tuesday, closing offices and schools, stopping train
service and rescheduling international flights.
	   ``We don't want even a fly inside the security zone,'' said
Colombo's deputy director general of police, J.J.A. Jayawardena.
	   The summit, starting Wednesday, coincides with the 15th
anniversary of anti-Tamil riots in Colombo that marked the
beginning of war in Sri Lanka for an ethnic Tamil homeland.
	   Ethnic Tamils claim the island nation's Sinhalese majority
discriminates against them, and armed separatists are fighting to
form a Tamil state in northeastern Sri Lanka.
	   On Tuesday, leaders from Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal,
Maldives, Pakistan and Sri Lanka began arriving in Colombo to take
part in the annual summit of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation.
	   Police fear the Tamil guerrillas could carry out an attack to
dramatize their demand for a homeland.
	   On Monday, police arrested two Tamil men in Colombo's outskirts
and recovered about 500 grams (one pound) of explosives.
	   Sri Lanka's national carrier, Air Lanka, rescheduled 10 flights,
and police have closed some roads into the city.
	   Indian Airlines suspended its flights from Madras, capital of
the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu state, whose 56 million
Tamils share a language and culture with the Tamils of Sri Lanka.
	   In July 1983, Sinhalese mobs attacked Tamil homes in the capital
to avenge the rebels' killing of 13 soldiers in northeastern Sri
Lanka. Hundreds of Tamils were massacred, and tens of thousands
fled to the island's northern province and to neighboring India.

Unknown Americans hope to impress scouts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Jimmy Sasser isn't just going for the gold
at the World Basketball Championship.
	   He's looking to resurrect a career.
	   The former NBA draft pick's story and sentiments mirror those of
most of his U.S. teammates at the tournament, which starts
Wednesday.
	   They're thrilled to be given the chance to win a world title _
and to impress some scouts.
	   ``I'm just actually waiting to get back in the NBA. This is a
critical year in my career right now,'' said Sasser, whose own
basketball odyssey started as soon as the 1996 draft ended.
	   Taken 41st out of Xavier by the Sacramento Kings, he was traded
the next day to the Trail Blazers, who cut him before the season. A
pair of 10-day contracts with San Antonio and Dallas only whetted
his thirst for NBA action. But he has since spent two seasons with
the CBA's Sioux Falls Skyforce and had a handful of games in the
Spanish League.
	   The U.S. roster has five CBA players, five members of foreign
teams, one collegian (Duke's Trajan Langdon), and one player
looking for work (Purdue's undrafted Brad Miller).
	   ``We are just focused in on winning this gold medal,'' Sasser
said. ``We also know that America hasn't really seen these guys in
awhile. We just want to prove we can win.''
	   The first test for coach Rudy Tomjanovich's ragtag collection is
against Brazil. The U.S. team's first-round bracket also has
Lithuania and South Korea.
	   Tomjanovich has had about three weeks to get to know the players
and find a system suited to their skills. The latest version of the
Dream Team threatened to boycott the worlds because of a labor
dispute with the NBA. USA Basketball responded by dumping the
collection of all-stars in mid-June.
	   Sasser and his new teammates were the beneficiaries.
	   ``I want to be in the NBA. This could help,'' said Jimmy King,
whose ``Nothing 2 Lose'' tattoo on his left forearm could be this
no-name team's motto.
	   King reached two NCAA title games as a member of Michigan's Fab
Five, but it's been mostly downhill since those heady days,
basketball-wise. He had brief bench-riding stints in the NBA and a
CBA MVP award highlights his resume.
	   ``These guys, if they were on NBA teams, they would be from the
10th to the 12th guy,'' Tomjanovich acknowledged. ``If it's the
right situation, they wouldn't embarrass themselves and could help
an NBA team.''
	   Although fill-ins, the players don't seem worried about
potential backlash from NBAers, the way baseball replacement
players were scorned by major leaguers during the 1995 spring
training lockout. Tomjanovich flatly refused to talk about the
lockout.
	   ``I don't think it will be that much of a serious issue,''
Sasser said. ``The NBA is a business. What those players are doing
is business strategy and that's what we're doing.''
	   While starring for a top European team can potentially net a
contract in excess of dlrs 1 million, CBA salaries fall well short
of the dlrs 272,500 NBA minimum.
	   About 20 NBA clubs will be scouting the championship, which ends
Aug. 9. In addition to eyeing the Americans, they'll be hoping to
find the next Vlade Divac (who opted not to play for Yugoslavia
here) or Toni Kukoc (whose Croatia didn't qualify).
	   Even without its own NBA players, European champion Yugoslavia
is expected to make a run at the gold in what has become a
tournament with no real favorite.
	   Australia, which will have center Chris Anstey of the Dallas
Mavericks, joins Lithuania, Greece and Italy as medal contenders.
	   ``We'll have to work hard and I'll need to coach hard,'' said
Tomjanovich, who has guided the Houston Rockets to two NBA titles.
``This team will have to be an example of true teamwork if we're to
be successful.''

German parties present law-and-order platforms with eye to
</HEADLINE>
far-right &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative
union presented a tough law-and-order election platform Tuesday
that looks a lot like the program presented by the opposition
Social Democrats a day earlier.
	   With an eye toward the growing appeal of far-right,
anti-foreigner parties, both of the mainstream parties have sought
to project a tough-on-crime image and prove they are taking steps
to stem the tide of refugees and immigrants to Germany.
	   The platform presented by Kohl's Christian Democrats and their
Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, calls for
deporting foreigners convicted of crimes in Germany and for locking
delinquent youth up in homes when necessary to keep them out of
trouble.
	   The Social Democrats, who presented their program for ``internal
security'' on Monday, had the same proposals.
	   Kohl's union went further, however, by also demanding that
criminal youths be treated tougher and that the maximum sentence a
juvenile offender can receive be raised from 10 to 15 years.
	   ``We will take decisive steps against criminality and
violence,'' said Finance Minister Theo Waigel, who also is CSU
chairman.
	   But Kohl nixed demands by the archconservative CSU to include
the statement ``Germany is not an immigration country'' in the
paper.
	   The focus on law and order in this year's election campaign is
seen as a response to the growing appeal of far-right parties,
especially in economically depressed eastern Germany, where
unemployment hovers around 20 percent.
	   The anti-foreigner German People's Union won about 13 percent of
the vote in a state election in April with slogans such as ``German
jobs for Germans'' and ``Out with foreign bandits.''
	   But the tough positions put forward by the mainstream parties
drew criticism as well.
	   Wolfgang Gerhardt, chairman of the liberal Free Democrats,
accused both his coalition partner _ the Christian Democrats _ and
the opposition of ``performing a big publicity show.''
	   Greens leader Juergen Trittin, who hopes to enter government
after the Sept. 27 election in coalition with the Social Democrats,
accused them nevertheless of populism.

Debate rages over Barnes, Mitchell suspensions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Track Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Track and field's national governing body is
incensed over the drug suspensions of shot putter Randy Barnes and
sprinter Dennis Mitchell by the sport's world organization.
	   ``USATF is concerned and dismayed that the IAAF chose to
temporarily suspend two American athletes on the basis of unproven
allegations that they have committed a doping offense,'' Craig
Masback, executive director of USA Track &AMP; Field, said Monday
night. ``USATF objects to the IAAF suspensions and will not enforce
them.
	   ``U.S. athletes are entitled to a full and fair hearing prior to
being declared ineligible to compete. USATF has on several
occasions informed the IAAF of its obligations under the Amateur
Sports Act. Therefore, we are outraged that the IAAF knowingly
breached our confidentiality rules, which were put in place to
protect those ultimately determined to be innocent.''
	   The International Amateur Athletic Federation disclosed the
indefinite suspensions Monday.
	   Masback said that Barnes and Mitchell would ``receive the full
support of USATF until such time as it is determined that they have
committed a doping offense.''
	   Barnes, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist and the world indoor and
outdoor record-holder, and Mitchell, the 1992 Olympic bronze
medalist in the 100 meters, were cited by the IAAF for failing
out-of-competition drug tests April 1.
	   Barnes, who could face a life suspension for a second offense,
was tested in Charleston, West Virginia, and Mitchell in
Gainesville, Florida.
	   Mitchell is president of USATF's Athletes Advisory Committee,
the athletes' voice in the national governing body, which has taken
a strong stance against drugs.
	   His suspension was handed down last week and represents his
first drug offense.
	   The IAAF did not officially announce the suspensions, and the
precise terms of the punishment have yet to be determined.
	   These are two of the most prominent suspensions in track and
field, following Ben Johnson at the 1988 Olympics, Butch Reynolds
in 1990 and Mary Slaney in 1997.
	   Johnson is banned for life after two suspensions, but has
requested reinstatement. Reynolds served a 27-month suspension and
now is competing. Slaney was found innocent after several months
and also is running again.
	   The suspensions come at a time when International Olympic
Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch has suggested some
performance-enhancing drugs be stricken from the list of banned
substances.
	   They also come as U.S. track and field is seeking to regain its
prestige and reputation but has had difficulty attracting sponsors
and television coverage.
	   In determining an athlete's drug test, the IAAF examines a urine
sample twice. Spokesman Giorgio Reneiri said from Monaco that only
the A sample from Barnes and Mitchell have been tested. However,
that is sufficient to levy a suspension.
	   If the B samples are positive, the IAAF then rules on the
severity of the punishment pending a hearing by USATF. If the B
sample is negative, the athletes are cleared.
	   Barnes was first suspended for two years starting in 1991 for
the steroid methyltestosterone at a meet in Malmo, Sweden, in 1990.
This time, the substance is androstenedione, a banned nutritional
supplement.
	   Mitchell tested positive for testosterone. If found guilty
following the B sample, he probably would receive a two-year ban.
	   Reneiri did not know the testosterone level in Mitchell's
sample. The allowable ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone
(another natural substance) is 6:1. Anything above that level
merits an investigation.
	   Mitchell's suspension was handed down last week, after he
finished fifth in the Goodwill Games 100 and ran on the winning
U.S. 400-meter relay team. If Mitchell is banned, he and the relay
team of Jon Drummond, Tim Harden and Maurice Greene would be
disqualified and forced to refund all prize money from the meet.
	   Mitchell was entered in the U.S. Open at Edwardsville, Illinois,
Saturday night, but the IAAF would not allow him to compete.
	   The IAAF said Mitchell responded recently to a request for an
explanation for the failed drug test.
	   ``The explanation was received and the doping commission decided
to suspend the athlete,'' Reneiri said.
	   Barnes and Mitchell were not immediately available for comment.
	   Barnes, 32, set the world indoor record of 74 feet, 4\ inches
(22.66 meters), in 1989 and the world outdoor record of 75-10\
(23.12 meters) in 1990. He was the Olympic silver medalist in 1988,
the world championship silver medalist in 1993 and bronze medalist
in 1995.
	   Mitchell, 32, had his best season in 1994 when he ran under 10
seconds five times in six weeks. He finished fourth in the 1988 and
1996 Olympics.

Cambodian opposition military leader says fighting will continue

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A general loyal to deposed Cambodian
co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh accused election officials
Tuesday of cheating for Hun Sen's party and said he would continue
to lead armed resistance to the government.
	   ``There's just too much cheating going on. I can't accept the
outcome,'' Gen. Nhek Bunchhay said in a telephone interview with
The Associated Press. ``This means our troops will continue to
fight Hun Sen's forces.''
	   Nhek Bunchhay and a few hundred troops loyal to Ranariddh have
holed up on a near-impregnable plateau near the Thai border since
last August, one month after Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh in a bloody
coup.
	   Despite repeated offensives by Hun Sen's forces, Nhek Bunchhay
and his men have successfully held their ground.
	   Nhek Bunchhay said that though official results of Sunda's
election were not yet in, it was apparent that the vote counting
was rigged to give Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party the victory.
	   ``I have received reports that in many places, representatives
from the opposition parties were forced to leave the area where the
counting was taking place,'' he said.
	   A senior Thai army officer stationed along the Cambodian border
said Thailand's unofficial recognition of Nhek Bunchhay's forces
could end after the election if the result is recognized by the
international community.

Deutsche Telekom reports higher profits for first half
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German telecommunications giant Deutsche
Telekom's net profit rose 18 percent to 1.95 billion marks (dlrs
1.1 billion) in the first half, from 1.65 billion marks a year
earlier, according to preliminary data released Tuesday.
	   Sales rose 4.6 percent to 34.4 billion marks (dlrs 19.3 billion)
during the six-month period to June 30, slightly below analysts
expectations.
	   Telekom also said it wouldn't set aside risk provisions for its
troubled cable-television unit for the first half because it
expects the regulatory authority to re-examine its decision forcing
Telekom to lower prices next year.
	   In light of the plans to regroup its cable operations, Telekom
said it will submit new documents to regulators, without
elaborating.
	   Telekom emphasized that the figures are preliminary and could be
adjusted when final data is released Aug. 27.

Zlatko Cajkovski, former star player, coach, is dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Zlatko ``Cik'' Cajkovski, a former
Yugoslav soccer star who became a renown coach in Germany and
launched the career of Gerd Mueller, has died. He was 74.
	   Cajkovski died Monday evening in a Munich hospital, his former
club Bayern Munich confirmed Tuesday.
	   Born in Zagreb, now capital of independent Croatia, Cajkovski
suffered from diabetes and had been in poor health for several
years. He also had a quadruple bypass operation.
	   In January, he had part of his right leg amputated.
	   A member of Yugoslavia's national team that won silver medals at
the Olympic Games in 1948 and 1952, the pint-sized, stocky winger
was considered one of the top players in Europe.
	   He coached in Israel and the Netherlands before coming to
Germany to study under Hennes Weisweiler.
	   Cajkovski led Cologne to the German championship in 1962, before
moving to Bayern Munich.
	   He guided Bayern into the Bundesliga, won the German Cup in in
1966 and 1667 and led Bayern to its first international title, the
European Cup Winners Cup in 1967.
	   He is credited with discovering Gerd Mueller, who became Bayern
Munich's and Germany's leading scorer of all time.
	   Cajkovski coached several other German clubs until retiring form
soccer in 1976. He has lived in Munich for decades.
	   The funeral will be held in Munich on Friday.

Zambia receives 2,000 Rwandese fleeing from Angola
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ The United Nations says about 2,000
Rwandan refugees have crossed into Zambia from Angola in the last
two weeks, fleeing renewed fighting between the Angolan government
and former UNITA rebels.
	   Martin Bucumi, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
representative in Zambia, said small numbers of Angolans, mostly
families with children, have also fled into Zambia.
	   Bucumi said Monday that the Rwandans, who earlier fled their own
country traveling through the Democratic Republic of Congo to reach
Angola, had come from Luao, a remote settlement in northeastern
Angola close to the border with Zambia.
	   UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, signed a peace agreement with the governing
party in November 1994, ending two decades of civil war that left
an estimated 1 million Angolans dead.
	   However, UNITA refuses to hand over its central highlands
strongholds to the government and there have been numerous reports
of renewed fighting.
	   President Jose Eduardo dos Santos said this month that the
country was in a state of ``undeclared war.''
	   UNITA vice-president Antonio Dembo denied that his movement was
behind the violence.

University, police bar students from holding pro-Democracy rally
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A planned rally by Iranian students who
favor democratic reforms failed to materialize on Tuesday when
Tehran University closed its gate to them.
	   A half-dozen students _ apparently an advance team _ stood
outside the gate for an hour before they were ordered away by
police.
	   One of the students was seen being taken away by police,
apparently for questioning.
	   University guards and plain-clothes police barred the students
from entering the campus, telling them they had no permit for a
rally. A busload of anti-riot police was waiting nearby, but the
police were not deployed.
	   The demonstration had been planned by pro-democracy student
groups demanding press freedoms and individual rights.
	   Such rallies have been violently disrupted in the past by
Islamic militants.
	   Tensions have been high in Iran amid a power struggle between
the reformist President Mohammad Khatami and religious hard-liners
determined to keep their grip on power.
	   Newspapers on Monday published a statement by university
officials saying that the student groups did not have permission to
congregate.
	   The students issued a statement in response, saying they did not
need permission because ``the university is the student-home, where
the students must have the right to defend the rights of the
nation.''
	   One measure of the tension over Khatami's efforts to liberalize
Iran involves the Khaneh newspaper.
	   Militants threw a petrol bomb at the paper's office on Monday
and then called editors to threaten further action if the paper
didn't change its policies. No one was injured in the incident.
	   The militants were angered because the paper recently published
a letter in which an anonymous young woman criticized the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
	   As leader of the 1979 revolution, he is called the Imam, and
portrayed almost as a saint. Criticism of Khomeini, who led Iran in
the 1980-88 war with Iraq, has been taboo.
	   But the young woman wrote to the paper: ``When I think of
Khomeini, all that comes to mind are the horrifying sounds of the
midnight bombs that used to fall on Tehran, and the blood of
thousands of innocent young Iranians who died in that war.''
	   She added: ``Do you call me to follow someone who has
transformed Iran into an international terrorist state with his
order to murder Salman Rushdie?''
	   Khomeini ordered Muslims to kill Rushdie for insulting Islam in
his novel ``The Satanic Verses.''

Apparent election victory proves Hun Sen is Cambodia's master
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GRANT PECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ By engineering an unofficial
election victory that appeared set Tuesday to win the blessing of
the international community, Hun Sen has proven once again that he
is the undisputed master of Cambodian politics.
	   After five years in the awkward position of sharing the
premiership, he looked set to again become the sole top leader,
with the title to match the power he has been wielding not very far
behind the scenes.
	   Hun Sen underwent an emergency appendectomy nine days before
Sunday's parliamentary elections, which his Cambodian People's
Party claimed to have won by a landslide.
	   Now 47, Hun Sen first became prime minister in 1985, heading the
single-party, Soviet-style regime installed by Vietnam after
Hanoi's troops toppled the genocidal Khmer Rouge in 1979.
	   He directed the country's transition to a free market economy,
and then helped his formerly communist party keep a grip on power
by forcing its way into a coalition government after placing second
in 1993's U.N.-supervised elections.
	   In 1993 as now, he cajoled other nations into letting him have
his way, knowing they would prefer at almost any cost to avoid the
possible violence of confrontation.
	   Few dispute that Hun Sen is one of the country's most astute
politicians. He likes to portray a human side _ he's hopelessly
addicted to cigarettes, has written a few score romantic ballads
and is becoming a golf buff.
	   Hun Sen is also widely believed to be behind a string of human
rights abuses, the latest to kill or frighten opposition members
before Sunday's parliamentary elections.
	   That his survival instinct would edge into brutality is not
surprising, since his university was the jungle and his teachers
the Khmer Rouge.
	   In 1970, as Cambodia started down the road that led to the
disastrous rule of the Khmer Rouge and decades of civil war, the
peasant's son joined the guerrillas at age 19.
	   Hun Sen was wounded five times in the bitter struggle against a
pro-U.S. regime and lost his left eye to an artillery shell April
16, 1975, the day before the Khmer Rouge marched into the capital.
	   Hun Sen _ who attained the rank of regimental commander _ has
not given a convincingly full account of his time with the Khmer
Rouge, whose revolution caused the deaths of as many as 2 million
Cambodians.
	   But there is no reason to believe he played a part in their
atrocities, and his June 1977 escape to neighboring Vietnam made
him one of the earliest high-ranking guerrilla defectors.
	   They formed a resistance movement that became the core of a
government the Vietnamese installed after they drove the Khmer
Rouge from power.
	   At age 27, Hun Sen was named foreign minister of the government,
which was host to a Vietnamese occupying army until 1989.
	   In 1985, Hun Sen became prime minister, a post he held alone
until the U.N.-supervised 1993 election. Although nominally only
``second prime minister'' behind vote-winner Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, Hun Sen made sure he kept control of the security
forces.
	   He used them to depose the prince in a bloody coup last year.

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's embassy in Washington has
sent letters to the finance chiefs of all 50 U.S. states and 15
major cities urging them not to impose sanctions on Swiss firms,
the government's task force on World War II said Tuesday.
	   The letter, signed by the Swiss ambassador to the United States,
Alfred Defago, and Thomas Borer, the diplomat who heads the task
force, was sent out on Friday.
	   Copies were also sent to all 50 state governors.
	   New York City and state earlier this month turned up the
pressure over deadlocked talks between Swiss commercial banks,
Jewish groups and lawyers for Holocaust survivors by announcing
plans to withhold business from the banks and, if no solution is
found, from other Swiss firms. Other states also have announced
plans for sanctions.
	   Last month, the banks offered dlrs 600 million for a settlement
of claims by Holocaust survivors. Jewish leaders claimed that was
far less than the more than dlrs 1 billion the banks should be
paying.
	   ``For us and our country, justice is a continuing process that
cannot be reduced to simple dollar amounts,'' the letter said,
listing Switzerland's efforts to address its wartime past and make
amends for any wrongdoing.
	   Those efforts include a fund to help needy Holocaust survivors,
an independent panel of historians reviewing the period and a
U.S.-led committee investigating Holocaust-era assets in Swiss
banks.
	   ``It is our hope that you will join with us in calling for an
end to counterproductive rhetoric and misguided sanctions that will
only serve to delay a just and lasting conclusion, in the interests
of the survivors of the Holocaust,'' the letter concluded.
	   It noted that over 400 Swiss companies have U.S. branches or
subsidiaries and said it ``would be a major mistake to risk this
productive relationship.''
	   In a personal letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton last week,
Swiss President Flavio Cotti called on the U.S. administration to
take decisive action against the sanctions.

TVM officials under investigation; Virenque denies taking EPO
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   REIMS, France (AP) _ Two top officials of the Dutch cycling team
TVM were placed under formal investigation by French authorities
Tuesday for the use of the performance-enhancing drug EPO.
	   Sporting director Cees Priem and team doctor Andrei Mikhailov
are now likely to be formally charged in the latest chapter of the
drugs scandal overshadowing the Tour de France.
	   TVM came under the spotlight when it emerged that EPO had been
found in the car of one of its officials in March.
	   Then, police found evidence of used drugs in a suitcase and
trash can during a search of the team's hotel in Toulouse and Metz,
though the nature of the drugs is still not known.
	   Rival team Festina has already been expelled from the Tour in
connection with the widespread use of the EPO.
	   Authorities in Lille said that Bruno Roussel, Festina's sporting
director, would likely be released Tuesday or Wednesday from the
nearby town of Arras where he has been held since July 17.
	   Festina physiotherapist Willy Voet was released Friday, but team
doctor Eric Ryckaert remains in custody.
	   ``The lack of collaboration of Dr. Ryckaert delayed his
release,'' according to judicial sources in Lille.
	   Meanwhile some Festina riders continue to deny ever taking EPO
or other illegal drugs.
	   ``Bruno Roussel never asked me if I wanted to take EPO under
medical control, and I maintain that I never took it,'' Richard
Virenque, the team's No. 1 cyclist, told investigating judge
Patrick Keil, according to daily newspaper L'Est Republicain on
Tuesday.
	   ``I never asked for doping products and I never needed them. I
have never taken amphetamines. I am going to follow the advise of
my lawyer and file a civil complaint,'' he said.
	   According to the paper, police are testing blood samples given
by the cyclists during questioning.
	   The results will be known in about three weeks, it said.
	   As the scandal grows, two former Festina cyclists, Emmanuel
Magnien and Gilles Bouvard have also been brought in for
questioning in Lille.
	   ``There is no doubt that all the former cyclists at Festina will
be interrogated,'' said main prosecutor Gerald Vinsonneau.
	   Neither cyclist is currently competing in the Tour.

Seven foreign ministers pressure Myanmar over Suu Kyi
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Seven foreign ministers met with
their counterpart from Myanmar Tuesday to press concerns about
human rights and ask for opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi to be
released from a police roadblock.
	   Suu Kyi has been stuck in a car on a rural Myanmar highway
surrounded by government security personnel. She was stopped Friday
on her way to a meeting with supporters.
	   The hastily arranged meeting with Myanmar Foreign Minister Ohn
Gyaw occurred on the sidelines of an international conference in
Manila, a statement released by New Zealand said. The ministers
were from New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Japan, South Korea, the
European Union and the United States, it said.
	   ``We conveyed our concerns about human freedoms in Myanmar, and
in particular for the security of democratic political leader Aung
San Suu Kyi,'' New Zealand Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said in
the statement.
	   Ohn Gyaw told The Associated Press that the ministers had asked
him to relay the request to resolve the impasse to his government,
and that he had done so.
	   The statement said the foreign ministers ``made it clear that
there is an urgent need to resolve the situation and allow Aung San
Suu Kyi freedom of movement within her own country,'' McKinnon
said.
	   He said Ohn Gyaw had agreed to report back to the group.
	   McKinnon said that while the issue already had been raised at
the conference, the ministers sought a separate meeting with Ohn
Gyaw because they placed great importance on finding a solution.
	   Myanmar has come under strong criticism at the conference,
particularly from the United States, but also privately by
Southeast Asian neighbors that previously had muted their comments.
	   Earlier Tuesday, the European Union said it is maintaining its
tough policy toward Myanmar because of continuing serious concerns
about the political and human rights situation there.
	   When Myanmar joined ASEAN in July 1997, the EU voiced serious
concerns about abuses by the military government in that country.
	   ``These concerns have unfortunately not yet been dissipated,''
Austrian Vice Chancellor Wolfgang Scheussel, the EU representative,
said. ``The EU has to maintain therefore, for the time being, its
common position.''
	   He said the EU was appealing strongly to Myanmar's government to
begin a dialogue with the opposition.
	   The EU and the United States maintain economic and political
sanctions against Myanmar.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, also in Manila for
the conference, said Monday that Myanmar's turmoil threatened the
stability of the region. She said the United States would hold
Myanmar ``directly responsible'' for Suu Kyi's welfare.

Saudi foreign minister in Yemen for talks on border dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Prince Saud
al-Faisal, held talks Tuesday in Yemen on a border dispute that
flared into armed clashes earlier this month.
	   Prince Saud was met at the airport by his Yemeni counterpart,
Abdul Qader Bajammal, who was in Saudi Arabia on Saturday for talks
on the dispute.
	   ``I hope my talks here will be as fruitful'' as the earlier
sessions, Prince Saud told reporters on arrival.
	   The two sides have agreed that the clashes should not be
repeated.
	   Prince Saud met with Bajammal at the Foreign Ministry and later
was to hold talks with President Ali Abdullah Saleh over lunch,
said a government official. He spoke on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   Three Yemeni guards were killed by Saudi forces last week on the
disputed Red Sea island of Duwaima. Saudi Arabia said its forces
fired in self-defense.
	   Yemen has long contested Saudi Arabia's claim to three Red Sea
islands, including Duwaima, as well as parts of the Empty Quarter,
a vast desert with potentially lucrative oil fields. Fighting has
occasionally erupted along their 2,000-kilometer (1,300-mile)
frontier.
	   In addition, the two nations have yet to demarcate a mountainous
border in the east.
	   Yemen has accused Saudi Arabia of setting up military posts in
disputed areas and claims Saudi border guards have entered Yemeni
territory and fired at Yemeni forces and civilians.
	   The Saudi government has not responded to the charges.
	   In 1995, Saudi Arabia sent 20,000 troops and hundreds of tanks
across the frontier before Syrian mediation secured a cease-fire
and withdrawal.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ McLaren has failed in its attempt to overturn
Michael Schumacher's victory at the British Grand Prix, FIA, the
sport's governing body, said Tuesday.
	   The July 12 Grand Prix ended in bizarre circumstances, when
Schumacher's Ferrari, leading by more than 20 seconds, crossed the
finish line driving down the pit lane rather than on the track.
	   McLaren, for whom Mika Hakkinen came in second, protested. It
lost, then appealed the decision.
	   The International Court of Appeal, which made the ruling, upheld
the original decision of the British stewards.

German parties present law-and-order platforms with eye to
</HEADLINE>
far-right &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES that union's policy on foreigners to be presented in
August &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative
union presented a tough law-and-order election platform Tuesday
that looks a lot like the program presented by the opposition
Social Democrats a day earlier.
	   With an eye toward the growing appeal of far-right,
anti-foreigner parties, both of the mainstream parties have sought
to project a tough-on-crime image and prove they are taking steps
to stem the tide of refugees and immigrants to Germany.
	   The platform presented by Kohl's Christian Democrats and their
Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, calls for
deporting foreigners convicted of crimes in Germany and for locking
delinquent youth up in homes when necessary to keep them out of
trouble.
	   The Social Democrats, who presented their program for ``internal
security'' on Monday, had the same proposals.
	   Kohl's union went further, however, by also demanding that
criminal youths be treated tougher and that the maximum sentence a
juvenile offender can receive be raised from 10 to 15 years.
	   ``We will take decisive steps against criminality and
violence,'' said Finance Minister Theo Waigel, who also is CSU
chairman.
	   The union's policy toward foreigners is to be presented in early
August, although the internal debate has been raging for months.
	   Kohl has nixed demands by the archconservative CSU to include
the statement ``Germany is not an immigration country'' in the
joint platform, but the parties are expected to call for limiting
the flow of foreigners to Germany ``as much as possible.''
	   The focus on law and order in this year's election campaign is
seen as a response to the growing appeal of far-right parties,
especially in economically depressed eastern Germany, where
unemployment hovers around 20 percent.
	   The anti-foreigner German People's Union won about 13 percent of
the vote in a state election in April with slogans such as ``German
jobs for Germans'' and ``Out with foreign bandits.''
	   But the tough positions put forward by the mainstream parties
drew criticism as well.
	   Wolfgang Gerhardt, chairman of the liberal Free Democrats,
accused both his coalition partner _ the Christian Democrats _ and
the opposition of ``performing a big publicity show.''
	   Greens leader Juergen Trittin, who hopes to enter government
after the Sept. 27 election in coalition with the Social Democrats,
accused them nevertheless of populism.

Sports minister says Samaranch denies softening stand on drugs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Samaranch-Knight phone call, new material
throughout, changes headline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ International Olympic Committee chief
Juan Antonio Samaranch has denied softening his stand on
performance-enhancing drugs in sport, Sydney Olympics Minister
Michael Knight said Tuesday.
	   Knight spoke to Samaranch by telephone on Tuesday as Australian
athletes and sports administrators protested over a Spanish
newspaper interview in which Samaranch said athletes should be able
to use ``harmless'' drugs that improved their performance.
	   ``Mr. Samaranch assured me the IOC's campaign against drugs in
sport would continue with full determination and vigor,'' Knight
said.
	   ``Regarding the comments attributed to him in the Spanish
newspaper purporting to draw a distinction between
performance-enhancing drugs which harmed athletes and those which
don't, he made it clear he believed there were no performance
enhancing drugs that did not cause harm to the health of the
athletes.
	   ``No such drugs existed is the way the president explained it to
me in the conversation.''
	   IOC medical commission vice chairman Jacques Rogge also moved to
hose down suggestions that Samaranch was softening his stance.
	   ``I spoke with him yesterday and I think there is a lot of
misunderstanding about what he said actually and the way it was
printed was a little bit inaccurate,'' Rogge told a Sydney radio
station.
	   ``President Samaranch is a keen defender of the fight against
doping and obviously for him there is absolutely no doubt there are
two reasons to have drugs on the anti-doping list _ one is to
protect the health of the athlete and secondly is all the drugs
that enhance performance,'' he said.
	   Rogge said what Samaranch wanted was to see if the list of
banned drugs could be simplified because there were some drugs and
compounds, put on the list years ago, which were no longer
considered a doping threat, such as codeine which was recently
removed.
	   Rogge dismissed suggestions that a planned January seminar on
doping to be convened by the IOC could see a major change in
policy.
	   ``The January seminar will be basically a big conference where
we have everyone around the table to see how we can improve the
fight against doping.
	   ``It is not going to be a conference to drastically change the
philosophy, the philosophy will remain the same but more I think a
matter of finding the best strategies.''
	   Earlier, Australian Sports Minister Andrew Thomson said it was
appalling that Australia's efforts to fight drug use at the 2000
Olympics had been undermined by Samaranch.
	   Samaranch was quoted in the Spanish newspaper El Mundo on Sunday
as saying the list of banned substances should be ``drastically''
reduced and that drugs which don't damage an athlete's health
should not be prohibited.
	   ``Doping now is everything that, firstly, is harmful to an
athlete's health and, secondly, artificially augments his
performance,'' he was quoted as saying. ``If it's just the second
case, for me that's not doping. If it's the first case, it is.''
	   Thomson said he burst into laughter when he first read about
Samaranch's comments.
	   ``If true it's the most extraordinary thing anyone has ever said
in elite sport,'' he said.
	   ``No one could understand someone coming here, the head of a big
movement, and making some strong statements about anti-doping, just
last April, and then uttering something that is apparently entirely
contradictory to it a few months later. It's too bizarre to be
true.''
	   Dual Olympic swimming gold medalist Kieren Perkins called for
separate lists of banned substances to be drawn up for individual
sports to take some of the confusion out the drugs in sport issue.
	   Perkins was cautious about Samaranch's comments.
	   ``I can only pray and hope that . . . he was talking about maybe
streamlining the IOC's list of banned drugs a little bit,'' the
triple world recordholder said.
	   ``I think the issue really is that we've got a situation where
the banned list is a very long list, it's a complex list and there
probably are a lot of drugs on the list which in reality aren't
performance enhancing in a lot of sports.''

Prosecutors allege those arrested in tax scandal took bribes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Senior officials of the Russian statistics service
arrested in a huge tax scandal also accepted 500,000 rubles (dlrs
82,000) in bribes from construction companies, a news agency said
Tuesday.
	   The head of the State Statistics Committee, his deputy and up to
20 alleged accomplices were arrested in June and charged with
helping big companies evade taxes.
	   Investigators accused them of manipulating economic data to hide
the real output of companies and reduce their tax liability, and
with selling classified information about rival companies'
performance.
	   The investigators said Tuesday that committee chief Yuri Yurkov
and Boris Saakyan, head of the agency's data processing center,
also took bribes to place orders for construction work.
	   Additional charges will be brought against the two men, a senior
investigator for the prosecutor general's office said, according to
Interfax.
	   No other details were given.

Russia launches Kosmos satellite

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia launched a Kosmos military satellite on
Tuesday, the Strategic Missile Forces said.
	   The satellite, launched from the Baikonur cosmodrome in
neighboring Kazakstan, will be used by the Defense Ministry,
Russian news agencies said.
	   The satellite will be put into orbit by a Zenit booster rocket.
	   This was the first satellite Russia has launched since July 10
when a booster rocket blasted off with a Russian Resurs-O satellite
and five foreign satellites.
	   That launched had been postponed several times because of
technical problems.

Warne says there's a slim chance he may not bowl again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Australian legspinner Shane Warne
says he has been told by surgeons that it's possible he may never
bowl again, but he hopes to be included in his state's cricket team
at the start of the season.
	   The world's most successful legspinner had major shoulder
surgery in May following Australia's tour of India. But he told a
dinner in Melbourne on Monday night there was a ``slim'' chance he
may not play again.
	   ``There is a slim chance of that,'' Warne said. ``It's a bit
daunting to think that you may never play again. The thing is no
other leg-spinner has had the operation.
	   ``It puts some people out for 18 months and some never return.''
	   Warne said he hoped to be back by the end of the year with his
Victorian state side but acknowledged it was unlikely.
	   ``I was told before the operation that if I had have kept going
I might have only had 50 percent use of my shoulder for the rest of
my life,'' he said.
	   Warne has 313 wickets in test cricket but has been worn out by
being Australia's most-bowled player, twice as much as most of the
other members of the attack.
	   That load has taken its toll in the last few years.
	   He will miss the September tour of Pakistan where the spin
duties will be shared by Stuart MacGill, Gavin Robertson and
part-timer Colin Miller. (djp)

with two cyclists under formal questioning
 &UR; TVM officials under investigation; Virenque denies taking EPO

<TEXT>
	   REIMS, France (AP) _ Two top officials of the Dutch cycling team
TVM were placed under formal investigation by French authorities
Tuesday for the use of the performance-enhancing drug EPO.
	   Sporting director Cees Priem and team doctor Andrei Mikhailov
are now likely to be formally charged in the latest chapter of the
drugs scandal overshadowing the Tour de France.
	   TVM came under the spotlight when it emerged that EPO had been
found in the car of one of its officials in March.
	   Then, police found evidence of used drugs in a suitcase and
trash can during a search of the team's hotel in Toulouse and Metz,
though the nature of the drugs is still not known.
	   Rival team Festina has already been expelled from the Tour in
connection with the widespread use of the EPO.
	   As the scandal grows, two former Festina cyclists, Emmanuel
Magnien and Gilles Bouvard Tuesday were placed under formal
questioning in Lille.
	   ``There is no doubt that all the former cyclists at Festina will
be interrogated,'' said main prosecutor Gerald Vinsonneau.
	   Neither cyclist is currently competing in the Tour.
	   Authorities in Lille said that Bruno Roussel, Festina's sporting
director, would likely be released Tuesday or Wednesday from the
nearby town of Arras where he has been held since July 17.
	   Festina physiotherapist Willy Voet was released Friday, but team
doctor Eric Ryckaert remains in custody.
	   ``The lack of collaboration of Dr. Ryckaert delayed his
release,'' according to judicial sources in Lille.
	   Meanwhile some Festina riders continue to deny ever taking EPO
or other illegal drugs.
	   ``Bruno Roussel never asked me if I wanted to take EPO under
medical control, and I maintain that I never took it,'' Richard
Virenque, the team's No. 1 cyclist, told investigating judge
Patrick Keil, according to daily newspaper L'Est Republicain on
Tuesday.
	   ``I never asked for doping products and I never needed them. I
have never taken amphetamines. I am going to follow the advise of
my lawyer and file a civil complaint,'' he said.
	   According to the paper, police are testing blood samples given
by the cyclists during questioning.
	   The results will be known in about three weeks, it said.

Chechnya criticizes Russian military maneuvers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechnya denounced Russia on Tuesday for
conducting military maneuvers near its borders designed in part to
quell disturbances inside the separatist republic.
	   The military exercises are ``an open demonstration of force,
which may destabilize the military and political situation in the
entire Caucasus region,'' the Chechen Foreign Ministry said in a
statement, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The military exercises began Monday and are scheduled to last
all week in an effort to better coordinate Russian forces in the
unstable Caucasus region, which includes Chechnya, Dagestan and
several other trouble spots.
	   The training includes exercises to fight terrorist attacks,
kidnappers and smuggling _ exactly the sort of incidents on the
rise in the region.
	   Several violent incidents, including an attempt to seize the
republic's TV broadcast center, prompted Chechen President Aslan
Maskhadov to declare a state of emergency last month.
	   The state of emergency expired Tuesday, and Maskhadov said it
would not be renewed.
	   Government patrols were keeping a tight hold on the capital,
Grozny, with checkpoints stationed every few hundred meters (yards)
around the city.
	   The government also issued a stiff warning to the fundamentalist
Wahabbi sect, which Chechen leaders have blamed for several recent
clashes, saying the Islamic group has two days to give up its
weapons. They also ordered two Wahabbi leaders to leave Chechnya.
	   ``We don't want blood to be shed or that young, inexperience
people die,'' Security Minister Aslambek Arsayev said on Chechen
television late Monday. ``To avoid bloodshed, we are giving them an
extra two days to lay down their arms.''
	   Chechnya considers itself an independent country since it
defeated Russian forces in a 1994-96 war of secession. But Russia
and the rest of the world continues to consider the republic part
of Russia.
	   Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko is expected to meet sson
with Maskhadov to demonstrate Kremlin support for the Chechen
president. A specific time and location for the meeting have not
been set.
	   Forces taking part in the Russian military exercises include the
Interior Ministry, the Border Guard Service, the Federal Security
Service, and troops stationed around Stavropol, 1,200 kilometers
(750 miles) south of Moscow.

crisis &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Asian and Western countries created a
forum Tuesday to try to reduce spiraling poverty and other social
costs of Asia's economic crisis.
	   ``Social unrest is now the most real threat to security in
Asia,'' said Kobsak Chutikul, a spokesman for Thailand, which
proposed the forum.
	   The Caucus on Social Safety Nets was established at a meeting of
the nine-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations and its
``dialogue partners'' _ a group of richer countries including the
United States, the European Union and Japan.
	   The year-old crisis has forced cuts in government social
spending, toppled businesses, thrown millions out of work, and sent
consumer prices soaring. The result has been unrest in much of the
region, especially in Indonesia, where bloody protests toppled
President Suharto in May.
	   Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said the social costs are
reversing Asia's economic achievements and ``inevitably threaten
the region as a whole.''
	   ``The social and economic dislocation, poverty, disease,
illiteracy, alienation, disorientation among our peoples would
surely lead to violence, rebellions, instability and insecurity,''
he said.
	   The forum will seek funds and coordinate programs to address the
social needs, Kobsak said.
	   Its first meeting may be held when ASEAN foreign ministers
attend the U.N. General Assembly session in New York in September.
	   Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Masahiko Komura also
urged ASEAN Tuesday to create a ``safety net'' for those in the
region who are most vulnerable to the impact of recession and the
structural reforms being made to remedy the crisis.
	   The International Monetary Fund has led multibillion-dollar
rescue packages for Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea, but the
recession, coupled with stringent conditions attached to these
loans, has worsened conditions for millions in the region's most
severely affected countries.
	   In April, the Manila-based Asian Development Bank arranged a
dlrs 500 million loan for Thailand to help finance a social program
to cushion the impact of the financial crisis on the most
vulnerable sectors of society.
	   The loan formed part of the ADB's dlrs 1.2 billion contribution
to the IMF's dlrs 17.2 billion rescue package for Thailand.
	   The ADB has said it hopes similar loans to co-finance a social
safety net can be made with other countries in Southeast Asia.
	   The region's financial crisis was triggered by Thailand
devaluing its currency in July 1997. This unleashed speculative
attacks on other regional currencies.

Serb forces encircle rebel stronghold in Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian guerrillas
counterattacked government forces near a major road that Serb
police recaptured after a two-month rebel blockade. More than
20,000 refugees _ some on foot, others on tractor-drawn carts _
fled their homes Tuesday to escape the fighting.
	   The Yugoslavian government's Tanjug news agency said Kosovo
Liberation Army fighters launched a strong attack late Monday near
Kijevo, just south of the highway linking this provincial capital
with Pec, 80 kilometers (50 miles) to the west.
	   Elsewhere, Serb police and Yugoslav troops sealed off the rebel
stronghold of Junik, 80 kilometers (50 miles) to the southwest
along the Albanian border.
	   The rebels are fighting for the independence of Kosovo, whose
population of 2 million people is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
Kosovo is located in southern Serbia, the dominant of two republics
that make up what remains of Yugoslavia.
	   Camouflaged government armored vehicles prowled the hills above
Junik late Monday, with loudspeakers demanding ``surrender,
surrender.'' But the Albanians refused.
	   Serbian police estimate that about 2,000 people were trapped in
the village, including about 1,000 ``highly trained'' KLA troops.
The rest are residents and refugees who fled recent fighting
elsewhere.
	   Reporters who reached Junik late Monday saw eight bodies near a
small stream. Police said they were shot earlier Monday trying to
flee into Albania from Kosovo.
	   On Monday, police regained control of the Pristina-Pec road from
KLA fighters, who erected barricades in early May. Police convoys
traveling eastward from Pec and westward from Pristina linked up
near Kijevo.
	   But on Tuesday, police were turning back reporters who tried to
drive along the road westward from Pristina, indicating the route
may not have been fully secure.
	   Fighting along the strategic highway, which bisects the heart of
KLA-controlled territory, prompted an estimated 20,000 Albanian
civilians to join the tens of thousands of others who have left
their homes since President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown
on Albanian separatists in February.
	   Albanian families, some on foot and others crowded on to
flat-bed carts pulled by small tractors, lined the road Monday
between Pristina and Pec, heading for KLA strongholds deeper in the
rugged mountains.
	   According to the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center, at
least five KLA members were killed in the latest Serb offensive,
launched Friday. The Yugoslav Army said in a statement that three
of its soldiers had been killed and five injured since Saturday.
	   Albanian analysts believe Milosevic wanted to deliver a blow to
the rebels before agreeing to future talks with moderate Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova on the fate of the province.
	   While the rebels admitted they suffered losses, they showed no
signs of giving in.
	   ``It's true that we have had losses during the clashes,'' Jakup
Krasniqi, a KLA spokesman told Albanian television late Monday.
``But the enemy has also had many losses _ both in people and
materials _ though they try to minimize them.
	   ``The KLA will come out of this Serb offensive stronger than
before,'' he said.
	   So far, the rebel organization has refused to endorse Rugova's
leadership because he opposes violence to gain independence for
Kosovo.
	   As fighting escalated, special U.S. envoy Christopher Hill
returned Monday to Pristina to continue efforts to cobble together
an Albanian delegation for talks with Milosevic.
	   Hill, the American ambassador to neighboring Macedonia, said the
new fighting ``simply increases the urgency of a political
solution.''
	   Milosevic has offered to restore Kosovo's autonomy, which he
abolished in 1989, but he opposes independence for the province.
	   The Americans and Europeans also oppose independence, fearing it
will lead to greater demands by the ethnic Albanians to unite with
Albanian communities in other Balkan countries, thereby
destabilizing the entire region.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Henri Ziegler, a wartime fighter in the French
resistance and a founder of the European airline consortium Airbus
Industrie, has died. He was 91.
	   Ziegler died July 23, Airbus Industrie said in a communique.
	   ``With the death of Henri Ziegler, the French and European
aeronautical industry has lost one of its founders,'' said French
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin after the former aviator's death was
announced Friday.
	   Ziegler was born in 1906 in central France. He graduated from
the prestigious Ecole Polytechnique and began his career as a test
pilot.
	   During World War II, under the code name Col. Vernon, Ziegler
participated in a number of resistance operations.
	   Following the war, he went to work for Air France, which he
headed from 1948 to 1954. He then worked for various aerospace
companies.
	   He helped found Airbus Industrie in 1970 and served as the first
director of the consortium that consists of Aerospatiale, Germany's
Daimler Aerospace, Spain's Casa and British Aerospace.

Japan says ASEAN recovery depends on implementation of reforms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Southeast Asian economies must push
through with difficult reforms for their economies to recover, a
senior Japanese official said Tuesday.
	   ``No matter how painful it may be, we must have the courage to
accomplish these reforms,'' Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs
Masahiko Komura told Pacific Rim foreign ministers. He said the
economic reforms were ``imperative to regain the market's
confidence.''
	   East Asia's economic plight dominated talks Tuesday between the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and its wealthier Western
and Asian partners, including the United States, Russia, China,
Japan, South Korea and the European Union.
	   In an unusual singling out of a country for criticism, ASEAN
members urged Japan over the weekend to quickly revive its
floundering economy to stop it from dragging down their own weak
economies.
	   Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, who is set to become Japan's next
prime minister, pledged to do so in a dinner meeting Sunday with
ASEAN officials.
	   Komura responded to ASEAN's criticism Monday by saying Japan
already has pledged more than dlrs 42 billion to help Asian
countries recover. Of that, dlrs 19 billion is Japan's contribution
to an international bailout of Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea,
while the remainder is generally indirect assistance such as trade
insurance and scholarships for Asian students studying in Japan,
officials said.
	   Japan ``is determined to continue its assistance as much as
possible,'' Komura said.
	   He outlined a number of points that Japan regards as essential
for the rescue effort, led by the International Monetary Fund, for
the embattled ASEAN economies.
	   These include providing trade finance for the private sector, as
Tokyo is doing via the Japan Export-Import Bank, and a ``safety
net'' for those in the region who are most vulnerable to the impact
of recession and the structural reforms being taken to remedy the
crisis.
	   Japan has been criticized by ASEAN and the United States for
delays in implementing reforms to stimulate its own economy.

Taliban insists aid groups move, reject U.N. mediation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ZAHID HUSSAIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A Taliban representative rebuffed
U.N. attempts to mediate a dispute between Afghanistan's
fundamentalist rulers and international aid groups, saying Tuesday
the issue was not the United Nations' business.
	   ``We don't have any problem with the U.N. We have a problem with
the (aid groups), and we don't want the U.N. to get involved with
this,'' said Qazi Habibullah, a high-ranking diplomat at the
Taliban embassy in Pakistan.
	   A day earlier, the United Nations handed the embassy a letter
requesting talks on the expulsion from Afghanistan last week of
some 200 aid workers who had refused Taliban orders to move into
war-damaged dormitories in Kabul, the Afghan capital.
	   Habibullah said his government had not yet formally responded to
the letter. He indicated that the request for talks would be
refused and said his government would not back down from demands
that aid workers move from homes and offices elsewhere in the
capital to the campus of Kabul Polytechnic.
	   Attempts to reach aid officials Tuesday were not immediately
successful. Most of the expelled workers came to neighboring
Pakistan, where aid to Afghanistan is coordinated.
	   The expulsions marked the climax of rising tensions between aid
workers and the Taliban religious army. The Taliban have imposed an
unusually strict version of Islam since capturing Kabul in 1996,
barring girls from school and confining most women to home.
International aid groups say they are committed to providing
education and other services to all.
	   Aid workers have said they want to resolve the dispute and
return to Kabul as soon as possible to avert a humanitarian
disaster for the city of 1.2 million, which has been decimated by
years of civil war. The 38 groups were providing food, clean water,
sanitation facilities and schooling, in some cases carrying out
U.N.-funded projects.
	   The dormitories where the Taliban government wants to
concentrate aid workers have no electricity or running water, and
walls and windows have been damaged by shells and bullets.
Officials have asked the aid groups to pay an estimated dlrs
800,000 to renovate the dormitories and the rest of the campus,
saying the costs will later be deducted from rent.
	   The aid groups say the dormitories are unsafe and uninhabitable
and that they can't afford to pay for repairs. They also fear they
will be vulnerable to kidnappings, or caught in the crossfire
between the Taliban army and opposition forces dug in north of
Kabul.

Myanmar's Suu Kyi visited by doctors, condition unknown

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi was
visited by her doctors Tuesday as neither the democracy campaigner
nor Myanmar's military government retreated from their four-day-old
highway standoff outside Yangon.
	   The visit by two of her personal physicians was reported in a
press release from her political party, the National League for
Democracy. It gave no details about her condition.
	   ``The provisions in the car, water and edibles, are nearly
exhausted. Before her health condition fails, the NLD party should
be allowed to proceed on their journey,'' the party statement said.
	   Suu Kyi, an aide and two drivers were stopped by the government
Friday morning 32 kilometers (19 miles) outside the capital as they
attempted to drive to the provincial city of Bassein to meet NLD
members.
	   Suu Kyi's freedom of movement has become an international issue.
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright berated Myanmar's
military government for its actions at a meeting of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations on Monday and said the United States
would hold the military responsible for the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize
winner's health and safety.
	   She said the repression in Myanmar was threatening regional
security and stability.
	   Suu Kyi has attempted to travel outside the capital three times
this month and the military has stopped her each time.
	   The military has said she is free to return to Yangon at any
time, but not to proceed on to Bassein. She has refused, and was
preparing to spend a fifth night in her white sedan.
	   The military has accused her of fomenting unrest and agitating
against the government. It accused the United States of ``carrying
out a witch hunt'' against Myanmar and ``acting as judge, jury and
executioner.''
	   The government has stationed an ambulance near Suu Kyi's car in
case she has health problems, but she and her party have said they
would refuse treatment from anyone except her personal physicians.
	   ``If she needs medical care, she must be brought back to her
house and not to anywhere else,'' the NLD statement said.
	   ``If anyone takes her to another place and anything happens to
her, it will be the responsibility of the person or the authority
concerned,'' the statement said.

Maritime rescuers seek 15 would-be immigrants missing at sea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGECIRAS, Spain (AP) _ Maritime rescue services searched
Tuesday for 15 would-be immigrants missing since their rudimentary
boat overturned two days earlier.
	   Five bodies were recovered and seven people rescued alive
Sunday.
	   Survivors told the authorities that the boat had set off from
Morocco heading for the southern Spanish coast with 27 people
aboard, Civil Guard spokesman Javier Cantifano said.
	   The single-engine boat ran into trouble because it was
overloaded and in bad condition, Cantifano said.
	   The number of people attempting to enter Spain clandestinely by
sea appears to be on the rise. About 2,000 illegal immigrants were
detained in all of 1997, only 400 more than the number seized
during the first six months of this year, Cantifano said.
	   Driven by poverty at home, thousands of people attempt each year
to cross the Mediterranean Sea from North Africa and enter unseen
into Europe. Almost all the would-be immigrants are men and most
are from Morocco.
	   Spain is a favored point of entry because the stretch of sea
separating it from Africa is only 15 kilometers (nine miles) wide
in places.
	   Most attempt the crossing in crude wooden boats at night. The
number of attempts rise sharply during the summer when seas are
calmer.

Two Serbs charged with burning Croatian flag
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSIJEK, Croatia (AP) _ Two Serbs from the former Serb-held
Eastern Slavonia have been charged with burning the Croatian flag
last month, the district attorney's office announced Tuesday.
	   The two _ Dusan Jankovic, 44, and Slobodan Desancic, 26 _ could
face up to three years in prison if convicted.
	   The defendants will remain free during the upcoming trial, said
Vjekoslav Puljko, deputy district attorney in Osijek.
	   On June 9, the two took the flag off the hospital in the village
of Bolman and burned it, the indictment said, according to the
state-run news agency HINA.
	   Thousands of Serbs left Eastern Slavonia after the region,
seized in 1991 by rebel Serbs, reverted to the government's rule in
January. Others stayed behind, ultimately accepting the
government's authority.

Russia expels three Japanese ships from territorial waters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia expelled three Japanese ships and their
crews on Tuesday more than two weeks after they were detained by
border guards near the disputed Kuril Islands, a news agency said.
	   A Russian patrol ships escorted the Japanese vessels and 15 crew
members from the Far East port of Yuzhno-Kurilsk and turned them
over to Japanese maritime security officials, Interfax said.
	   The ships' captains, who were charged with violating the Russian
border, remain in Yuzhno-Kurilsk. If convicted, they could face a
fine or up to two years in prison.
	   Both Japan and Russia claim the southern part of the Kuril
Islands, which were seized by Soviet troops at the end of World War
II. The dispute has prevented the two countries from signing a
peace treaty formally ending the war.

Congolese government orders Rwandan soldiers out of the country
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The Congolese government has ordered out
of the country the Rwandan soldiers who supported President Laurent
Kabila in his eight-month rebellion against the country's former
dictator.
	   David Kokolo Longo, a top defense official who made the
announcement late Monday night on state television, thanked the
soldiers for all their work.
	   The move comes two weeks after Kabila replaced his chief of
defense staff, the Rwandan James Kabari and installed a Congolese,
Celestin Kifwa.
	   Kabari was made an advisor to the president.
	   Rwandan soldiers were an important part of Kabila's rebel
movement, which eventually drove longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu
Sese Seko into exile in May 1997. Mobutu later died and Kabila
later renamed the country Congo.
	   Rwandan-Congolese ties have soured since then, as disputes have
flared over the way Kabila has managed the country and because of
security problems in eastern Congo, where Hutu rebel groups have
bases from which they launch attacks on the Rwandan government.
	   Some Rwandan soldiers remained in Congo after Kabila took over
the country, though it was not immediately clear how many were
still in the country when the order was given.

Thai finance firms nearing agreements with foreign buyers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai central bank governor Chatu Mongol
Sonakul said Tuesday that three or four small finance companies
have found foreign partners to inject new capital into the moribund
industry.
	   Chatu Mongol told reporters that the partnerships were awaiting
approval by the Finance Ministry. He declined to name the local or
foreign companies involved or to provide any details.
	   On Monday night, Chatu Mongol also had told reporters that ``in
the next two or three days, there will be a bank or banks that will
reach agreement with their prospective foreign partners.''
	   As a result of the worst economic crisis in Thailand's modern
history, the Bank of Thailand has sent 56 finance companies into
liquidation and nationalized four commercial banks and seven
finance companies, wiping out former shareholders' equity.
	   With bad debt nearing 40 percent of total loans and tougher
loan-loss provision rules being phased in by the central bank, Thai
financial institutions have turned to foreign banks for help to
recapitalize.
	   Earlier this year, ABN AMRO of the Netherlands acquired 75
percent of Bank of Asia, while Development Bank of Singapore
acquired 50.27 percent of Thai Danu Bank.
	   Nakornthon Bank, a small Thai commercial bank, said Monday it
was close to completing negotiations with three prospective foreign
partners.
	   A bank official didn't identify any of the prospective partners.
She also denied local press reports that Thai Danu already had
decided to sell a 75 percent stake to Standard Chartered and would
sign a memorandum of understanding with the British-based bank
later this week.
	   Chatu Mongol has reiterated that undercapitalized institutions
that fail to find foreign partners on their own face central bank
intervention.

Tugs fail to extract cargo ship stuck in mud in Lisbon port
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Attempts to free a Cypriot cargo ship
that ran aground in Lisbon port during a harbor pilots' strike
failed early Tuesday.
	   The 35,000-ton Ioannis M, carrying soya beans, got stuck on a
mudbank as it maneuvered towards a quay Monday without the usual
help of harbor pilots who guide ships into port.
	   The incident has sharpened the dispute between the pilots and
the government which has refused to negotiate, and last week
scrapped the law requiring ships' captains to hire a pilot.
	   After tugs failed to extract the Ioannis M from the mud at
high-water Tuesday, striking pilots warned that the vessel's fuel
tanks could crack open and spew oil into the Tagus estuary. It was
not immediately clear how much oil was on board.
	   A crane was lifting the ship's cargo onto two barges to lighten
its weight and increase buoyancy. A second attempt to free the ship
was scheduled for the evening high tide.
	   The port authority said the ship was sitting on the soft
riverbed, but the pilots' union claimed rocks could be concealed in
the mud.
	   The harbor pilots began their 14-day strike on July 21,
initially choking the flow of imports and exports by sea. The
repeal of the law forcing captains to hire pilots has since allowed
most ships to enter the country's ports unassisted.
	   The harbor pilots are demanding a pay hike, a risk subsidy and
the right to set their own working conditions.
	   Following widespread allegations of corruption among the harbor
pilots, the government this year placed them under the supervision
of the port authorities _ a move resisted by the pilots.
	   More than 90 percent of the country's 80 harbor pilots are under
investigation for corruption, extortion and criminal association,
according to the government.

Seven foreign ministers pressure Myanmar over Suu Kyi
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new 6th-9th grafs with U.S. and Japan ambassadors
to check on Aung San Suu Kyi's status, reports that she was able to
leave car for the first time; statement by Suu Kyi's party in grafs

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Seven foreign ministers met with
their counterpart from Myanmar Tuesday to press concerns about
human rights and ask for opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi to be
released from a police roadblock.
	   Suu Kyi has been stuck on a rural Myanmar highway surrounded by
government security personnel since last Friday, when her car was
stopped on her way to a meeting with supporters.
	   The hastily arranged meeting with Myanmar Foreign Minister Ohn
Gyaw occurred on the sidelines of an international conference in
Manila. The ministers were from New Zealand, Australia, Canada,
Japan, South Korea, the European Union and the United States, a
statement from New Zealand said.
	   ``We conveyed our concerns about human freedoms in Myanmar, and
in particular for the security of democratic political leader Aung
San Suu Kyi,'' New Zealand Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said in
the statement.
	   Ohn Gyaw told The Associated Press that the ministers had asked
him to relay a request to resolve the impasse to his government,
and that he had done so.
	   EU officials said the ministers had decided to ask the U.S. and
Japanese ambassadors in Myanmar to check on Suu Kyi's status.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, also in Manila for
the conference, said reports of Suu Kyi's physical condition were
encouraging.
	   ``She has enough food and water and medical attention. Her
health is OK,'' Albright said.
	   A senior U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said Suu Kyi got out of the car Tuesday for the first time. He said
that her colleagues hope to be able to talk to her Wednesday, after
driving past Tuesday and seeing her, but not being allowed to stop.
	   In Yangon, the Myanmar capital, a statement from Suu Kyi's party
said her doctors had visited her Tuesday, but it gave no details
about her condition.
	   ``The provisions in the car, water and edibles, are nearly
exhausted. Before her health condition fails, (she and her group)
should be allowed to proceed on their journey,'' the party
statement said.
	   McKinnon said the foreign ministers made it clear ``that there
is an urgent need to resolve the situation and allow Aung San Suu
Kyi freedom of movement within her own country.''
	   He said that while the issue already had been raised at the
conference, the ministers sought a separate meeting with Ohn Gyaw
because they placed great importance on finding a solution.
	   Myanmar has come under strong criticism at the conference,
particularly from the United States, but also privately by
Southeast Asian neighbors that previously had muted their comments.
	   Earlier Tuesday, the European Union said it is maintaining its
tough policy toward Myanmar because of continuing serious concerns
about the political and human rights situation there.
	   When Myanmar joined ASEAN in July 1997, the EU voiced serious
concerns about abuses by the military government in that country.
	   ``These concerns have unfortunately not yet been dissipated,''
Austrian Vice Chancellor Wolfgang Scheussel, the EU representative,
said. ``The EU has to maintain therefore, for the time being, its
common position.''
	   He said the EU was appealing strongly to Myanmar's government to
begin a dialogue with the opposition.
	   The EU and the United States maintain economic and political
sanctions against Myanmar.

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Monica Lewinsky is breaking her silence and
telling prosecutors she had sexual relations with President
Clinton, a possible prelude to a deal giving her complete immunity
from prosecution, legal sources say. In a nearly five-hour
interview Monday in New York, Ms. Lewinsky's account included
information considered relevant to Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr's criminal investigation of possible obstruction by Clinton
and others, but she did not say Clinton asked her to lie, the
sources said. Ms. Lewinsky's account closely tracked her lawyers'
proffer of evidence to prosecutors early on in the probe, according
to a key source. In that proffer, Ms. Lewinsky was said to have
admitted having a sexual relationship with the
president.(US-CLINTON INVESTIGATION.)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Setting the stage for more turmoil
in one of the world's most troubled countries, strongman Hun Sen's
party claimed a landslide victory Tuesday in parliamentary
elections while the opposition accused him of massive fraud. The
Cambodian People's Party shrugged off opposition threats to boycott
the new National Assembly and suggested a coalition. Opposition
leaders, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy accepted that the
official tally would resemble figures put out by the Cambodian
People's Party _ an acknowledgment of its grip on the levers of
power and refusal to let them go. Figures showed the ruling party
taking 67 of the 122 National Assembly seats, a commanding majority
in what had looked like a tight three-way race. According to the
figures, Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC took 42 seats and the Sam
Rainsy Party just 13. (CAMBODIA-ELECTION)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian guerrillas
counterattacked government forces near a major road that Serb
police recaptured after a two-month rebel blockade. More than
20,000 refugees _ some on foot, others on tractor-drawn carts _
fled their homes Tuesday to escape the fighting. The Yugoslavian
government's Tanjug news agency said Kosovo Liberation Army
fighters launched a strong attack late Monday near Kijevo, just
south of the highway linking this provincial capital with Pec, 80
kilometers (50 miles) to the west. Elsewhere, Serb police and
Yugoslav troops sealed off the rebel stronghold of Junik, 80
kilometers (50 miles) to the southwest along the Albanian border.
The rebels are fighting for the independence of Serbia's Kosovo
province, which is 90 percent ethnic Albanian. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ Armed men stormed into Hindu villagers'
homes in Kashmir and sprayed the occupants with gunfire, killing 16
people and wounding five others, police said Tuesday. The raids
marked the seventh time this year that suspected Muslim guerrillas
have attacked civilians in a predominantly Hindu corner of
Jammu-Kashmir, India's only state with an overall Muslim majority.
No one immediately claimed responsibility for the killings, but
police blamed the Harkat-ul-Ansar and Hizbol-Mujahideen militant
organizations. Both seek to separate Kashmir from India and unite
it with neighboring Pakistan, an officially Islamic
state.(INDIA-KASHMIR)
	   YUEYANG, China (AP) _ As flood waters roared through central
China's rich farmland and heavy industry center Tuesday, Beijing
called for a ``do or die'' effort to ensure the safety of millions
of people along the Yangtze River. With waters on the mighty river
continuing to rise, nearly 5 million people in five provinces were
mobilized to help ensure that anti-flood embankments held firm, the
official Liberation Army Daily said Tuesday. Floods caused by rains
that fell heavier and earlier than usual have killed more than
1,145 people so far this year. Almost a million people have been
forced from their homes in the three worst-hit provinces _ Hunan,
Hubei and Jiangxi. Zhou Ming, a spokesman for the Ministry of Civil
Affairs, said the death toll from flooding was expected to rise,
but not by a large margin.(CHINA-FLOODS)

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed generally lower
Tuesday, but both Japanese share prices and the yen rose on news
that former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa was ready to become
Japan's new finance minister. Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei Stock
Average of 225 selected issues gained 170.18 points, or 1.07
percent, closing at 16,114.54. On Monday, the average had lost
417.53 points, or 2.55 percent. The brokerage sector posted strong
gains amid expectations of accelerating business alliances and
mergers. In currency trading, the dollar was quoted at 141.94 yen
in late afternoon, down 0.40 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also
below its late New York rate of 142.41 yen overnight. South Korean
shares also closed higher after two striking labor unions decided
to resume talks with the government and employers over planned
layoffs. The Seoul Stock Exchange's Composite Stock Price Index
rose rose 5.53 points, or 1.7 percent, to 335.33. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A former premier and ruling party economics expert
was reportedly ready Tuesday to accept the job as Japan's finance
chief, triggering a rally in Tokyo markets. The decision by Kiichi
Miyazawa boosted efforts by incoming prime minister Keizo Obuchi to
piece together a Cabinet this week. Miyazawa had been reluctant to
take over the reins of the powerful Finance Ministry because he was
too old. But Kyodo News reported Tuesday that concerns over Japan's
severe economic crisis had persuaded him to accept the job of
lifting Japan out of recession and restoring stability to the
ailing banking system. (JAPAN-POLITICS)
	   LONDON (AP) _ The grandest name of British motoring,
Rolls-Royce, was shaken up Tuesday in a deal that will see two
German automakers each producing Rolls-Royce and Bentley models
early in the next century. BMW, which bought the rights to the
famous brand, will make Rolls-Royces and plans to create a new
Rolls-Royce company. Volkwswagen AG will keep the old Rolls-Royce
factory it just bought and continue producing the Bentley line of
luxury cars. VW paid 479 million pounds (dlrs 790 million) for
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd. early this month. But Europe's biggest
automaker didn't get the rights to the Rolls-Royce brand name and
logo, which were held by British jet engine maker Rolls-Royce PLC.
Rolls-Royce PLC announced a deal Tuesday to sell the Rolls-Royce
auto brand to BMW for 40 million pounds (dlrs 66
million).(BRITAIN-ROLLS ROYCE)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Southeast Asian countries asked the
world powers Tuesday for new financing and investment to lead a
regional economic recovery. But the United States, Japan and other
countries did not announce any new aid packages and said that
recovery will require Southeast Asian countries to persevere with
painful political and economic reforms. At the opening of annual
talks among the nine-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations,
conference chairman Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon,
said rich countries needed to inject new investment and assume a
leadership role in restoring economic vitality. He urged the United
States to replenish the reserves of the International Monetary
Fund, which has bailed out several Asian nations in the past year.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In the latest mega-merger to transform the
telecommunications industry, Bell Atlantic Corp. and GTE Corp. have
agreed to join into a huge company offering local telephone calls,
wireless services and Internet access. The agreement reached late
Monday was expected to be announced Tuesday morning, a source
familiar with the transaction said. The source said the deal was a
merger of equals and that each side would form part of the new
board. Bell Atlantic shares would be swapped to pay for the
transaction, estimated at dlrs 55 billion. (US-GTE-BELL ATLANTIC)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese financial giants Sumitomo Bank and Daiwa
Securities Co. announced Tuesday that they will form an alliance in
the investment banking business.
	   It was the latest move in a continuing consolidation in Japan's
financial industry following a series of financial deregulation
reforms, dubbed the ``Big Bang,'' aimed at invigorating the economy
by opening up markets to greater competition.
	   Sumitomo and Daiwa will establish three joint-venture companies
that will start operations next April, Sumitomo said in a news
release.
	   One company will be in the capital market business for corporate
clients, one will deal in derivatives, and the other will handle
asset management, company officials said. (JAPAN-SUMITOMO-DAIWA)
	   FLINT, Michigan (AP) _ Negotiators tried until early Tuesday to
work out the remaining disputes blocking a settlement of two
crippling parts plant strikes against General Motors Corp. as both
sides faced mounting pressures to reach an agreement. Top GM and
United Auto Workers negotiators both said a deal could come soon.
The Flint strikes have brought GM's North American operations to a
virtual standstill and have cost the world's No. 1 automaker an
estimated dlrs 2.2 billion. About 200,000 GM employees in North
America remained idled by the strikes. GM wants any deal to settle
the strikes in Flint, Michigan, near Detroit, to resolve festering
disputes at parts plants at Ohio parts plants. The union has argued
that it makes no sense to delay a settlement at Flint to reach
deals elsewhere. (US-GM-STRIKES)

Illegal immigrants try to escape from holding center in Sicily
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A group of illegal immigrants from North Africa
tried to escape from a detention center in southern Italy where
they were awaiting expulsion, news reports said Tuesday. Two made
it; about 50 were stopped trying to climb over a fence.
	   Police fired shots in the air to stop the escape attempt in the
Sicilian city of Caltanissetta on Monday night, the reports said.
No one was injured.
	   Another group of about 122 would-be immigrants at the center
went on a hunger strike Monday to protest their impending
expulsion.
	   Under the European Union's open borders policy, Italy is obliged
to send home the illegal immigrants, many of whom are headed to
northern Europe in search of jobs.
	   Also on Monday, five Tunisians stowaways died in a blaze aboard
a freighter docked in Genoa.
	   Port authorities theorized that they set the fire in hopes of
fleeing in the confusion. It was not clear whether the stowaways
were locked in the cabin when the blaze broke out.
	   Four more stowaways were in a nearby cabin, including a man who
reportedly lost two brothers in the fire. Three were arrested and
one escaped.
	   Warm temperatures and calm seas of the past weeks have
encouraged clandestine runs of boats packed with North Africans
seeking jobs in Italy or elsewhere in Europe.
	   More than 3,000 people trying to slip in by sea have been found
since July 1.
	   Italy has been trying to persuade Morocco and Tunisia to better
patrol their coasts.
	   An agreement was reached Monday with Morocco. Talks with Tunisia
were scheduled for Aug. 5.

Russian orchestra plays funeral march for back wages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The symphony orchestra in the northern Siberian
city of Yakutsk played a funeral march in the city's central square
Tuesday to protest five months of unpaid wages, a news agency
reported.
	   The musicians from the Yakutsk Opera Theater threatened to play
the march every day for two hours until they are paid, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The region's culture minister, Andrei Borisov, said that 2,300
artists in the region are in similar straits and said he would
resign Friday unless the federal government comes up with the
funds.
	   Officials in Moscow say they have paid out all they owe to
regional governments. They blame the wage arrears on local
mismanagement.
	   Russia has struggled in recent years to collect taxes and other
revenues, and has lacked adequate cash to pay millions of workers
on time.

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Ziegler role in Concorde, survivors, funeral
plans,

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Henri Ziegler, a wartime fighter in the French
resistance who played a major role in the creation of the
supersonic Concorde airliner, has died. He was 91.
	   Ziegler died July 23, Airbus Industrie said in a communique.
	   ``With the death of Henri Ziegler, the French and European
aeronautical industry has lost one of its founders,'' said French
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin after the former aviator's death was
announced Friday.
	   Ziegler was born in 1906 in central France. He graduated from
the prestigious Ecole Polytechnique and began his career as a test
pilot.
	   During World War II, under the code name Col. Vernon, Ziegler
participated in a number of resistance operations.
	   Following the war, he went to work for Air France, which he
headed from 1948 to 1954. He then worked for various aerospace
companies.
	   Ziegler played a major role in the creation of the supersonic
Concorde airline, which travels at twice the speed of sound and can
cross the Atlantic in just three hours.
	   He helped found Airbus Industrie in 1970 and served as the first
director of the consortium that consists of Aerospatiale, Germany's
Daimler Aerospace, Spain's Casa and British Aerospace.
	   He was survived by his wife and four children. Funeral services
took place Tuesday.

Expensive new tests set for defective jet fighter
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A major design flaw in Japan's next-generation F-2
fighter will require extra tests and repairs costing as much as 4
billion yen (dlrs 30 million), the Defense Agency said Tuesday.
	   The new tests will take an additional nine months but are not
expected to delay the high tech jet's scheduled deployment in March
2000, said an agency spokesman, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Japan's Air Self-Defense Force, which is now testing the plane,
said in a report last month that the F-2's wings flutter violently
when the jet accelerates while carrying a payload of anti-ship
missiles.
	   The shudder begins at the relatively slow speed of 600
kilometers per hour (372 mph), the report said.
	   In the worst-case scenario, the jet could even break up in
midflight.
	   The extra testing will push back completion of the single-seat
fighter's development to December 1999.
	   The Defense Agency spokesman said the extension will give
engineers time to find a way to strengthen the wings before the
jets are put into active service.
	   The aircraft, one of the most expensive fighters in the world at
16 billion yen (dlrs 115 million) each, has had a troubled history.
	   Development began in the 1980s, when Tokyo initially sought to
build a world-class warplane entirely on its own.
	   That brought a hail of criticism from Washington, which wanted
Japan to help ease the trade deficit by buying U.S.-made jet
fighters.
	   A compromise was reached in 1988, when the two sides agreed to
jointly design and build a new jet based on the United States'
highly successful F-16 Fighting Falcon.
	   Production of the F-2, which was called the FSX during
development, is headed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, maker of the
famous Zero fighter during World War II.
	   Lockheed Martin, which produces the F-16, and General Electric
will build parts of the fuselage and the engine.
	   The design is intended to enhance maneuverability by
computer-controlled canards sticking down from the plane's body. It
also uses Japanese-developed advanced carbon graphite wings.
	   The Defense Agency spokesman would not say which company's parts
were involved in the design problem.
	   Japan has already spent 1 trillion yen (dlrs 7.2 billion) to
develop the jet. It plans to buy 130 of the new F-2 fighters over
the next 10 years to replace its aging fleet of homegrown F-1
fighters.
	   The Air Self-Defense Force also flies a Japanese-made version of
the U.S. F-15 Eagle fighter.

President's party asks government to free more political prisoners
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SANG-HUN CHOE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Government officials have begun
screening hundreds of political prisoners for possible release in a
planned amnesty in August, the Justice Ministry said Tuesday.
	   The government has promised to set free a large number of
``prisoners of conscience'' to mark the Aug. 15 anniversary of
Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule in 1945.
	   But it has set a condition deplored by human rights groups.
	   Prisoners seeking freedom must first sign a statement
acknowledging past crimes and promising not to violate South Korean
laws again.
	   ``The statement violates the freedom of conscience and the
freedom of silence,'' said Nam Kyu-sun, secretary-general of
Minkahyup, a leading South Korean human rights group. ``It's a new
form of shackles.''
	   The statement replaces the government's decades-old practice of
forcing political prisoners to disavow their political beliefs
before they could be considered for a pardon.
	   Human rights groups estimate the number of political prisoners
in South Korean at more than 500. Many are students and factory
workers convicted of supporting communist North Korea.
	   The ruling party, the National Congress for New Politics, said
Tuesday that it has submitted a list of 300 political prisoners to
be considered for release.
	   The party also said it was asking the government to free 900
ordinary prisoners and drop criminal charges against 400 student
activists and other dissidents being sought by police.
	   Prisoners who may benefit from the planned amnesty include Woo
Yong-gak, 69, believed to be the world's longest-serving political
prisoner. Woo, convicted as a North Korean spy, has been held in
solitary confinement for 40 years, despite being partially crippled
by a stroke.
	   Woo is among 17 political prisoners, most of them convicted
North Korean spies, who have served more than 15 years and have
refused to disavow their beliefs, according to human rights groups.
	   The amnesty also is expected to affect some of the 150 Asians
who are serving prison terms for crimes committed after coming to
South Korea as alien workers, government officials said.
	   President Kim Dae-jung, who took office in February, was
persecuted by past military governments and imprisoned for more
than six years in the 1970s. He freed 74 political prisoners in an
amnesty in March. Critics said those pardons were merely cosmetic.

Saudi beheaded after victim's family refuses clemency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ A Saudi man was executed Tuesday for
murdering a fellow tribesman after the victim's family refused to
grant him clemency, the Interior Ministry said.
	   Mohammad Sayer al-Umeiri was executed in the holy city of Mecca
in western Saudi Arabia, the ministry said in a statement.
	   It said he was convicted of stabbing Mashhoor Mubarak al-Umeiri
to death after an argument. The statement did not say when or where
the crime took place, nor when the conviction occurred.
	   But it said that the execution was delayed until heirs of the
victim had reached the age of 18. That is the legal age in the
kingdom when a relative can decide whether to accept financial
compensation for a crime or demand punishment.
	   The statement did not say how long the delay was.
	   The latest execution raised to 20 the total in the kingdom this
year. Last year 124 people were executed.
	   Saudi Arabia's Islamic courts impose the death sentence for
murder, rape, drug trafficking and armed robbery. Executions are
carried out with a sword in public.
	   Human rights groups have criticized the executions, saying that
suspects do not receive fair trials, are denied lawyers and do not
have the right to appeal.

Serb forces encircle rebel stronghold in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with UN saying over 100,000 refugees in
Kosovo, more in nearby countries &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian guerrillas
counterattacked near a major road which Serb police regained after
a two-month rebel blockade. More than 20,000 refugees were on the
move Tuesday to escape the fighting.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency said Kosovo Liberation Army
fighters launched a strong attack late Monday near Kijevo, just
south of the highway linking this provincial capital with Pec, 80
kilometers (50 miles) to the west.
	   Elsewhere, Serb police and Yugoslav troops sealed off the rebel
stronghold of Junik, 80 kilometers (50 miles) to the southwest
along the Albanian border.
	   Loudspeakers mounted on government camouflaged armored vehicles
prowled the hills above the village late Monday, demanding
``surrender, surrender.'' But the Albanians refused.
	   Serbian police estimate that there are about 2,000 people
trapped in Junik, including about 1,000 are ``highly trained'' KLA
troops. The rest are local residents and refugees who fled recent
fighting elsewhere.
	   Reporters who reached Junik late Monday saw eight bodies lying
near a small stream. Police said they were shot earlier Monday
trying to flee into Albania from Kosovo.
	   On Monday, police regained control of the Pristina-Pec road from
KLA fighters, who erected barricades in early May. Police convoys
traveling eastward from Pec and westward from Pristina linked up
near Kijevo.
	   But on Tuesday, police were turning back reporters who tried to
drive along the road westward from Pristina, indicating the route
was not fully secure.
	   Fighting along the strategic highway, which bisects the heart of
KLA-controlled territory, prompted an estimated 20,000 Albanian
civilians to join the tens of thousands of others who have left
their homes since President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown
on Albanian separatists in February.
	   Albanian families, some on foot and others crowded on flat-bed
carts pulled by small tractors, could be seen Monday lining the
road between Pristina and Pec, heading for KLA strongholds deeper
into the rugged mountains.
	   The rebels are fighting for the independence of Kosovo, whose
population of 2 million people is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
Kosovo is located in southern Serbia, the dominant of two republics
that make up what remains of Yugoslavia.
	   In Geneva, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimated
there are about 100,000 refugees in Kosovo. Another 25,000 have
fled to Montenegro and 13,000 to Albania.
	   ``Unless it all ends,we're going to end up with a huge mess on
our hands and a major humanitarian disaster come winter,'' UNHCR
spokesman, Kris Janowski, said.

Turkish court sentences leading activist for separatism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Brushing aside an appeals court ruling, a
state security court on Tuesday affirmed a one-year sentence for a
leading human rights activist convicted of inciting racial hatred
through Kurdish propaganda.
	   Akin Birdal, who is recovering from an assassination attempt,
was convicted in a retrial ordered by the appeals court.
	   He was on trial for a speech two years ago calling for a
peaceful solution to end a 14-year old war between autonomy-seeking
Kurds in southeastern Turkey and government troops.
	   ``This is another attack on freedom of expression,'' said Nazmi
Gur, a senior official at the independent Human Rights Association.
	   Birdal is a prominent campaigner against to torture and the
army's forced evacuation of Kurdish villages in southeastern
Turkey. He heads the Human Rights Association.
	   In May, he was shot six times ultra-nationalist gunmen who
apparently considered him too sympathetic to Kurds.
	   The appeals court overturned Birdal's first conviction and
one-year sentence, saying his speech was not a crime, and ordered
the retrial. The appeals court will review the results of the
retrial, a process that could take up to a year.

Government announces new economic measures as part of reforms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan will cut customs duties and other
taxes but impose a value added tax as part of reforms designed to
improve relations with the International Monetary Fund.
	   Customs duties that range from 5 percent to 250 percent will be
brought to a maximum of 80 percent within six months, said
Abdel-Wahab Osman, minister for finance and economic planning.
	   The government will cut several other taxes but impose a value
added tax of 10 percent, he said Monday. Some commodities like gum
arabic, a major Sudanese export, will be exempted, he said.
	   The reforms are designed to help Sudan enter the World Trade
Organization and improve relations with the Washington-based IMF,
which Sudan owes dlrs 1.7 billion. The government pays off its
arrears to the IMF at a rate of about dlrs 2.5 million a month.
	   But the reforms and potentially higher taxes have the potential
to unleash unrest in Sudan, one of the world's poorest countries.
	   Some economic indicators, like growth and inflation, have
improved as a result of the recent reforms, but even basic goods
are often beyond the reach of average Sudanese.
	   ``We have made a commitment ... that these measures will add no
burden on our people,'' Osman told the news conference.

Palestinians, Israelis to resume peace talks Tuesday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Talks on Israel's overdue West Bank troop
withdrawal were scheduled to resume Tuesday, but expectations of a
breakthrough were low.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, speaking on the Voice
of Palestine radio, called reported Israeli proposals for sharing
security control of a small area of the West Bank ``diversions.''
	   ``We will not take them seriously,'' he said. But Erekat said
the Palestinians had agreed to resume talks because Israeli
negotiators had called and said they wanted to ``present ideas.''
	   Erekat reiterated that the Palestinians would not consider any
proposals that were not in line with a U.S. initiative calling for
an Israeli withdrawal from an additional 13 percent of the West
Bank.
	   Israel has refused to accept the American initiative, and talks
on the long overdue withdrawal have been deadlocked for months.
	   Israel has balked at turning over more than 10 percent more of
the West Bank to the Palestinians before a final peace settlement
is reached. But Israeli media reports said Israel was proposing
sharing security control with the Palestinians in another 3 percent
on land in the Judean Desert. Israel reportedly wants the land to
be a nature reserve where the Palestinians would be prohibited from
building _ an idea the Palestinians have rejected.

Debts mounting at Russia's huge electricity monopoly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Unpaid bills are mounting at Russia's huge,
state-owned electricity monopoly, despite government promises to
get tough with customers who do not pay their bills, company
officials said Tuesday.
	   Consumer debts to Unified Energy System soared by 26 percent
this year to 129 billion rubles (dlrs 20 billion) at the beginning
of July, said Alexander Remyozov, deputy chairman of the board.
	   Unified Energy Systems controls most of Russia's electricity
distribution, and has long been at the center of the country's
enormous non-payments crisis, being at once debtor and creditor to
hundreds of public and private companies throughout Russia.
	   Earlier this year, the government appointed former First Deputy
Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais to head the company, which was
created out of the Soviet-era administrative system and has changed
little since.
	   Rather than help Chubais, the government has contributed to the
company's problems.
	   Viktor Ott, the first deputy minister for fuel and energy, said
43 percent of all consumer debts to UES were from government-funded
agencies.
	   In other economic news Tuesday, the Central Bank said that 363
of the 615 Russian commercial banks with registered capital of less
than 1 million ECUs (dlrs 1.1 million) are in financial trouble.
	   These banks must either close or merge with more stable
financial institutions by Jan. 1, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.

South Africa warns of Angolan `disaster'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Zambia-Angola-Refugees &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The fraying of Angola's peace
process could result in a disaster for all of southern Africa,
South Africa said on Tuesday.
	   Relations between Angola's government and former rebel movement
UNITA are reaching a crisis point and observers fear a renewed
outbreak of a civil war that ended with 1994 peace accords in the
Zambian capital Lusaka.
	   Last week about 200 people were massacred in the small diamond
mining village of Bula, about 250 miles (400 kilometers) east of
Luanda, according to reports cited by U.N. officials. Survivors
allege the attackers were from UNITA, but the former guerrilla
group has denied the accusations.
	   Several thousand refugees have begun trickling into neighboring
Zambia, says the United Nations, which is sending an emergency
mediator to the country.
	   ``This is a disastrous situation,'' South Africa's deputy
foreign minister, Aziz Pahad, told a parliamentary foreign affairs
committee.
	   A renewal of conflict could lead to a refugee crisis and the
further destruction of what little infrastructure remains, Pahad
added.
	   ``It will (have an) impact on the whole economic thinking ... of
how we develop the region,'' he said.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ runs diamond mining operations in
Lunda Norte, where Bula is located. The diamonds provide the
movement with hundreds of millions of dollars annually, analysts
say.
	   The United Nations has banned UNITA's diamond exports as part of
sanctions that came into force when the former rebels failed to
abide by terms of the Lusaka peace plan.
	   Pahad harshly criticized UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, saying the
former ally of the apartheid state had failed to disarm all his
troops or hand over territory as had been agreed.
	   Further negotiations with Savimbi were pointless, he said, and
would only lead to more delays. ``The issues are quite clear. We
don't want to give any more excuses for more delaying,'' he said.
	   UNITA refuses to hand over its central highland strongholds to
the government, alleging that police have committed human rights
abuses in areas already handed over.
	   Angola is a vast country in the southwest of the continent,
sparsely populated but rich in natural resources. Civil wars since
independence from Portugal in 1975 have devastated its economy and
costs hundreds of thousands of lives.

	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ The body of a slain Jesuit
priest was discovered Tuesday in a puddle of blood and with a
bullet through his head, a police spokesman said.
	   Rev. Michel Halbecq was shot to death sometime during the night
at the dormitory of the St. Ignace Jesuit mission in the capital of
Brazzaville, the police spokesman said on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   Halbecq's naked body was discovered just after midnight. His
remains will be sent to Paris via neighboring Cameroon, the
spokesman said.
	   French diplomats are assisting in an investigation into the
killing.
	   Nothing was stolen from Halbecq, said Zola Bouebassihou, a
novice Jesuit who is studying at St. Ignace.

Japan's first discount airline set for takeoff
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's first discount airline received a license
Tuesday to begin operations, opening the way for the country's
first fare wars _ and relief for its beleaguered consumers.
	   The Ministry of Transport granted the license to Skymark
Airlines to fly between Tokyo and the southern city of Fukuoka
starting Sept. 13.
	   For 45 years, Japan has had only three main airlines: All Nippon
Airways, the formerly government-owned Japan Airlines and Japan Air
System.
	   They formed a comfortable arrangement that is typical of many
industries in Japan that aren't exposed to foreign competition,
offering exactly the same prices and no discounts.
	   Skymark will try to grab market share by charging 13,700 yen
(dlrs 100) for a one-way ticket between the cities _ half the
current cost.
	   The new airline will try to cut costs by copying many of the
practices of U.S. carriers, such as reducing turnaround times
between flights and leasing its U.S.-made Boeing 767 airplanes.
	   Skymark's majority owner, ticket discounter HIS Co., also brings
cost-saving and marketing expertise to the business.
	   Chairman Hideo Sawada said Tuesday the airline may soon expand
service to other destinations, including the northern island
Hokkaido and the popular resort spot of Okinawa to the south.
	   While he said other airlines will likely respond by cutting
airfares, Sawada expects a profit by the year 2000.
	   The airline was formed in 1996 after Japan started loosening
regulations as part of sweeping liberalization promised by Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.

Four men killed in gangland-style slayings in Swiss tea room
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds; RECASTS, ADDS detail. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Four men were shot to death in a
gangland-style attack on a tea room in the diplomatic quarter of
the ordinarily placid Swiss capital, police said Tuesday.
	   The attackers escaped, said a police spokesman. Officers found
the bodies of the men who had been ``mown down,'' lying in the back
of the Safari Tea Room.
	   Neighbors called police late Monday evening when they heard the
windows breaking at the tea room, a 10-minute walk from the main
railroad station in the city center. The Italian consulate and the
Ghana and Jordan embassies are among other tenants of the building.
	   Federal prosecutor spokesman Juerg Blaser said there appeared to
be no connection between the slayings and the diplomatic missions.
	   Police said they had yet to identify the victims and didn't have
any immediate reason for the killings. Witnesses said they saw
three or four men at the tea room at the time of the attack.
	   Bloody footprints could be seen Tuesday on the stairs to the
basement toilets.
	   The tea room, which had been closed for two months due to a
change of ownership, was to reopen Tuesday under the management of
a Turkish woman, police said.
	   Up to 40 police officers have been assigned to the case, and a
number of people have been questioned, but no one has been charged,
police said.

Singapore security officers shoot at man with wife
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Two Singapore security officers fired Tuesday
at a man who had waved a knife at a border checkpoint, television
news reported.
	   The man was injured and taken to a hospital, the report said,
citing police.
	   The officers work for CISCO, a government agency within the
Ministry of Home Affairs. CISCO officials and police could not be
reached for comment Tuesday night.
	   The TV report quoted police as saying an Indian man was
confronted by three CISCO officers as he waved a parang, a type of
heavy Malay knife, while walking along the causeway that connects
Singapore and Malaysia.
	   In the ensuing scuffle, the middle finger of one officer was cut
off, it said. The other two officers then fired several rounds with
their service revolvers, including two warning shots, it added.

Nuclear reactors to be removed from Moscow's Kurchatov Institute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Nuclear reactors will be removed from one of
Russia's leading nuclear research centers, the Kurchatov Research
Institute, and a high technology center created in its place, a
news agency said Tuesday.
	   The seven nuclear reactors and a large amount of radioactive
waste will be removed from the institute in Moscow over several
years, Interfax said, quoting Yevgeny Velikhov, the institute's
president.
	   The Kurchatov Institute, which pioneered the Soviet Union's
nuclear program, is one of the most radioactive sites in the
Russian capital. The institute is located in central Moscow near
residential areas.
	   In the first seven-year stage of the project, the three most
dangerous reactors will be taken outside of Moscow and 3,500 to
4,000 cubic meters (4,200 to 4,800 cubic yards) of radioactive
waste will be recycled, Velikhov said.
	   The clean-up will cost an estimated 750 million rubles (dlrs 121
million), to be paid by the institute, the federal government and
the city, he said.
	   The institute wants to keep its first reactor as a museum
exhibit, he said.
	   The new high technology center would study telecommunications,
biotechnology and medicine, Interfax said.

Arrests made in slaying of German nun in South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Police on Tuesday arrested two men
in the slaying of a Roman Catholic nun who ran a school near this
southeastern city.
	   Officers were searching for a third suspect in the killing of
Sister Theodelind Schreck, a German citizen, said Bala Naidoo, a
police spokeswoman.
	   Schreck, 57, disappeared while driving on a remote road
Wednesday. Police found her car in a poor area near Durban, and
discovered her body on Sunday near the Holy Childhood Convent
School in Eshowe, about 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of the
city.
	   She had been fatally shot, and police said she apparently was
the victim of a robbery. The arrested suspects were 17 and 23,
though no further information on them was available.
	   Schreck was a native of Gissigheim, Germany. She had worked
since 1970 at the school, the first in the region to admit students
of all races during the apartheid era.

Cambodians cautious about poll results, but fear future conflict
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodians reacted cautiously
Tuesday to reports that the party of strongman Hun Sen won
parliamentary elections, but expressed fears that refusal by
opposition parties to recognize the poll results may lead to more
conflicts.
	   The national body supervising the elections has not released an
official tally yet, but Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party claimed
in its own report that it has won 67 out of 122 seats in the
National Assembly.
	   ``It is hard for me to believe this. I don't think it is
accurate,'' said Nhean Buntha, a 27-year-old motorcycle taxi
driver. Observers watching counting Monday in Phnom Penh had seen
votes spread fairly evenly among the top three candidates.
	   Nhean Buntha said he learned about the results from a friend who
had a copy of the ruling party's tally report.
	   The unofficial report, copies of which circulated in the capital
Tuesday, have triggered protests from Hun Sen's main challengers,
deposed co-prime minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy.
	   Both opposition leaders claimed there were irregularities in the
ballot counting procedures.
	   The capital was largely normal. The streets bustled with small
motorbikes roaring past stately cyclo-pousses, a hybrid between a
bicycle and rickshaw. Buddhist monks made their daily begging
rounds and there was no visible increase in security.
	   During the sometimes tense campaign period before Sunday's
election, Cambodians had stocked up on rice and other essentials,
fearful that Hun Sen might call out the army if he lost the
election. That possibility diminished with the CPP's claimed
victory.
	   The CPP tally report suggested that Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party
has garnered 42 seats, followed by 13 for the Sam Rainsy Party.
None of the 36 other parties won a seat.
	   Ranariddh said his party was leading in the race, but
irregularities have put him behind archrival Hun Sen. He and Sam
Rainsy announced Tuesday that they rejected the results and
demanded that elections be rerun in certain places.
	   While they await the final official election results, some
ordinary Cambodians are concerned that any stalemate in creating a
new coalition government might trigger new bloodshed between
conflicting parties.
	   ``I'm afraid that they may pick up arms and war may return to
Cambodia,'' said Sok Veasna, a 32-year-old resident who does odd
jobs ranging from construction worker to motorcycle driver.
	   Svay Sitha, a steering committee member of the CPP, said that
the present government led by Hun Sen would continue to rule the
country indefinitely if Ranariddh or Sam Rainsy refused to take
part in a new government.

University, police bar students from holding pro-democracy rally
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A planned rally by Iranian students who
favor press freedom and individual rights failed to materialize
Tuesday when Tehran University closed its gate, and ordered the
students to leave.
	   A half-dozen students _ apparently an advance team _ stood
outside the gate for an hour Tuesday before they were ordered away
by police. One student was taken away by police, apparently for
questioning.
	   University guards and plainclothes police barred the students
from entering the campus, telling them they had no permit for a
rally. A busload of antiriot police was waiting nearby, but the
police were not deployed.
	   Tensions have been high in Iran amid a power struggle between
the reformist President Mohammad Khatami and religious hard-liners
determined to keep their grip on power.
	   Islamic militants in the past have violently dispersed such
pro-democracy rallies, but they made no such move Tuesday.
	   Newspapers on Monday published a statement by university
officials saying that the student groups did not have permission to
congregate.
	   The students issued a statement in response, saying they did not
need permission because ``the university is the student home, where
the students must have the right to defend the rights of the
nation.''
	   One measure of the tension over Khatami's efforts to liberalize
Iran involves the Khaneh newspaper, which recently published a
letter in which an anonymous young woman criticized the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
	   Militants threw a petrol bomb at the paper's office on Monday
and then called editors to threaten further action if the paper
didn't change its policies. No one was injured in the incident.
	   As leader of the 1979 revolution, Khomeini is called the Imam,
and portrayed almost as a saint. Criticism of Khomeini, who led
Iran in the 1980-88 war with Iraq, has been taboo.
	   But the young woman wrote to the paper: ``When I think of
Khomeini, all that comes to mind are the horrifying sounds of the
midnight bombs that used to fall on Tehran, and the blood of
thousands of innocent young Iranians who died in that war.''
	   She added: ``Do you call me to follow someone who has
transformed Iran into an international terrorist state with his
order to murder Salman Rushdie?''
	   Khomeini ordered Muslims to kill Rushdie for insulting Islam in
his novel ``The Satanic Verses.''

Army says it repulsed rebel attack on border with Eritrea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's army spokesman said Tuesday that
government forces repulsed an attack by southern rebels on the
border with neighboring Eritrea.
	   The statement came three days after the rebel Sudan Peoples
Liberation Army claimed it killed at least 93 government soldiers
in fighting near the border late last week.
	   Sudan's army spokesman, Gen. Abdel Rahman Sirul-Khatam, told
state-run radio that government forces wiped out the ``hostile
troops'' and captured a tank.
	   He said the crewmen of the tank were taken prisoner. He gave no
other details of the fighting or figures on government casualties.
	   On Sunday, the SPLA said its fighters repulsed an offensive by
the army against its bases at Oulo, near the border with Eritrea.
The rebel group said it killed 93 soldiers and captured 10 others
in the fighting last Thursday.
	   The SPLA as been fighting since 1983 for more autonomy for the
south's Christians and animists from the Muslim north. An estimated
1.5 million people have died in the fighting and accompanying
famines.
	   The SPLA is allied with northern opposition groups in the
Eritrea-headquartered National Democratic Alliance. Northern
fighters have from time to time launched their own offensives along
the Eritrea border.

Palestinians, Israelis to resume peace talks Tuesday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Talks on Israel's overdue West Bank troop
withdrawal were scheduled to resume Tuesday, but expectations of a
breakthrough were low.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, speaking on the Voice
of Palestine radio, called reported Israeli proposals for sharing
security control of a small area of the West Bank ``diversions.''
	   ``We will not take them seriously,'' he said. But Erekat said
the Palestinians had agreed to resume talks because Israeli
negotiators had called and said they wanted to ``present ideas.''
	   Erekat reiterated that the Palestinians would not consider any
proposals that were not in line with a U.S. initiative calling for
an Israeli withdrawal from an additional 13 percent of the West
Bank.
	   Israel has refused to accept the American initiative, and talks
on the long overdue withdrawal have been deadlocked for months.
	   Israel has balked at turning over more than 10 percent more of
the West Bank to the Palestinians before a final peace settlement
is reached. But Israeli media reports said Israel was proposing
sharing security control with the Palestinians in another 3 percent
on land in the Judean Desert. Israel reportedly wants the land to
be a nature reserve where the Palestinians would be prohibited from
building _ an idea the Palestinians have rejected.

EU says too early to assess Cambodian voting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo ASEAN124 &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ It is not clear whether vote-counting
in Cambodia is proceeding fairly, the European Union said Tuesday,
although election day itself went well.
	   ``It is too early to have a final assessment,'' Wolfgang
Schuessel of Austria, the European Council president, told a news
conference during security talks between the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations and major world powers.
	   The EU has contributed dlrs 15 million and 200 observers to the
Cambodian parliamentary elections, meant to settle the political
leadership after fighting broke out last year between supporters of
the rival co-prime ministers.
	   The pre-election period was ``full of intimidation,'' Schuessel
said, ``with no free access to the media and punitive acts of
violence.''
	   He said the Sunday election went ``OK'' because of the high
voter turnout and only one major violent event.
	   ``Up to now, we don't have a clear message about whether the
counting of the votes is being done in a positive way,'' he added.
	   The vote counting began Monday and results are not expected
until next month.
	   On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told the
same international conference that countries must remain vigilant
after the election because the democratic process in Cambodia has
unraveled before.
	   Earlier, an Amnesty International representative monitoring the
ASEAN regional security dialogue said that one of the first acts of
Cambodia's new government should be to prosecute those responsible
for the scores of politically motivated executions over the past
year.
	   ``There is a concern about impunity,'' said the spokeswoman,
Donna Guest. ``No one has been brought to justice.''
	   She said the group is asking the new government ``to make an
initial step of good faith to the Cambodian people and the
international community, take a high-profile extra-judicial killing
and begin an investigation.''
	   She said this could include the case of Hor Sok, a senior
government official loyal to Prince Norodom Ranariddh. Hor Sok was
detained when Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh, his co-prime minister, in a
coup in July 1997. He was executed in the Interior Ministry
compound, according to human rights investigators.
	   Besides the coup-related killings, supporters of opposition
political parties were murdered in the run-up to the elections.
	   Guest said countries also should support the U.N. Center for
Human Rights in Phnom Penh, which is monitoring human rights while
Cambodian legal and other institutions are still in infancy.

Betis coach Aragones retires from soccer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEVILLE, Spain (AP) _ Real Betis coach Luis Aragones has retired
from the club and the game, a team spokesman said on Tuesday _ the
outgoing coach's 60th birthday.
	   Aragones announced his departure in a statement Monday night
after a four-hour meeting with the president of the first division
Spanish club Manuel Ruiz de Lopera, the spokesman said. His
replacement is due to be announced within 24 hours.
	   Stressing that he had no intention of training any other team,
Aragones cited ``personal reasons'' motivating his retirement from
soccer. He did not expand.
	   Aragones, who had coached Betis for one season, had a three-year
contract with the southern Spanish team.
	   The former Atletico de Madrid player coached the team during
three spells over the last 20 years. He also headed powerhouse FC
Barcelona for one season in 1988.

Serb forces encircle rebel stronghold in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS 2 grafs after 11th pvs to UPDATE with UN saying more
than 100,000 refugees in Kosovo, more in nearby countries. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian guerrillas
counterattacked near a major road which Serb police regained after
a two-month rebel blockade. More than 20,000 refugees were on the
move Tuesday to escape the fighting.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency said Kosovo Liberation Army
fighters launched a strong attack late Monday near Kijevo, just
south of the highway linking this provincial capital with Pec, 80
kilometers (50 miles) to the west.
	   Elsewhere, Serb police and Yugoslav troops sealed off the rebel
stronghold of Junik, 80 kilometers (50 miles) to the southwest
along the Albanian border.
	   Loudspeakers mounted on government camouflaged armored vehicles
prowled the hills above the village late Monday, demanding
``surrender, surrender.'' But the Albanians refused.
	   Serbian police estimate that there are about 2,000 people
trapped in Junik, including about 1,000 are ``highly trained'' KLA
troops. The rest are local residents and refugees who fled recent
fighting elsewhere.
	   Reporters who reached Junik late Monday saw eight bodies lying
near a small stream. Police said they were shot earlier Monday
trying to flee into Albania from Kosovo.
	   On Monday, police regained control of the Pristina-Pec road from
KLA fighters, who erected barricades in early May. Police convoys
traveling eastward from Pec and westward from Pristina linked up
near Kijevo.
	   But on Tuesday, police were turning back reporters who tried to
drive along the road westward from Pristina, indicating the route
was not fully secure.
	   Fighting along the strategic highway, which bisects the heart of
KLA-controlled territory, prompted an estimated 20,000 Albanian
civilians to join the tens of thousands of others who have left
their homes since President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown
on Albanian separatists in February.
	   Albanian families, some on foot and others crowded on flat-bed
carts pulled by small tractors, could be seen Monday lining the
road between Pristina and Pec, heading for KLA strongholds deeper
into the rugged mountains.
	   The rebels are fighting for the independence of Kosovo, whose
population of 2 million people is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
Kosovo is located in southern Serbia, the dominant of two republics
that make up what remains of Yugoslavia.
	   In Geneva, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimated
there are about 100,000 refugees in Kosovo. Another 25,000 have
fled to Montenegro and 13,000 to Albania.
	   ``Unless it all ends,we're going to end up with a huge mess on
our hands and a major humanitarian disaster come winter,'' UNHCR
spokesman, Kris Janowski, said.

Polish poet Zbigniew Herbert dies at 73
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDRZEJ STYLINSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poet Zbigniew Herbert, one of Poland's
most outstanding postwar writers and moralists, died in a Warsaw
hospital Tuesday. He was 73.
	   The cause of death was not immediately available, but a longtime
friend, fellow poet and critic Krzysztof Karasek, said Herbert had
suffered from asthma and serious circulatory problems for several
years.
	   ``He was the conscience of Polish literature,'' Karasek said.
``During the final two decades of communism he was a spiritual
support for us younger poets, someone who never changed his
views.''
	   An early advocate of reforms, he was linked to the democratic
opposition starting in the 1970s and became a Solidarity supporter
in 1981. Protesting communist policies, he left Poland in 1986 and
settled in Paris. He returned to Warsaw in 1992, three years after
the end of communism.
	   In his poems, Herbert discussed moral problems facing the
present generations, drawing broadly from the humanistic tradition
of European culture, its classic works and myths.
	   In many poems, Herbert presents Pan Cogito (Mr. Cogito), a
character representing rational views and skepticism about the
modern world.
	   Mr. Cogito makes moral judgments, but always supports those who
are losing or who are persecuted, Karasek said.
	   Born in Lwow, which then was part of Poland and now belongs to
Ukraine, he joined the underground Polish Home Army during World
War II. He moved to Krakow in 1944.
	   He studied arts, law and philosophy at Jagiellonian University
in Krakow, and the university in Torun.
	   Herbert published his first poems in 1950. During the Stalinist
era he was considered a ``class enemy'' by the communists and his
poems were rarely published.
	   In 1955-65, Herbert edited the literary magazine ``Tworczosc''
(Creation), and in 1965-68 the magazine ``Poezja'' (Poetry).
	   In 1970, Herbert lectured on European literature at California
State College in Los Angeles.
	   His main volumes of poetry include ``Hermes, pies i gwiazda,''
(Hermes, Dog and Star), published in 1957, ``Pan Cogito,'' 1974 and
the collection ``89 wierszy'' (89 Poems) published this year.
	   He also wrote dramas like ``Inny pokoj'' (Another Room) and
``Jaskinia filozofow'' (The Philosphers' Cave) and two volumes of
essays.
	   Herbert is survived by his wife, Katarzyna.

Airplane ordered back because of security breach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Officials at Hong Kong's troubled new airport
are investigating a lapse in which passengers were allowed to board
a flight without going through security checks, a spokesman said
Tuesday.
	   Flight CA652 of Taiwan's national carrier, China Airlines, was
ordered to turn back shortly before taking off last Saturday when
security guards discovered the breach. Airline staff allowed nearly
40 passengers from Kuala Lumpur in transit to Taipei to disembark
and walk directly into the departure lounge.
	   ``This was clearly a flagrant violation of airport security,''
said Airport Authority spokesman Chris Donnolley. ``The
responsibility for that incident rests squarely with the airline.''
	   Donnolley said security guards notified the control tower
immediately, and the airline was ordered back to the terminal
shortly before takeoff.
	   He did not say what measures the airport would take against the
airline, but said an investigation was going on.
	   Officials at China Airlines in Hong Kong said no one was
available Tuesday who could comment on the report.
	   All passengers going into the departure hall at Hong Kong's new
dlrs 20 billion Chek Lap Kok airport are required to go through
security checks. Transit passengers are required to disembark with
all others and have to go through another set of checks before
entering the departure hall.
	   Shortly after the opening of the airport on July 6, the Dutch
airline KLM revealed that one of its planes bound for Amsterdam had
taken off with the bags of two passengers who weren't aboard.

Swiss write to U.S. finance chiefs over sanctions threats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With US-Swiss Banks-Holocaust &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's embassy in Washington has
sent letters to the finance chiefs of all 50 U.S. states and 15
major cities urging them not to impose sanctions on Swiss firms,
the government's task force on World War II said Tuesday.
	   The letter, signed by the Swiss ambassador to the United States,
Alfred Defago, and Thomas Borer, the diplomat who heads the task
force, was sent out on Friday.
	   Copies were also sent to all 50 state governors.
	   New York City and state earlier this month turned up the
pressure over deadlocked talks between Swiss commercial banks,
Jewish groups and lawyers for Holocaust survivors by announcing
plans to withhold business from the banks and, if no solution is
found, from other Swiss firms. Other states also have announced
plans for sanctions.
	   Last month, the banks offered dlrs 600 million for a settlement
of claims by Holocaust survivors. Jewish leaders claimed that was
far less than the more than dlrs 1 billion the banks should be
paying.
	   ``For us and our country, justice is a continuing process that
cannot be reduced to simple dollar amounts,'' the letter said,
listing Switzerland's efforts to address its wartime past and make
amends for any wrongdoing.
	   Those efforts include a fund to help needy Holocaust survivors,
an independent panel of historians reviewing the period and a
U.S.-led committee investigating Holocaust-era assets in Swiss
banks.
	   ``It is our hope that you will join with us in calling for an
end to counterproductive rhetoric and misguided sanctions that will
only serve to delay a just and lasting conclusion, in the interests
of the survivors of the Holocaust,'' the letter concluded.
	   It noted that over 400 Swiss companies have U.S. branches or
subsidiaries and said it ``would be a major mistake to risk this
productive relationship.''
	   In a personal letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton last week,
Swiss President Flavio Cotti urged the federal government to take
decisive action against the sanctions.

Seven foreign ministers pressure Myanmar over Suu Kyi
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with additional comments on Aung San Suu
Kyi, party saying her food is running out &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Seven foreign ministers met with
their counterpart from Myanmar Tuesday to press concerns about
human rights and ask for opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi to be
released from a police roadblock.
	   Suu Kyi has been stuck on a rural Myanmar highway surrounded by
government security personnel since last Friday, when her car was
stopped on her way to a meeting with supporters.
	   The hastily arranged meeting with Myanmar Foreign Minister Ohn
Gyaw occurred on the sidelines of an international conference in
Manila. The ministers were from New Zealand, Australia, Canada,
Japan, South Korea, the European Union and the United States, a
statement from New Zealand said.
	   ``During the meeting, a lot of pressure was exerted on the
leadership of Myanmar to change their ways, their policies. I hope
this can have some impact,'' said Wolfgang Schuessel, president of
the European Council.
	   ``The blockade of Aung San Suu Kyi in the car is absolutely
unbearable.''
	   Ohn Gyaw told The Associated Press that the group asked him to
relay a request to his government that the impasse be resolved, and
that he had done so.
	   Schuessel said the ministers have asked the U.S. and Japanese
ambassadors in Myanmar to check on Suu Kyi's status.
	   Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy, said in a
statement Tuesday that her food was running out and that she should
be allowed to proceed before her health fails.
	   ``The provisions in the car, water and edibles, are nearly
exhausted,'' it said.
	   It said Suu Kyi's doctors had visited her Tuesday, but it gave
no details about her condition.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, also in Manila for
the conference, said the United States would hold the military
responsible for the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner's health and
safety.
	   ``Aung San Suu Kyi should be able to travel freely in her own
country,'' she said.
	   New Zealand Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said that while the
issue already had been raised at the conference, the ministers
sought a separate meeting with Ohn Gyaw because they placed great
importance on finding a solution.
	   Myanmar has come under strong criticism at the conference,
particularly from the United States, but also privately by
Southeast Asian neighbors that previously had muted their comments.
	   Schuessel said the European Union is maintaining its tough
policy toward Myanmar because of continuing serious concerns about
the political and human rights situation there.
	   When Myanmar joined ASEAN in July 1997, the EU voiced serious
concerns about abuses by the military government in that country.
	   ``These concerns have unfortunately not yet been dissipated,''
Schuessel said.
	   The EU and the United States maintain economic and political
sanctions against Myanmar.

Burkina official: Ethiopia, Eritrea to meet over border fight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRAHIMA OUEDRAOGO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Officials from Ethiopia and
Eritrea will meet in this West African nation over the weekend to
discuss ways to end their simmering border dispute, a foreign
ministry official said Tuesday.
	   Salim Salim, the secretary-general of the Organization of
African Unity, will mediate the talks, which will be the East
African countries' first face-to-face discussions since their
long-standing territorial dispute flared anew, according to the
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Fighting broke out briefly between the two countries in mid-May,
and in early June both sides bombed each other's territory. It is
believed several hundred people _ perhaps more _ perished before
the fighting that stopped in mid-June.
	   Both sides have massed troops along the contested portion of the
border, and the situation is at a stalemate.
	   Officials from Burkina Faso, Djibouti and Zimbabwe will also
help mediate the talks, which will be held Aug. 1-2, the official
said.
	   It was not clear, though, what officials would be coming from
Ethiopia and Eritrea.
	   The talks would come as something of a surprise since Ethiopia
has said it would never discuss the situation until Eritrea pulls
out of the disputed territory, and Eritrea insists it controls its
rightful land.
	   Ethiopia is demanding that Eritrea withdraw from Badme and
Shiraro, districts on the western end of the 600-mile border
separating the two countries _ that were one until Eritrea became
independent in 1993.
	   Ethiopia says it was Eritrea's invasion of the two districts on
May 6 that precipitated the crisis and subsequent fighting. But
Eritrean presidential spokesman Yemana Ghebreab calls Ethiopia's
sabre-rattling a ``bluff'' to maneuver the international community
into pressuring Eritrea to withdraw to get the two sides talking.
	   A United Nations mission to Ethiopia's northern Tigray and
eastern Afar regions said as many as 100,000 people had been
displaced by the fighting. Ethiopia puts the figure at 180,000.
	   Eritrea says 100,000 of its people have been forced to flee
because of the conflict.

Prime minister defends postwar reconstruction program
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HUSSEIN DAKROUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on Tuesday
defended his multibillion dollar reconstruction program, saying
Lebanese deserved ``to enjoy social security'' after their brutal
1975-90 civil war.
	   ``We will proceed with the development and reconstruction
process and secure the repatriation of displaced people as we have
promised,'' Hariri said in a speech before laying the cornerstone
for a new Lebanese University campus.
	   ``We will not be deterred by any desperate attempt to foil this
will,'' he added. ``It's a right of the Lebanese to enjoy social
security after the war.''
	   Hariri's reconstruction plan has been under attack by opposition
politicians and labor unions because it requires heavy borrowing
and higher taxes.
	   There have been reports that the government is considering
increases in taxes on gasoline and cellular phones to fund a pay
increase for government employees _ a move expected to draw further
criticism from the opposition and labor leaders.
	   Hariri is the moving force behind a massive program to repair
the infrastructure damaged during the war and to rebuild the
war-shattered downtown.
	   On Tuesday, he spoke at a ceremony for the laying of a
cornerstone at the new Lebanese University campus in Beirut's
southern Hadath suburb.
	   Construction began last September and is expected to be
completed by the year 2000.
	   Nabil Jisr, chairman of the Council for Development and
Reconstruction, said the new campus and a second one planned for
the northern suburb of Fanar would accommodate 42,000 students by
the year 2025.
	   Total cost of the two campuses will be dlrs 250 million, he
said.
	   There currently are some 29,000 students enrolled at the
existing state-run Lebanese University campuses.
	   Jisr said that dlrs 130 million for the Hadath campus had come
in the form of grants and low-interest loans from the Kuwait-based
Arab Fund for Social and Economic Development, the Saudi
Development Fund, the Jiddah-based Islamic Development Fund and the
Omani government.

EDs: UPDATES with ex-Festina riders released from detention,
</HEADLINE>
CORRECTS that they were in detention Monday &QL; 
 &UR; TVM officials under investigation; Virenque denies taking EPO

<TEXT>
	   REIMS, France (AP) _ Two top officials of the Dutch cycling team
TVM were placed under formal investigation by French authorities
Tuesday for the use of the performance-enhancing drug EPO.
	   Sporting director Cees Priem and team doctor Andrei Mikhailov
are now likely to be formally charged in the latest chapter of the
drugs scandal overshadowing the Tour de France.
	   TVM came under the spotlight when it emerged that EPO had been
found in the car of one of its officials in March.
	   Then, police found evidence of used drugs in a suitcase and
trash can during a search of the team's hotel in Toulouse and Metz,
though the nature of the drugs is still not known.
	   Rival team Festina has already been expelled from the Tour in
connection with the widespread use of EPO.
	   As the scandal grows, two former Festina cyclists, Emmanuel
Magnien and Gilles Bouvard, were released from police detention
Tuesday, a day after being held for questioning by Lille police.
	   ``There is no doubt that all the former cyclists at Festina will
be interrogated,'' said main prosecutor Gerald Vinsonneau.
	   Neither cyclist is currently competing in the Tour.
	   Authorities in Lille said that Bruno Roussel, Festina's sporting
director, would likely be released Tuesday or Wednesday from the
nearby town of Arras where he has been held since July 17.
	   Festina physiotherapist Willy Voet was released Friday, but team
doctor Eric Ryckaert remains in custody.
	   Meanwhile some Festina riders continue to deny ever taking EPO
or other illegal drugs.
	   ``Bruno Roussel never asked me if I wanted to take EPO under
medical control, and I maintain that I never took it,'' Richard
Virenque, the team's No. 1 cyclist, told investigating judge
Patrick Keil, according to daily newspaper L'Est Republicain on
Tuesday.
	   ``I never asked for doping products and I never needed them. I
have never taken amphetamines. I am going to follow the advise of
my lawyer and file a civil complaint,'' he said.
	   According to the paper, police are testing blood samples given
by the cyclists during questioning.
	   The results will be known in about three weeks, it said.

Turmoil looms after Cambodian ruling party declares landslide

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Setting the stage for more turmoil
in one of the world's most troubled countries, strongman Hun Sen's
party claimed a landslide victory in parliamentary elections
Tuesday while the opposition accused him of massive fraud.
	   The Cambodian People's Party shrugged off opposition threats to
boycott the new National Assembly and suggested a coalition.
	   ``If they don't, the current government will go until probably
2003, but I think they should uphold national interests and join a
coalition government,'' said Svay Sitha, a CPP steering committee
member.
	   As the second day of counting drew to a close, the Hun
Sen-packed National Election Committee released preliminary
official tallies for half the communes in 11 of the 21 provinces.
Hun Sen's party was well ahead of the others.
	   The two main opposition leaders, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and
Sam Rainsy, accepted that the official tally would resemble figures
put out by the Cambodian People's Party _ but only because of the
party's influence over the election committee.
	   The CPP's figures showed the ruling party taking 67 of the 122
National Assembly seats, a commanding majority in what had looked
like a tight three-way race. According to the figures, Ranariddh's
royalist FUNCINPEC took 42 seats and the Sam Rainsy Party just 13.
	   In a meeting in Manila, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said ``any declarations of victory are premature. The only
thing we know for a fact is that the Cambodian people voted in
large numbers as they did in the previous election.''
	   The prince and Sam Rainsy, on-again, off-again allies, said they
would boycott the National Assembly, denying the CPP the two-thirds
of members needed to hold meetings.
	   They also demanded a new vote in areas where there were
irregularities. They complained of missing ballots, polling station
staff marking ballots for voters, willful miscounting, threats to
observers and improper moving of ballots at night.
	   Ranariddh said: ``Yesterday, in the morning, until about 11 or
12 o'clock, FUNCINPEC was leading everywhere. We were clearly
leading. But in the afternoon, the situation was reversed.''
	   The dispute raised the prospect of more turmoil in a country
that suffered the Khmer Rouge genocide of the 1970s and 30 years of
civil war and strife. In the latest round, Hun Sen had deposed
Ranariddh as co-prime minister last year in two days of fighting in
the capital.
	   The co-premiership emerged from U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993
meant to usher in a new era of peace and democracy.
	   Ranariddh won, but Hun Sen, who came to power in 1985 under the
harsh Vietnamese occupation that followed the Khmer Rouge, forced
his way into a coalition by threatening war.
	   Hun Sen called the elections in a bid to win back international
aid and legitimacy, but used violence, including murder, against
opposition activists and intimidation of voters to ensure his
victory.
	   Ranariddh and Hun Sen both said they would reject another
co-premiership, calling it a recipe for disaster.
	   Foreign observer groups noted the pre-election violence but said
that relatively peaceful voting and initially smooth counting
Monday signaled an election fair enough to represent the will of
Cambodians.
	   But most issued their endorsements before even the barest
official returns came in.
	   Sam Rainsy said that together, his party and FUNCINPEC should
have been able to form a majority with the prince as prime
minister.
	   By all accounts, one seat won by Sam Rainsy was Pailin, a border
town that is a stronghold of thousands of former Khmer Rouge
guerrillas who made peace with the government two years ago. They
voted Sunday in the first election in their lives.
	   Meanwhile, a general loyal to Ranariddh who waged armed
resistance on behalf of the prince after the coup said he would
keep fighting with his few hundred troops from their hilltop
stronghold on the border with Thailand.
	   ``There's just too much cheating going on,'' Gen. Nhek Bunchhay
told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. ``I can't
accept the outcome.''

Australian winger set to play for Leeds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ Australian rugby league winger Wendall
Sailor will play rugby union and rugby league for teams based in
Leeds for 16 weeks starting Oct. 17.
	   The 24-year-old Brisbane Broncos star, rated the best winger in
rugby league, confirmed Tuesday he would head to England after a
test series against New Zealand in early October.
	   He was released by the Broncos for the period between the finals
in Australia and pre-season training starting late January.
	   Sailor was secured by Leeds Rugby Club for 100,000 pounds (dlrs
164,000) _ the club embraces the second division rugby union team
and the Leeds Rhinos Super League team.
	   Sailor was linked with a lucrative move to Super League
powerhouse Wigan earlier this year but the move was blocked by the
Brisbane Broncos.
	   Speaking via a satellite link to Headingly stadium from his
Brisbane home, Sailor said he had been looking forward to playing
rugby union and playing at Headingly, which he visited during
Australia's rugby league tour in 1994.
	   Under the agreement, the winger could feature in grand finals in
the northern and southern hemispheres within a month.
	   If, as expected the Brisbane Broncos _ Australian Super League
and World Club champions last season _ make the National Rugby
League final, he will play the southern hemisphere play-off in
September and start in the northern hemisphere play-offs in
October.
	   Leeds Rhinos coach Graham Murray said on his day, Sailor was the
world's best winger.
	   ``He's beaten plenty of my sides by himself,'' he said.
	   ``Fellas who can turn a match by playing on the wing are
something special.''

Trial begins for men accused of smuggling arms from Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Fourteen men pleaded innocent Monday to
charges that they smuggled ammunition and hundreds of guns and
rifles from Iraq to the West Bank.
	   Six other defendants are being tried in absentia.
	   Prosecution witnesses spoke of a vast smuggling ring, in which
defendants used trucks and trailers to carry the weapons. They said
the ring began operating in March 1998 and had planned to sell the
arms on the market in the West Bank.
	   Over a month, the group smuggled 256 rifles, 177 pistols, 800
bullets out of Iraq and brought much of it into the West Bank,
prosecutors said. The group was believed to have earned 65,000
Jordanian dinars (dlrs 91,500), court records said.
	   Jordan borders the West Bank to the west and Iraq to the east.
The majority of its population is of Palestinian descent.
	   The defendants are from Iraq, Jordan and Egypt.
	   The case was adjourned for two weeks.

Guinea-Bissau cease-fire reported broken by government forces
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Rebels who launched a coup attempt in
Guinea-Bissau in West Africa seven weeks ago, claimed Tuesday that
government forces have violated a cease-fire agreement signed last
weekend, according to news reports.
	   The rebels' radio station alleged that Senegalese forces
supporting President Joao Bernardo Vieira fired at rebel positions
near Bafata, the former Portuguese colony's second-largest city,
media reports here said.
	   The Portuguese Foreign Ministry said its officials in the
country had heard shots but could not say who fired them.
	   ``There were minor, isolated incidents _ mostly sporadic
gunshots _ around the capital and in the hinterland at dawn,'' a
Foreign Ministry spokesman said by phone.
	   The rebels, who claim to have the loyalty of most of the
country's 6,000-strong army, also alleged that government forces
had blasted a bridge in the Bafata area, about 140 kilometers (85
miles) northeast of the capital.
	   The government and the breakaway military faction agreed Sunday
to a cease-fire ahead of further talks to end the conflict which
has displaced some 200,000 people _ about one-fifth of the
population.
	   The agreement was brokered by a Portuguese-speaking delegation
made up of diplomats from Portugal, Brazil, Angola, Mozambique,
Cape Verde, and Sao Tome and Principe.
	   They are due to facilitate a new meeting on Friday in the Cape
Verde islands, about 700 kilometers (430 miles) off the coast of
Senegal. The possible deployment of an international monitoring
force is expected to be discussed.
	   The conflict erupted June 7 after Mane, a former Armed Forces
chief-of-staff, was dismissed for allegedly smuggling arms to
Senegal's Casamance separatists.
	   No numbers were available on how many were killed in the
fighting, which also has spread to inland areas of this small
country wedged between Senegal and Guinea.

Former East German spy chief fined for refusing to testify
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Former East German spymaster Markus Wolf was fined
500 marks (dlrs 280) Tuesday for refusing to testify against a
former secret police colonel accused of embezzlement.
	   Wolf, 75, was first called as a witness in June, but won a
postponement by arguing that his lawyer was not present.
	   On Tuesday, Wolf again refused to testify for the same reason,
saying his lawyer had left on a vacation that could not be
postponed.
	   The court said Wolf had no legal right to refuse to testify in
the case and levied the fine. It also ordered him to appear next
Tuesday or face additional fines.
	   Wolf was jailed for two days in January for refusing to testify
at another trial of a former spy. He was released when federal
judges ruled he had the right to refuse to testify on the grounds
it could incriminate him.
	   Wolf was East Germany's top spy from 1953 through 1986.

Daimler-Benz to build ultra-lavish Maybach limousine

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ German industrial giant Daimler-Benz
said Tuesday it will go forward with its plans to build the lavish
Mercedes-Benz Maybach, an exclusive limousine to rival the
Rolls-Royce.
	   The 5.7-meter-long (19-feet-long) Maybachs are to travel at top
speeds of 250 kilometers per hour (155 mph), have three telephones
each and cater to a ``small, exclusive group of clients.''
	   The Maybach was displayed as a prototype at auto shows late last
year, and the company has been debating since then whether to build
the car and where.
	   The Daimler-Benz board gave the project its final approval
Tuesday, saying the Maybach will be produced in Sindelfingen in
southern Germany. Daimler announced no production costs, sales
prices or date when sales would begin.
	   ``With the positive decision to build the Mercedes-Benz Maybach
we underline once again our intention to represent the absolute top
in every segment,'' Daimler chief Juergen Schrempp said.
	   Introduction of the Maybach comes at a time of brisk expansion
and diversification for Daimler and other German automakers.
	   Daimler-Benz announced a merger with the United States' No. 3
automaker, Chrysler, earlier this year, and introduced its first
sub-compact late last year.
	   Volkswagen also expanded into the high-luxury end of the market
with its purchase this year of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd.
	   Daimler said the hand-finished Maybach will not compete with its
S-class luxury cars, but represent an even higher tier of luxury.
	   Among standard luxuries to come under the Maybach's glass roof
are three telephones, reclining seats, bar, VCR and computer. Each
Maybach is to be custom-made for individual customers, said Juergen
Hubbert, head of Daimler's car division.
	   With the name Maybach, the company is resurrecting a pre-World
War II marque named after Wilhelm Maybach, an engineer with the
company during its early days.

Four men killed in gangland-style slayings in Swiss tea room
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Four men were shot to death in a
gangland-style attack on a tea room in the diplomatic quarter of
the ordinarily placid Swiss capital, police said Tuesday.
	   Officers found the bodies of the men in the back of the Safari
Tea Room. The attackers escaped, said a police spokesman.
	   Neighbors called police late Monday evening when they heard the
windows breaking at the tea room, in central Bern. The Italian
consulate and the Ghana and Jordan embassies are among other
tenants of the building.
	   Federal prosecutor spokesman Juerg Blaser said there appeared to
be no connection between the slayings and the diplomatic missions.
	   Police said they had yet to identify the victims and had no
motive for the killings. Witnesses said they saw three or four men
at the tea room at the time of the attack.
	   The tea room, which had been closed for two months due to a
change of ownership, was to reopen Tuesday under the management of
a Turkish woman, police said.
	   Up to 40 police officers have been assigned to the case, and a
number of people have been questioned, but no one has been charged,
police said.

Russia denies arms shipments to Afghan rebels, points finger at
</HEADLINE>
Pakistan &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia denied a report that it was supplying
weapons to opposition fighters in Afghanistan and suggested Tuesday
that most of the arms going to the ruling Taliban movement were
from Pakistan.
	   Afghanistan has been at war for two decades and both the Taliban
movement and the opposition appear to have inexhaustible supplies
of weapons, though no outside country acknowledges supplying the
arms.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry said that an international arms
embargo against Afghanistan would prove futile because it was
``virtually impossible to establish an effective control over the
border between Afghanistan and Pakistan.''
	   Pakistan is sympathetic to the Taliban, a fundamentalist Islamic
movement. Many countries have said that Pakistan supplies weapons
to the Taliban, though Pakistan denies the charge.
	   Russia, meanwhile, is opposed to the Taliban because it fears
the spread of Islamic fundamentalism into the former Soviet
republics of Central Asia.
	   The New York Times, citing unidentified U.S. officials, reported
Monday that the Russians had become a major weapons supplier to the
Afghan factions opposing the Taliban.
	   But Russian officials denied the accusations on Tuesday, as they
have in the past.
	   However, some Russian analysts said they had no doubt that
Moscow was providing assistance _ and that it was going to the very
groups that fought against the Soviet army when it occupied
Afghanistan from 1979-89.
	   ``It's a long-standing fact that Russia is helping the
anti-Taliban alliance,'' said Pavel Felgenhauer, a respected
military analyst for the liberal daily Segodnya.
	   If Russia is providing help to Afghan factions, it would not be
a new development.
	   In 1995, the Taliban forced down a Russian cargo plane that was
taking weapons to the Afghan factions that controlled the capital
Kabul at the time.
	   The Taliban drove the factions out of Kabul in 1996 and imposed
its harsh version of Islamic law over 85 percent of Afghanistan.
Their rivals have retreated to the northern part of the country.
	   The Russians have repeatedly voiced concerns that Taliban-style
movements could spread into Central Asia.
	   As a result, Russia for years has stationed 25,000 troops along
Tajikistan's rugged, mountainous frontier with Afghanistan. The
Russian soldiers helped Tajikistan's hard-line government in its
war with Islamic rebels.
	   The war formally ended last year, but the Russian troops remain
to prevent drugs, weapons and militants from coming across the
border from Afghanistan.
	   According to the New York Times report, the Russian military was
using its bases in Tajikistan to ferry weapons to Afghan rebel
leader Ahmed Shah Massoud.
	   Ironically, Massoud was the most effective rebel leader in the
1980s when he was battling the Soviet forces in Afghanistan. But
the Russians now see him as a valuable asset, Felgenhauer said.
	   ``Russian commanders who fought against Massoud speak about him
with great respect,'' Felgenhauer said.
	   Uzbekistan, another ex-Soviet republic bordering Afghanistan,
has been reportedly ferrying weapons to Rashid Dostum, an ethnic
Uzbek who controls part of northern Afghanistan, he said.
	   ``The Taliban is a clear danger (for Russia). It's quite natural
for Russia to support its foes,'' said Dr. Sergei Oznobishev, head
of the Institute of Strategic Assessment, an independent Russian
think-tank.

Russia's most prominent reporters, Yelena Masyuk.
	   Russia's Glasnost Protection Fund appealed Tuesday to Tajik
President Emomali Rakhmonov to reverse the decision to declare
Masyuk persona non grata, Russian news agencies said.
	   The group urged Rakhmonov to make sure the Central Asian country
honors ``its international commitments allowing journalists to have
their own opinions about developments.''
	   Masyuk, who works for NTV, was held hostage in the secessionist
Russian region of Chechnya for 101 days in 1997 before her employer
paid dlrs 2 million to release her and her crew.
	   The Glasnost Foundation said Tajik authorities acted against
Masyuk on Monday, citing stories she filed Thursday and Friday
which they said violated a 1990 law on the media.
	   ``The evident intent of her reports was to discredit the
leadership of the Republic of Tajikistan, to undermine the
government policy of peaceful development of society and to
interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign state,'' Interfax
said, citing the Tajik Foreign Ministry.
	   In its appeal, the foundation said Masyuk ``is an
internationally known brilliant journalist.''
	   ``The fact that she was stripped of her accreditation and
especially declared persona non grata on a vague and poorly
formulated pretext will be a much greater blow against Tajikistan's
reputation than the criticism contained in her reports,'' it said.
	   She is the second Russian reported declared persona non grata by
Tajikistan's Foreign Ministry in the past two years. In 1997, the
republic expelled Nezavisimaya Gazeta reporter Igor Rotar.
	   Four Russian reporters were held hostage in Tajikistan for 10
days in February 1997 and Russian ORT reporter Viktor Nikulin was
killed in the Tajik capital Dushanbe in March 1996.
	   The Paris-based Reporters Without Borders Group also protested
the action against Masyuk on Monday.

Thai study says country has almost 18,000 child prostitutes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ There are 17,978 children working as
prostitutes in Thailand, including 5,510 from neighboring
countries, the Ministry of Public Health said Tuesday.
	   The figures come from a study done by Mahidol University, the
top medical school in Thailand.
	   Children's rights groups, however, criticized the study, saying
it surveyed only brothels and did not include homeless and runaway
children who sell their bodies, nor school girls who engage in
prostitution part time.
	   The numbers are also drastically lower than those estimated by
some rights groups and international organizations. The United
Nations Children's Fund, for instance, has said there are about
300,000 child prostitutes in Thailand.
	   The ministry, however, will urge the Cabinet and the Foreign
Ministry to use its numbers as the official figure.
	   That should put an end to misleading speculation by foreign
media and organizations, which often use higher numbers to attack
Thailand, said a ministry official, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity.
	   Researchers at Mahidol University warned last week that the
problem of child prostitution will continue to grow unless the
government treats the matter more seriously.
	   ``The government has to address this issue with the same urgency
as the international narcotics trade,'' Kritaya Archavanikul, a
researcher at the university, told reporters at a recent seminar.
	   The report said about 50,000 prostitutes now working in Thailand
entered the sex business when they were below the age of 18.
	   About 90,916 people are working as prostitutes in Thailand.
About 18,000 are foreigners, according to the Mahidol University
study.

Protesters greet One Nation legislators' debut in state parliament

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ An estimated 2,000 Aboriginal and
student protesters greeted members of right-wing populist Pauline
Hanson's One Nation party Tuesday when they took their place for
the first time in Queensland state's parliament.
	   Eleven One Nation lawmakers were elected to the state
legislature on June 13 in the first ballot box test of the
fledgling party formed by Hanson less than two years ago.
	   One Nation does not hold any position of power in the Queensland
government, which was formed by the Labor party with the support of
one independent legislator.
	   Hanson claims Australia is becoming ``Asianized,'' opposes
special welfare benefits for Aborigines and advocates protectionist
economic policies. One Nation party has rated in double figures in
recent national opinion polls, despite condemnation that Hanson's
views are racist.
	   In separate rallies that combined outside the state's Parliament
House, students and Aborigines demonstrated against Hanson's
policies on the first day of the parliamentary session.
	   High school student and protester David Taylor said that
although the students were too young to have a say at the ballot
box, they were entitled to protest against policies with which they
disagreed.
	   ``Society may deny us our vote, but we intend to speak with our
feet and raise our voices before the One Nation members take their
seat in government,'' Taylor said.
	   Another, David Lafferty, said One Nation's policies must be
opposed.
	   ``We must oppose Pauline Hanson not only because she is a racist
with discriminatory policies, but also because her solutions of
scapegoating minority groups are false,'' he said.
	   Hanson, who is a member of the federal parliament, watched from
the visitors' gallery in the state parliament and said she was
``absolutely delighted'' to see her party's legislators make their
debut.
	   ``I think I'd be the proudest woman in Australia,'' she said.

Illegal immigrants try to escape from holding center in Sicily
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A group of illegal immigrants from North Africa
tried to escape from a detention center in southern Italy where
they were awaiting expulsion, news reports said Tuesday. Two made
it; about 50 were stopped trying to climb over a fence.
	   Police fired shots in the air to stop the escape attempt in the
Sicilian city of Caltanissetta on Monday night, the reports said.
No one was injured.
	   Another group of about 122 would-be immigrants at the center
went on a hunger strike Monday to protest their impending
expulsion.
	   Under the European Union's open borders policy, Italy is obliged
to send home the illegal immigrants, many of whom are headed to
northern Europe in search of jobs.
	   Also on Monday, five Tunisians stowaways died in a blaze aboard
a freighter docked in Genoa.
	   Port authorities theorized that they set the fire in hopes of
fleeing in the confusion. It was not clear whether the stowaways
were locked in the cabin when the blaze broke out and why no one
came to their assistance.
	   The captain of the ship, Crescenzo Mendella, insisted in an
interview with state television that the cabin door cannot be
locked. ``They can be opened from inside,'' he said.
	   Four more stowaways were in a nearby cabin, including a man who
reportedly lost two brothers in the fire. Three were arrested and
one escaped.
	   Warm temperatures and calm seas of the past weeks have
encouraged clandestine runs of boats packed with North Africans
seeking jobs in Italy or elsewhere in Europe.
	   More than 3,000 people trying to slip in by sea have been found
since July 1.
	   Italy has been trying to persuade Morocco and Tunisia to better
patrol their coasts.
	   An agreement was reached Monday with Morocco. Talks with Tunisia
were scheduled for Aug. 5.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Police prevented students who are seeking
democratic reforms in Iran from staging a rally on Tuesday, the
latest incident in a deepening power struggle between moderates and
hard-liners in the country.
	   A half-dozen students _ apparently an advance team _ stood
outside the Tehran University gate for an hour before they were
ordered away by police.
	   University guards and plain-clothes intelligence officials
prevented them from entering the campus, telling them they had no
permit for a rally. Police also ordered curious passersby to
disperse.
	   Anti-riot police waited nearby, but were not deployed.
	   Tensions have been high in Iran amid a power struggle between
reformist President Mohammad Khatami and religious hard-liners
determined to keep their grip on power.
	   Increasingly, the conflict inside the government has had
ramifications on the street.
	   Pro-democracy rallies in recent months have been violently
disrupted in the past by Islamic militants.
	   On Tuesday, one of the students was seen being taken away by
police, apparently for questioning. The police forces remain under
the control of the hard-liners.
	   ``Although we were not allowed to speak publicly, we think we
were able to make our point about no freedom in this country,''
said Parviz Safari, one of the student leaders prevented from
entering the campus.
	   While the students were being prevented from staging their
demonstration, Khatami was telling the official Islamic Republic
News Agency that he was committed to democratic reforms.
	   ``Rights are not given by the governments. They are God-given,''
Khatami said during a visit to IRNA headquarters in Tehran. ``Good
governments must remove all hurdles impeding these rights.''
	   He added: ``I am trying today to defend peoples' rights on the
basis of religion and freedom.''
	   One measure of the tension over Khatami's efforts to liberalize
Iran involves the Khaneh weekly.
	   Militants threw a small petrol bomb at the paper's office on
Monday and then called editors to threaten further action if the
paper didn't change its policies. No one was injured in the
incident.
	   The militants were angered because the paper recently published
a letter in which an anonymous young woman criticized the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
	   As leader of the 1979 revolution, he is called the Imam, and
portrayed almost as a saint. Criticism of Khomeini, who led Iran in
the 1980-88 war with Iraq, has been taboo.
	   But the young woman wrote to the paper: ``When I think of
Khomeini, all that comes to mind are the horrifying sounds of the
midnight bombs that used to fall on Tehran, and the blood of
thousands of innocent young Iranians who died in that war.''
	   She added: ``Do you call me to follow someone who has
transformed Iran into an international terrorist state with his
order to murder Salman Rushdie?''
	   Khomeini ordered Muslims to kill Rushdie for insulting Islam in
his novel ``The Satanic Verses.''

Japanese gangster shot to death in southwestern Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Three men fatally shot a gang boss at his home in
southwestern Japan in an apparent turf dispute, a police spokesman
said Tuesday.
	   Masuo Manabe, 49, leader of the four-member Manabe-gumi
underworld syndicate, was shot late Monday in Touyo, 680 kilometers
(425 miles) southwest of Tokyo, said Seiki Fujino, a local police
spokesman.
	   Several hours after the shooting, Tatsuya Nagai, 38, a member of
the Yamaguchi-gumi gang, turned up at a nearby police station with
a pistol, Fujino said. The two other attackers were still at large.
	   A total of 53 cases of gang violence, mostly shootings, were
reported last year, according to the National Police Agency. Three
people, including one not involved with gangs, were killed, it
said.
	   Police estimate there are about 80,000 gangsters nationwide,
including the 33,000-member, Kobe-based Yamaguchi-gumi, Japan's
largest underworld syndicate. Gangsters are mostly engaged in
various kinds of extortion, the sex trade, drugs, and real estate
and construction swindles.

Turkey protests Greek foreign minister's remarks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey on Tuesday condemned comments by
the Greek foreign minister, who said a Turkish consulate in
northern Greece would be ``taught a lesson'' for interfering in the
region's affairs.
	   Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos on Sunday accused the
Turkish consulate in Salonica of creating tension between
Christians and Muslims.
	   ``We strongly condemn the remarks,'' a statement from the
Turkish Foreign Ministery said
	   Turkey has a close interest in the 120,000-strong
Turkish-speaking Muslim minority in northern Greece.
	   Greece and Turkey are bitter rivals, although both belong to
NATO. Their relations are strained by disputes over land, water and
airspace in the Aegean and the divided island of Cyprus.

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Arab Banking Corp., the Arab world's
largest bank, said Tuesday its profit in the first half of 1998
fell 23.5 percent to dlrs 72 million over the same period last
year.
	   Pre-tax profit for the first half last year amounted to dlrs 94
million, the bank said in a statement.
	   But total ABC assets in the first half this year stood at dlrs
24.9 billion, 7 percent higher than dlrs 23.2 billion at the end of
June 1997, the bank said.
	   The bank did not release a full balance sheet or mention the net
profit after tax for the 1998 first half. Bank officials were not
available for comment.
	   ABC, which is based in Bahrain, is held 26.93 percent by
Kuwait's Ministry of Finance, 26.79 percent by Central Bank of
Libya, 25 percent by Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, 5.7 percent by
Belgium's Kredietbank SA and the remaining shares are listed on the
Bahrain, Kuwait and Paris stock exchanges.
	   ABC overseas subsidiaries include Banco Atlantico S.A. in Spain,
International Bank of Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong, ABC International
Bank Plc in London, Arab Banking Corp-Daus &AMP; Co. GmbH in Frankfurt,
ABC Banque Internationale de Monaco S.A.M. in Monte Carlo and Arab

	   KUWAIT, (AP) _ Parliament has tentatively approved a government
request to reschedule a plan for paying hundreds of millions of
dinars in bad debts owned to it by private investors. Government
and parliament now must agree on how to reschedule the debts.
	   After 14 hours of deliberations that ended early Tuesday, 30
lawmakers voted for the move, 20 opposed it and three abstained.
	   The 6.7 billion dinars (dlrs 21.89 billion) in debts resulted
from a 1982 stock market crash, and were aggravated by Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait. After liberation in 1991, the government took
over these debts from nine private banks in a debts-for-bonds deal.
	   The bad debts law was amended in 1995 to give the 10,400 debtors
the choice of paying 45 percent of their debts in five
installments, or scheduling the full amount over 12 years. Most
debtors chose the installment method.
	   The government believes a six-month extension for each of the
last two installments will increase the chance of payment. It also
wants to give defaulting debtors a chance to pay their dues.
	   The house's financial committee, however, wants to merge the two
last payments and allow the debtors to pay them in three
installments.
	   Opponents of the amendment accuse the government of trying to
help out a few hundred merchants at the expense of the public.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq has signed dlrs 431 million in
contracts with neighboring Syria under the current phase of its
oil-for-food deal with the United Nations, an official magazine
reported Tuesday.
	   Al-Ittihad said under the contracts Syria will ship to Iraq
detergents, medicines, eggs, sugar and other commodities not banned
under the exemptions to U.N. trade sanctions imposed on Iraq for
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The weekly said contracts with Syria worth dlrs 231 million have
already been approved by Iraq's U.N. sanctions committee, which
vets Iraq's trade with the outside world.
	   It said Iraq has sent additional contracts worth more than dlrs
200 million it signed with Syria recently for approval.
	   Syria's support for non-Arab Iran in the 1980-1988 war with Iraq
led to a break in relations between Damascus and Baghdad.
	   But since last year the countries have increased political
contacts and bilateral trade, and they agreed this month to reopen
a joint pipeline used to carry Iraqi crude to the Mediterranean via
Syria.
	   ___
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The African Export-Import Bank has loaned
dlrs 16 million to two banks in Nigeria and Zimbabwe to encourage
trade, a statement by the Cairo-based bank said Tuesday.
	   The bank has renewed the credit line worth dlrs 10 million to
trust Merchant Bank Limited of Zimbabwe because of the previous
``satisfactory performance,'' the statement said.
	   The bank also loaned dlrs 6 million to Diamond Bank Limited of
Nigeria to help entrepreneurs enter the oil export field.
	   The bank was set up in 1994 by private and public financial
institutions in Africa and abroad to help raise the continent's
minimal share of world trade.
	   With a capital base of dlrs 750 million, it has a total of 127
shareholders, including 13 governments, 17 central banks and 30
financial institutions in Africa. There also is financial backing
from Brazil, China, France, India, Europe and the United States.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Investment in Jordan has increased by 40
percent to 131 million Jordanian dinars (dlrs 184.5 million) during
the first half of 1998 as compared to the same period last year, a
government official said Tuesday.
	   Investments stood at 85.1 million dinars (dlrs 119.8 million)
during the same period of last year, said Muntasser Oklah, director
general of the state-owned Investment Promotion Corporation.
	   Investments ranged from hotels, industry, agriculture, maritime
transport and railways, Oklah said.
	   Foreign investors from Canada, the United States, Europe and
Asia contributed 52.2 percent, while Arab Gulf investors accounted
for 30.9 percent, he said.

French foreign minister visits Tehran Aug. 22-23
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine will visit
Iran on Aug. 22-23, the ministry announced Tuesday. The trip
presages a new level of ties between the two nations whose
relations have been marked by dramatic swings.
	   Vedrine will meet with his Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharrazi
and other officials during the working visit, said Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
	   Talks are expected to cover a range of subjects from bilateral
relations economic and political as well as cultural and
scientific, she said.
	   The discussions will not exclude ``problem'' areas like the 1989
death fatwa on British writer Salmon Rushdie, individual freedoms
and non-proliferation of weapons, Gazeau-Secret told a news
briefing.
	   ``This visit falls within the process of normalization'' between
the European Union and Iran,'' Gazeau-Secret said. She referred to
Iran's ``considerable status'' in the Middle East, suggesting
Tehran could bring ``stabilization'' to the region.
	   The EU dropped its five-year policy of ``critical dialogue''
with Tehran _ long criticized by the United States _ after a German
court accused Tehran of murdering dissidents in Berlin.
	   But a new era of normalization was signaled in February when the
EU lifted its interdiction on ministers' visits.
	   The United States has unsuccessfully tried to persuade its
allies to isolate Iran, which it accuses of state-sponsored
terrorism.
	   Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini visited Iran in March,
the first Western Cabinet-level official to go to Iran since the EU
ban was lifted.
	   Earlier this month, an EU delegation revived the high-level
dialogue with Iran's government during a visit to Tehran.
	   Roland Dumas' 1991 trip to Tehran was the last by a French
foreign minister.

 &UR; Hundreds of Inter fans welcome newly-signed striker &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Hundreds of jubilant Inter Milan fans on
Tuesday cheered Roberto Baggio as the newly-signed Italian veteran
striker arrived at the club headquarters for his presentation to
the media.
	   The 31-year-old star-forward signed a two-year contract with
Inter to team in front with Brazilian superstar Ronaldo, who's
expected to join the team by mid August.
	   Ronaldo was given a one-month vacation by officials of his
Italian team to recover from the stress sustained in the recent
World Cup.
	   Baggio, who scored 22 goals with low-ranked Bologna last year,
will get 4.5 billion lire (dlrs 2.5 million) a year from Inter, his
fifth Serie A club.
	   One of the most talented Italian players, Baggio debuted with
Fiorentina in 1985 and also played with Juventus, AC Milan and
Bologna. He scored 151 goals in 316 league matches.
	   Baggio said he hoped to keep his place on the national team for
the upcoming European Championship qualifying matches, at the
orders of newly-appointed coach Dino Zoff.
	   Playing portions of matches, as substitute of younger star
Alessandro Del Piero, Baggio was one of Italy's best players at
France '98.
	   Baggio was expected to make his debut on Inter's lineup in a
Champions League match scheduled in Pisa on Aug. 12. Inter
qualified for the most titled European competition finishing second
to Juventus of Turin in the last Serie A campaign.

Aung San Suu Kyi's release from roadblock in 4th-8th grafs; trims

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Southeast Asian countries asked the
world powers Tuesday for new financing and investment to help the
region recover from its economic crisis.
	   But the United States, Japan and other countries did not
announce any new aid packages and said that while they will
continue to help, Southeast Asian countries themselves must
persevere with painful political and economic reforms if they are
to recover.
	   The turmoil, which has dragged many of the region's once-vibrant
economies into recession, dominated the start of annual talks among
the nine-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations and a group
of nine richer Asian and Western nations plus the European Union.
	   During a break in the conference, however, foreign ministers
from seven of the countries met with their counterpart from Myanmar
to press concerns about human rights and ask for the release of
opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi from a police roadblock.
	   Suu Kyi has been stuck on a rural Myanmar highway surrounded by
government security personnel since last Friday, when her car was
stopped on her way to a meeting with supporters.
	   The ministers _ from New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Japan,
South Korea, the European Union and the United States _ urged
Myanmar to quickly resolve the impasse.
	   ``During the meeting a lot of pressure was exerted on the
leadership of Myanmar to change their ways, their policies. I hope
this can have some impact,'' said Wolfgang Schuessel, president of
the European Council.
	   Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy, said in a
statement Tuesday that her food was running out and that she should
be allowed to proceed before her health fails.
	   The currency crisis began in July 1997, when Thailand's
devaluation of its currency sparked a wave of speculative attacks
against currencies in the region. ASEAN ministers have warned of
further social unrest and violence, such as that which toppled
Indonesia's President Suharto in May, if the world's economic
powers do not quickly extend more assistance.
	   The conference chairman, Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo
Siazon, said the rich countries had a ``paramount role'' in
restoring economic vibrancy to the region.
	   ``In addition to keeping their markets open, injecting new
investments and sustaining fresh financing, our dialogue partners
are urged to assume leadership in restoring economic vitality in
the region,'' he told the conference.
	   Siazon said the United States should increase its share of
funding to the International Monetary Fund. The IMF's reserves have
been depleted by major bailouts of several Asian nations in the
past year.
	   He said Japan's new government should more quickly carry out its
fiscal stimulus package and reform its financial and income tax
system. ASEAN officials have said that the stability of the yen and
Japanese demand for imports from Southeast Asia are crucial to the
region's recovery.
	   In her statement, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
said democracy and free market policies are critical to recovery.
She said nations that have given their people the greatest say in
political decisions have had the greatest success in preserving
stability and in getting support for tough policies.
	   ``Official assistance can help countries in this region get
through the worst days of the economic crisis,'' she said. ``But we
also have to recognize that it is not going to solve the deeper,
long-term problems they face. The crisis is not going to be solved
by aid alone.''
	   She said the key ingredient for restoring investor confidence in
Asia is transparency _ ``an expectation that in a climate of
openness, economic decisions will be shaped by market forces, and
not distorted by corruption.''
	   Another key, she said, is for industrialized countries to
increase imports from Southeast Asia.
	   ASEAN groups Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Brunei,
Singapore, Myanmar, Vietnam, Malaysia and Laos.

	   GELSENKIRCHEN, Germany (AP) _ Olaf Thon, who lost his starting
position as Germany's sweeper at this summer's World Cup in France,
said Tuesday he was quitting the national team.
	   Thon went to France as Germany's No. 1 sweeper, or libero, but
he lost the job to 37-year-old veteran Lothar Matthaeus at halftime
of Germany's third game against Iran. Germany lost 3-0 to Croatia
in the quarterfinals.
	   ``I talked last week to coach Berti Vogts and told him that I
won't be available any more,'' the Schalke player said. ``My
decision is also based on the fact that Vogts is staying on as
coach. The two of us don't get along.''
	   Thon, 32, is the second member of Germany's World Cup squad to
announce his retirement after captain Juergen Klinsmann.

Khatami sends message via Internet to U.S.-based Iranians

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ President Mohammad Khatami used the Internet
on Tuesday to send greetings to Iranians living in the United
States.
	   During a visit to the Tehran office of the government's Islamic
Republic News Agency, Khatami got on line with IRNA's correspondent
in New York, the agency reported.
	   Khatami asked the correspondent to convey his greetings to
``Iranians in America whose hearts are beating for Islamic Iran,''
IRNA said.
	   Khatami also thanked Iranians in the states for their good
wishes and support, saying he hoped that ``with the unity created''
they could work together for a stronger Iran.
	   About a million Iranians, many of whom fled during the 1979
Islamic revolution that ousted the U.S.-backed shah, have settled
in the United States.
	   Many have softened their stance toward their homeland since the
election in May 1997 of Khatami, a moderate cleric who has tried to
introduce democratic reforms to the strict Islamic republic.
	   The United States severed relations after Islamic militants took
52 Americans hostage in 1979 and held them for 444 days.

Rivals India and Pakistan meet at regional forum

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Seeking to ease tensions that
skyrocketed since the rival nations conducted nuclear tests, the
prime ministers of India and Pakistan flew Tuesday to the neutral
ground of Sri Lanka for their first encounter since the
acceleration of the South Asian arms race.
	   Unwilling to meet in each other's nation, India's Atal Bihari
Vajpayee and Pakistan's Nawaz Sharif flew Tuesday into Colombo, Sri
Lanka's heavily secured capital, where they will meet during a
seven-nation summit that opens Wednesday.
	   The annual South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation
summit aims to develop the economies of some of the world's poorest
countries, but is often overshadowed by the 50-year rivalry between
group's two largest states. The other members are Nepal,
Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives and Sri Lanka.
	   As in nine previous summits, this week's meeting is likely to be
distracted by the dispute over Kashmir, the Himalayan territory
which has detonated two India-Pakistan wars. Kashmir, which was a
Hindu kingdom with a Muslim majority before the first war in 1947,
is now split, with India controlling two-thirds.
	   Vajpayee and Sharif will meet for the first time since ordering
underground nuclear tests last May and declaring their countries
nuclear weapon states.
	   India's five nuclear explosions in May were greeted with
national jubilation and pride, matched two weeks later in Pakistan
when Sharif brought Islamabad's nuclear program out of the closet.
Opinion polls showed the tests were hugely popular.
	   It also will be their first meeting since Vajpayee's Hindu
nationalist government took office in March, pledging to step up
the fight against what India calls a Pakistan-backed insurgency by
Muslim separatists in Kashmir. Pakistan denies active involvement,
but gives diplomatic and political support to the militants.
	   ``I am optimistic,'' Vajpayee said on his arrival in Colombo.
``I am confident the dialogue with Pakistan will be continued
further.''
	   Sharif, leaving Islamabad for Sri Lanka, said in a statement he
would focus the talks on ``peace and security, particularly in the
background of the nuclearization of South Asia,'' and on the
Kashmir question.
	   The United States has been prodding the two sides to start
talking to each other to prevent a fourth war in the region, this
time possibly a nuclear one.
	   Expectations of the Vajpayee-Sharif meeting are low. An
agreement to resume talks between the top foreign policy
bureaucrats, suspended last year, was the most many expected.
	   ``My guess is that they will agree to revive foreign
secretary-level talks, but I don't know what will be the modalities
for discussing Kashmir,'' said J.N. Dixit, India's former foreign
secretary who also has served as India's ambassador to Pakistan.
	   The positions on Kashmir appear irreconcilable. Pakistan demands
international mediation to settle the dispute since it believes it
is at a disadvantage in one-to-one talks with a much bigger and
more powerful India. New Delhi rejects any outside interference.
	   Pakistan also wants residents of both Indian- and Pakistani-held
Kashmir to be allowed to vote to chose which country they want to
belong to. Such a plebiscite, as outlined in U.N. resolutions from
the 1940s, is opposed by India.
	   On Wednesday, Vajpayee is expected to offer Shrarif the chance
to sign a pact not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. In 1985,
the two countries signed an agreement not to attack each other's
nuclear power stations.
	   As U.S.-led international economic sanctions begin to pinch,
voices of dissent were beginning to be heard _ often reflecting on
the contradiction between nuclear ambitions and economic distress.
The seven SAARC states are home to one-fifth of humanity, but they
account for half the world's illiteracy and 40 percent of its poor.
	   Drawing a horrific portrait of a devastated nuclear landscape,
India's hottest young writer, Arundhati Roy described the bomb as
``the final act of betrayal by a ruling class that has failed its
people.'' In an 8,000-word essay carried this week in two popular
national weeklies, she wrote, ``it's far easier to make a bomb that
to educate 400 million people.''

Nigeria's Okocha bound for PSG, French paper says

	   PARIS (AP) - Paris Saint-Germain is ready to smash the French
transfer record by paying 95 million francs (dlrs 15.8 million) for
Nigerian star Jay-Jay Okocha, French daily L'Equipe reported
Tuesday.
	   Midfield playmaker Okocha, who currently plays in Turkey for
Fenerbahce, is in demand after a series of fine World Cup
performances for Nigeria.
	   World governing body FIFA selected Okocha in its all-star squad
of the 22 best players at France 98.
	   PSG officials declined to comment on whether the club has bid
for Okocha.
	   Marseille currently has the two most expensive players in French
club football, having paid 75 million francs each for Italian
international Fabrizio Ravenelli and former Metz star Robert Pires.

South Korean auto exports up in numbers, down in value
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's weaker currency helped
it sell 11.5 percent more cars abroad in this year's first six
months, but reduced its earnings from the sales, the government
said Tuesday.
	   Exports for January-June rose to 765,000 vehicles, but earnings
dropped 9.6 percent from last year's first half. The foreign sales
brought in dlrs 4.42 billion, compared with dlrs 4.88 billion from
selling 686,000 vehicles in January-June 1997.
	   A severe financial crisis hit South Korea last year. Its
currency lost more than half of its value against the U.S. dollar
before rising slowly in the past month.
	   Exports of cars with engines of 1,000cc or smaller rose 109
percent to dlrs 424 million, for 110,000 cars, Korea Customs
Service said in a news release.
	   Export of jeeps also rose by 94 percent to dlrs 302 million.
	   But shipments of passenger cars with 1,000 to 1,500cc engines
decreased 30 percent to dlrs 1.42 billion, for 307,000 cars.
	   South Korea is the world's fifth largest automaker, and produced
some 2.8 million cars last year. More than half of production was
meant for exports.
	   The Korea Auto Manufacturers' Association said the nation's
total car production will fall by more than 20 percent this year
because of sluggish domestic sales amid the financial crisis.

Confused tourists go far astray from Diana's grave
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Althorpe cq for village, Althorp for house &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ALTHORPE, England (AP) _ Villagers in Althorpe are getting used
to tourists asking directions to Princess Diana's grave. Just turn
south, drive 120 miles (200 kms) or so and there you are.
	   The confusion is easily understood. Diana is buried on the
grounds of Althorp House in Northamptonshire, 65 miles (100 kms)
northwest of London. But most maps wouldn't show the house, just
the nearby village of Great Brington.
	   However, some maps do show Althorpe, a village 185 miles (300
kms) north of London, on the edge of Scunthorpe.
	   Yvonne Sleight, who runs the Lansdowne House Hotel in Althorpe,
said lost travelers had been turning up since the princess' death
last year but numbers had increased since Althorp House and its new
Diana museum opened to the public this summer.
	   ``They are usually quite intelligent people but I don't think
they have researched their trip very well,'' Mrs. Sleight said.
``They are a bit gobsmacked (shocked) when they realize they are in
the wrong place.''
	   Many had bought tickets to enter Althorp House but had failed to
find out where it was, she said.
	   ``They just have a blank expression on their face. The majority
are actually foreign so sometimes it can be a bit difficult trying
to explain,'' Mrs. Sleight said.

North Korea to replace its ambassador to Thailand

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea has decided to replace its
ambassador to Bangkok, the communist state's official news media
reported Tuesday.
	   Ambassador Ri Sam Ro made a farewell visit to Korn Dabaransi,
head of Thailand's opposition Chart Pattana party, last Wednesday,
North Korea's official Pyongyang Radio reported.
	   Pyongyang Radio did not say who will replace Ri, said Seoul's
Naewoe Press, which monitors the North's news media.
	   Ri moved to Bangkok in late 1995 after serving as ambassador to
Indonesia, Naewoe Press said.

Debts mounting at Russia's huge electricity monopoly
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Gazprom also accumulating debts, breakdown of UES
debts, Finance Ministry canceling planned bond auction. ADDS
byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Unpaid bills are mounting at Russia's huge,
state-owned electricity and natural gas monopolies, despite
government promises to get tough with customers who do not pay
their bills, company officials said Tuesday.
	   Consumer debts to Unified Energy System, which controls most of
Russia's electrical grid, soared by 26 percent this year to 129
billion rubles (dlrs 20 billion) at the beginning of July, said
Alexander Remyozov, deputy chairman of the board.
	   Natural gas monopoly Gazprom, Russia's largest company, has
racked up consumer debts of 98.7 billion rubles (dlrs 15.9 billion
rubles), up 16 percent over last year, said its deputy board
chairman, Valery Remizov.
	   The two companies are at the center of Russia's enormous
non-payments crisis, being at once debtor and creditor to hundreds
of public and private companies throughout Russia.
	   ``Gazprom has ended up in a role of a cheap lender to the whole
Russian economy,'' Remizov said. He urged the Energy Ministry to
take tougher action against debtors, many of whom he said have
foreign currency bank accounts.
	   Earlier this year, the government appointed former First Deputy
Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais to head United Energy Systems and
resolve the cash crunch at the company which has changed little
since it was created out of the Soviet-era administrative system.
	   Instead, the government has contributed to the company's
problems.
	   Viktor Ott, the first deputy minister for fuel and energy, said
43 percent of all consumer debts to UES were from government-funded
agencies.
	   That includes 16 billion rubles (dlrs 2.6 billion) owed by the
federal government and 15.5 billion rubles (dlrs 2.5 billion) owed
by regional governments, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The government announced Saturday that it planned to sell an
addition 5 percent of Gazprom shares to raise tens if not hundreds
of millions of badly needed dollars. The government said Tuesday
that sale will take place this year.
	   In other economic news Tuesday, the Central Bank said that 363
of the 615 Russian commercial banks with registered capital of less
than 1 million ECUs (dlrs 1.1 million) are in financial trouble.
	   These banks must either close or merge with more stable
financial institutions by Jan. 1, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The Finance Ministry called off sales of two large lots of
treasury bills that had been planned for Wednesday, amid signs of
scant demand for the paper.
	   The cancellation of the sale of 6 billion rubles (dlrs 967
million) worth of interest-bearing bonds and 7 billion rubles (dlrs
1.12 billion) worth of discounted bonds signaled the continuing
lack of confidence that the Russian government has sufficient will
to set its finances straight.

Former strongman urges Nigerian democracy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Having ruled Nigeria as a dictator for
eight years, retired Gen. Ibrahim Babangida is now urging African
countries to embrace democracy for the good of the continent.
	   ``As we face the 21st century, it is incumbent upon us to unite
our people under the banner of democratization and constitutional
framework which includes rather than excludes,'' he said at a
political symposium in the capital of Abuja late Monday.
	   His comments follow weeks of turmoil in Nigeria in the wake of
the deaths of former dictator Gen. Sani Abacha and the country's
top opposition leader, Moshood Abiola. Both died of apparent heart
attacks one month apart.
	   ``The cost of maintaining a dictatorship, including the energy
dissipated and the blood expended in warding off challenges to the
monopoly of power ... makes it imperative that democracy is not
only an attractive option but a rational and inevitable system of
governance,'' Babangida said.
	   Babangida's faltering rule and indecision in 1993 cleared the
way for Abacha's takeover. Babangida that year canceled civilian
presidential elections that Abiola was widely believed to have won.
	   Abacha subsequently pushed Babangida from power, jailed Abiola
and plunged Nigeria into one its most repressive eras, during which
hundreds of dissidents and political opponents were jailed, exiled
and at times executed.
	   Abacha's death was hailed as the end of tyranny in Nigeria,
while Abiola's death in detention triggered riots among outraged
supporters.
	   For all but 10 of its 38 years as an independent country,
Nigeria has been ruled by the military in a successive run of coups
and counter-coups that have stifled most attempts at democratic
reform.
	   The country's newest military ruler, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar,
however, has vowed to bring democracy and civilian rule to Nigeria
by next year. As a show of good faith, he has freed hundreds of
prisoners, including leading dissidents and government opponents.

 &UR; BMW buys Rolls-Royce brand name, leaving VW to produce Bentleys &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos LON109-110 &QL; 
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The grandest name of British motoring,
Rolls-Royce, was shaken up Tuesday in a deal that will see separate
German automakers producing Rolls-Royce and Bentley models early in
the next century.
	   BMW will make Rolls-Royces after buying the rights to the famous
brand and announcing plans to create a new Rolls-Royce company,
while Volkwswagen AG will keep the old Rolls-Royce factory it just
bought and continue producing the Bentley line of luxury cars.
	   VW paid 479 million pounds (dlrs 790 million) for Rolls-Royce
Motor Cars Ltd. early this month, but Europe's biggest automaker
faced one big problem: It didn't get the rights to the Rolls-Royce
brand name and logo.
	   Those were held by the British jet engine maker Rolls-Royce PLC,
which had hoped the luxury carmaker would be sold to Germany's BMW.
Rolls-Royce PLC said Tuesday it would sell the Rolls-Royce auto
brand to BMW for 40 million pounds (dlrs 66 million).
	   BMW said Tuesday that VW can use the Rolls-Royce name for free
until Dec. 31, 2002, but after that BMW will take the name away and
create a new Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd.
	   The VW chairman, Ferdinand Piech, disputed suggestions that the
deal was a defeat, insisting in a news conference that VW paid a
fair price for what it got. Piech said Tuesday's accord was a
better solution than a drawn-out legal fight over the name.
	   ``I would have preferred to keep both brands, but the way _ how
it developed today _ I am very satisfied,'' Piech told a news
conference.
	   The uncertainty over what would happen at Rolls-Royce has pushed
new orders of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars down by about 30 percent
over the past six weeks, but Rolls-Royce Motor Cars chairman Graham
Morris predicted they could rebound now that the rival German
carmakers have made their peace.
	   VW will keep the Rolls-Royce factory in Crewe, England, but the
company's name will be changed in 2003 to Bentley Motor Cars Ltd.
and VW will produce Bentleys, the other line of luxury cars now
made by Rolls-Royce that accounts for about 70 percent of the cars
sold by the company.
	   It remains unclear how much BMW will spend to set up a new
Rolls-Royce company or precisely where it will be located.
	   BMW chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder would say only that
Rolls-Royces would be made in England, but probably not in any of
the manufacturing plants it now owns through its Rover subsidiary.
	   ``How much it will cost, I don't know,'' Pischetsrieder told
reporters.
	   Rolls-Royce Motor Cars was put up for sale last autumn by the
British conglomerate Vickers PLC, which wanted out of the
automotive business to focus on other operations including defense
contracting.
	   The sale of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars to the Germans drew angry
patriotic outbursts from many Englishmen, as well as a couple of
failed attempts to keep the famous company British.
	   VW outbid BMW in the spring, but Rolls-Royce PLC made it clear
that it favored selling the company to BMW, its partner in a jet
engine venture.
	   Rolls-Royce PLC was separated from the motor car business in an
early 1970s restructuring _ but it maintained the rights to the
all-important brand name.
	   Rolls-Royce PLC will hold a seat on the board of the new
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, BMW said.
	   The Rolls-Royce PLC chairman, Sir Ralph Robins, called the deal
``an Anglo-German success.''
	   But one question was posed several times with no precise
answers: Why didn't VW even try to buy the Rolls-Royce brand name
from the British owners?
	   Piech said he never even met Robins until Tuesday morning, after
the deal with BMW had been done, and he sidestepped questions about
why he hadn't gone after the Rolls-Royce name after paying so much
for the company.
	   Robins disputed suggestions he might have gotten a better price
for the brand by talking to both German carmakers.
	   ``We don't think we sold it too cheaply,'' Robins said.
	   As part of Tuesday's deal, BMW withdrew its earlier threat to
cut off engines it supplies to Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.
	   BMW said it will sell engines for Rolls-Royce models through
Dec. 31, 2002, when it then will begin using the brand name at its
own new company. BMW said it's willing to keep providing engines
for the Bentley Arnage models as long as VW continues to make them.
	   The German automakers said that after BMW starts making
Rolls-Royces and VW concentrates on making Bentleys, they will
cooperate on producing Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph models at the old
factory in Crewe.

Poll: Israeli support for Palestinian state drops
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Support among Israeli Jews for the
establishment of a Palestinian state has dropped in the past year,
according to a survey released Tuesday.
	   The survey, conducted annually by the Jaffee Center for
Strategic Studies, also found that fewer Israeli Jews believe that
most Palestinians want peace.
	   The center polled 1,207 Jewish adults between late January and
early March and found that while 66 percent believe a Palestinian
state will eventually be established, just 44 percent support that
happening.
	   In 1997, 51 percent of Israeli Jews said they supported the
establishment of a Palestinian state.
	   Since 1997, the percentage of Israeli Jews who said they believe
that most Palestinians want peace dropped from 65 percent to 55
percent, the survey found.
	   In 1996, when Israel was hit by a series of terrorist attacks,
only 40 percent of those surveyed said they believed the
Palestinians wanted peace.
	   The poll also found a decrease in willingness to return land for
peace _ from 54 percent to 44 percent, although support remained
high _ 83 percent, compared to 89 percent in 1997 _ for continuing
peace talks with the Palestinians.
	   The poll had a margin of error was 2.8 percent.

Huge demand for tickets for fifth test
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In the euphoria of the stunning eight-wicket
victory over South Africa, England and Wales Cricket Board chairman
Lord MacLaurin summed up the mood by saying England's win would
lift the ``whole country's spirits.''
	   He was right.
	   Ticket sellers for the fifth and deciding test at Headingley
next week were besieged Tuesday by fans desperate to get a seat for
one of the five days play.
	   On Monday, politicians interrupted question time in the House of
Commons to congratulate the England cricket team on its stirring
win.
	   Until now, the nation's cricketers had taken a backseat to the
World Cup, Wimbledon, the British Open golf and the seemingly
unbeatable South African opposition.
	   England secured a draw in the first test of the series but was
comprehensively outplayed by South Africa in the second test at
Lord's, losing by 10 wickets.
	   In the third test at Old Trafford, the home side just managed to
avoid suffering the same fate when the last two batsmen saw out the
final overs of the fifth day to salvage a draw.
	   But in the fourth test former skipper Michael Atherton's 98 not
out and Angus Fraser's inspirational bowling _ after he was almost
omitted from the team _ gave the fans something to cheer about with
the series level at 1-1.
	   Some controversial umpiring, a tinge of dissent, and a fired-up
South African pace bowler Allan Donald _ who unleashed an hour of
short-pitched bowling at Atherton after an umpiring decision went
against him _ has suddenly revived interest in England's national
game.
	   ``Resurgent England win over critics'' was the back page
headline of the Times newspaper Tuesday.
	   The Times said the win was all English fans needed to renew
interest in the game.
	   ``In all the talk of decline and apathy, the truth was that
cricket only needed a winning national team,'' the article said.
	   The Daily Express printed a picture of Atherton _ bat and helmet
held high in triumph _ on its front page and the headline suggested
that England's win signalled the start of summer.
	   The Daily Telegraph reported England's win put a new complexion
on the game.
	   ``Banishing the mordent prophets of doom, England won the fourth
test...creating a rush of tickets for the final test and putting a
smile back on the game,'' the article said.
	   Headingley box office spokesman David Ryder said the response
for tickets Tuesday was phenomenal, a stark comparison with last
week when ticket sales looked bleak.
	   The prospect of victory had already recaptured the public's
attention Monday _ the crowd which streamed into the stadium was
the biggest fifth-day attendance in England since the West Indies
played at The Oval in 1991.
	   ``It was a test match where there wasn't a lot else going on
like football, golf or tennis and it was important we made an
impact for the crowd and ourselves,'' Atherton said.
	   ``It's difficult for a team or player to carry the expectations
of a nation with them, but we are aware that we have not won as
much as we should have done.''
	   ECB chairman of selectors David Graveney said cricket had center
stage for the first time this season.
	   ``So far there has been talk of doom and gloom and that has been
fair enough because if you lose you must expect that,'' he said.
	   ``Now we have put in a tremendous performance and overall it is
the game of cricket in this country that is the winner.''

Army says it repulsed rebel attack on border with Eritrea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's army spokesman said Tuesday that
government forces repulsed an attack by southern rebels on the
border with neighboring Eritrea.
	   The statement came three days after the rebel Sudan Peoples
Liberation Army claimed it killed at least 93 government soldiers
in fighting near the border late last week.
	   Sudan's army spokesman, Gen. Abdel Rahman Sirul-Khatam, told
state-run radio that government forces wiped out the ``hostile
troops'' and captured a tank.
	   He said the crewmen of the tank were taken prisoner. He gave no
other details of the fighting or figures on government casualties.
	   On Sunday, the SPLA said its fighters repulsed an offensive by
the army against its bases at Oulo, near the border with Eritrea.
The rebel group said it killed 93 soldiers and captured 10 others
in the fighting last Thursday.
	   The SPLA as been fighting since 1983 for more autonomy for the
south's Christians and animists from the Muslim north. An estimated
1.5 million people have died in the fighting and accompanying
famines.
	   The SPLA is allied with northern opposition groups in the
Eritrea-headquartered National Democratic Alliance. Northern
fighters have from time to time launched their own offensives along
the Eritrea border.

Russia lashes out at Georgia after attack on peacekeepers in
</HEADLINE>
Abkhazia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After a bombing that injured three Russian
peacekeepers in Georgia's breakaway region of Abkhazia, Russia
accused the Georgian government on Tuesday of fueling tension in
the Black Sea province.
	   ``The continuous terrorist actions against the Russian
peacekeepers have been carried as part of a plan, with the Georgian
authorities' connivance,'' the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a
statement released to the media.
	   The unusually harsh statement blamed Georgia for failing to
fulfill its obligations to stop ``gang-style activities.''
	   The mine explosion on Monday was the third such attack on
Russian troops in two weeks. Altogether, five peacekeepers have
been killed and 12 wounded in the bombings.
	   The peacekeepers were sent to stabilize Abkhazia in 1994
following a civil war in which separatists drove out Georgian
government troops. Large-scale hostilities have seized, but
sporadic clashes between separatists and pro-government militia
have continued in spite of the peacekeepers' presence.
	   Russia has joined Abkhazian leaders in blaming Georgian White
Legion fighters for most of the attacks. The White Legion has
denied the charges.
	   For its part, the Georgian government has often accused Russian
peacekeepers of backing separatists and periodically threatened to
have them withdrawn.
	   There was no immediate reaction to the Russian statement from
the Georgian government.

Indians joke about nuclear tests during ASEAN entertainment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ India's delegation to a Southeast
Asian security conference joked about its nuclear weapons testing
in a song parody prepared for performance Tuesday night at the
forum's closing banquet.
	   ``Why such fuss over a few crackers in the Thar,'' said one line
in the song, referring to the desert where India stunned the world
by conducting nuclear tests in May.
	   At the final banquet of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations' annual meeting with counterparts from major powers outside
the region, the delegations traditionally perform either cultural
dances or song parodies.
	   Last year, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was the
hit of the conference with an Evita-style rendition of ``Don't cry
for me ASEAN.''
	   The Indian song, with words set to a famous old movie tune,
suggests that the nuclear tests were not such a big deal, compared
to those by other nations.
	   ``They weren't as loud as Nevada and Lop Nor,'' the song said,
mentioning the sites of U.S. and Chinese tests.
	   ``Talk of your bikinis, talk of your atolls, before you talk of
our sands,'' went another line, referring to U.S. and French
nuclear tests in the South Pacific.
	   The song's humor contrasted sharply with the dour mood conveyed
Monday by India's delegation chief, Jaswant Singh, as he told a
news conference of his sadness and regret over a statement from the
multinational gathering that ``deplored'' the nuclear tests by
India and Pakistan.
	   As the banquet was held behind closed doors, it was not
immediately possible to confirm whether the stentorian Singh
actually sang with his aides.
	   But a copy of the song made available to The Associated Press
bore the heading: ``Song sung by Shri Jaswant Singh and the Indian
delegation.''
	   The song began with words in the Hindi language meaning:
	   ``Forget the whole thing.
	   ``What has happened before is something old.
	   ``We will write a new story, together in a new era
	   ``We are Indian, we are Indian.''

Guinea-Bissau cease-fire reported broken by government forces
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Rebels who launched a coup attempt in
Guinea-Bissau in West Africa seven weeks ago, claimed Tuesday that
government forces have violated a cease-fire agreement signed last
weekend, according to news reports.
	   The rebels' radio station alleged that Senegalese forces
supporting President Joao Bernardo Vieira fired at rebel positions
near Bafata, the former Portuguese colony's second-largest city,
media reports here said.
	   The Portuguese Foreign Ministry said its officials in the
country had heard shots but could not say who fired them.
	   ``There were minor, isolated incidents _ mostly sporadic
gunshots _ around the capital and in the hinterland at dawn,'' a
Foreign Ministry spokesman said by phone.
	   The rebels, who claim the loyalty of most of the country's
6,000-strong army, also alleged that government forces had blasted
a bridge in the Bafata area, about 140 kilometers (85 miles)
northeast of the capital.
	   The government and the breakaway military faction agreed Sunday
to a cease-fire ahead of further talks to end the conflict which
has displaced some 200,000 people _ about one-fifth of the
population.
	   The agreement was brokered by a Portuguese-speaking delegation
made up of diplomats from Portugal, Brazil, Angola, Mozambique,
Cape Verde, and Sao Tome and Principe.
	   They are due to facilitate a new meeting on Friday in the Cape
Verde islands, about 700 kilometers (430 miles) off the coast of
Senegal. The possible deployment of an international monitoring
force is expected to be discussed.
	   The conflict erupted June 7 after Mane, a former Armed Forces
chief-of-staff, was dismissed for allegedly smuggling arms to
Senegal's Casamance separatists.
	   No numbers were available on how many were killed in the
fighting, which also has spread to inland areas of this small
country wedged between Senegal and Guinea.

Israel considers granting citizenship to soldiers' families
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VITA BEKKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ When Israeli combat soldier Oleg Pilchenko came
home on his monthly leaves last year, no one was there to greet
him.
	   Since his mother and teenage brother moved to Israel from the
Ukraine last October, Pilchenko is much happier, he said Tuesday.
	   But Israel's Interior Ministry has denied applications by
Valentina Pilchenko, who is not Jewish, for citizenship. Her
tourist visa expired last month, and if her request for permanent
residency is denied, she may be forced to leave Israel _ and her
son.
	   The non-Jewish parents and wives of more than 100 soldiers who
immigrated from the former Soviet Union have had their applications
for Israeli citizenship denied by the Interior Ministry, according
to Roman Bronfman, a lawmaker from Israel's Immigrants' Party.
	   On Monday, the Knesset approved the first reading of a bill that
would grant citizenship to the non-Jewish immediate relatives of
immigrant soldiers. The bill, which faces opposition from religious
parties, has to pass three readings before it becomes a law.
	   ``Soldiers who serve as fighters need their families by them,''
said Marina Solodkin, another Immigrants' Party lawmaker.
	   While the bill stays on the Knesset floor, Pilchenko's mother
stays home, unemployed because her tourist visa won't allow her to
work or to get health insurance.
	   ``I don't want her to leave,'' said Pilchenko, 25, who
immigrated to Israel five years ago. He was not raised as a Jew,
but because his father is Jewish he was granted citizenship under
Israel's Law of Return, which grants automatic citizenship and
benefits to immigrants with at least one Jewish grandparent. His
parents are divorced.
	   ``I defend this country even though I am not Jewish,'' Pilchenko
said. ``But I don't get anything back.''

Brazil's 'keeper arrives in Turkey to join champion team

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Brazilian goalkeeper Taffarel, whose
penalty saves led his national team to this year's World Cup final,
arrived in Istanbul Tuesday to begin training with champion
Galatasaray.
	   The goalkeeper, whose transfer looked in doubt two weeks ago
because of a dispute over pay, said he came with the will to fight
for Galatasaray to maintain its title as Turkish league champion.
	   ``There is the will to win. There is a lot of work, and it
doesn't only depend on me, but the will is there,'' Taffarel said
upon arrival at Istanbul airport accompanied by his wife, Andrea,
and their two children.
	   Taffarel signed a preliminary dlrs 1.5 million two-year contract
with the Turkish team during the World Cup in Paris on June 24. He
is scheduled to sign a final contract Wednesday, reports said.
	   The 32-year-old 'keeper has already won the hearts of
Galatasaray fans by saving two penalty shots in the World Cup
semifinal against the Netherlands. But his standout performances
could not prevent Brazil's 3-0 defeat by France in the final.
	   Taffarel was a starter on Brazil's World Cup team in 1990. The
team was knocked out in the second round and the sometimes erratic
'keeper began a long slide that reached a low point when he was
benched by Italy's Parma.
	   In the 1994 World Cup, however, Taffarel only conceded three
goals and Brazil won an unprecedented fourth title.
	   Galatasaray finished last season with a 23-6-5 record and 75
points, four points ahead of rival Fenerbahce. The club has been
desperately seeking a goalkeeper for the past few years worthy of
the champion team.
	   His transfer from Atletico Mineiro should boost Galatasaray's
power against big rival Fenerbahce which recently hired another
Brazilian soccer player, Sergio Neves, from Saudi Arabia's Alahari
team.

Confidence restored in Swiss Guard, interim commander says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss Guard's morale has been
largely restored almost three months after the slaying of the tiny
papal force's commander, his temporary successor said in an
interview published Tuesday.
	   Roland Buchs said that, while investigations continue, he sees
no reason to doubt the Vatican's version of Alois Estermann's
death. ``Another theory would surprise me,'' he was quoted as
saying in the Lausanne daily Le Matin.
	   The Vatican says young guardsman Cedric Tornay, bitter because
of a reprimand by Estermann and the latter's failure to award him a
medal, fatally shot Estermann and his wife, Gladys Meza Romero, and
then killed himself, in the couple's Vatican apartment in May.
	   ``I think that only God knows the absolute truth and the exact
motivations behind this tragedy,'' Buchs said, adding that he has
full confidence in Vatican justice.
	   Buchs, the former commander who took over following the death of
Alois Estermann, steps down Saturday to make way for new permanent
commander Pius Segmueller.
	   He will take over the security service at the Swiss federal
parliament building in Bern when he leaves Rome after 22 years.
	   Segmueller takes up the post in favorable conditions, Buchs
said. ``The young (guardsmen) in particular hope to have a more
open dialogue'' with the leadership, he said.

Seat in ex-Khmer Rouge stronghold goes to opposition leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GRANT PECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ While opposition leader Sam Rainsy
claims his party was cheated out of several parliamentary seats in
this week's election, the upstart group turned the tables in one
area _ a bastion of the former Khmer Rouge guerrillas.
	   The sole seat in the western province of Pailin was easily
captured by the Sam Rainsy Party, which won 5,733 votes, or more
than two-thirds of the 8,505 votes cast Sunday, a party official
said Tuesday.
	   Ros Sakarach said the other main opposition party, FUNCINPEC,
came in second with 2,180 votes and the ruling Cambodian People's
Party had 336.
	   The figures were phoned in by the party's agents, but apparently
reflected the official total. It was not clear if the total was a
final tally, because there were more than 15,000 registered voters.
	   However, an unofficial tally by the CPP _ disputed by the Sam
Rainsy Party on most points _ backed up the result.
	   Conventional wisdom held that the province would go the ruling
party. The former guerrillas have had a comfortable accommodation
with strongman Hun Sen since making peace two years ago.
	   Governor Y Chhien, a former guerrilla commander, was publicly
neutral in the election. But his political mentor, former Khmer
Rouge foreign minister Ieng Sary, endorsed the CPP.
	   It was expected that Y Chhien, who runs the province like a
fiefdom, would deliver the vote for Hun Sen's party.
	   So how did the Sam Rainsy Party win?
	   ``We just campaigned normally and conducted less activity than
in other provinces,'' said Ros Sakarach. ``In Pailin, people are
very sure. They know democracy after a very long time suffering in
war and they know correctly who to choose.''
	   Many of the former Khmer Rouge guerrillas say they gave up their
struggle because they were tired of fighting decades of civil war.
	   Most were voting for the first time in their lives. When the
Khmer Rouge held power from 1975 to 1979, advocating participation
in elections would have been a capital crime.
	   The Maoist-inspired revolutionary regime caused the deaths of as
many as 2 million Cambodians.
	   Historically, the Khmer Rouge had detested Hun Sen and his
party, viewing them as puppets of Cambodia's historic enemy,
Vietnam, which toppled the Khmer Rouge government.
	   Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge officer, defected to Vietnam in
1977 to escape bloody purges. In 1985, he became prime minister of
the Hanoi-backed state that succeeded the Khmer Rouge.
	   Sam Rainsy, a former finance minister, was accused during the
campaign of pandering to the deep-rooted anti-Vietnamese sentiments
many Cambodians hold.

Poll: Israeli support for Palestinian state drops
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Support among Israeli Jews for the
establishment of a Palestinian state has dropped in the past year,
according to a survey released Tuesday.
	   The survey, conducted annually by the Jaffee Center for
Strategic Studies, also found that fewer Israeli Jews believe that
most Palestinians want peace.
	   The center polled 1,207 Jewish adults between late January and
early March and found that while 66 percent believe a Palestinian
state will eventually be established, just 44 percent support that
happening.
	   In 1997, 51 percent of Israeli Jews said they supported the
establishment of a Palestinian state.
	   Since 1997, the percentage of Israeli Jews who said they believe
that most Palestinians want peace dropped from 65 percent to 55
percent, the survey found.
	   In 1996, when Israel was hit by a series of terrorist attacks,
only 40 percent of those surveyed said they believed the
Palestinians wanted peace.

EU says internal measures now key to Asia recovery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The European Union believes it is now
largely up to crisis-hit East Asian countries themselves to revive
their embattled economies, an official said Tuesday.
	   ``The main work has to be done internally and must come from
national governments,'' said Wolfgang Schuessel, president of the
EU Council.
	   Schuessel noted that an international framework for pulling the
region out of its year-old crisis has already been established, and
that the focus of future remedies must come from the afflicted
countries themselves.
	   Schuessel is attending a gathering in Manila of foreign
ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and their
counterparts from other regions, including the United States,
Russia and China.
	   At the gathering, ASEAN asked the world powers for new financing
and investment to speed the region's recovery.
	   But the United States, Japan and other countries did not
announce any new rescue packages and said that while they will
continue to help, the ASEAN countries must persevere with painful
political and economic reforms if they are to recover.
	   Schuessel said the European Union remains committed to keeping
its markets open to Asian goods as its main contribution to
alleviating the economic crisis in Asia.
	   He echoed the view of his ASEAN counterparts that there can be
no meaningful recovery unless Japan _ an engine of growth in the
region _ comes to grips with its economic and financial problems.
	   Schuessel said, however, that Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo
Obuchi, who is set to become the next prime minister, is fully
aware of what needs to be done to revive the economy and clean up
Japan's shaky financial system. Obuchi briefly attended the ASEAN
gathering Sunday.
	   ``Everyone can expect something from his leadership,'' Schuessel
said.

Military says 19 Tamil rebels, seven soldiers killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lankan troops shot and killed 19
Tamil rebels and lost seven soldiers in two encounters in the
latest battle in the northern war theater, a military spokesman
said Tuesday.
	   Nine rebels and seven soldiers were killed in a battle near the
rebel-held town of Mankulam on Monday, the spokesman, Colonel
Ranjith Witana, said in a statement. Mortar and rifle fire also
wounded 19 soldiers.
	   The other deaths occurred in the nearby town of Kilinochchi
north of Mankulam.
	   Mankulam, a key junction 250 kilometers (155 miles) north of the
capital, Colombo, is heavily fortified with mines, underground
bunkers, razor wire and booby traps. Rebels controlling the town
have been holding out against the army for months.
	   Mankulam controls a 77-kilometer (48-mile) road the army has
been trying to capture since May 1997 in the longest and bloodiest
offensive of its 15-year-old civil war.
	   The road would link Jaffna, a former rebel stronghold captured
by the army two years ago, with the rest of the country. Since the
army takeover, Jaffna's half million people have had to rely on air
and sea deliveries for food and other supplies.
	   The rebels are fighting for an independent Tamil homeland for
the minority Tamils saying they are discriminated against in
Sinhalese-majority Sri Lanka. Over 54,000 people have died in the
insurrection.

Ukrainian authorities threaten to suspend Jewish Agency's
</HEADLINE>
activities &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine might suspend the activities of the
Jewish Agency's Ukrainian branch because its offices in most
regions of the former Soviet republic operate illegally, the
Justice Ministry said Tuesday.
	   The ministry said it has issued an official warning to Mordechai
Paz, the head of the local branch of the agency, also known as
Sokhnut, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The agency is a quasi-governmental body based in Israel, which
promotes Jewish immigration to Israel and educational and cultural
activities among world Jews.
	   Since the late 1980s, it has coordinated the emigration of
hundreds of thousands of Jews from the former Soviet Union to
Israel.
	   Ukraine's Justice Ministry pointed out that agency
representatives were violating Ukrainian laws by working in regions
where Sokhnut has not formally registered its offices.
	   Such offices are licensed to operate only in the Odessa,
Kharkiv, Mykolaiv and Chernivtsi regions, it noted, according to
Interfax.
	   In 1996, the Jewish Agency faced similar problems in Russia, and
it had its license temporarily revoked. Russian authorities have
accused the agency of running regional branches despite a law
forbidding foreign public bodies to do so.
	   The sides later worked out a deal under which the agency was
accredited as a local public body, affiliated with the Jewish
Agency in Israel but run by Russian Jews.

Maritime rescuers seek 15 would-be immigrants missing at sea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGECIRAS, Spain (AP) _ Spanish rescuers searched Tuesday for 15
would-be immigrants missing since their rudimentary boat overturned
two days earlier.
	   Five bodies were recovered and seven people rescued alive
Sunday.
	   Survivors told the authorities that the boat had set off from
Morocco heading for the southern Spanish coast with 27 people
aboard, Civil Guard spokesman Javier Cantifano said.
	   The single-engine boat ran into trouble because it was
overloaded and in bad condition, Cantifano said.
	   The number of people attempting to enter Spain clandestinely by
sea appears to be on the rise. About 2,000 illegal immigrants were
detained in all of 1997, only 400 more than the number seized
during the first six months of this year, Cantifano said.
	   Driven by poverty at home, thousands of people attempt each year
to cross the Mediterranean Sea from North Africa and enter unseen
into Europe. Almost all the would-be immigrants are men and most
are from Morocco.
	   Spain is a favored point of entry because the stretch of sea
separating it from Africa is only 15 kilometers (nine miles) wide
in places.
	   Most attempt the crossing in crude wooden boats at night. The
number of attempts rise sharply during the summer when seas are
calmer.

Turkey and Romania urge pressure on Belgrade

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The presidents of Romania and Turkey on
Tuesday urged greater international pressure on Yugoslavia to end
fighting in the troubled Kosovo province.
	   Romanian President Emil Constantinescu, who is on a one-day
visit, and his Turkish counterpart, Suleyman Demirel, also agreed
on the urgent need for a multinational peace force for the Balkans
region.
	   Both Turkey and Romania are concerned that the fighting in
Kosovo may degenerate into another Bosnia and destabilize the
Balkan region.
	   ``We agree on the subject of forming a multinational force,''
Constantinescu told reporters in a joint news conference.
	   Hundreds of people have died in Kosovo and tens of thousands of
others have fled their homes, since long-standing tensions erupted
into violent clashes five months ago, following a crackdown by
Serb-led security forces on Kosovo Albanian separatists.
	   Relations between Turkey and Romania have soared in recent
years. Both Constantinescu and Demirel pay regular visits to each
other's countries.
	   Demirel said both countries would aim to up trade to dlrs 1
billion in the coming years. Two-way trade between the two stood at
dlrs 200 million in the first half of this year.
	   In a gesture to the visiting Romanian president, the Turkish
Parliament's foreign affairs commission on Tuesday approved NATO's
enlargement to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic and
also recommended Bulgaria and Romania be part of the next
enlargement process.

Greece tries to mend fences with US
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece tried to mend fences with the
United States on Tuesday, but did not apologize for saying
President Bill Clinton lied about his Cyprus policies.
	   ``A small inconvenience was created on both sides and we think
this inconvenience was a small parenthesis that has closed,'' said
government spokesman Dimitris Reppas.
	   Reppas said that although ``Greek American relations are good,
they must and can become much better.''
	   A series of comments made over the past week by Foreign Minister
Theodoros Pangalos were condemned Monday by the U.S. State
Department.
	   ``They are so outrageous and so unbecoming of the foreign
minister of a NATO ally that we would be surprised if anyone took
them seriously,'' said spokesman James P. Rubin.
	   Pangalos last week twice blamed for reneging on pre-election
promises to make Cyprus a top U.S. foreign policy priority. In an
unprecedented remark, Pangalos called Clinton a ``liar.''
	   On Sunday, Pangalos said Greece and the region had suffered
enough over the years because of involvement by the United States.
	   ``Your help, your friendship _ we have had enough of them. Leave
the people of Turkey and Greece, of the region, at peace. Stop
working for our good. We have seen this good. Thank you very much,
we have had enough,'' Pangalos said.
	   Reppas has defended Pangalos' remarks. But Reppas added he
discussed Pangalos' remarks with U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Burns
late Monday.
	   ``The temperature is already high and we have to bring it
down,'' Reppas said.
	   Cyprus has been divided since the 1974 Turkish occupation of its
northern third, sparked by an attempted coup by supporters of union
with Greece. A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north is
recognized only by Turkey.

Budget hike to be used for nuclear power, not weapons: scientist
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAMOLA TALWAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ A top scientist who was a key planner of
India's nuclear tests said Tuesday that most his department's
increased federal funds would be spent on nuclear power, not
weapons.
	   The federal budget introduced in June, just three weeks after
India detonated underground nuclear explosions, increased the
budgets of the Atomic Energy Commission and the nation's space
program by more than 60 percent. The budget, which Parliament
approved last week, also raised defense spending by 14 percent.
	   People assumed the extra funds would go for developing nuclear
weapons and missiles, said R. Chidambaram, the commission chairman,
speaking to a meeting of scientists. But they were wrong.
	   ``Most of the money is going for nuclear power generation,'' he
said.
	   He said India intended to increase the 1,800 megawatts now
produced by its 10 nuclear reactors, and to build new reactors. He
didn't say how much would be devoted to the weapons program.
	   Nuclear power is expected to double in Asia, at the same time
that the United States and Europe reduces its dependency of nuclear
energy, he said. Atomic reactors are crucial to energy-starved
India since it is cheaper than thermal power.
	   Four new power stations in southern and western India will
become commercially operational next year, while work on two
projects in Bombay will soon begin, said Y.S.R. Prasad, chairman
and managing director of the Nuclear Power Corporation.
	   Russia and India signed an agreement last week for a dlrs 2.6
billion sale of two 1,000-megawatt light water reactors that will
be built in southern India.

Moldavian student arrested with heroin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A Moldavian student was in police custody
Tuesday after she tried to smuggle three kilograms (6.6 pounds) of
heroin into Greece from Turkey.
	   Svetlana Gradinarou, a 23 year-old student at the University of
Romania, was arrested Monday on Greece's northern border with
Turkey after customs officials found the heroin folded inside a
pair of thick leggings and a plastic pouch.
	   Traveling on a bus from Istanbul to Athens, Gradinarou was using
a fake French passport.
	   Gradinarou told customs officials the passport and drugs were
given to her in Istanbul by a drug dealer she identified only as
Ali. She was to deliver the drugs to an unidentified man at a train
station in the northern port city of Salonica.

Iran, Iraq exchange remains of soldiers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran and Iraq on Tuesday exchanged the
remains of 183 soldiers killed during their 1980-88 war, Iranian
radio reported.
	   Iran handed over the remains of 83 Iraqi soldiers killed during
the conflict and Iraq delivered the bodies of 100 Iranian soldiers,
the radio said.
	   The remains were recovered after a joint search operation, the
radio reported. The operations started four months ago, it said.
	   The exchange took place on the Iran-Iraq border in southwestern
Khuzestan province.
	   The war, which killed or wounded at least 1 million people from
both sides, ended with a U.N. brokered cease-fire but animosity has
persisted over the issue of prisoners.
	   The two countries recently exchanged thousands of prisoners of
war. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross,
some 75,000 POWs on both sides have been freed since the war ended.

Ten banks file lawsuit against Thai Chrysler alleging loan default
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Eight international banks have joined
two others in a bankruptcy suit filed in a Thai court against the
Thai subsidiary of U.S. automaker Chrysler, sources from the banks
said Tuesday.
	   The banks say Thai Chrysler Automotive defaulted on dlrs 40
million in loans. In addition, two more Thai banks, Bangkok Bank
and Bank of Ayudhya, are preparing lawsuits against the company,
said a source who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
	   The 10 banks filed their suit Monday. Chrysler officials could
not be contacted Tuesday.
	   Thai Chrysler, established in 1994, is listed on the Thai stock
exchange. Swedish Motors holds a 70 percent share and Chrysler
U.S.A. holds 30 percent.
	   The U.S. automaker is attempting to sever its links with the
Thai subsidiary to set up a new company to handle its business in
the Southeast Asian nation.
	   The American auto giant has established a wholly owned
subsidiary named Chrysler Sales and Service to handle sales,
distribution and service of Chrysler products in Thailand,
according to the source.
	   The 10 banks that filed suit against Thai Chrysler are Bank of
Montreal, Citibank Finance Ltd., the ING Bank, KBC Bank, Bayerische
Vereinsbank AG, The Development Bank of Singapore, The Fuji Bank,
and the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan, Deutsche Bank and
Industrial Bank of Japan.
	   The creditors have already won an injunction barring the company
from exporting 271 Jeep Grand Cherokee sport utility vehicles worth
dlrs 6.7 million.

Coal miners take mine chief hostage in Russian Far East
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in graf 5 with intermediaries returning equivalent of
over dlrs 20 million to Siberian coal companies. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) _ Disgruntled coal miners in the
Russian Far East took the director of their mine hostage Tuesday to
press demands for payment of nine months of back wages, a news
agency reported.
	   About 10 workers at the Nagornaya mine in the town of Partizansk
occupied the director's office Tuesday and said they would not
permit him to leave.
	   ``We'll be here until we get our money,'' Viktor Grubov, a
spokesman for the miners, told The Associated Press by telephone.
	   The director, Viktor Trukhin, said he is being held against his
will but supports the miners' demands. He and the miners plan to
meet Wednesday with local officials and the mine's biggest debtor,
the electric company Dalenergo.
	   In the Siberian region of Kemerovo, coal-selling companies have
returned 130 million rubles (dlrs 20 million) to their suppliers
after police investigated the companies for allegedly dishonest
business practices, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Tuesday. The
government has blamed such intermediaries for part of its debt to
coal miners.
	   The incident in Partizansk was one of several ongoing miners'
protests in various regions of Russia, which has experienced
sporadic miners' strikes since early May.
	   Farther north, miners on the island of Sakhalin continued to
block coal shipments to the region's major power plant, demanding
that energy officials pay for coal that has already been delivered,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Because of the delayed payments, coal miners say they have not
been paid in eight months.
	   The miners have blocked the delivery of more than 70 rail cars
carrying 4,000 tons of coal, Yuri Kuzin of the Sakhalinenergo
company told the Interfax news agency. Kuzin said the plant may
have to shut down on Friday unless its fuel supplies are
replenished.
	   Other miners' protests include two rail blockades _ one in the
town of Osinniki in the Siberian Kuzbass mining region, and another
near the Ural Mountains city of Chelyabinsk.
	   The most visible protest is in Moscow, where a group of about
200 miners have been camped outside the government's main
administration building since early June.
	   The protests have been largely uncoordinated and have not
inflicted significant damage on the economy.

Congress Party in India says government should go

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ In her first public protest since taking
command of the powerful Congress Party, Sonia Gandhi led a rally of
50,000 people Tuesday to denounce the failure of India's right-wing
government to control rising food prices and spiraling crime.
	   The crowd was far less than Congress had expected, thinned by a
heavy police cordon that blocked tens of thousands of people from
joining the activists who jammed downtown streets near Parliament.
	   ``Topple the government!'' the crowd chanted.
	   But Mrs. Gandhi said the Congress, which governed India for 45
of its 50 years since independence, will remain satisfied for now
to be a responsible opposition party in Parliament, where no party
has a clear majority.
	   Some Congress leaders have cautioned Mrs. Gandhi against the
temptation of trying to oust the weak 4-month-old government, since
a Congress government could not be expected to fare much better.
	   Mrs. Gandhi lashed the government for prices that have touched
an all-time high. Crime in the capital is so rampant that many of
its 11 million citizens no longer feel safe, the Italian-born
Gandhi said in a five-minute speech in accented Hindi.
	   The protest was something of a letdown for Congress, which had
announced that Mrs. Gandhi would lead a procession of 500,000 party
workers through the streets. Police refused to allow her to march,
since she remains a high-security risk following the 1991
assassination of her husband, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
	   About 100,000 people were brought in buses to a park in northern
New Delhi to join the planned march. The police, under the command
of a right-wing state government, blocked most of the roads,
letting barely half of the crowd reach the downtown rally site,
said an officer at the police control room.
	   Earlier, Mrs. Gandhi joined 150 party lawmakers in a sit-in
under a huge granite statue of independence leader Mohandas Gandhi
on the lawns of Parliament, shouting anti-government slogans.
	   Newspapers have been speculating that Mrs. Gandhi could take
advantage of discontent to wean away some of the 19 regional
parties in the governing coalition, headed by Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party.

Hundreds of Inter fans welcome newly-signed striker
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Baggio quote about Ronaldo &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photo MIL101 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Hundreds of jubilant Inter Milan fans on
Tuesday cheered Roberto Baggio as the newly-signed Italian veteran
striker arrived at the club headquarters for his presentation to
the media.
	   The 31-year-old star-forward signed a two-year contract with
Inter to team in front with Brazilian superstar Ronaldo, who's
expected to join the team by mid August.
	   Ronaldo was given a one-month vacation by officials of his
Italian team to recover from the stress sustained in the recent
World Cup.
	   ``I have been long thinking of our next matches together,''
Baggio told a news conference. ``It's exciting to think I can feed
him so that he can score goals taking advantage of his speed and
power.''
	   About Ronaldo's crisis before the World Cup final, Baggio said
the young Brazil probably suffered from an excess of pressure.
	   ``It can happen when you have too many trips, too much stress
and little rest,'' Baggio said.
	   The Italian forward, who scored 22 goals with low-ranked Bologna
last year, will get 4.5 billion lire (dlrs 2.5 million) a year from
Inter, his fifth Serie A club.
	   One of the most talented Italian players, Baggio debuted with
Fiorentina in 1985 and also played with Juventus, AC Milan and
Bologna. He scored 151 goals in 316 league matches.
	   Baggio said he hoped to keep his place on the national team for
the upcoming European Championship qualifying matches, at the
orders of newly-appointed coach Dino Zoff.
	   Playing portions of matches, as substitute of younger star
Alessandro Del Piero, Baggio was one of Italy's best players at
France '98.
	   Baggio was expected to make his debut on Inter's lineup in a
Champions League match scheduled in Pisa on Aug. 12. Inter
qualified for the most titled European competition finishing second
to Juventus of Turin in the last Serie A campaign.

Iran, Iraq exchange remains of soldiers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran and Iraq on Tuesday exchanged the
remains of 183 soldiers killed during their 1980-88 war, Iranian
radio reported.
	   Iran handed over the remains of 83 Iraqi soldiers killed during
the conflict and Iraq delivered the bodies of 100 Iranian soldiers,
the radio said.
	   The remains were recovered after a joint search operation, the
radio reported. The operations started four months ago, it said.
	   The exchange took place on the Iran-Iraq border in southwestern
Khuzestan province.
	   The war, which killed or wounded at least 1 million people from
both sides, ended with a U.N. brokered cease-fire but animosity has
persisted over the issue of prisoners.
	   The two countries recently exchanged thousands of prisoners of
war. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross,
some 75,000 POWs on both sides have been freed since the war ended.

Confidence restored in Swiss Guard, interim commander says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss Guard's morale has been
largely restored almost three months after the slaying of the tiny
papal force's commander, his temporary successor said in an
interview published Tuesday.
	   Roland Buchs said that, while investigations continue, he sees
no reason to doubt the Vatican's version of Alois Estermann's
death. ``Another theory would surprise me,'' he was quoted as
saying in the Lausanne daily Le Matin.
	   The Vatican says young guardsman Cedric Tornay, bitter because
of a reprimand by Estermann and the latter's failure to award him a
medal, fatally shot Estermann and his wife, Gladys Meza Romero, and
then killed himself, in the couple's Vatican apartment in May.
	   ``I think that only God knows the absolute truth and the exact
motivations behind this tragedy,'' Buchs said, adding that he has
full confidence in Vatican justice.
	   Buchs, the former commander who took over following the death of
Alois Estermann, steps down Saturday to make way for new permanent
commander Pius Segmueller.
	   He will take over the security service at the Swiss federal
parliament building in Bern when he leaves Rome after 22 years.
	   Segmueller takes up the post in favorable conditions, Buchs
said. ``The young (guardsmen) in particular hope to have a more
open dialogue'' with the leadership, he said.

Debate rages over Barnes, Mitchell suspensions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: INSERTS IAAF comment, grafs 6-9; EDITS 18th graf to edit to
conform &QL; 
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ America's governing body for athletics is
incensed over the doping suspensions of shot putter Randy Barnes
and sprinter Dennis Mitchell by the IAAF.
	   ``USATF (USA Track and Field) is concerned and dismayed that the
IAAF chose to temporarily suspend two American athletes on the
basis of unproven allegations that they have committed a doping
offense,'' Craig Masback, executive director of organiztion, said
Monday night. ``USATF objects to the IAAF suspensions and will not
enforce them.
	   ``U.S. athletes are entitled to a full and fair hearing prior to
being declared ineligible to compete. USATF has on several
occasions informed the IAAF of its obligations under the (U.S.)
Amateur Sports Act. Therefore, we are outraged that the IAAF
knowingly breached our confidentiality rules, which were put in
place to protect those ultimately determined to be innocent.''
	   The U.S. Amateur Sports Act is a 20-year-old federal law that
governs ``amateur'' sports in the United States. The International
Amateur Athletic Federation disclosed the indefinite suspensions
Monday.
	   Masback said that Barnes and Mitchell would ``receive the full
support of USATF until such time as it is determined that they have
committed a doping offense.''
	   IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said Tuesday he could not comment
specifically on Masback's remarks. But he said IAAF rules could not
be adjusted for different national federations.
	   ``We know what the problems and laws are in the U.S.,'' Reineri
said. ``But we are the governing body for athletics for all
countries in the world, and we have to apply the rules for
everybody.''
	   He said it was now up to the U.S. federation to act on the
Barnes and Mitchell cases.
	   Barnes, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist and the world indoor and
outdoor record-holder, and Mitchell, the 1992 Olympic bronze
medalist in the 100 meters, were cited by the IAAF for failing
out-of-competition doping tests April 1.
	   Barnes, who could face a life suspension for a second offense,
was tested in Charleston, West Virginia, and Mitchell in
Gainesville, Florida.
	   Mitchell is president of USATF's Athletes Advisory Committee,
the athletes' voice in the national governing body, which has taken
a strong stance against doping.
	   His suspension was handed down last week and represents his
first doping offense.
	   The IAAF did not officially announce the suspensions, and the
precise terms of the punishment have yet to be determined.
	   These are two of the most prominent suspensions in athletics
following Ben Johnson at the 1988 Olympics, Butch Reynolds in 1990
and Mary Slaney in 1997.
	   Johnson was banned for life after two suspensions, but has
requested reinstatement. Reynolds served a 27-month suspension and
now is competing. Slaney was found innocent after several months
and also is running again.
	   The suspensions come at a time when IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch has suggested some performance-enhancing drugs be
stricken from the list of banned substances.
	   They also come as athletics in the United States is seeking to
regain its prestige and reputation but has had difficulty
attracting sponsors and television coverage.
	   To test an athlete for doping, the IAAF divides a urine sample
from the competitor into two. If the first sample is positive, the
second sample is tested to confirm the original result.
	   Reneiri said from Monaco that only the A sample from Barnes and
Mitchell have been tested. However, that is sufficient to levy a
suspension.
	   If the B samples are positive, the IAAF then rules on the
severity of the punishment pending a hearing by USATF. If the B
sample is negative, the athletes are cleared.
	   Barnes was first suspended for two years starting in 1991 for
the steroid methyltestosterone at a meet in Malmo, Sweden, in 1990.
This time, the substance is androstenedione, a banned nutritional
supplement.
	   Mitchell tested positive for excessive testosterone. If found
guilty following the B sample, he probably would receive a two-year
ban.
	   Reneiri did not know the testosterone level in Mitchell's
sample. The allowable ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone
(another natural substance) is 6:1. Anything above that level is
considered suspicious.
	   Mitchell's suspension was handed down last week, after he
finished fifth in the Goodwill Games 100 and ran on the winning
U.S. 400-meter relay team. If Mitchell is banned, he and the relay
team of Jon Drummond, Tim Harden and Maurice Greene would be
disqualified and forced to refund all prize money from the meet.
	   Mitchell was entered in the U.S. Open at Edwardsville, Illinois,
last Saturday night, but the IAAF would not allow him to compete.

Three killed in shooting in market in southern Russia

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two policemen patrolling a market in a restive
region of southern Russia exchanged gunfire on Tuesday with several
men who refused to show their identity documents, and both were
killed, a news agency said.
	   A man who was shopping at the market in the city of Khasavyurt
in the region of Dagestan was also killed, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Two other market guards were injured, the news agency said. The
men who fired at the policemen escaped, it said.
	   Dagestan borders the secessionist region of Chechnya in the
Caucasus, a region that has been plagued by lawlessness.

Taliban government wants children to have Islamic names
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Taliban religious police called on
Afghan parents to give their children ``Islamic'' names.
	   A decree read on state radio Tuesday said names such as ``Rita''
and ``Victor'' should be changed, and all parents should in future
``use names for their children according to Islamic ... law,'' it
said.
	   The religious police offered no examples of acceptable names,
but they likely included Arabic names such as Abdullah and Mohammad
that are common in Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban have imposed a strict version of Islam in the 85
percent of Afghanistan they control. The religious militia took
over Kabul, the Afghan capital, two years ago.

Dikes hold as swollen Yangtze waters pass Chinese city
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with latest developments, details &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YUEYANG, China (AP) _ Dikes held back a third flood crest on the
middle reaches of the Yangtze River Tuesday as China called for a
``do or die'' effort to protect millions of people living along its
mightiest waterway.
	   With waters on the Yangtze at their highest levels in 44 years,
nearly 5 million people in five provinces were mobilized to help
ensure embankments held firm, the official Liberation Army Daily
said.
	   An all-out effort was needed to ensure the flood crest doesn't
undermine the dikes, already weakened by heavy rains and high
waters, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
	   The flood peak passed Yueyang in Hunan province without incident
early Tuesday and was moving through Wuhan, central China's largest
industrial center, with more than 7 million residents.
	   The flood peak was the Yangtze's second-largest since 1954, when
floods killed 30,000 people and disrupted life for 10 million
others, Xinhua said.
	   Floods caused by rains that fell heavier and earlier than usual
have killed more than 1,145 people so far this year. Almost a
million people have been forced from their homes in the three
worst-hit provinces _ Hunan, Hubei and Jiangxi.
	   Construction crews rode rafts to work and residents hurried to
dry out belongings during a brief break in the rain Tuesday in
Yueyang, a small city on the edge of badly swollen Dongting Lake,
which feeds into the Yangtze.
	   Only the roofs of houses could be seen above the water in the
nearby town of Chenglingji, where the Yangtze has breached dikes.
	   Authorities warn the river could remain at the current high
level for up to two weeks, keeping the waterlogged dikes under
constant pressure.
	   Downstream in Anhui province, 2.8 million residents have been
flooded out of their homes, and 4,600 hectares (11,360 acres) of
farmland have been submerged, Xinhua reported. Television showed
farmers ferrying earth on shoulder poles and plugging holes in the
embankments with sandbags and wicker baskets full of gravel.
	   Meanwhile, in China's commercial capital of Shanghai, where the
Yangtze flows into the sea, authorities warned that heavy rains
combined with dangerously high water levels on the river could lead
to ``big flooding,'' Xinhua said.
	   Torrential rains that began last week have already left some
streets in the metropolis submerged and flooded 2,600 homes, it
said.
	   The People's Liberation Army has mobilized a million soldiers to
help shore up dikes and has provided 4,000 vehicles and 280 boats
to aid relief efforts, Xinhua said. The air force has evacuated
more than 300,000 people from flood-stricken areas, it said.
	   The Red Cross said it was organizing deliveries of food and
water purification tablets to victims, and medical workers were
striving to prevent an outbreak of epidemics.
	   Police along the Yangtze were ordered to step up patrols and
crack down on thefts of anti-flood equipment, the Liberation Army
Daily said. They also were ordered to ensure that prisoners did not
escape from detention centers, the newspaper said.
	   The Finance Ministry, meanwhile, ordered stepped up supervision
of flood relief funds to ensure they are not diverted or wasted,
the People's Daily said.
	   Over the past 200 years, the 6,300-kilometer- (3,900-mile-) long
Yangtze has been hit by a devastating flood every 10 years, it
said.

EU envoy: Role of peace broker must not be limited to U.S.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Peace in the Middle East is the
responsibility of all parties and the United States must not be the
sole broker, the European Union's Middle East envoy said Tuesday.
	   Miguel Moratinos spoke after meeting with President Elias Hrawi.
	   Moratinos arrived in Lebanon on Tuesday as part of a Mideast
tours aimed at breaking the deadlock in Arab-Israeli negotiations.
He has visited Syria and will also travel to Jordan, Israel and
Egypt.
	   ``There should be a U.S. role, a European role, a Russian role
and a role for all those who really support peace,'' Moratinos told
reporters.
	   ``There is a joint responsibility by all parties,'' he said.
``This is the new way to look at the future of the Middle East.''
	   Israeli-Palestinian negotiations have been stalled since the
Israeli government began in March 1997 to build new housing for
Jews in the traditionally Arab side of Jerusalem. Israel's peace
talks with Syria and Lebanon have been suspended since February
1996.
	   The Middle East peace process has been largely sponsored by the
United States since 1991.
	   Arab states have called repeatedly for a bigger EU role in the
peace process. The United States and Israel have rejected any
European role in the peace talks.
	   Moratinos said the 15-nation EU is seeking to convene an
international conference on Middle East peace.
	   Moratinos said, however, that for such a conference to be
successful, it must be supported by the United States.

Palestinians, Israelis to resume peace talks Tuesday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with defense minister quote in grafs 6-7, protest
votes in Knesset in last 2 grafs &QL; 
 &UR; By HILARY APPELMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Talks on Israel's overdue West Bank troop
withdrawal were scheduled to resume Tuesday, but expectations of a
breakthrough were low.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, speaking on the Voice
of Palestine radio, called reported Israeli proposals for sharing
security control of a small area of the West Bank ``diversions.''
	   ``We will not take them seriously,'' he said. But Erekat said
the Palestinians had agreed to resume talks because Israeli
negotiators had called and said they wanted to ``present ideas.''
	   Erekat reiterated that the Palestinians would not consider any
proposals that were not in line with a U.S. initiative calling for
an Israeli withdrawal from an additional 13 percent of the West
Bank.
	   Israel has refused to accept the American initiative, and talks
on the long overdue withdrawal have been deadlocked for months.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, speaking to
reporters in Tel Aviv, said he hoped Tuesday's talks would
``succeed in advancing the process one step forward.''
	   He said he would ``continue to meet with the Palestinian
Authority to make advancements.''
	   Israel has balked at turning over more than 10 percent more of
the West Bank to the Palestinians before a final peace settlement
is reached. But Israeli media reports said Israel was proposing
sharing security control with the Palestinians in another 3 percent
on land in the Judean Desert. Israel reportedly wants the land to
be a nature reserve where the Palestinians would be prohibited from
building _ an idea the Palestinians have rejected.
	   Israeli legislators will vote Wednesday on a preliminary bill to
dissolve the Knesset. The bill, submitted by lawmakers from the
opposition Labor and Meretz parties, is a largely symbolic step to
protest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's handling of the peace
process. It would have to pass three further readings _ each
requiring an absolute majority of 61 legislators _ to take effect.
	   On Monday, the Knesset passed a vote of no-confidence in the
government by a vote of 42 to 20, but failed to come up with the 61
votes required to bring down the government.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ When Israeli combat soldier Oleg Pilchenko came
home on his monthly leaves last year, no one was there to greet
him.
	   Since his mother and teenage brother moved to Israel from the
Ukraine last October, Pilchenko is much happier, he said Tuesday.
	   But Israel's Interior Ministry has denied applications by
Valentina Pilchenko, who is not Jewish, for citizenship. Her
tourist visa expired last month, and if her request for permanent
residency is denied, she may be forced to leave Israel _ and her
son.
	   The non-Jewish parents and wives of more than 100 soldiers who
immigrated from the former Soviet Union have had their applications
for Israeli citizenship denied by the Interior Ministry, according
to Roman Bronfman, a lawmaker from Israel's Immigrants' Party.
	   On Monday, the Knesset approved the first reading of a bill that
would grant citizenship to the non-Jewish immediate relatives of
immigrant soldiers. The bill, which faces opposition from religious
parties, has to pass three readings before it becomes a law.
	   ``Soldiers who serve as fighters need their families by them,''
said Marina Solodkin, another Immigrants' Party lawmaker.
	   While the bill stays on the Knesset floor, Pilchenko's mother
stays home, unemployed because her tourist visa won't let her work
or get health insurance.
	   ``I don't want her to leave,'' said Pilchenko, 25, who
immigrated to Israel five years ago. He was not raised as a Jew,
but because his father is Jewish he was granted citizenship under
Israel's Law of Return, which grants automatic citizenship and
benefits to immigrants with at least one Jewish grandparent. His
parents are divorced.
	   ``I defend this country even though I am not Jewish,'' Pilchenko
said. ``But I don't get anything back.''

Israeli held in connection with cocaine smuggling ring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ An Israeli was being held here Tuesday on
an international arrest warrant following suspicions that he may
have been laundering money for a multinational cocaine smuggling
ring.
	   Police said Elias Dali, 45, was arrested on the resort island of
Mykonos last Saturday following a warrant issued by Israeli
authorities, who have asked for his extradition. Dali has been
living on Mykonos for the past two years.
	   According to police and local media reports, Dali is suspected
of laundering Monday from the sale of large quantities of cocaine
smuggled from Venezuela to Europe.
	   Dali has denied involvement in any illegal acts. He told local
media the Israeli arrest warrant was politically motivated because
he is of Iraqi descent.
	   According to police Dali will be transferred to a prison near
Athens on Wednesday.
	   Israel has 30 days to provide evidence and documentation backing
up the charges, otherwise Dali will be released.

Taliban insists aid groups move, reject U.N. mediation
</HEADLINE>

promising statement in grafs 5-6. Minor editing throughout. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A Taliban representative rebuffed
U.N. attempts to mediate a dispute between Afghanistan's
fundamentalist rulers and international aid groups, saying Tuesday
the issue was not the United Nations' business.
	   ``We don't have any problem with the U.N. We have a problem with
the (aid groups), and we don't want the U.N. to get involved with
this,'' said Qazi Habibullah, a high-ranking diplomat at the
Taliban embassy in Pakistan.
	   A day earlier, the United Nations handed the embassy a letter
requesting talks on the expulsion from Afghanistan last week of
some 200 aid workers who had refused Taliban orders to move into
war-damaged dormitories in Kabul, the Afghan capital.
	   Habibullah said his government had not yet formally responded to
the U.N. letter. He indicated that the request for talks would be
refused and said his government would not back down from demands
that aid workers move from homes and offices elsewhere in the
capital to the campus of Kabul Polytechnic.
	   Most of the expelled workers came to neighboring Pakistan, where
aid to Afghanistan is coordinated.
	   In the Pakistani capital Islamabad, Andrew Wilder of Save the
Children, one of the expelled aid organizations, said Tuesday that
the groups would have no comment until they had a formal response
from Afghanistan. U.N. spokeswoman Susan Manuel said the United
Nations was also awaiting an official response.
	   In Kabul, planning minister Khalid Din Mohammed promised an
announcement on the dispute Wednesday. Din Mohammed had ordered the
aid groups to move.
	   The expulsions marked the climax of rising tensions between aid
workers and Afghanistan's Taliban religious rulers. Taliban
officials have imposed an unusually strict version of Islam since
capturing Kabul in 1996, barring girls from school and confining
most women to the home. International aid groups say they are
committed to providing education and other services to all.
	   Aid workers have said they want to resolve the dispute and
return to Kabul as soon as possible to avert a humanitarian
disaster for the city of 1.2 million, which has been decimated by
years of civil war. The 38 groups were providing food, clean water,
sanitation facilities and schooling, in some cases carrying out
U.N.-funded projects.
	   The dormitories where the Taliban government wants to
concentrate aid workers have no electricity or running water, and
walls and windows have been damaged by shells and bullets.
Officials have asked the aid groups to pay an estimated dlrs
800,000 to renovate the dormitories and the rest of the campus,
saying the costs will later be deducted from rent.
	   The aid groups say the dormitories are unsafe and uninhabitable
and that they can't afford to pay for repairs. They also fear they
will be vulnerable to kidnappings, or caught in the crossfire
between the Taliban army and opposition forces dug in north of
Kabul.

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poet Zbigniew Herbert, one of Poland's
most outstanding postwar writers and moralists, died in a Warsaw
hospital Tuesday. He was 73.
	   The cause of death was not immediately available, but a longtime
friend, fellow poet and critic Krzysztof Karasek, said Herbert had
suffered from asthma and serious circulatory problems for several
years.
	   ``He was the conscience of Polish literature,'' Karasek said.
``During the final two decades of communism he was a spiritual
support for us younger poets, someone who never changed his
views.''
	   Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska, the 1996 Nobel laureate, told
the PAP news agency that Herbert was a ``great artist and
thinker,'' and that he will have an eternal place in Polish
literature.
	   An early advocate of reforms, Herbert was linked to the
democratic opposition starting in the 1970s and became a Solidarity
supporter in 1981. Protesting communist policies, he left Poland in
1986 and settled in Paris. He returned to Warsaw in 1992, three
years after the end of communism.
	   In his poems, Herbert discussed moral problems facing the
present generations, drawing broadly from the humanistic tradition
of European culture, its classic works and myths.
	   In many poems, Herbert presents Pan Cogito (Mr. Cogito), a
character representing rational views and skepticism about the
modern world.
	   Mr. Cogito makes moral judgments, but always supports those who
are losing or who are persecuted, Karasek said.
	   Born in Lwow, which then was part of Poland and now belongs to
Ukraine, he joined the underground Polish Home Army during World
War II. He moved to Krakow in 1944.
	   He studied arts, law and philosophy at Jagiellonian University
in Krakow, and the university in Torun.
	   Herbert published his first poems in 1950. During the Stalinist
era he was considered a ``class enemy'' by the communists and his
poems were rarely published.
	   In 1955-65, Herbert edited the literary magazine ``Tworczosc''
(Creation), and in 1965-68 the magazine ``Poezja'' (Poetry).
	   In 1970, Herbert lectured on European literature at California
State College in Los Angeles.
	   His main volumes of poetry include ``Hermes, pies i gwiazda,''
(Hermes, Dog and Star), published in 1957, ``Pan Cogito,'' 1974 and
the collection ``89 wierszy'' (89 Poems) published this year.
	   He also wrote dramas like ``Inny pokoj'' (Another Room) and
``Jaskinia filozofow'' (The Philosphers' Cave) and two volumes of
essays.
	   After a several-year break from writing, Herbert wrote new poems
last year during a three-month period when his health slightly
improved. The result was ``Epilog burzy'' (Storm's Epilogue), also
published this year, which displayed a very human side that
included suffering, Karasek said.
	   Herbert is survived by his wife, Katarzyna.

EU envoy: Role of peace broker must not be limited to U.S.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Peace in the Middle East is the
responsibility of all parties and the United States must not be the
sole broker, the European Union's Middle East envoy said Tuesday.
	   Miguel Moratinos arrived in Lebanon on Tuesday as part of a
Mideast tours aimed at breaking the deadlock in Arab-Israeli
negotiations. He has visited Syria and will also travel to Jordan,
Israel and Egypt.
	   ``There should be a U.S. role, a European role, a Russian role
and a role for all those who really support peace,'' Moratinos told
reporters after meeting Lebanese President Elias Hrawi.
	   ``There is a joint responsibility by all parties,'' he said.
``This is the new way to look at the future of the Middle East.''
	   Israeli-Palestinian negotiations have been stalled since the
Israeli government began in March 1997 to build new housing for
Jews in the traditionally Arab side of Jerusalem. Israel's peace
talks with Syria and Lebanon have been suspended since February
1996.
	   The Middle East peace process has been largely sponsored by the
United States since 1991.
	   Arab states have called repeatedly for a bigger EU role in the
peace process. The United States and Israel have rejected any
European role in the peace talks.
	   Moratinos said the 15-nation EU is seeking to convene an
international conference on Middle East peace.
	   Moratinos said, however, that for such a conference to be
successful, it must be supported by the United States.

Four get amnesty for 1993 killing of American student Amy Biehl
</HEADLINE>

Tuesday, comments from freed prisoner and his mother &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Four men who beat and stabbed
American student Amy Biehl to death have been granted amnesty, the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission said Tuesday.
	   The action clears the way for their release from prison. One was
released Tuesday afternoon and prison officials said the other
three would be released later Tuesday.
	   Biehl, 26, died in 1993 in the Guguletu black township outside
Cape Town when a crowd of blacks stoned her car, then beat and
stabbed her. The killing drew international attention to South
Africa's racial violence.
	   Vusumzi Ntamo, Ntobeko Peni, Mzikhona Nofemela and Mongezi
Manqina, told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission last year
that they killed Biehl. They asked her family for forgiveness.
	   Biehl's parents, Peter and Linda Biehl, in a statement from
their home in Newport Beach, California, supported the amnesty
decision.
	   ``In the cases of the four amnesty applicants in Amy's murder,
we hope they will receive the support necessary to live productive
lives in a non-violent atmosphere. In fact, we hope the spirits of
Amy and of those like her will be a force in their new lives,'' the
Biehls said today.
	   The Truth Commission can grant amnesty for full confessions that
shed light on abuses during the country's apartheid era, when the
white-minority government clashed with black militants. The crimes
must be deemed political.
	   Biehl, a Fulbright scholar, was in South Africa to help with
voter registration for the nation's first all-race election in 1994
that ended apartheid.
	   The four killers, convicted and sentenced to 18 years in prison
for the murder, testified at their amnesty hearing that they
believed their political leaders wanted them to attack whites _
also called ``settlers'' by black militants _ to highlight the
grievances of blacks.
	   They cited the ``one settler, one bullet'' slogan of the Pan
Africanist Congress, a radical black group.
	   The Biehls, who traveled to South Africa for the amnesty
hearing, said their daughter would have supported the commission's
mission to resolve the nation's racial division.
	   Manqina, who admitted he delivered the fatal stab wound, sat
with his head on a desk and wiped tears from his eyes as Mrs. Biehl
testified at his amnesty hearing.
	   Manqina was released from Brandblei prison in Worcester, 135
kilometers (85 miles) northeast of Cape Town, Tuesday afternoon. He
said he was happy to be released but declined to make any other
comment immediately.
	   He was greeted at the prison by his mother and other relatives.
	   ``We can't believe that he is out. We are very happy,'' said his
mother, Evelyn Manqina. ``As a mother I am very happy, but on the
other side I am not happy. I feel the pain of Mrs. Biehl. I am not
glad because of what my child has done.''
	   In their statement, the Biehls expressed hope that South
Africans would be able to resolve their differences and learn to
live in harmony.
	   ``Amy was drawn to South Africa as a student and she admired the
vision of Nelson Mandela of a `Rainbow Nation.' It is this vision
of forgiveness and reconciliation that we have honored,'' said the
Biehls.
	   Biehls' parents urged South Africans to accept the decisions of
the amnesty commission and to work to step up the pace of
reconciliation.
	   ``We must never forget people who lost their lives in the
struggle,'' the Biehls said. ``We must honor them in discovering
new approaches _ non-violent partnerships - to create the South
African which Nelson Mandela, Amy and those who perished dreamed of
- a new, multi-racial, democratic nation.''

Hundreds of Inter fans welcome new striker

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Hundreds of jubilant Inter Milan fans on
Tuesday cheered Roberto Baggio as the newly acquired veteran
striker arrived at the club's headquarters for his introduction to
the media.
	   The 31-year-old Italian signed a two-year contract with Inter to
join Brazilian superstar Ronaldo, who's expected to return by
mid-August.
	   Ronaldo was given a one-month vacation by the Italian club to
recover from the World Cup.
	   ``I have been long thinking of our next matches together,''
Baggio said. ``It's exciting to think I can feed him so that he can
score goals, taking advantage of his speed and power.''
	   Baggio said he believes Ronaldo's problems prior to the World
Cup final, which included reported vomiting and convulsions the day
of the championship match against France, probably resulted from
the relentless scrutiny of being in the World Cup spotlight.
	   ``It can happen when you have too many trips, too much stress
and little rest,'' Baggio said.
	   The Italian forward, who scored 22 goals with lightly regarded
Bologna last year, will get 4.5 billion lire (dlrs 2.5 million) a
year from Inter, his fifth Serie A club.
	   Baggio debuted with Fiorentina in 1985 and also has played with
Juventus, AC Milan and Bologna. He has 151 goals in 316 league
matches.
	   Baggio said he hoped to keep his place on the national team for
the upcoming European Championship qualifying matches under new
coach Dino Zoff.
	   Entering as a substitute for Alessandro Del Piero, Baggio was
considered one of Italy's best players at France 98.
	   Baggio was expected to make his debut for Inter in a European
Champions Cup match scheduled in Pisa on Aug. 12. Inter qualified
for the tournament by finishing second to Juventus last season.

	   ``If there is no legitimate government as a result of a free,
fair and credible election, the issue will have to be on hold,''
the minister, Surin Pitsuwan, said in an interview.
	   ASEAN groups Thailand with Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Brunei, Singapore, Vietnam, Myanmar and Laos.
	   Cambodia was scheduled to join ASEAN in July 1997. But ASEAN
postponed entry because Cambodian strongman Hun Sen launched a
bloody coup that month, ousting his co-prime minister, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh. An election was held Sunday, with vote-counting
still in progress Tuesday.
	   Many people worry that Hun Sen will reject the results and
forcibly maintain power, as happened after the 1993 election
organized by a U.N. peacekeeping force.
	   Surin was in Manila for annual talks between ASEAN and other
Asian and Western countries.
	   The EU representative at the talks said that while the polling
itself proceeded satisfactorily, with only one major violent event
reported, it was not yet clear if the votes were being counted in a
valid way.
	   ``It is too early to have a final assessment,'' said Wolfgang
Schuessel of Austria, the European Council president.
	   The EU contributed dlrs 15 million and 200 observers to the
election.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had earlier told the
same meeting that countries must remain vigilant after the election
because the democratic process in Cambodia has unraveled before.
	   Also Tuesday, an Amnesty International representative monitoring
the conference said that one of the first acts of Cambodia's new
government should be to prosecute those responsible for the scores
of politically motivated executions over the past year.
	   ``There is a concern about impunity,'' said the spokeswoman,
Donna Guest. ``No one has been brought to justice.''
	   She said the group is asking the new government ``to make an
initial step of good faith to the Cambodian people and the
international community, take a high-profile extra-judicial killing
and begin an investigation.''
	   She said this could include the case of Hor Sok, a senior
government official loyal to Ranariddh. Hor Sok was detained during
the coup and executed in the Interior Ministry compound, according
to human rights investigators.
	   Besides the coup-related killings, supporters of opposition
political parties were murdered in the run-up to the elections.

Palestinians, Israelis to resume peace talks Tuesday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with defense minister quote in grafs 6-7, protest
votes in Knesset in last 2 grafs &QL; 
 &UR; By HILARY APPELMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Talks on Israel's overdue West Bank troop
withdrawal were scheduled to resume Tuesday, but expectations of a
breakthrough were low.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, speaking on the Voice
of Palestine radio, called reported Israeli proposals for sharing
security control of a small area of the West Bank ``diversions.''
	   ``We will not take them seriously,'' he said. But Erekat said
the Palestinians had agreed to resume talks because Israeli
negotiators had called to say they wanted to ``present ideas.''
	   Erekat reiterated that the Palestinians would not consider any
proposals that were not in line with a U.S. initiative calling for
an Israeli withdrawal from an additional 13 percent of the West
Bank.
	   Israel has refused to accept the American initiative, and talks
on the long overdue withdrawal have been deadlocked for months.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, speaking to
reporters in Tel Aviv, said he hoped Tuesday's talks would
``succeed in advancing the process one step forward.''
	   He said he would ``continue to meet with the Palestinian
Authority to make advancements.''
	   Israel has balked at turning over more than 10 percent more of
the West Bank to the Palestinians before a final peace settlement
is reached. But Israeli media reports said Israel was proposing
sharing security control with the Palestinians in another 3 percent
on land in the Judean Desert. Israel reportedly wants the land to
be a nature reserve where the Palestinians would be prohibited from
building _ an idea the Palestinians have rejected.
	   Israeli legislators will vote Wednesday on a preliminary bill to
dissolve the Knesset. The bill, submitted by lawmakers from the
opposition Labor and Meretz parties, is a largely symbolic step to
protest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's handling of the peace
process. It would have to pass three further readings _ each
requiring an absolute majority of 61 legislators _ to take effect.
	   On Monday, the Knesset passed a vote of no-confidence in the
government by a vote of 42 to 20, but failed to come up with the 61
votes required to bring down the government.

Five Ukrainians killed by fumes from decaying grain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Five Ukrainians were killed by poisonous
fumes produced by decaying grain stored in a private granary in
southern Ukraine, emergency officials said Tuesday.
	   In the incident Monday in the village of Bezvodne, located in
the Mykolaiv region, a worker who descended into the 6-meter
(20-feet) deep granary lost consciousness because of the fumes.
	   Four other people who went in to rescue the worker also were
disabled by the fumes, and all five subsequently died, the
Emergency Situations Ministry said.
	   It noted that private granaries usually are not equipped with
proper ventilation systems and thus are in danger of being filled
with fumes from old grain.
	   The incident was a virtual repeat of one in which three people
were killed last month by gas produced by decaying vegetables kept
in a cellar in the northeastern Ukrainian town of Izyum.

Dikes hold as swollen Yangtze waters pass Chinese city
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with presidential concern, officials disciplined for
negligence, grafs 7-9 &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YUEYANG, China (AP) _ Dikes held back a third flood crest on the
middle reaches of the Yangtze River Tuesday as China called for a
``do or die'' effort to protect millions of people living along its
mightiest waterway.
	   With waters on the Yangtze at their highest levels in 44 years,
nearly 5 million people in five provinces were mobilized to help
ensure embankments held firm, the official Liberation Army Daily
said.
	   An all-out effort was needed to ensure the flood crest doesn't
undermine the dikes, already weakened by heavy rains and high
waters, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
	   The flood peak passed Yueyang in Hunan province without incident
early Tuesday and was moving through Wuhan, central China's largest
industrial center, with more than 7 million residents.
	   The flood peak was the Yangtze's second-largest since 1954, when
floods killed 30,000 people and disrupted life for 10 million
others, Xinhua said.
	   Floods caused by rains that fell heavier and earlier than usual
have killed more than 1,145 people so far this year. Almost a
million people have been forced from their homes in the three
worst-hit provinces _ Hunan, Hubei and Jiangxi.
	   The flooding has prompted direct orders from President Jiang
Zemin to local officials to ensure dikes are maintained and victims
aided.
	   In Jiangxi, a bureaucrat responsible for flood control was
removed from his post and three others were given reprimands for
failing to keep a watch over dikes along Saicheng Lake near the
city of Jiujiang, Xinhua said.
	   Another official in southern Guangdong province was sacked for
using an official car to flee with his family ahead of floodwaters,
it said.
	   Construction crews rode rafts to work and residents hurried to
dry out belongings during a brief break in the rain Tuesday in
Yueyang, a small city on the edge of badly swollen Dongting Lake,
which feeds into the Yangtze.
	   Only the roofs of houses could be seen above the water in the
nearby town of Chenglingji, where the Yangtze has breached dikes.
	   Authorities warn the river could remain at the current high
level for up to two weeks, keeping the waterlogged dikes under
constant pressure.
	   Downstream in Anhui province, 2.8 million residents have been
flooded out of their homes, and 4,600 hectares (11,360 acres) of
farmland have been submerged, Xinhua reported. Television showed
farmers ferrying earth on shoulder poles and plugging holes in the
embankments with sandbags and wicker baskets full of gravel.
	   Meanwhile, in China's commercial capital of Shanghai, where the
Yangtze flows into the sea, authorities warned that heavy rains
combined with dangerously high water levels on the river could lead
to ``big flooding,'' Xinhua said.
	   Torrential rains that began last week have already left some
streets in the metropolis submerged and flooded 2,600 homes, it
said.
	   The People's Liberation Army has mobilized a million soldiers to
help shore up dikes and has provided 4,000 vehicles and 280 boats
to aid relief efforts, Xinhua said. The air force has evacuated
more than 300,000 people from flood-stricken areas, it said.
	   The Red Cross said it was organizing deliveries of food and
water purification tablets to victims, and medical workers were
striving to prevent an outbreak of epidemics.
	   Police along the Yangtze were ordered to step up patrols and
crack down on thefts of anti-flood equipment, the Liberation Army
Daily said. They also were ordered to ensure that prisoners did not
escape from detention centers, the newspaper said.
	   The Finance Ministry, meanwhile, ordered stepped up supervision
of flood relief funds to ensure they are not diverted or wasted,
the People's Daily said.
	   Over the past 200 years, the 6,300-kilometer- (3,900-mile-) long
Yangtze has been hit by a devastating flood every 10 years, it
said.

After Suharto, old grievances are resurrected in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos JAK102 &QL; 
 &UR; By ALI KOTARUMALOS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOR, Indonesia (AP) _ Eighty-year-old Nawi bin Said squinted
from beneath the brim of his battered straw hat, surveying a tiny
plot of land that he's waited 26 years to take back from former
President Suharto.
	   ``I used to grow banana trees there before Suharto pushed us
out,'' said the peasant farmer, pointing to the one-acre tract. ``I
want it back. He's not in power now so I'm not scared anymore.''
	   Two months after Suharto quit amid protests and riots triggered
by Indonesia's worst economic crisis in decades, thousands of
Indonesians have resurrected long-held grievances against the old
ruling elite.
	   Human rights activists regard the David-and-Goliath struggle of
Nawi and his neighbors as a classic example of how Suharto, his
government and his cronies trampled on the rights of ordinary
Indonesians during his 32-year rule.
	   Suharto allegedly grabbed hundreds of acres of farmland from 300
poor villagers in 1972 and built a cattle ranch in the lush, cool
foothills just south of Jakarta, Indonesia's overcrowded and
polluted capital.
	   Suharto, a former army general, was then at the height of his
power.
	   ``There was nothing we could do except wait until he stepped
down,'' said Nawi who, with his impoverished neighbors, have now
walked back onto the land they say is rightfully theirs.
	   Armed with hoes and shovels, they've cleared scrub, dug small
plots and planted crops to stake their claim.
	   Security guards have evicted them three times in the past month,
but on Sunday they returned unchallenged.
	   For decades they held their tongues, fearing the consequences of
dissent against a regime that tolerated little opposition.
	   But now they've boldly complained to the National Human Rights
Commission and their lawyers plan to take the ex-leader to court.
	   ``This is the best chance we have to claim back our rights,''
said one villager, who identified himself by the single name of
Bardjad.
	   Suharto has not commented on the case, but in the past he's
maintained the land was vacant when he took it over.
	   Suharto's successor, B.J. Habibie, has pledged sweeping
political, legal and economic reform. But change can't come fast
enough for many.
	   The government is investigating corruption during the Suharto
era. But opponents want a specific, independent inquiry into
allegations that he misused his power to enrich his family, now
worth billions. Suharto has denied the allegations.
	   But such inquiries won't stem the effects of soaring inflation
and mass unemployment, as the gap between rich and poor widens at a
dramatic rate.
	   Millions are dropping below the poverty line and looting has
become an almost daily occurrence.
	   Warehouses have been raided and shops ransacked. Desperate mobs
have even stripped coffee beans off plantation trees and pulled
tons of shrimp from fish farm ponds.
	   Worried by an upsurge in crime and mob rule, the powerful armed
forces have warned Indonesians not to take the law into their own
hands.
	   The military and police say looters will be shot and land grabs
will be suppressed.
	   ``Even if people are hungry, no one should do just what they
want and take the property of others by force,'' military commander
Gen. Wiranto said.
	   Police set up a 250-strong task force on Monday to curb
widespread lootings in Jakarta and its environs.
	   An alleged looter of shrimp pond in the West Java town of
Tangerang, just west of Jakarta, was shot dead last week by police.
	   Nawi and his fellow villagers are unconcerned by such warnings.
	   Now, as demands for reform sweep crisis-ridden Indonesia, they
say justice is better served late than never.
	   Not far from Suharto's ranch, angry villagers carved slogans
into the manicured greens of a golf course they claim was built on
top of their farms.
	   Mobs burned buildings and cut down trees at another golf course
that they said was once their rice fields.
	   Human rights activists say a growing number of poor will act
outside the law if they can't get justice.
	   ``Although nobody in their right mind would justify land
plundering, it is understandable why peasants have resorted to
it,'' the Jakarta Post newspapers quoted land rights lawyer Luhut
Pangaribuan as saying.
	   ``In land disputes, the court almost always decided in favor of
the government or business interests,'' he said.

Supreme court restores fundamental rights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's Supreme Court on Tuesday
restored freedom of speech, movement and assembly and other civil
rights suspended under an emergency decree declared following
nuclear test in May.
	   The ruling announced by Chief Justice Ajmal Mian came in
response to a challenge filed by former President Leghari and other
political leaders.
	   President Rafiq Tarar, citing threats from an unspecified
country, declared the emergency immediately after Pakistan
conducted nuclear tests in response to a series of tests by
neighbor and rival India.
	   The brief ruling did not lay out the court's reasonings.
	   Under the emergency, the president suspended all basic rights
enshrined in Pakistan's constitution, including the right to
challenge any government action in the courts.
	   Opposition and civil rights groups accused the government of
trying to impose a dictatorship.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A Moldovan student was in police custody
Tuesday after she tried to smuggle three kilograms (6.6 pounds) of
heroin into Greece from Turkey.
	   Svetlana Gradinarou, a 23-year-old student at the University of
Romania, was arrested Monday on Greece's northern border with
Turkey after customs officials found the heroin folded inside a
pair of thick leggings and a plastic pouch.
	   Traveling on a bus from Istanbul to Athens, Gradinarou was using
a fake French passport.
	   Gradinarou told customs officials the passport and drugs were
given to her in Istanbul by a drug dealer she identified only as
Ali. She was to deliver the drugs to an unidentified man at a train
station in the northern port city of Salonica.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ A senior Nigerian general has pledged that
his men will remain neutral during the country's transition to
civilian rule.
	   ``The Nigerian army of today has no place for undisciplined
officers,'' Chief of Army Staff Major Gen. Ishaya Bamaiyi said
Monday. ``I do not expect any officer or soldier taking part in
political campaigns either overtly or covertly.''
	   Bamaiyi was addressing guests at the opening of the army's
training week in the commercial capital Lagos.
	   Nigeria has been ruled by soldiers for all but 10 years since it
gained independence in 1960. During the recent rule of Gen. Sani
Abacha, Nigeria became an international pariah.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, who took over after Abacha's death in
June, has received cautious praise for promising to free all
political detainees and to turn over power to a democratically
elected president in May 1999.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The official weekly newspaper of
President Robert Mugabe's ruling Zanu party claims a conspiracy by
whites loyal to the former breakaway British colony of Rhodesia was
behind an increasingly negative image of the leader.
	   ``The local opposition papers and a host of stringers who were
part of the Rhodesian media lift negative stories and give them a
global context,'' said The People's Voice. ``The stringers have
transformed into news cartels which control overseas publicity on
Zimbabwe.''
	   After Zimbabwe's 1980 independence, 200,000 of the former
280,000-member white population of Rhodesia emigrated.
	   In 1965 former Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith declared
unilateral independence from Britain to try and stop black rule,
but was forced to yield power after 14 years of international
sanctions and a seven-year guerilla war.

	   BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) _ Lawyers and relatives of a former
Malawian army officer who died in prison protested Tuesday at the
exclusion of their own representatives from an autopsy of his body.
	   James Njoloma died Thursday in Zomba prison hospital, 40 miles
(60 kilometers) north of Blantyre after serving three years of a
15-year sentence for inciting mutiny.
	   In the past year more than 170 prisoners have died there due to
overcrowding and poor conditions.
	   Njoloma, who was alleged to have been party to an abortive
military coup plot, was said by prison doctors to have died of
malaria. He reported pains in the chest and abdomen two days before
he died.
	   -----
	   BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) _ A consignment of 400 tons relief maize
donated by the European Union for local victims of last season's El
Nino drought has become the subject of political debate here.
	   Opposition leader Chakufwa Chihana Monday claimed maize intended
for his home area, northern Malawi, had been re-exported to
neighboring Zambia where it fetched 780 million kwacha (dlrs 30
million).
	   Spokesmen for President Bakili Muluzi's government denied the
allegations.
	   Chihana alleged profits from re-sale of the maize were being
channelled to Muluzi's ruling party through officials in the
Ministry of Relief and Rehabilitation.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Africa is playing an increasing role in
world drug trafficking, and Africans are becoming drug users as
well, the head of Interpol's drugs section said Tuesday.
	   ``It is a growing situation. Unfortunately, Africa is not only
becoming an important transit point but also a consumer,'' Ian
Bain, said in an inteview during a meeting on African
drug-trafficking networks.
	   He attributed the increase in both trafficking and consumption
to the rising number of relatively well-off African youths with
more leisure time.
	   ``Drug traffickers are very aggressive. If there is no market,
they will create a market,'' Bain said.
	   In comments to 100 delegates from Africa, Europe, North and
South America and Asia, Bain said international drug-trafficking
has increased 10-fold in the past 20 years.
	   Bain said the first known seizure of heroin in Africa was 2.6
kilograms in 1985. Last year, he said 62 kilograms were seized.
	   Kenyan official Marsden Madoka said Interpol had set up three
regional bureaus in Africa, in Harare, Zimbabwe; Abidjan, Ivory
Coast; and Nairobi.

	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ Journalists and their supporters marched
through Accra to protest the recent sentencing of two local
journalists in a libel case brought by Ghana's first lady.
	   The group, which included publishers and academics, marched
across the city center to the Supreme Court on Monday. Carrying
placards and chanting ``We want press freedom,'' the protesters
were followed by police, who did not interfere.
	   Editors Haruna Attah and Kweku Bako were given 30-day jail
sentences last week for carrying a story in their papers from a
U.S-based newspaper which alleged that Nana Konadu
Agyemang-Rawlings was a drug dealer.
	   Mrs. Rawlings denied the allegations and responded with libel
charges.
	   Dozens of other libel cases are pending in Ghananian courts
against journalists and publishers.
	   Ninety percent of the cases have been filed by government
officials, a situation pro-democracy groups feel is an attempt to
gag a growing independent press.

	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ The Mozambican Trade Union Federation
says that some 105,000 workers nationwide have lost their jobs
because of privatization during the last 10 years.
	   According to the Mozambique News Agency, AIM, this figure is
contained in a report by the federation's executive committee.
	   The committee has been meeting since Monday at Matola, a city
adjoining the capital, Maputo. According to the report, 840
companies have been privatized in the period.

McLaren fails in attempt to overturn Schumacher win

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ McLaren has failed in its attempt to overturn
Michael Schumacher's victory at the British Grand Prix, FIA, the
sport's governing body, said Tuesday.
	   The July 12 Grand Prix ended in bizarre circumstances, when
Schumacher's Ferrari, leading by more than 20 seconds, crossed the
finish line driving down the pit lane rather than on the track.
	   The McLaren team, for which Mika Hakkinen came in second,
protested. It lost, then appealed the decision.
	   The International Court of Appeal, which made the ruling, upheld
the original decision of the British stewards.
	   But FIA will attempt to find out what action Silverstone
officials should have taken, and ensure that the embarrassment
doesn't happen again, by holding an extraordinary meeting of the
World Motor Sports Council - its policy-making arm - on Wednesday.
	   Three British Grand Prix race stewards have been called to
appear at the Paris meeting.
	   ``It is very unusual for FIA to call a meeting of 24 top
officials from around the world in July. We really want to ensure
that this doesn't happen again,'' said Francesco Longanesi, a
spokesman for FIA.
	   ``Something will come out of this meeting,'' Longanesi said,
probably by way of improved procedures.
	   At the British Grand Prix, Schumacher, under orders from his
garage, came into the pit on the final lap to take a 10-second
penalty for overtaking under a yellow caution flag earlier in the
race.
	   McLaren said that he should have taken the 10-second stop-go
penalty during the final few laps _ not at the end.
	   The Court seemingly supported the FIA's reason for siding with
Ferrari, saying that the Italian team wasn't notified about the
penalty for 31 minutes - six minutes longer than the rules allow -
and, therefore, couldn't impose it until the end.
	   Before the race, Finland's Hakkinen and Schumacher of Germany
were number one and two in the Formula One standings.
	   They remain fierce rivals as the top two drivers in the current
standings.
	   McLaren and Ferrari had little to say on the controversy.
	   ``We are very satisfied with the decision and the confirmation
of the result of the race. But we aren't going to make any other
comment,'' said Claudio Berro, Ferrari's racing spokesman.
	   McLaren declined to comment.

Italy's new coach promises more offensive play
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Dino Zoff, Italy's newly-appointed coach, said
Tuesday he planned a more offensive play when the ``Azzurri'' begin
qualifying matches for the European Championships in September.
	   ``I plan a zone defense without a sweeper and two forwards in a
4-4-2 tactic similar to the one I used as a coach of Lazio,'' Zoff
said as he met reporters in his first news conference as Italy's
coach.
	   Zoff, a former national team goalkeeper and coach of Lazio and
Juventus, was named last week to replace Cesare Maldini who was
sacked following Italy's elimination by France on a penalty
shootout in the World Cup quarterfinals.
	   Maldini, criticized for the overly defensive tactics used by the
Italian team at France '98, told Milan's authoritative daily
Corriere della Sera he could not understand reasons for his
dismissal.
	   ``I'm no longer Italy's coach, without losing a game in the
World Cup. The fans still are supporting me,'' Maldini was quoted
as saying Tuesday.
	   Zoff, who signed a four-year contract running through the next
World Cup in 2002, did not join Maldini's critics saying Italy
played quite well in France.
	   ``I never judged a colleague's work ... I will adapt (Italy's
play) to what the league offers,'' Zoff said.
	   Zoff, who captained Italy to the 1982 World Cup title in Spain,
will make his debut on Italy's bench in Liverpool on Sept.5, when
the Azzurri play Wales in an European qualifying match.
	   The coach will name Italy's roster on Aug. 30, the day after the
Italian SuperCup final between Juventus and Lazio.

Parliament committee criticizes secrecy of Georgia nuclear
</HEADLINE>
shipment &QL; 
 &UR; EDS: Lang Banks cq in penultimate graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ A parliamentary committee
investigating a uranium shipment from the former Soviet republic of
Georgia criticized the ``culture of secrecy'' at a Scottish nuclear
plant but concluded Tuesday that the government was right to accept
the nuclear material.
	   The unanimous report by the Trade and Industry Select Committee
concluded that there were no technical reasons for criticizing the
decision to reprocess the uranium at the Dounreay plant on the
coast of northern Scotland, which was built in 1957. ``Dounreay was
the appropriate location for its acceptance in to the United
Kingdom,'' said committee chairman Martin O'Neill.
	   The Georgian shipment of 4.3 kilograms (9.5 pounds) of highly
enriched uranium and 0.8 kilograms (1.76 pounds) of spent nuclear
fuel in April was controversial in part because it was kept secret
in Britain and the story broke in the United States.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair said at the time that the decision was
taken in the interests of nuclear non-proliferation, to keep the
uranium out of the hands of rebels in the troubled Caucasus nation
or would-be nuclear powers.
	   But environmentalists accused the government of using Scotland
as a nuclear dumping ground and demanded that world leaders address
the fundamental problem of what to do with radioactive waste _ a
view they reiterated Tuesday.
	   The Health and Safety Executive's Nuclear Installations
Inspectorate, the government agency in charge of monitoring
civilian nuclear operations, ordered Dounreay to stop reprocessing
18 months ago after leaks were discovered.
	   Only weeks after the Georgia shipment, Blair's government
announced it will close Dounreay. The plant will take no new
nuclear shipments but will finish reprocessing 15 tonnes (16.5
tons) of material from its own reactor, the nuclear material from
Georgia and its existing commerical contracts.
	   The select committee hearing at Thurso Town Hall coincided with
publication of a highly critical report on Dounreay by the
government's Health and Safety Executive.
	   According to this report, about 80 percent of the Georgian
material, which was due to be reprocessed within weeks of its
arrival, has not been. The remaining 20 percent of the Georgian
material has been through a nuclear reactor but has had to be
stored until Dounreay is granted permission to reprocess it.
	   Friends of the Earth Scotland spokesman Lang Banks said the
committee had ``fudged the issue of what should happen now.''
	   ``No lessons will have been learned if they invest more money in
reprocessing,'' he said. ``It will be cheaper just to store it for
the foreseeable future.''

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ About 50 students rallied Monday
against a military agreement with the United States in front of a
hotel where U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was holding
talks with Southeast Asian countries.
	   A dozen chanting students broke through a security cordon and
entered the driveway of the hotel, scuffling with guards, who
pushed them back. There were no injuries.
	   The protesters accused Albright of pressuring the Philippine
government to allow the resumption of joint military exercises.
	   One protest leader, Ruth Cervantes, said the return of American
troops to the Philippines would encourage prostitution of women and
children.
	   ``We will never forget the atrocities committed by the U.S.
forces,'' she said.
	   In 1992, the Philippine Senate rejected a renewal of the lease
on the last U.S. base, which was forced to close the following
year, ending nearly a century of U.S. military presence in the
Philippines.
	   Earlier this year, U.S. and Philippine officials signed a
visiting forces agreement that would allow a resumption of joint
military exercises and provide certain legal protections to U.S.
soldiers while in the Philippines.
	   Critics say the agreement, which requires ratification by the
Philippine Senate, could shield American soldiers from prosecution
because of various loopholes.
	   Albright told reporters that she discussed the agreement in a
meeting at Malacanang Palace with President Joseph Estrada.
	   ``It is my understanding the government supports this agreement
and it is one that is viewed as mutually beneficial to both
countries,'' she said.
	   She said any concern about nuclear weapons was misplaced.
	   ``I think we have made statements all along that our surface
ships do not carry nuclear weapons,'' she said.
	   In his first state-of-the-nation address to the Philippine
Congress on Monday, Estrada repeated his support for the agreement.
Until the country develops a credible military deterrent, it must
depend on treaty commitments with the United States, he said.
	   No joint exercises have been held since 1996, when a legal
loophole granting protection to U.S. soldiers was eliminated.

Rivals India and Pakistan meet at regional forum

 &UR; Eds: SUBS 9th graf to UPDATE quote from Sharif &QL; 
 &UR; By ASHOK SHARMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Seeking to ease tensions that
skyrocketed since the rival nations conducted nuclear tests, the
prime ministers of India and Pakistan flew Tuesday to the neutral
ground of Sri Lanka for their first encounter since the
acceleration of the South Asian arms race.
	   Unwilling to meet in each other's nation, India's Atal Bihari
Vajpayee and Pakistan's Nawaz Sharif flew Tuesday into Colombo, Sri
Lanka's heavily secured capital, where they will meet during a
seven-nation summit that opens Wednesday.
	   The annual South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation
summit aims to develop the economies of some of the world's poorest
countries, but is often overshadowed by the 50-year rivalry between
group's two largest states. The other members are Nepal,
Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives and Sri Lanka.
	   As in nine previous summits, this week's meeting is likely to be
distracted by the dispute over Kashmir, the Himalayan territory
which has detonated two India-Pakistan wars. Kashmir, which was a
Hindu kingdom with a Muslim majority before the first war in 1947,
is now split, with India controlling two-thirds.
	   Vajpayee and Sharif will meet for the first time since ordering
underground nuclear tests last May and declaring their countries
nuclear weapon states.
	   India's five nuclear explosions in May were greeted with
national jubilation and pride, matched two weeks later in Pakistan
when Sharif brought Islamabad's nuclear program out of the closet.
Opinion polls showed the tests were hugely popular.
	   It also will be their first meeting since Vajpayee's Hindu
nationalist government took office in March, pledging to step up
the fight against what India calls a Pakistan-backed insurgency by
Muslim separatists in Kashmir. Pakistan denies active involvement,
but gives diplomatic and political support to the militants.
	   ``I am optimistic,'' Vajpayee said on his arrival in Colombo.
``I am confident the dialogue with Pakistan will be continued
further.''
	   Arriving later, Sharif said he would focus the talks with
Vajpayee on Kashmir, ``which is the root cause of all the tension.
I am confident the talks will succeed.''

Government announces new economic measures as part of reforms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan will cut customs duties and other
taxes but impose a value added tax as part of reforms designed to
improve relations with the International Monetary Fund.
	   Customs duties that range from 5 percent to 250 percent will be
brought to a maximum of 80 percent within six months, said
Abdel-Wahab Osman, minister for finance and economic planning.
	   The government will cut several other taxes but impose a value
added tax of 10 percent, he said Monday. Some commodities like gum
arabic, a major Sudanese export, will be exempted, he said.
	   The reforms are designed to help Sudan enter the World Trade
Organization and improve relations with the Washington-based IMF,
which Sudan owes dlrs 1.7 billion. The government pays off its
arrears to the IMF at a rate of about dlrs 2.5 million a month.
	   But the reforms and potentially higher taxes have the capacity
to unleash unrest in Sudan, one of the world's poorest countries.
	   Some economic indicators, like growth and inflation, have
improved as a result of the recent reforms, but even basic goods
are often beyond the reach of average Sudanese.
	   ``We have made a commitment ... that these measures will add no
burden on our people,'' Osman told the news conference.

Bhutto challenges Swiss case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
went to court Tuesday to try to derail a Swiss money-laundering
case she says was manipulated by her political enemies.
	   According to a statement released by her Pakistan People Party,
Ms. Bhutto asked a provincial court to declare illegal documents
she said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government sent to Swiss
officials.
	   Earlier this month, a Swiss court indicted Ms. Bhutto's husband
Asif Zardari on charges of money laundering and said it was
clearing up details before charging Ms. Bhutto. The couple is also
charged in several Pakistani corruption cases.
	   ``The Nawaz regime has falsely alleged to Switzerland that
Senator Zardari was involved in narcotics trafficking,'' Ms.
Bhutto's party said. The party statement added Ms. Bhutto's
government had been falsely accused of taking kickbacks to award
contracts to Swiss companies.
	   Ms. Bhutto's government was dismissed in 1996 after being
accused of ineptitude and widespread corruption.
	   Sharif, who had campaigned on a clean government platform, won
elections last year. Once in office, he set out to prove Ms. Bhutto
and her husband took millions of dollars in kickbacks and bribes
and hid the money in Swiss bank accounts.

Einstein house to go back to heirs, but not all satisfied

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A years-long fight over ownership of Albert
Einstein's Bauhaus-style home in the woods near Berlin reached a
turning point Tuesday when German officials ruled the title should
be given to his heirs.
	   But their lawyer is reportedly planning to appeal because the
decision includes an unwanted partner: an organization representing
Jewish victims of the Holocaust.
	   In the meantime, the lakeside house, made from American pine, is
in desperate need of restoration, said Josefine Ewers, head of the
office charged with resolving post-unification questions of
property ownership.
	   But, she said, no one wants to pay for the work _ estimated at
up to 800,000 marks (dlrs 445,000) _ until the title is settled.
	   ``It can still drag on for a long time,'' she said.
	   Einstein lived in the fishing village of Caputh from 1929 to
1932, using the house as a retreat from the hustle of Berlin, 10
kilometers (6 miles) away. There he found the quiet he needed to
work, inspired by walks through the pine forest with fellow
scientists like Max Planck and Otto Hahn.
	   Facing increasing anti-Semitic sentiment, Einstein left Germany
one month before Adolf Hitler took power in 1933. He never
returned. The house was confiscated by the Nazis in 1935 and
transferred to the village of Caputh.
	   Einstein initially gave permission for the house to be used by a
neighboring Jewish school. But the students and teachers were
forced out after the ``Night of Broken Glass'' pogrom of 1938.
	   After the war, the house was used as a residence, then later as
a guesthouse for the East German Academy of Sciences.
	   After German unification in 1990, the village regained title.
	   Since 1994, the private Einstein Forum think tank has been
allowed to use it during the week for seminars and other academic
pursuits in exchange for paying maintenance costs.
	   But on the weekends, the village opened the house to tourists _
something Einstein Forum director Gary Smith said last year that
Einstein would have opposed.
	   He has been supporting attempts by 11 Einstein heirs to reclaim
the house.
	   They include a distant relative of Einstein's from New York,
Jerusalem's Hebrew University, an eye clinic in Princeton, New
Jersey, and a U.S. animal protection group.
	   The case dragged on for years because no one was able to produce
an official certificate of heirship, Ewers said. In the end, she
said she was forced to include the Jewish Claims Conference among
the heirs.
	   The conference was created after the Holocaust to represent
cases in which heirs to the rightful owner are dead or cannot be
located. It usually sells the property after assuming title and
donates the proceeds to Jewish organizations worldwide, many of
which are caring for Holocaust survivors.
	   Freia Hartung of the Einstein Forum office in Potsdam welcomed
the ruling, and said she hopes work can begin soon on preserving
the 70-year-old building.
	   ``It's not a ruin, but it would do the house good to be
thoroughly restored,'' she said.
	   But Ewers said the Cologne-based lawyer for the 11 heirs,
Hermann Schlagermann, has already filed notice of his intention to
appeal the inclusion of the claims conference.
	   Schlagermann was out of his office Tuesday, his secretary said.

Two nations set up working groups as `initiative' becomes `project'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELAINE GANLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France and Egypt are setting up working groups to
advance their proposal for an international conference to break the
impasse in the Middle East peace process, their foreign ministers
announced Tuesday.
	   Hubert Vedrine of France and Amr Moussa of Egypt said the
proposal has moved from the stage of an ``initiative'' to that of a
``project.'' But both stressed it is not meant to undermine
American mediation efforts.
	   ``This is not a sports competition,'' Vedrine told reporters
after a meeting with Moussa.
	   The Egyptian minister was to meet with President Jacques Chirac
later and deliver a message from President Hosni Mubarak.
	   Vedrine described the project, proposed in May during a visit by
Mubarak, as a contingency plan should U.S. efforts fail.
	   ``We are obliged to envisage the hypothesis whereby we must
prolong (the effort) in another form,'' Vedrine said. ``We're not
there today, but we have to think of it ....
	   ``If the American efforts succeed ... there will be no reason to
take other initiatives,'' Vedrine said.
	   But planning was moving forward.
	   The two officials said consultations are planned in the coming
days with the United States and other nations.
	   Neither Vedrine nor Moussa would indicate a projected date for
such a conference, but Moussa said dates were part of the
discussion.
	   Moussa was completing the second day of his visit to Paris
before heading to Casablanca, Morocco, for a meeting of the Al Qods
(Jerusalem) Committee of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference, set for Wednesday and Thursday.
	   Vedrine said the working groups, which are to be in ``constant
contact,'' represent a new ``more concrete'' phase in the planning
for a conference.
	   Israeli-Palestinian negotiations have failed to advance since
the Israeli government began building a Jewish housing estate on
the traditionally Arab side of Jerusalem in March 1997.
	   Arab nations have pressed for a more active European role in the
peace process, and France has led the way in trying to take part in
it.
	   In an interview published Tuesday in the French newspaper Le
Monde, Moussa said the entire peace process would have to be
reviewed ``if Israel's attitude remains unchanged ... because this
policy will lead to catastrophe.''
	   ``No one is disposed to wait until the end of time,'' Moussa was
quoted as saying. ``There is a limit to everything. Sooner or later
the drop of water will make the vase overflow.''
	   The conference as described by officials in May would take place
in two steps, starting with a larger conference then a smaller one
including nations like Israel directly concerned with the peace
process.

Tugs fail to extract cargo ship stuck in mud in Lisbon port
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Tugs failed Tuesday to free a Cypriot
cargo ship that ran aground in Lisbon port during a harbor pilots'
strike.
	   The 35,000-ton cargo ship, Ioannis M, got stuck on a mudbank
Monday as it maneuvered without the usual help of Portugal's harbor
pilots who guide ships into port.
	   The incident has sharpened the dispute between the pilots and
the government which has refused to negotiate, and last week
scrapped the law requiring ships' captains to hire a pilot.
	   After tugs failed to extract the Ioannis M from the mud at
high-water Tuesday, striking pilots warned that the vessel's fuel
tanks could crack open and spew oil into the Tagus estuary. It was
not immediately clear how much oil was on board.
	   A crane was lifting the ship's cargo of soy onto two barges to
lighten its weight and increase buoyancy. A second attempt to free
the ship was scheduled for the evening high tide.
	   Portugal's harbor pilots began their 14-day strike on July 21,
initially choking the flow of imports and exports by sea. The
repeal of the law forcing captains to hire pilots has since allowed
most ships to enter the country's ports unassisted.
	   The harbor pilots are demanding a pay hike, a risk subsidy and
the right to set their own working conditions.
	   Following widespread allegations of corruption among the harbor
pilots, the government this year placed them under the supervision
of the port authorities _ a move resisted by the pilots.
	   More than 90 percent of the country's 80 harbor pilots are under
investigation for corruption, extortion and criminal association,
according to the government.

BlueWave beat Fighters 10-7
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Troy Neel hit a three-run home run in the six-run
third inning, helping the Orix BlueWave beat the Pacific League's
front-running Nippon Ham Fighters 10-7 at Kobe Tuesday.
	   The BlueWave scored four more runs in the eighth with help from
a home run by Hirofumi Ogawa and a two-run homer by Ichiro Suzuki.
	   Neel, formerly with the Oakland Athletics, has 13 homers. Suzuki
has nine and Ogawa three.
	   The Fighters are still 8 1/2 games ahead of the second-place
Kintetsu Buffaloes, who blanked the Seibu Lions 4-0 at Seibu Dome
on three home runs, including one by Phil Clark in the second
inning. Clark, formerly with the Boston Red Sox, has 15 homers.
	   Buffaloes rookie Masaki Maki pitched a four-hitter for his third
victory against two defeats.
	   At Kitakyushu, former Milwaukee Brewers player Julio Franco
ignited a three-run sixth inning with a double as the Chiba Lotte
Marines beat the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks 3-1.
	   In the Central League, Koichi Sekikawa doubled home the winning
run in the bottom of the seventh as the second-place Chunichi
Dragons edged the front-running Yokohama BayStars 3-2 at Nagoya
Dome, ending the BayStars' winning streak at a club record tie of
10.
	   The victory narrowed the BayStars' lead over the Dragons to four
games.
	   At Tokyo's Jingu Stadium, Atsuya Furuta slugged a three-run home
run, his sixth homer of the season, in the sixth inning as the
Yakult Swallows extended their winning streak to five with a 7-6
victory over the Yomiuri Giants.
	   League leader Hideki Matsui of the Giants hit his 22nd homer of
the season in the four-run eighth inning.
	   At Koshien Stadium, Dave Hansen hit a home run in the seventh as
the Hanshin Tigers blanked the Hiroshima Toyo Carp 2-0 and ended
their losing streak at seven.
	   Former Anaheim Angels pitcher Darrel May pitched a seven-hitter
over seven innings for his second victory against five defeats, and
reliever Ben Rivera, formerly with the Philadelphia Phillies, held
the Carp hitless in the last two innings for his 14th save.
	   Hansen, formerly with the Chicago Cubs, has five homers.

Bank says Hong Kong's GDP is expected to shrink by 3 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's economy is expected to shrink by 3
percent this year because of Asia's financial turmoil, a leading
bank reported Tuesday.
	   In a midyear review of the territory's economy, the Hang Seng
Bank said the economic adjustment, though painful, was necessary
for Hong Kong's competitiveness.
	   It said unemployment in Hong Kong is expected to edge up to
above 5 percent in the second half of this year, and that inflation
is forecast to fall to a 12-year low of 2 percent by the end of
1998.
	   Hong Kong's economy shrank 2 percent in the first quarter this
year, the first contraction in 14 years. Earlier this month, the
government said unemployment climbed to a 15-year high of 4.5
percent in the three months ended June 30.
	   Hong Kong has weathered Asia's financial turmoil better than
most of its neighbors, but has been suffering from high interest
rates and slumping property and share prices.
	   Financial Secretary Donald Tsang has said that the forecast
annual economic growth of 3.5 percent was unlikely, and that he
would revise the forecast later in the year.

Aeroflot signs dlrs 1 billion deal to buy 20 Russian airliners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's largest airline signed a dlrs 1 billion
deal Tuesday to buy 20 Ilyushin-96 Russian jets equipped with
U.S.-made engines and electrical equipment.
	   Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko traveled to the southern
city of Voronezh to attend the signing ceremony between Aeroflot
Russian International Airlines, the largest successor to the
Soviet-era giant Aeroflot, and the Voronezh aircraft-maker.
	   The order will keep 14,000 employees of the Voronezh plant and
workers at dozens others plants throughout Russia busy for five
years, Kiriyenko said, according to the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   The Voronezh plant, like other Soviet-era industrial giants, has
mostly stood idle in recent years because of a lack of orders from
the cash-strapped government. Aeroflot and other Russian carriers
instead purchased foreign planes, including Boeing jets from the
United States.
	   The new contract will be financed by loans and guarantees from
several Russian banks, the U.S. Export-Import Bank and the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The aircraft will be
equipped with Pratt and Whitney engines and Rockwell Collins
avionics.

U.S., Russians do duet; Indians joke about nuclear tests during
</HEADLINE>
ASEAN entertainment &QL; 
 &UR; With ASEAN &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM RAUM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Posing as star-crossed lovers, U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov did a duet to a tune from the musical West Side
Story they ``East-West Story.'' Indians joked about their nuclear
weapons testing.
	   The song parodies came at a concluding banquet of the Southeast
Asian diplomatic conference. Both dinner and the skits were behind
closed doors, but advance copies of the script showed Albright and
Primakov teaming up to sing ``Maria.''
	   ``The most beautiful son I ever heard, Yevgeni, Yevgeni,
Yevgeni, Yevgeni,'' went Albright's lyrics. His reponse,
``Madeleine Albright, I just met a girl named MadeleineAlbright ...
And suddenly I find ... She thinks she'll change my mind ... For
free.''
	   ``She's over the top, but she's alright ... From Prague to
Manila ... She's stomped like Godzilla,'' Primakov's lyrics
continued. Her refrain: ``Who me?''
	   India's delegation took a light look at its nuclear tests last
May.
	   ``Why such fuss over a few crackers in the Thar,'' said one line
in the song, referring to the desert where India stunned the world
by conducting nuclear tests in May.
	   At the final banquet of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations' annual meeting with counterparts from major powers outside
the region, the delegations traditionally perform either cultural
dances or song parodies.
	   Last year, Albright was the hit of the conference with an
Evita-style rendition of ``Don't cry for me ASEAN.''
	   The Indian song, with words set to a famous old movie tune,
suggests that the nuclear tests were not such a big deal, compared
to those by other nations.
	   ``They weren't as loud as Nevada and Lop Nor,'' the song said,
mentioning the sites of U.S. and Chinese tests.
	   ``Talk of your bikinis, talk of your atolls, before you talk of
our sands,'' went another line, referring to U.S. and French
nuclear tests in the South Pacific.
	   The song's humor contrasted sharply with the dour mood conveyed
Monday by India's delegation chief, Jaswant Singh, as he told a
news conference of his sadness and regret over a statement from the
multinational gathering that ``deplored'' the nuclear tests by
India and Pakistan.
	   The U.S.-Russian script called for ``delegations together'' at
the conclusion of the East-West skit to sing: ``Tonight, Tonight
... In harmony tonight ... Our accents may not all ... Sound quiet
right...''
	   ``We're superpowers ... But we have feelings too ... despite our
nukes ... And our spooks ... We need you.''

China becomes South Korea's second largest export market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ China replaced Japan as South Korea's
second largest export market in the first half of this year,
officials said Tuesday.
	   The United States remained the No. 1 market for South Korean
exports. South Korea shipped dlrs 11 billion worth to the United
States in the six months, said the state-run Korea International
Trade Association.
	   South Korean exports to China fell by 3.6 percent to dlrs 6.28
billion, while shipments to Japan fell by 16.6 percent to dlrs 6.16
billion.
	   A recent depreciation of the Japanese yen has hurt Japan's
demand for foreign imports, the association said in a report
released Tuesday.
	   South Korea's exports to the three major trading partners
accounted for 34.7 percent of its total dlrs 67.63 billion in
exports in the six months.

Vandals desecrate Jewish graves in Warsaw
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Vandals damaged about 50 tombstones of
Polish Jews executed by the Nazis near Warsaw, the head of the
cemetery said Tuesday.
	   ``Plaques from graves of Polish Jews were torn away, some were
found _ all of them twisted and damaged,'' said Karol Lot, head of
the cemetery and museum at Palmiry, 30 kilometers (18 miles)
northwest of Warsaw.
	   The vandals also damaged the tombstone of Poland's pre-war
parliament speaker Maciej Rataj.
	   Most of graves were destroyed Friday and the rest over the
weekend, Warsaw police spokesman Ryszard Pietrzykowski said.
	   The Palmiry cemetery has been vandalized twice before, the last
time several years ago, Lot said. In late May, hooligans damaged
some 25 tombstones at a 192-year-old Jewish cemetery in Warsaw.
	   The Nazis executed some 3,500 prominent Poles in Palmiry.
	   Some 20,000 Jews live in Poland now, a fraction of thriving
pre-war community of 3,5 million.

Pakistan gives government building to Maldives
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan is so strapped for cash it's
trying to sell one of its own government buildings, but still able
to play big benefactor to the small fellow-Islamic country of
Maldives.
	   In a statement released Tuesday, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
said he would inaugurate a new parliament building in Maldives on
Friday. He called the building `a gift from the people of Pakistan
to the people of Maldives.''
	   Zafar a Tatal, honorary Maldives consul in Pakistan, said the
building was not an outright gift, but constructed thanks to a soft
loan from Pakistan approved a decade ago. Tatal said he had few
details.
	   Maldives, a collection of islands in the Indian Ocean with a
population of about 200,000, has no ambassador in Pakistan, and
very few anywhere else in the world.
	   The new Maldives parliament ``is a symbol of friendship between
the two countries,'' said Pakistani foreign office spokesman Nadeem
Kiyani. Kiyani said he did not know how much the building cost.
	   After years of economic mismanagement, Pakistan was pushed to
the brink of bankruptcy by international economic sanctions after
it tested nuclear weapons in May. As part of austerity measures
announced after the tests, Sharif put up for sale a
multi-million-dollar marble office building that had housed his
staff. The 400-room prime minister's secretariat had only recently
been completed.
	   Both Maldives and Pakistan are officially Islamic and both are
members of the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation.

Spurned Tahiti woman tells Miss World organizers to get atlas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PAPEETE, Tahiti (AP) _ A Tahitian beauty chosen by France to run
in the Miss World contest has been spurned by the pageant's
organizers she says ``know nothing about geography.''
	   Hinano Teanotoga said in an interview Tuesday with local radio
station RFO that Eric Morley, organizer of the Miss World
competition, had rejected her bid, casting doubts on her being
French.
	   ``He doesn't understand anything about politics and doesn't know
his geography,'' she said. ``Polynesians have chosen to remain
French.''
	   Her case has been taken up by Jean-Jack Queyranne, France's
deputy minister for overseas territorial affairs.
	   Queyranne said Tuesday he was ``stunned by this decision based
on ignorance of French Polynesia'' and that there was ``no doubt
about her French nationality.''
	   He said he was sure that Miss World organizers would reconsider
their decision to exclude Teanotoga.
	   Teanotoga, who works for local government, was a leading
fundraiser for the relief effort in Papua New Guinea after a
tsunami left around 2,000 people dead on July 17.
	   Tahiti is an island in French Polynesia that is a French
overseas territory.

Russia favors return of Kosovo autonomy within Yugoslavia

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Russia supports broad autonomy for
the Albanian-majority province of Kosovo, but not secession from
Serb-dominated Yugoslavia, Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said
Tuesday at a security conference of Asian and Western nations.
	   The status of Kosovo had been regarded by Moscow in the past as
an internal question for the Yugoslavian federation to decide, and
Primakov's statement was in agreement with recent offers made by
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   ``In our view, the issue of the status of Kosovo could be solved
through granting the province a broad autonomy,'' Primakov said.
``We oppose any solution which would lead to the secession of
Kosovo from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Serbia.''
	   Kosovo enjoyed a high-level of autonomy and equal rights with
other provinces in Yugoslavia under Communist dictator Josip Broz
Tito. But that status was abolished under Milosevic's nationalist
Serb policies in 1989. Milosevic has recently offered to restore
Kosovo's autonomy.
	   ``Milosevic has to deliver soundly in this respect to encourage
the moderate set of Kosovo Albanians that it makes sense to
negotiate,'' Wolfgang Schuessel of Austria said, speaking on behalf
of the European Union. ``The lost years when there was no movement
_ Milosevic's personal mistake _ weakened the moderate leaders.''
	   Extremist elements of an ethnic Albanian resistance movement are
seeking to secede from Yugoslavia, which they accuse of abusing the
human and political rights of ethnic Albanians comprising 90
percent of the province's population. More moderate ethnic Albanian
groups also want independence but may settle for political
autonomy, which the U.S government also supports.
	   Primakov told other foreign ministers from Europe, Asia, North
America and the South Pacific that Russia opposes ``any outside
intervention with the use of force'' to settle the problem.
	   He said the main task now is to resume, ``without preconditions,
the interrupted negotiating process'' between the Yugoslav leaders
in Belgrade and the leaders of Kosovo Albanians.
	   Primakov also confirmed that Russia will participate in the next
international peacekeeping operation, subject to a double chain of
command for its contingent separate from the American leadership.
	   One of the priorities in Bosnia is to work out by the end of
this year ``a new platform for securing the peace process in Bosnia
...,'' he said.
	   He spoke at the Post-Ministerial Conference of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations, also attended by U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and representatives of Japan, China,
Australia, Canada, the European Union and others.

China worried about AIDS spread as HIV carriers top 10,000
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with official warning cases could hit 1 million by
2000, graf 3 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese authorities urged greater efforts to slow
the spread of AIDS as the official tally of people infected with
the virus that causes the disease topped 10,000, an official
newspaper said Tuesday.
	   The Health News also said the actual number of people infected
with HIV may be as high as 300,000, or 100,000 more than previous
estimates.
	   That figure could pass 1 million by 2000 if more is not done to
check the spread of HIV, Xiao Yan, an official with the Department
of Disease Control, told state television.
	   The official tally of people who tested positive for HIV stood
at 10,676 at the end of June, a 22 percent increase from last
October and surpassing 10,000 for the first time, the newspaper
said.
	   As of March this year, 290 people had developed AIDS and 173 had
died, the newspaper said.
	   The virus' spread has accelerated, and local health authorities
have been ordered to speed up education and prevention campaigns,
it said.
	   The HIV virus was first detected in China in 1985. About
two-thirds of reported cases of HIV infection are due to
intravenous drug use _ a growing problem in China. Transmission
through sexual intercourse and blood transfusions accounted for the
other cases of infection, the newspaper said.

Britain gives millions to help eradicate polio in east Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANTERBURY, England (AP) _ Britain announced an 18 million pound
(dlrs 29 million) polio eradication project Tuesday to immunize 16
million children under the age of five in east Africa.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair said the campaign could wipe out polio
in the region by the millennium by preventing all new cases of the
disease.
	   ``This project gives a whole generation of children the chance
to lead healthier lives,'' he told more than 700 Anglican bishops
at the church's once-a-decade Lambeth Conference in Canterbury.
	   Britain is working in partnership with the World Health
Organization on the project, which will cover Kenya, Uganda and
Tanzania. National Immunization Days will be held in all three
countries in August and September.

Somalis oppose sale of beans deemed unfit for human consumption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Somali leaders Tuesday criticized
plans by the U.N. World Program to sell 152 metric tons of relief
beans deemed unfit for human consumption, claiming people might buy
them to eat.
	   Ads placed in Mogadishu newspapers by the U.N. food agency
stipulated that the buyer must sign a letter absolving WFP of any
responsiblity and that the beans cannot be transported in
containers carrying the WFP insignia.
	   ``It (the sale) is a total degradation of the Somalis,'' said
Ali Mahdi Mohamed, the warlord of north Mogadishu.
	   Michele Quintaglie, a spokeswoman for WFP in neighboring Kenya,
said an analysis of the dried beans by a reputable company in
Nairobi indicated they could be consumed by animals but not humans.
	   Quintaglie did not know why the beans were submitted for
analysis in the first place.
	   ``We have strictly followed international and donor guidelines
on such matters,'' she said.
	   She said whoever buys the beans must satisfy the WFP the food is
meant for animal consumption.
	   Dr. Osman Mohamud Dufle, coordinator of Mogadishu's Joint Health
Authority, told journalists the beans were unfit for animal
consumption and suggested they be burned or buried. Qintaglie said
WFP does not have those options.
	   A group of magistrates, led by Abdulkadir Sheik Ma'ow, said WFP
cannot escape responsibility from health hazards that might result
from the disposal of the food in Somalia.
	   Meawnhile, 1,800 families have left their homes in the Middle
Juba region in search of food, the relief agency World Vision said
in a statement issued in Nairobi Tuesday.
	   The agency said the people are heading toward its base in
Buaale, about 350 kilometers (217 miles) southwest of Mogadishu.
	   WFP says Somalia's 1998 harvest is expected to be 160,000 to
170,000 tons, or as low as 35 percent of last year's harvest of
462,000 tons.
	   The shortage follows floods in the Juba River valley region late
last year and early this year. The floods destroyed crops, broke
down river embankments, destroyed irrigation canals and led to
heavy weed infestation and well as an increase in rats, crickets
and other vermin.

Russia develops plans for tackling Year 2000 glitch
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's government has released guidelines to
help its branches determine how vulnerable they are to the effects
of a worldwide computer glitch that is expected to strike when
clocks roll over into the 21st century, a government
telecommunications expert said Tuesday.
	   The so-called millennium bug threatens computer programs that
use just the last two digits to designate a year. When 1999 gives
way to 2000, many computers won't know if it's 2000 or 1900, which
could cause them to go haywire or shut down.
	   The Central Telecommunication Commission's set of guidelines
tells government sectors how to analyze their computer systems and
where they can turn for help in tackling the glitch.
	   The commission's recommendations mark a step forward for
Russia's government, which has gotten a late start in the race
against the bug. But in recent months, Moscow has hastily begun
consulting with foreign experts to prepare for the glitch's
unpredictable effects.
	   Those consultations included recent discussions in Moscow
between Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and U.S. Vice President Al
Gore. The two agreed to include Russian scientists in a special
group to tackle the problem.
	   ``Compared with other countries, I must say we are behind, but
after meeting with a number of foreign representatives, we are
confident that we are now following the same path they started on a
few months ago,'' said Alexander Krupnov, chairman of the
Government Telecommunications Commission.
	   Krupnov said Russia is not under as much pressure as some
western countries to beat the bug's 2000 deadline.
	   ``We can fix the problem within a year and a half because we
have less technology, and (the bug) won't strongly affect our
critical systems,'' he said.
	   Despite those assurances, experts fear that Russia, like many
economically struggling countries, does not have the funds to cope
with the problem, and could be hit by catastrophes like financial
market meltdown and the collapse of telecommunications networks.

Rights group urges South Asian leaders to protect children
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Amnesty International urged leaders of
seven South Asian nations, assembling Tuesday for an annual summit,
to take urgent steps to protect the interests of 400 million
children in the region.
	   ``There is a gap between rhetoric and reality. This must
close,'' the international rights group said in a statement
released ahead of Wednesday's summit.
	   The summit will be attended by leaders from Pakistan, India,
Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and the Maldives. The
countries are among the world's poorest and most populous.
	   ``To be truly holistic all governments must address the entire
range of abuses that children suffer _ in custody, in the family,
in the community and in armed conflict,'' the group said.
	   ``The recent preoccupation with the nuclear issue in the region
may deflect critical resources and attention away from the needs of
the children,'' the group said in reference to India and Pakistan,
the two largest countries in the region which carried out nuclear
tests in May.
	   Each year 37 million babies are born in South Asia, a region
that is already home to a quarter of the world's children,
according to the United Nations' children's fund, UNICEF.
	   Almost two-thirds of the region's children are undernourished
and fewer than half the children will complete five years of
primary education, according to the UNICEF.
	   Millions of South Asia's children are also being exploited by
industries looking for cheap labor, experts say.

German arrested after World Cup attack on French cop released
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ One of four Germans suspected of
attacking a French police officer after a World Cup soccer game was
released from custody but still faces reduced charges, prosecutors
said Tuesday.
	   The 23-year-old suspect from Herne was seen in photos of the
July 21 attack bending over the French officer, Daniel Nivel, who
was seriously injured and remains in a coma.
	   The suspect maintained he was trying to keep others from
continuing to beat Nivel. Prosecutors said that other witnesses
have since come forward to support his story.
	   Prosecutors dropped charges of suspicion of group attempted
murder against him, but he still faces charges of suspicion of
causing serious bodily harm.

Ethiopia, Eritrea border dispute to be discussed in Burkina Faso

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Seeking to end the simmering
border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea, diplomats will gather
in this West African nation over the weekend, officials said
Tuesday.
	   Salim Salim, the secretary-general of the Organization of
African Unity, will mediate talks on the dispute, according to a
Burkina Faso foreign ministry official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Ethiopia's ambassador to the United Nations, Duri Mohammed,
denied that Ethiopian and Eritrean officials would meet face to
face, as the foreign ministry official had said earlier. Mohammed
said separate consultations will be held with the OAU at the
ministerial level.
	   Fighting broke out briefly between the two countries in mid-May,
and in early June both sides bombed each other's territory. It is
believed several hundred people _ perhaps more _ perished before
the fighting that stopped in mid-June.
	   Both sides have massed troops along the contested portion of the
border, and the situation is at a stalemate.
	   Officials from Burkina Faso, Djibouti and Zimbabwe will also
help mediate the talks, which will be held Aug. 1-2, the foreign
ministry official said.
	   Ethiopia has insisted _ and Mohammed repeated again Tuesday _
that it would not discuss the situation in face-to-face talks until
Eritrea pulls out of the disputed territory. Eritrea, however,
insists it controls its rightful land.

Four men killed in gangland-style slayings in Swiss tea room
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds; RECASTS for AMs, ADDS detail, byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By EDUARD MADER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Police in this normally peaceful
capital faced a rare gangland-style slaying Tuesday as they tried
to find who gunned down four men in a tea room.
	   The cardboard-patched window by the entrance of the Safari was
the first sign of the shooting, which took place late Monday
evening, hours before the redecorated tea room was to open for
business under new management.
	   Unaware of what had happened, a blond woman carrying a waitress
uniform stood smoking nervously Tuesday morning, waiting for
someone to open the door for her first day on the job.
	   ``I have a bad feeling,'' she said. ``I can't figure out what's
wrong.''
	   She was unaware that hours before police had found the bodies of
four men on the floor at the back of the tea room, where they had
been mown down by three or four other men.
	   Bloody footprints in the rear staircase and another shattered
window indicated how the attackers may have escaped.
	   ``I can't remember any crime like this,'' said Hans Gerber,
spokesman of the city police. Up to 40 officers have been assigned
to investigate the slaying in the diplomatic quarter.
	   Police refused to comment on speculation that the attack was a
feud among Turks, possibly related to debts. The new manager of the
tea room is a Turkish woman, whose whereabouts was unknown Tuesday.
	   Neither the identity nor the nationality of the victims could be
determined immediately, said police, whose previous experience with
shootings have generally involved lone, revenge-seeking gunmen.
	   Gerber said the only time he could find in city records when
four people had been shot to death was in 1993, when a 53-year-old
Swiss man killed his brother, the brother's wife and an employee in
a bakery and then turned the gun on himself.
	   Bern, with a population of about 130,000 people, is
Switzerland's fourth largest and perhaps quietest major town.
	   Police began investigating before midnight Monday after they
were alerted by neighbors who heard breaking glass.
	   Juerg Blaser, spokesman for the federal prosecutor, said there
appeared to be no connection between the slayings and three
diplomatic missions that share the building, a 10-minute walk from
the main railroad station in the city center.
	   The Italian consulate and the Ghana and Jordan embassies are
among other tenants.
	   Rolf Bellwald, a friend of the new manager, said, ``It seems
there were money problems. Her Turkish partner had debts and some
men came to her apartment to threaten her if they weren't paid.''
	   The tea room had been closed for two months because of the
change of ownership.
	   A number of people have been questioned, but no one has been
charged, police said.

Official: Privatization revenues in 1998 to fall far below target
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's government will raise far fewer
revenues from privatization in 1998 than planned, the country's
privatization chief said Tuesday.
	   The government will hardly be able to meet its target of 1
billion hryvna (dlrs 500 million), which it planned to collect this
year by selling state-owned property, said Oleksandr Bondar, chief
of the State Property Fund.
	   He said the property fund would ask the Cabinet to halve the
1998 privatization target and incorporate it in the revised 1998
budget, which President Leonid Kuchma is to introduce shortly.
	   The government has earned a meager 241 million hryvna (dlrs
120.5 million) from privatization since the beginning of 1998, and
the figure has remained virtually unchanged since June.
	   The property fund has had to cancel dozens of privatization
tenders since January after failing to attract even one bidder.
	   A number of potentially lucrative companies, including oil
refineries and electricity companies, were offered for sale two or
three times, but neither domestic nor foreign investors have
expressed interest.
	   Bondar said that the poor investment climate in Ukraine and
plummeting stock market prices were dampening the government's
hopes to raise significant revenues from privatization in the near
future.
	   ``Demand and prices (for companies undergoing privatization) are
much lower today than three years ago, and the situation is not
likely to improve soon,'' he said.

Obuchi presses senior statesman to accept key finance post

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Incoming prime minister Keizo Obuchi said Tuesday
he will ask a respected senior statesman to become Japan's next
finance minister, a critical post in leading the economy out of
severe recession.
	   Tokyo markets rallied on reports that former Prime Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa is ready to accept the offer from Obuchi, who is
trying to put together a Cabinet ahead of his expected appointment
as prime minister later this week.
	   ``It's a difficult job. I want to ask Miyazawa-sensei,'' Obuchi
told reporters, using a Japanese honorific.
	   A former Finance Ministry official who has made a name for
himself as a financial guru within the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party, the 78-year-old Miyazawa remained noncommittal in public,
citing his age.
	   ``Aren't there other capable people in the party?'' he replied
when asked by reporters if he'd take the job.
	   But Kyodo News reported Tuesday that concerns over Japan's
severe economic crisis had persuaded him to accept the post, one
that is considered instrumental in efforts to revive economic
growth and restore stability to the ailing banking system.
	   That news was welcomed by Japan's financial markets. The
benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average rose 170.18 points, or 1.07
percent, to 16,114.54, regaining some of the 417.53 points it lost
Monday on concern about the new Cabinet's ability to cure the
economy's ills.
	   ``Miyazawa is not the best answer, but compared to the other
candidates, he's the best,'' said Takashi Nakauchi, foreign
exchange manager at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd.
	   Foreign Minister Obuchi, who won the LDP presidency last week
and is expected to be voted prime minister Thursday in Parliament,
said he will meet personally with Miyazawa on Wednesday to press
him to accept the finance job.
	   The choice is a crucial one. Obuchi has promised to build an
``economic reform Cabinet'' and to deal with record-high
unemployment, increasing bankruptcies and a financial system
straining under mountains of bad debt.
	   But pulling Japan from its worst recession since it rose from
the ashes of World War II promises to be an arduous task. Anyone
who takes the top finance post can expect to come under intense
criticism if the economic crisis worsens.
	   Miyazawa, who has served in the past as finance minister, is a
main architect of Japan's efforts to reform its banking system.
Many consider his economic expertise essential to counterbalance
Obuchi's relative inexperience in the field.
	   Fluent in English, Miyazawa has also cultivated strong relations
with top finance officials in Washington.
	   Many other leading candidates have also reportedly balked at
overtures to take up the post _ once considered the most desirable
in the Cabinet outside the premiership itself.
	   Another possible candidate, Koichi Kato, former LDP
secretary-general, has said he can't take the job because of his
responsibility for the LDP's defeat in elections to the upper house
of Parliament earlier this month, the newspapers said.
	   That electoral humiliation forced Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto to announce his resignation, which led to Obuchi's
election as party president.
	   Analysts said Kato's refusal may indicate that he is protecting
his reputation as he grooms himself to become prime minister
sometime in the future.
	   The third candidate Obuchi has been considering, former Chief
Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama, may still be offered the post,
but he also appears unlikely to accept it.
	   Kajiyama had come in second after Obuchi in the LDP's divisive
election for a new party president. His outspoken calls for radical
``surgery'' to cure Japan's economic ills quickly turned him into
the darling of the financial markets.
	   Obuchi's third opponent in last week's election, Welfare
Minister Junichiro Koizumi, flatly refused offers to join the new
Cabinet.

Report: 12 civilians killed in latest Algeria violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ At least 12 people were reported killed
Tuesday in Algeria, but the massacre sites were far from a U.N.
fact-finding delegation investigating an Islamic insurgency in the
country.
	   The civilians were killed in three separate incidents that have
taken place since Saturday, primarily in western Algeria,
newspapers reported.
	   Eight people were killed Saturday by an armed group near
Hassasna, a town about 400 kilometers (250 miles) west of Algiers,
the French-language newspaper Le Jeune Independent reported.
	   Three women who had been kidnapped by an armed group early
Sunday not far from the Moroccan border were found dead with their
throats slit, the La Tribune newspaper said.
	   In a third incident, an Algerian woman who lives in France but
had returned to her homeland for a vacation, had her throat slit
while her nephew looked on in Chlef, about 220 kilometers (135
miles) south of Algiers, said a hospital source, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   The nephew was able to flee and alerted security forces who
found the woman's body, the source said.
	   Meanwhile, in Algiers, the U.N. delegation continued its mission
with meetings with the Commerce Minister as well as representatives
of the government coalition.
	   The mission is looking into an Islamic insurgency that was
sparked in 1992 after the government canceled parliamentary
elections an Islamic party was set to win.
	   More than 75,000 people have died in the insurgency
	   The wave of killings has prompted the visit by a six-member U.N.
panel, led by former Portuguese President Mario Soares. The mission
arrived Wednesday for a visit expected to last about two weeks.
	   The group was not expected to meet with the Islamic Salvation
Front, banned in 1992.
	   Abelaziz Sbaa, spokesman for the Algerian Foreign Ministry, said
on Monday that reports the delegation had met _ or would meet _
with leaders of the Salvation Front were ``far-fetched.''
	   On Monday, a source close to the Salvation Front said that the
U.N. delegation met with the outlawed party's leader, Abassi
Madani, and with Ali Belhadj, its second-in-command.

Imprisoned British aid worker imprisoned by Serbs says she's on
</HEADLINE>
hunger strike &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LIPLJANE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A British aid worker imprisoned near
the Kosovo capital Pristina briefly fell unconscious Monday after
five days of hunger strike, the British Embassy in Belgrade said
Tuesday.
	   The British consul in Belgrade, Bob Corton, confirmed that a
member of the embassy staff had visited Sally Becker.
	   ``At one point during the interview, she fainted but quickly
regained consciousness. She did not object to having an intravenous
fluid attached,'' said the consul.
	   She was remarkably well considering that she had been without
food and drink for five days, he said. She was oriented and alert
and determined to continue with the hunger strike.
	   From what doctors have said the period after the fifth day of a
hunger strike is critical, Corton explained.
	   Ms Becker, known as the angel of Mostar for her humanitarian
efforts in that Bosnian city during the 3 1/2 war, was detained on
July 16 and charged with illegally crossing the Albanian-Yugoslav
border while attempting to assist Kosovo refugees. She heads a
small humanitarian organization called Operation Angel. Kosovo
refugees. She heads a small humanitarian organization called
Operation Angel.
	   The British aid worker was sentenced to 30 days in prison and is
being held in a prison cell in Lipljane, 20 kilometers (12 miles)
south of Kosovo.
	   On July 23, she announced to reporters that she had stopped
eating and drinking to protest the violence in Serbian Kosovo
province, where the underground Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting
Serbian forces for independence from Serbia.
	   ``Her lawyer has registered an appeal, hoping for a reduced
sentence,'' consul Corton said.
	   So far, there has been no sign from Serbian authorities whether
the sentence will actually be reduced. A decision was expected by
Wednesday.

China `strongly concerned' over Chinese Indonesians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China is ``strongly concerned'' over the
sufferings of Chinese Indonesians victimized by looting and alleged
rape in Indonesia's May riots, Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang
Guoqiang said Tuesday.
	   China has repeatedly urged Indonesia to discover the facts
behind the riots accompanying democracy protests that forced the
resignation of Indonesian President Suharto, Tang was quoted as
saying by the official Xinhua News Agency.
	   ``Steps need to be taken to avoid such misfortunes happening
again in the future,'' Xinhua quoted Tang as saying.
	   Indonesia should protect Chinese Indonesians' legal rights and
personal safety, he added.
	   Critics charge that Indonesia's security forces did little to
stop rioters who targeted ethnic Chinese, resented for dominating
business in Indonesia, and looted their homes and businesses.
Women's rights activists claim 168 girls and women were raped in
the violence, most of them Chinese Indonesians. Twenty of the rape
victims were murdered by their assailants, the groups say.
	   Outrage over the May attacks has grown steadily among Chinese
worldwide, sparking protests outside Indonesia's representative
offices in Taipei and Hong Kong.
	   New Indonesian President B.J. Habibie has formed a separate
independent commission to investigate the rapes, in addition to a
general investigation into the rioting and other human rights
abuses.

Harnisch decides to end career
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Henning Harnisch, one of the best German
basketball players, said Tuesday he was ending his career.
	   Harnisch, a forward who was a star on Germany's national team
that surprisingly won the European Championship in 1993, also had a
share in 14 national club titles in Germany.
	   His last club was Alba Berlin. Harnisch, 30, decided to end his
career although he reportedly had an offer to transfer to Kinder
Bologna, the Italian team that won the European club title last
season.

Report: 70 percent of Thai students drop out of primary school
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A 12-year survey of school attendance
records indicated that about 70 percent of Thai students dropped
out of primary school, Education Ministry officials said Tuesday.
	   Education officials believe poverty and a lack of transportation
for students were the main causes of the high dropout rate, said a
ministry spokesman.
	   The study, which covered 1986-97, also showed average attendance
at primary and secondary schools dropped by 33.9 percent.
	   A poorly educated work force has been cited by many economists
as a key factor hindering Thailand from sustaining its economic
development and attracting higher-technology industries.

ADB President Sato resigns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo Available &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Asian Development Bank President
Mitsuo Sato announced Tuesday that he will step down for personal
reasons next Jan. 15.
	   Sato, 55, has been the Manila-based bank's president since 1993.
	   ``After five years I got very tired,'' he told reporters.
	   Sato led the bank as it broadened from being a conventional
source of funding for development projects and became involved in
regional banking reform and international rescue efforts for
countries hurt by Asia's currency crisis.
	   The bank also shifted its focus from large projects such as dams
and roads to programs targeted at improving the livelihoods of the
poor.
	   Earlier this month, it launched an anti-corruption policy aimed
at reducing the huge losses for development projects caused by
bribery, nepotism and bid-rigging.
	   Sato said he hopes the bank's board of governors will choose a
Japanese to replace him since Japan is the largest shareholder of
the bank.
	   He said Chino Tadao, a former vice minister of finance for
international affairs, will be nominated by the Japanese government
as his successor.
	   Japanese Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga said Chino, currently
chairman of the board at Nomura Research Institute, has extensive
experience in international finance and a thorough knowledge of
Asian countries.
	   Sato said he will not be ``taking it easy or relaxing'' during
the remaining months as the region continues to battle its currency
crisis.
	   He said the region remains vulnerable to another round of
devaluations as long as the Japanese yen remains volatile.
	   ``It is crucial for Japan and other Asian countries to stabilize
the yen. Otherwise, we cannot rule out another round of currency
crisis,'' he said.
	   The bank has been funding development projects in the
Asia-Pacific since it was established in 1966.

IMF mission meets Ukrainian premier in talks on large loan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund said
Tuesday that Ukraine had made significant progress toward meeting
the terms for a dlrs 2.5 billion loan intended to shore up the
country's struggling economy.
	   After meeting with IMF representatives, Premier Valery
Pustovoitenko said he was hopeful that the delegation would
recommend release of loan.
	   National Bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko said that Ukraine ``has
never been so close'' to approval of the loan. He said the
government has adopted a ``thick pile of documents'' to qualify,
the Interfax news agency reported.
	   IMF mission chief Mohammad Shadman-Valavi, in turn, noted
``significant successes'' in economic reform but said several
issues remained to be decided by Pustovoitenko.
	   Approval of the loan is crucial for Ukraine, which has to repay
a dlrs 18 billion foreign debt _ including about dlrs 450 million
in August alone _ and chronically fails to collect the required
budget revenues.
	   In addition, Ukraine's hryvna currency has been under pressure
in recent months because foreign investors have exited from the
country's financial market. The National Bank has depleted its
reserves to some dlrs 1.7 billion in attempts to support the
hryvna.
	   The government has approved dozens of economic reforms since
May, trying to meet requirements set by the IMF.
	   However, a key condition had not been implemented by the time
parliament began its summer recess Friday: The new 1998 budget was
not approved and the lawmakers left the decision up to the
government.
	   Parliamentary speaker Oleksandr Tkachenko said Tuesday that
President Leonid Kuchma would implement the budget, which envisages
a cut in the deficit, by decree.
	   Ukrainian officials say the IMF loan would be used almost in
full to replenish the National Bank's reserves, which have shrunk
by more than 15 percent in the last two months due to the need to
support the hryvna.
	   But their main hope is that renewed cooperation with the IMF
would restore foreign investors' confidence in Ukraine and let the
former Soviet republic borrow abroad at lower interest rates.
	   The IMF suspended disbursement of its aid to Ukraine last
spring, citing stalled reforms and excessive state spending. The
move was followed by the World Bank's refusal to cooperate with
Ukraine until the IMF aid is resumed.

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ A parliamentary committee
investigating a uranium shipment from the former Soviet republic of
Georgia criticized the ``culture of secrecy'' at a Scottish nuclear
plant but concluded Tuesday that the government was right to accept
the nuclear material.
	   The unanimous report by the Trade and Industry Select Committee
concluded that there were no technical reasons for criticizing the
decision to reprocess the uranium at the Dounreay plant on the
coast of northern Scotland, which was built in 1957. ``Dounreay was
the appropriate location for its acceptance in to the United
Kingdom,'' said committee chairman Martin O'Neill.
	   Energy and Industry Minister John Battle welcomed the
committee's ``support'' for the government's decision to move the
uranium to Dounreay and agreed on the need to promote ``greater
transparency on Dounreay and on nuclear matters generally.''

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania, (AP) _ For two hours each night, Albania's
government television brings the Kosovo conflict into Albanian
homes with graphic reports about the struggle between Kosovo
Albanian ``heroes'' and their Serb ``enemy.''
	   The regular appeals on state television for Albanians to ``give
their all for Kosovo's independence'' are at odds with Prime
Minister Fatos Nano's support for peaceful dialogue to end the
fighting between the Serb-led Yugoslav government and Kosovo
Albanian rebels.
	   But the government in Tirana barely controls this impoverished,
factious country of more than 3 million people and broadcasting
programs like Monday's televised concert, ``Kosovo, The Cradle of
Freedom'' is one way to address popular pro-KLA sentiment.
	   A performer dressed in a KLA uniform sang the ``KLA's anthem''
and the audience joined the other onstage performers chanting
``UCK, UCK,'' the rebels' Albanian language initials.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army is seeking independence for the
Yugoslav province, where Albanians form 90 percent of the
population. A hard-line KLA wing also seeks to unite
Albanian-speaking communities throughout the Balkans into a
``Greater Albania,'' which Yugoslavia and major powers oppose.
	   ``There is a big difference between what the government declares
and what it really does,'' said Remzi Lani, an Albanian political
analyst. ``The world has closed one eye to what's happening in
Albania. Albania has closed both of them.''
	   KLA rebels move freely from northern sanctuaries into
Yugoslavia, carrying weapons and ammunition to battle the Serbs.
	   Former President Sali Berisha, who was defeated by Nano in last
year's elections, openly supports the KLA, apparently gambling that
nationalist feelings among Albanians will propel him back to power.
	   Nano, whose shaky government desperately needs foreign
assistance to rebuild the economy, has tried to steer a course
between the Americans and Europeans _ who oppose Kosovo
independence and a ``Greater Albania'' _ and Berisha's vigorous
opposition.
	   Albanian state television has set up a special Kosovo department
financed by Albanian communities abroad and with links to a Kosovo
government-in-exile.
	   Six staffers prepare a daily program about Kosovo, in which
about 15 Kosovo Albanian correspondents provide satellite-telephone
reports of the fighting. KLA rebels are referred to as ``the
heroes.'' Serbs are ``the enemy.'' Videotapes from the front are
ferried by KLA fighters.
	   The rest of the two-hour program is devoted to dramas,
documentaries and concerts promoting ``Albanianism.'' A recent
documentary _ ``An Unseparated People'' _ featured the Albanian
version of the centuries-long struggle between Albanians and Serbs
in the southern Balkans.
	   ``The Kosovo Liberation Army is a hope, a historic chance which
probably will never come again,'' the commentator said.
	   A senior adviser to the prime minister said the broadcasts do
not reflect official policy _ even though the station is
government-run.
	   But the adviser, Vladimir Prela, said any attempt to shut down
the Kosovo department or tone down coverage would backfire among
the population of this once-reclusive nation thrust only recently
into the world stage.
	   Bajram Asllani, chief of Albanian television's Kosovo
department, makes no secret of his views.
	   ``This is a historic chance for Albanians,'' Asllani said in an
interview. ``And if our leaders in Tirana and (Kosovo's capital)
Pristina fail to take it, shame on them for the rest of the
history.''
	   Foreign Minister Paskal Milo admitted for the first time Monday
that the government ``has often been obliged to give explanations
to foreign governments and international organizations for certain
television reports.''
	   ``Only a few days ago, we had to answer for such irresponsible
reports,'' Milo said.
	   He was referring to a television report quoting a KLA statement
urging Kosovo Albanians to abandon pacifist leader Ibrahim Rugova,
whom the Americans and Europeans are promoting to head an Albanian
delegation in future peace talks with the Yugoslavs.

 &UR; Pantani still in yellow after Ullrich challenge &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with day's stage
 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALBERTVILLE, France (AP) - Marco Pantani held onto the yellow
jersey Tuesday in the 16th stage of the Tour de France although
defending champion Jan Ullrich laid down a challenge to keep his
title in a thrilling head-to-head duel.
	   At the end of the stage, less than 5 centimeters (2 inches)
separated them. But the real racing happened over the last 60
kilometers (37 miles) which they did together with no other riders
in sight.
	   First up most of the 20-kilometer (12.5 mile) Madelaine peak.
Then the last 40 kilometers downhill at speeds approaching 100 kph
(61 mph).
	   Ullrich did most of the work, trying to break Pantani. He wanted
to cut a the gap that Pantani built Monday when Ullrich lost nearly
nine minutes to the Italian during the day.
	   Only on the final flat of more than 10 kilometers (6 miles) did
Pantani share pace-setting chores with Ullrich to maintain their
gap over the others.
	   In the final stretch both sprinted and Ullrich came out ahead
but just barely over Pantani.
	   American Bobby Julich, who was in second entering the day to
Pantani, was dropped by the two on the final climb. He managed to
finish 1 minute 49 seconds behind to hold onto second place overall
by 14 seconds over Ullrich.
	   Julich now trails by 5:42 in the overall standings with Ullrich
now at 5:56.
	   At the beginning of the day he had led Ullrich by 2:03.
	   Tuesday's stage had five climbs but all were between 950 meters
(3,106 feet) and 2,000 meters (6,540 feet). In contrast to the wet
conditions Monday, it was sunny nearly the entire way of the 204
kilometers (127 miles) from Vizille to Albertville.
	   Ullrich made a bold move on the final climb. He was trying to
cut the gap to have a chance in Saturday's time trial to hold on to
the title.
	   In the last time trial, Ullrich gained 4:21 over Pantani. In
last year's final time trial, Ullrich gained nearly four minutes.
	   France's Stephane Heulot and Germany's Rolf Aldag built up a
lead of more than six minutes enterng the final climb up the
Madelaine peak.
	   But midway up Ullrich looked around then broke away from the
small group of favorites. Only Pantani followed.
	   For the rest of the climb it was Ullrich looking straight ahead
with Pantani riding just behind the German's back wheel.
	   By the top they had passed Aldag and Heulot and built up about
two minutes on the group that included Julich and Fernando Escartin
of Spain, third entering the day.
	   Wednesday's 17th stage is the last full day in the Alps from
Albertville to Aix les Bains, 149 kilometers (92.6 miles) with
three climbs but ending with a long downhill.
	   The Tour ends Sunday.

Thai prime minister, crown prince celebrate birthdays

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
celebrated his 60th birthday Tuesday and asked military leaders not
to pay him the traditional honor of visiting him with gifts of
expensive floral arrangements.
	   Instead, the prime minister urged them to save money and either
send him a greeting card or leave birthday messages on his Internet
site, a government spokesman said.
	   Thailand is suffering through its worst economic crisis in
modern times.
	   Also celebrating a birthday Tuesday was Crown Prince
Vajiralongkorn, who turned 46. An accomplished jet fighter pilot,
Vajiralongkorn is next in line to succeed his father, King Bhumibol
Adulyadej, ninth ruler of the Chakri dynasty and Thailand's
constitutional monarch .
	   With more than 51 years on the throne, King Bhumibol is the
longest-reigning monarch in the world.

Sprinters highlight Gaz de France meet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - Although Wednesday's Gaz de France meet isn't part
of the Golden League yet, it offers a top field including a star
100-meter event.
	   World champion Maurice Greene, Olympic champion and world
record-holder Donovan Bailey, Ato Boldon and Frankie Fredericks
meet. It is their first confrontation since the Goodwill Games 100
that caused some harsh feelings among them when Bailey eased up.
	   Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco, who set the world record in the
1,500 and just missed the mile and 2,000-meter records within a
week, is set to try again for the mile record.
	   At the Nice meet almost two weeks ago he missed the mile mark by
just .21 seconds.
	   Algeria's Noureddine Morceli, who has the records mile and 2,000
meters but lost the 1,500-meter record to El Guerrouj, is also
entered in the field. Moreceli set the 2,000-meter world record in
this Paris meet three years ago.
	   Marion Jones, the top women's sprinter this year, is entered in
the 100 and long jump to try to duplicate her double at the
American championships and the Goodwill Games.
	   Others in the meet include Sergei Bubka, struggling to return to
top form with 35 world records, indoors and outdoors, in the pole
vault. Jeff Hartwig, fresh from an American record of 6.01 meters
(19 feet, 8 1/2 inches), is also entered.
	   At least four other members of the pole vault's ``6-meter club'
are scheduled to compete.
	   The women's distance events are highlighted by Russian Svetlana
Masterkova, who won two gold medals at the Atlanta Olympics.
	   Michael Johnson, who anchored the American team to a world
record in the 1,600-meter relay last week at the Goodwill Games,
was a late scratch.
	   At last year's Gaz de France meet Johnson came in fifth in the
400, his first loss at that distance in eight years. That started a
string of defeats for him in 1997 before he returned to top
condition this year.

Thailand to begin receiving gas from Myanmar pipeline July 30
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand will begin receiving gas from
Myanmar Thursday as the Yadana pipeline project becomes
operational, the Petroleum Authority of Thailand said.
	   The dlrs 1.2 billion project, owned by Total of France, Unocal
of the United States, PTT and Myanmar's military government,
carries gas from the coastal waters of Myanmar, also known as
Burma, to a power plant in Ratchaburi, Thailand.
	   The project has been dogged by criticism and lawsuits by
democracy and environmental activists.
	   They charge that Myanmar's military regime has used forced labor
to build infrastructure necessary for the pipeline and that its
profits will shore up a government that is strapped for cash and
spends most of its budget on weapons to repress its own people.
	   The pipeline was attacked at least once by ethnic guerrillas
fighting Myanmar's military government.
	   Environmental activists contend that the project has destroyed
rain forests and the habitat of wild animals including elephants,
Thailand's national symbol.
	   The companies involved deny all the charges.

Russia's two largest tax delinquents complain their debts mounting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; RECASTS, UPDATES with closing markets. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's two largest tax delinquents _ the huge
natural gas and electricity monopolies _ complained Tuesday that
the government and other customers are not paying their bills.
	   Gazprom and Unified Energy System said their unpaid bills have
risen substantially over last year, despite government promises to
get tough with customers who don't pay up.
	   If customers don't pay for gas and electricity, the companies
can't pay their taxes, and the government can't pay salaries and
wages, thus perpetuating one of the vicious circles at the heart of
Russia's economic woes.
	   In a glimmer of good news, the Russian stock market rose 4.5
percent Tuesday after six straight days of decline.
	   Consumer debts to Unified Energy System, which controls most of
Russia's electrical grid, rose by 26 percent this year to 129
billion rubles (dlrs 20 billion) as of the beginning of July, said
Alexander Remyozov, deputy chairman of the board.
	   Gazprom, Russia's largest company and the world's largest gas
company, has racked up consumer debts of 98.7 billion rubles (dlrs
15.9 billion rubles), up 16 percent over last year, said its deputy
board chairman, Valery Remizov.
	   Both men spoke at a meeting called to discuss the energy
industry's preparations for winter.
	   ``Gazprom has ended up in a role of a cheap lender to the whole
Russian economy,'' Remizov said. He urged the Energy Ministry to
take tougher action against debtors, many of whom he said have
foreign currency bank accounts.
	   But the government is one of the main debtors.
	   Viktor Ott, the first deputy minister for fuel and energy, said
43 percent of all consumer debts to UES were from government-funded
agencies who have run up huge unpaid bills for gas and electricity.
	   That includes 16 billion rubles (dlrs 2.6 billion) owed by the
federal government and 15.5 billion rubles (dlrs 2.5 billion) owed
by regional governments, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Gazprom and UES owe hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid
taxes. Earlier this summer, the government threatened to seize
assets from some delinquents unless they paid up but then softened
its demands.
	   In other economic news Tuesday, the Central Bank said that 363
of the country's small commercial banks are in financial trouble
and must close or merge with more stable financial institutions by
Jan. 1.
	   And the Finance Ministry called off sales of two large lots of
treasury bills that had been planned for Wednesday, amid signs of
scant demand.
	   It's another sign that investors have not yet fully regained
their confidence in the Russian market, despite a recently approved
dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package from the International Monetary
Fund and others.

Malaysia wants seven sites on heritage list
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia is pushing for the
inclusion of seven sites in UNESCO's World Heritage List of
important historic and cultural landmarks.
	   Education Minister Najib Tun Razak, who is president of the
UNESCO Malaysia National Commission, said Tuesday that Malaysia had
no sites on the global list.
	   The United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural
Organization lists 516 sites in 108 countries. Najib complained
that more than half of these were in Europe.
	   ``Something must be done to check this domination,'' he said.
	   Malaysia ought to be included because it was a signatory to the
global convention to protect cultural and natural heritage, the
domestic news agency Bernama quoted Najib as saying.
	   ``This matter should be given attention as even other small
countries such as Laos, Bangladesh and Nepal have entered their
sites in the world list,'' Najib said at a seminar on heritage in
the northern town of Penang.
	   The proposed Malaysian sites are three national parks and four
sites linked to local history and culture.

 &UR; BMW buys Rolls-Royce brand name, leaving VW to produce Bentleys &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos LON109-110 &QL; 
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The grandest name of British motoring,
Rolls-Royce, was shaken up Tuesday in a deal that will see separate
German automakers producing Rolls-Royce and Bentley models in a few
years.
	   BMW will make Rolls-Royces after buying the rights to the famous
brand and announcing plans to create a new Rolls-Royce company,
while Volkwswagen AG will keep the old Rolls-Royce factory it just
bought and continue producing the Bentley line of luxury cars.
	   VW paid 479 million pounds (dlrs 790 million) for Rolls-Royce
Motor Cars Ltd. early this month, but Europe's biggest automaker
faced one big problem: The purchase didn't include the rights to
the Rolls-Royce brand name and logo.
	   Those were held by the British jet engine maker Rolls-Royce PLC,
which had hoped the luxury carmaker would be sold to Germany's BMW
_ its partner in an aerospace engine venture. Rolls-Royce PLC said
Tuesday it would sell the Rolls-Royce auto brand to BMW for 40
million pounds (dlrs 66 million).
	   BMW said Tuesday that VW can use the Rolls-Royce name for free
until Dec. 31, 2002, but after that BMW will take the name away and
create a new Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd.
	   The VW chairman, Ferdinand Piech, disputed suggestions he had
been defeated, insisting in a news conference that VW paid a fair
price for what it got. Piech said Tuesday's accord was a better
solution than a drawn-out legal fight over the name.
	   ``I would have preferred to keep both brands, but the way _ how
it developed today _ I am very satisfied,'' Piech told a news
conference.
	   Analysts said that if VW had tried to get the brand name, it
would have faced a tough battle against Rolls-Royce PLC and BMW
that probably would have been more trouble than it was worth.
	   Tuesday's deal ``has to be seen in part as a humiliation for
Volkswagen, but also a pragmatic development,'' said Nick Snee, a
stock analyst who follows auto companies for J.P. Morgan Securities
in London.
	   Uncertainty over the future at Rolls-Royce had pushed new car
orders down by about 30 percent over the past six weeks, but
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars chairman Graham Morris predicted sales now
can bounce back.
	   VW will keep the Rolls-Royce factory in Crewe, England, but the
company's name will be changed in 2003 to Bentley Motor Cars Ltd.
VW then will produce Bentleys, the luxury line that now accounts
for about 70 percent of the cars sold by Rolls-Royce.
	   It remains unclear how much BMW will spend to set up a new
Rolls-Royce company or precisely where it will be located. BMW
chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder would say only that Rolls-Royces
would be made in England.
	   Rolls-Royce Motor Cars was put up for sale last autumn by the
British conglomerate Vickers PLC, which wanted to focus on other
operations including defense contracting. VW finally won the
bidding, in a deal that drew angry patriotic outbursts from many
Englishmen, as well as failed attempts to keep Rolls-Royce British.
	   Rolls-Royce PLC was separated from the motor car business in an
early 1970s restructuring _ but it maintained the rights to the
all-important brand name.
	   Rolls-Royce PLC will hold a seat on the board of the new
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, and the Rolls-Royce chairman, Sir Ralph
Robins, called the deal ``an Anglo-German success.''
	   But one question was posed several times with no precise
answers: Why didn't VW even try to buy the Rolls-Royce brand name
from the British owners? Apparently because it decided tangling
with Rolls-Royce PLC would be futile, analysts said.
	   ``VW got the worst of the deal,'' said Lydia Aydon, news editor
at London's weekly Auto Express. ``They're publicly saying they're
satisfied, but I think behind closed doors they're not real
happy.''
	   As part of Tuesday's deal, BMW withdrew its earlier threat to
cut off engines it supplies to Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.
	   BMW said it's willing to keep providing engines for the Bentley
Arnage models as long as VW continues to make them. After BMW
starts making Rolls-Royces and VW concentrates on making Bentleys,
the German companies will cooperate on producing Rolls-Royce Silver
Seraph models at the old factory in Crewe.

Thousands attend funeral for actor Farid Shawqi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Nearly 3,000 fans and mourners crowded
outside a Cairo mosque Tuesday for the funeral of Farid Shawqi, the
actor known as the ``King of the Screen.''
	   Shawqi, who underwent several heart operations, died in a Cairo
hospital on Monday. He was 76.
	   On Tuesday, police closed a main street in midtown Cairo as four
men carried Shawqi's coffin, draped in Egypt's red, black and white
flag, from the mosque.
	   Onlookers, curious to see movie and television stars, crowded
the street.
	   Heavy-set with angular features, Shawqi earned his reputation
playing tough guy roles. He acted in nearly 400 films since
starting his career in 1949.
	   Among his best known films are ``They Made Me a Criminal,''
directed by Atef Salem, and ``The Bully,'' by Salah Abu Seif, which
won a prize at the 1956 Berlin Cinema Festival.
	   He also wrote and starred in a television soap opera called
``The Miser and I'' in addition to a few stage plays.
	   Shawqi is survived by his wife, Soheir el-Turk, and four
daughters, two from a previous marriage.

Southeast Asia praises China for resisting devaluation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Southeast Asian nations, seeking more
help from almost everyone to overcome a regional economic crisis,
patted China on the back Tuesday for what it did not do: devalue
its currency.
	   ``ASEAN welcomes China's firm commitment to maintain the
stability of the renminbi as an important contribution to financial
stability in the region,'' Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan of
Thailand said at a meeting between the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations and major world powers.
	   The economic crisis began in July 1997, when Thailand devalued
its baht, sparking speculative attacks on currencies and
devaluations throughout the region. China has been losing money in
trade because its non-convertible currency has not been devalued,
an act that would throw Asia into a fresh decline.
	   ``We welcomed the Chinese continuing contribution by not
devaluing the renminbi at some loss to China,'' Malaysian Foreign
Minister Abdullah Badawi said after an ASEAN-China dialogue. ``If
China maintains an active interest in the economies of Southeast
Asia, she will be well-placed to play a catalytic role'' in the
region.
	   Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan proudly described his own
country's policies as ``highly responsible'' in remarks to the
Southeast Asian nations.
	   ``While working to expand domestic demand to boost its economic
growth, China persists in not devaluing,'' Tang said. He mentioned
a dlrs 4 billion Chinese contribution to the International Monetary
Fund aid to Indonesia and other bilateral assistance.
	   Tang ``said there may be other initiatives China can take,''
Abdullah told reporters after the meeting. But they were not
itemized. ``I would like to believe that China is sincere in
wanting to help the ailing Southeast Asian economies.''
	   There apparently was little progress in persuading China to
accede to a treaty that would make Southeast Asia, including the
surrounding international waters, a nuclear weapons-free zone.
	   ``China will continue to make contacts and have discussions''
with ASEAN about the treaty, said Abdullah. ``Perhaps later they
might consider acceding to the treaty.''

German court OKs first-ever deportation of delinquent minor, with
</HEADLINE>
parents &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ A Munich court gave its approval Tuesday
for the state of Bavaria to deport to Turkey a 14-year-old juvenile
deliquent and his parents, who have lived in Germany more than 30
years.
	   It was the first time a German state prepared to expel an entire
family because of the crimes of the child, and comes amid a growing
election-year clamor in Germany to crack down on foreigners who
commit crimes here.
	   Because of the seriousness of the case, Munich Mayor Christian
Ude said they would give the family a chance to appeal to a higher
court before acting on the order. That court was expected to rule
within a few days.
	   The boy, known as Mehmet, has committed more than 60 offenses.
He been in police custody in Munich since allegedly committing
another robbery early this month.
	   His parents, accused of failing to properly raise the boy, were
also ordered expelled. They appealed to the administrative court in
Munich.
	   The court ruled Tuesday that the teen-ager's ``years-long
serious criminal behavior'' and the public security interest
justified expelling him, despite his age. It said private
counseling the boy received through a church had apparently been
``completely unsuccessful.''
	   It also saw nothing wrong with expelling his parents with him.
	   While the decision was welcomed by Ude and other city and state
officials, the liberal Greens Party accused the state of trying to
make an entire family liable for the crimes of one member.

Kosovo government-in-exile claims account blocked by Swiss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ An official of Kosovo's self-proclaimed
government-in-exile said Tuesday it holds one of two bank accounts
frozen by the Swiss on suspicion that money they contain is used to
buy weapons for independence fighters.
	   But Xhafer Shatri, a Swiss-based spokesman for the Kosovo
Information Center which is close to the province's moderate
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, denied that cash from the account
is spent on arms.
	   ``The money has always been used for humanitarian, social,
cultural and educational purposes,'' he said.
	   Shatri didn't say how much the account contained, but said
several tens of millions of Swiss francs (dlrs) donated by the
Kosovo Albanian population in Switzerland had passed through it
since it was opened six years ago.
	   On Monday, the Swiss authorities froze the account and another
run by the Popular Movement of Kosovo, a group supporting the
Kosovo Liberation Army, amid suspicions that money from them is
used to finance illegal trafficking of arms in Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians are fighting for independence from Yugoslavia.
	   The government-in-exile's Geneva office was searched by Swiss
police on Monday, the Swiss daily newspaper Tribune de Geneve
reported Tuesday.
	   Juerg Blaser, spokesman for the Swiss Federal Prosecutor's
Office, confirmed Tuesday that a Geneva location was searched and
documents were confiscated, but declined to give further details.
	   The raid was part of an operation in which police also searched
the homes of three PMK members in eastern Switzerland and detained
several people.
	   The three men are signatories to the frozen PMK account, which
the group claims is used to collect cash for humanitarian aid to
Kosovo Albanians.
	   Speaking to reporters Monday, PMK spokesman Mahmuti Bardhyl
wouldn't rule out the possibility that money from the group's
account is used to buy arms.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Alleging that ``many
irregularities'' had marred Cambodia's election, opposition parties
asked Tuesday that new votes be taken in disputed precincts if
wrongdoing was found.
	   They also threatened to boycott the National Assembly if their
complaints were not heeded, bringing the prospect that Cambodia
will remain in a state of political turmoil.
	   The opposition parties anticipate that official election results
will favor the ruling party of strongman Hun Sen, although only a
small number of partial results have been released so far from
Sunday's election.
	   The National Election Committee has released preliminary
official tallies for half the communes in 11 of the 21 provinces.
Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party was well ahead of its opponents.
	   Opposition suspicions have been stirred by the circulation of an
unofficial tally by Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian Peoples Party,
showing it had won 67 of the National Assembly's 122 seats.
	   According to CPP figures, the royalist FUNCINPEC party of Prince
Norodom Ranariddh took 42 seats and the Sam Rainsy Party just 13.
Ranariddh was deposed by Hun Sen, his co-premier, in a coup last
year.
	   FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party issued a statement saying
they ``cannot accept the results of these elections'' until their
allegations of irregularities in voting, ballot counting and
results reporting had been thoroughly investigated by national and
international observers.
	   But international election observers, upon whose support the
opposition parties are depending, appeared inclined to certify the
election as free and fair enough to be considered legitimate,
pending the full release of credible results.
	   Most international groups, which sent a total of almost 700
observers, have already said that Sunday's voting was conducted in
a fair and efficient manner.
	   ``The balloting and counting processes were generally well
administered, and the atmosphere on the balloting and counting days
was largely upbeat,'' said a statement from a U.S. delegation. It
was sent by the National Democratic Institute for International
Affairs and the International Republican Institute.
	   It added, however, that such an accomplishment could not
``negate the violence, extensive intimidation, unfair media access
and ruling party control of the administrative machinery that
characterized the pre-election period.''
	   Stephen Solarz, a former U.S. congressman who is co-leader of
the delegation, said that allegations of fraudulent vote-counting
should be immediately and thoroughly investigated to determine if
they were extensive enough to affect the election's validity.
	   But he also said that state control of the electoral process
``does not appear to have been used to fundamentally distort the
results,'' and indicated that his group would defer to Cambodia's
National Election Committee to investigate the complaints about the
counting.
	   The opposition feels the committee is stacked with Hun Sen
supporters.
	   A small but prestigious observer group whose co-leader is former
Australian Ambassador Tony Kevin issued a more-or-less unqualified
endorsement of the polls.
	   The statement from the Volunteer Observers for the Cambodian
Elections _ widely seen as sympathetic to Hun Sen _ said it
believed the election ``was an authentic expression of the
Cambodian people's choice.''
	   Hun Sen's party, meanwhile, shrugged off opposition threats to
boycott the new National Assembly and suggested a coalition.
	   ``If they don't, the current government will go until probably
2003, but I think they should uphold national interests and join a
coalition government,'' said Svay Sitha, a CPP steering committee
member.
	   If Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy boycott the National Assembly, they
could block its ability to do anything because two-thirds of the
members must be present to hold meetings.
	   The dispute raised the prospect of more turmoil in a country
that suffered the Khmer Rouge genocide of the 1970s and 30 years of
civil war and strife. In the latest round, Hun Sen deposed
Ranariddh as co-prime minister last year in two days of fighting in
the capital.
	   The co-premiership emerged from U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993
meant to usher in a new era of peace and democracy.
	   Ranariddh won, but Hun Sen, who came to power in 1985 under the
harsh Vietnamese occupation that followed the Khmer Rouge, forced
his way into a coalition by threatening war.
	   Hun Sen called the elections in a bid to win back international
aid and legitimacy, but used violence, including murder, against
opposition activists and intimidation of voters to ensure his
victory.
	   Ranariddh and Hun Sen both said they would reject another
co-premiership, calling it a recipe for disaster.

Pope mourns slayings of nuns in Yemen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II has mourned the slaying of
three nuns from Mother Teresa's order in Yemen, saying he hoped
their ``supreme sacrifice'' will help relations between Christians
and Muslims.
	   The three were shot dead Monday by gunmen firing from a car
passing their clinic in the Red Sea city of Hodeida, a Yemeni
government official said.
	   Police say they have arrested one of the gunmen who has
confessed to killing the nuns, one of whom was from the Philippines
and two were Indian.
	   The Vatican sent condolence messages in the pope's name Tuesday
to the local church representative, based in the United Arab
Emirates, and to Sister Nirmala, successor to Mother Teresa, who
died last year.
	   The message to Sister Nirmala said the pope ``prays that their
supreme sacrifice will help to further the cause of interreligious
understanding and esteem.''
	   Yemen is overwhelmingly Muslim. The 3,000 Roman Catholics in
Yemen are foreign workers.
	   In March, following a visit by a Vatican delegation, Yemen and
the Vatican agreed to establish diplomatic relations.

Malaysia to resume crackdown on illegal immigrants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia is preparing for another
massive crackdown on illegal immigrants, news reports said Tuesday.
	   The government has set a deadline of Aug. 15 for employers of
foreign workers to renew work permits.
	   One day after that deadline, authorities will swoop down on
workplaces known to employ foreign workers, targeting restaurants,
food stalls, hotels, factories and plantations, Tajol Rosli
Ghazali, deputy home minister, was quoted as saying by the Sun
newspaper.
	   Tajol said authorities would ``show no mercy'' to employers
caught with illegal foreign workers.
	   ``Housewives employing foreign maids are not exempted,'' and
government workers would be either fined or fired if caught
employing a foreigner illegally, the minister said.
	   Malaysia, gripped with rising unemployment, launched a
nationwide crackdown last year on illegal foreign workers to free
up jobs for locals. More than 30,000 illegal aliens, mainly from
Indonesia, have been deported.
	   The government said recently that Malaysia had 977,276 foreign
workers, compared with 1.1 million earlier.

Local flood warning announced in Poland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A flood warning was issued Tuesday for
parts of southeastern Poland as heavy rains moved across the
country, but meteorologists said rivers in the area should stay
within their banks.
	   Heavy rainfall was recorded Monday in southwestern Opole
province, which was hit hard in last summer's disastrous floods.
Firefighters were repeatedly called to pump out water from flooded
basements but the Oder River level did not rise.
	   A flood committee in the Rzeszow province, 280 kilometers (175
miles) southeast from Warsaw, appealed to residents Tuesday to
safeguard their houses against possible flooding. Rainfall of over
100 millimeters (4 inches) within 12 hours was expected overnight.
	   But Marianna Sasim of the Meteorological Institute in Warsaw
said the water level in rivers in the province should not reach
alarm levels.
	   Last week, heavy rain caused flash floods in the Klodzko region,
near the border with the Czech republic. Nine people were killed,
including a 40-year-old man whose body was only discovered late
Monday.
	   The weather is expected to improve on Wednesday with the low
moving east over Lithuania and Latvia, according to the Institute.

Rights group opposes plan to use vigilantes against street girls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAVAO, Philippines (AP) _ A children's rights group said Tuesday
it opposes a plan to use anti-communist vigilantes to arrest street
girls for vagrancy in a southern Philippine city.
	   Mayor Benjamin de Guzman said members of the anti-communist Alsa
Masa group have pledged to help the city keep the girls off the
streets.
	   De Guzman said the girls will be arrested if they violate the
city's 10 p.m.-4 a.m. curfew for minors unaccompanied by adults.
	   Betty Cabazares, executive director of the Tambayan Center for
the Care of Abused Children, said such a move would not solve the
problem of young homeless girls or those who have fled their homes
to escape abuse.
	   ``They will be more abused,'' she said.
	   Mrs. Cabazares said police officers or local authorities had
abused many of the girls, aged 9 to 18, who have been held in local
jails ``for safekeeping'' under a local ordinance setting the
curfew.
	   The Alsa Masa was formed as vigilante group that fought
communist urban guerrillas in Davao in the 1980s. It later became
notorious for human rights violations, but was supported and armed
by the Philippine military.
	   Mrs. Cabazares said her group has documented at least 323 street
girls over the past two years, but the actual number could be
bigger.
	   She said the number of street girls is also growing in nearby
General Santos City southwest of Davao, about 960 kilometers (600
miles) southeast of Manila.
	   The local press calls the girls ``buntog,'' the name of a type
of quail that hops from nest to nest, a suggestion that the girls
engage in free sex or prostitution.
	   But Mrs. Cabazares said the girls, who have joined street gangs,
have abandoned their homes in an ``act of survival.'' About 70
percent do not go to school.
	   She said poverty is a major reason why the girls leave their
homes, but that many were also abused at home.
	   Mayor de Guzman said the vigilantes would be trained so that the
children ``will be handled with care.''
	   Mrs. Cabazares, however, said ``the problem of the children is a
social problem and the measures are police measures.''
	   ``Definitely it will not solve the problem,'' she said.

Palestinian security chief, in shift, takes tough anti-Hamas line
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ Signaling what could be new
willingness by the Palestinian leadership to crack down on Hamas,
Yasser Arafat's chief enforcer took a confrontational tone Tuesday
in remarks about the Islamic militant group.
	   During a question-and-answer session with foreign news
organizations, Jibril Rajoub, head of Palestinian preventive
security in the West Bank, sharply criticized neighboring Jordan
for allowing Hamas to use it as a staging ground.
	   In the session near his headquarters in the West Bank town of
Jericho, Rajoub also insisted that the death of Hamas' chief
bombmaker four months ago was the result of an internal feud _
something Hamas has bitterly denied _ and declared that one of the
militant group's top political leaders should be given as long
prison term to set an example.
	   Hamas, which bitterly opposes the Oslo peace accords and has
staged suicide attacks that have killed scores of Israelis, has
long presented a thorny problem for Arafat.
	   As a rule, the Palestinian leader avoids direct confrontations
with Hamas, but relations between his government and the Islamic
group have deteriorated in recent months.
	   The remarks of Rajoub, which almost certainly indicate the
thinking of Arafat and his inner circle, reflected those growing
tensions. The comments also come at a delicate moment in efforts to
restart the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
	   During the 16-month impasse, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has incessantly criticized Arafat's Palestinian Authority
for failing to take sufficient steps to fight terrorism.
	   Rajoub stopped well short of deferring to the Israeli leader on
that point _ ``I'm not looking for some certification from
Netanyahu,'' he said sardonically.
	   Even so, he took surprisingly sharp aim at Hamas' spiritual
leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, who returned to the Gaza Strip 10
months ago after being freed from Israeli prison.
	   During a three-month fundraising tour of Arab states that ended
last month, Yassin repeatedly criticized Arafat's policies and
advocated a return to the armed Palestinian struggle.
	   Rajoub was dismissive of Yassin's activities, saying the sheik
had ``failed in reorganizing Hamas.'' But he coupled that with the
most explicit worded warning yet from a top Palestinian official
that the sheik would not be allowed to become too powerful.
	   ``I didn't take part in the national struggle for 18 years...to
see Sheik Ahmed Yassin leading the Palestinian people,'' Rajoub
said, adding: ``I don't think Palestinians want to live in an
Islamic state.''
	   In the session with reporters, the Palestinian security chief
also said jailed Hamas political leader Abdel Aziz Rantisi deserved
to spend 15 or 20 years behind bars.
	   Rantisi was arrested in April and charged with endangering
national security. Last month, the Palestinian Supreme Court
ordered him released for lack of evidence, but he remains in
prison, with new charges being prepared against him.
	   Rajoub also reiterated that the death of chief Hamas bombmaker
Mohiyadine Sharif _ whose mangled body was found March 29 at the
scene of a massive car-bomb blast in the West Bank town of Ramallah
_ was the result of an internal Hamas feud. Hamas has angrily
denied that and blamed Israel for the killing.
	   Soon after the slaying, Palestinian police jailed Imad
Awadallah, a close associate of the slain man in the Hamas military
wing. Rajoub said Awadallah had confessed and would be tried.
	   He also suggested that Hamas should provide a full accounting of
the slaying. ``I'm waiting for Hamas to tell us something _
anything,'' he said.
	   The Palestinian security chief also took issue with what he said
was Jordan's acquiescence to being used as a prime Hamas base.
	   ``The Jordanians adopted the Hamas leadership and provide the
facilities,'' he said. ``All (Hamas') financial support is in
Jordan _ the orders come from there.''
	   Asked why Hamas had desisted in suicide attacks for nearly a
year, Rajoub said it was only because of the continued deadlock in
negotiations with Israel.
	   ``When there is no progress, there are no attacks,'' he said.

Statue near Buchenwald camp vandalized
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WEIMAR, Germany (AP) _ Vandals sawed into a group of 3.5-meter
(11.5-foot) bronze statues of survivors of the former Buchenwald
concentration camp in eastern Germany, the museum said Tuesday.
	   Marks from a saw and other tools were found on the statue of a
child, which is among the 11 figures depicted in the 1958 Fritz
Cremer work near the former camp, spokeswoman Ursula Hertel said.
The figure's right leg was sawn about two-thirds of the way
through, Hertel said.
	   There were no immediate suspects in the vandalism.
	   Emil Carlebach, vice president of the international committee of
Buchenwald survivors, said his group demanded that everything be
done to find and punish those responsible.
	   From 1937 to 1945, Nazis interned about 263,000 people from more
than 30 countries at Buchenwald, including communists and others
who resisted Nazi rule, Jews and Gypsies. Some 56,000 people died
there, including at least 11,000 Jews.

Celtic fears early exit from Champions Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Despite ending Rangers' nine-season reign as
Scottish titlist, Celtic appears to have inherited its neighbor's
abysmal record in the Champions Cup.
	   The Bhoys go to Dublin tied 0-0 with the semi-pros of St.
Patrick's Athletic in Wednesday's qualifying round.
	   A loss at Tolka Park would mean that, yet again, Scotland will
have no further interest in Europe's foremost club competition.
	   Last season Rangers, playing in the competition for the ninth
season in a row, lost in the second qualifying round. Its only
highlight during a near decade of domestic domination was knocking
out English titlist Leeds back in 1993 and reaching the last 16.
	   Celtic, now managed by well-respected Slovak Josef Venglos, is
striving for a lucrative matchup with Croatia Zagreb, which has six
members of Croatia's World Cup semifinal roster.
	   To get to that stage it can't afford any slipups in Dublin. A
week ago the Bhoys were jeered off their own field by 57,000 fans
in Glasgow after the tame goal-less tie with the League of Ireland
champion.
	   Swedish forward Henrik Larsson hopes to have shaken off a leg
injury and French defender Stephane Mahe should be fit to face the
Irish club.
	   Scottish World Cup player Craig Burley admits Celtic is a slow
starter to the season but has the habit of fighting back.
	   ``One of the most pleasing aspects of last season was the way we
were able to recover from setbacks quickly, especially after losing
our first two games,'' the midfielder said.
	   ``I'd like to think we'd retain that quality this time and I'm
not worried about anything that's happened in the last week.''
	   While the Scots have big problems achieving success in the
Champions Cup, Dynamo Kiev of modest Ukraine relishes playing in
the competition.
	   Quarterfinalist last season, Kiev was still made to go through
the qualifying stage this term because Ukraine, a comparative
newcomer in European competitions, doesn't have a great record
overall.
	   Kiev scored a crushing 8-0 victory over minnow Barry Town of the
Welsh League with four goals coming from Serhiy Rebrov and is
virtually sure to meet Sparta Prague in the second qualifying
round.
	   Poland's LKS Lodz looks set to meet powerhouse Manchester
United. It holds a 4-1 first leg lead over Kapaz of Azerbaijan,
which needs at least a 3-0 win to ensure two games against one of
Europe's most glamorous clubs.
	   Yugoslavia's Obilic, ahead 2-0 from the first leg at home, goes
to Iceland to hold off a challenge from Vestmannaeyja and set up a
second qualifying round matchup with mighty Bayern Munich, a
three-time Champions Cup titlist.
	   In the UEFA Cup, Rangers survived a nightmare start against
another Irish club, Shelbourne, falling 3-0 behind with little over
a half hour to go.
	   But the Glasgow club, the biggest spender in Britain when it
comes to transfers, hit back for a 5-3 away victory and will be
confident of finishing the job at its own Ibrox Park.

Kosovo government-in-exile claims account blocked by Swiss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ An official of Kosovo's self-proclaimed
government-in-exile said Tuesday that it owns one of two frozen
Swiss bank accounts, but denied that the funds were being used to
buy weapons for independence fighters.
	   ``The money has always been used for humanitarian, social,
cultural and educational purposes,'' said Xhafer Shatri, a
Swiss-based spokesman for the Kosovo Information Center. The Center
is allied with the moderate ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Shatri didn't say how much the account contained, but said tens
of millions of Swiss francs (dlrs) donated by the Kosovo Albanian
population in Switzerland had passed through the account since it
was opened six years ago.
	   On Monday, Swiss authorities froze the account and another run
by the Popular Movement of Kosovo, or PMK, a group that supports
the militant Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for
independence for the Serb-controlled province, which is 90 percent
Albanian. They suspect the accounts were used to finance illegal
arms trafficking in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians are fighting for
independence from Yugoslavia.
	   Swiss police searched the Geneva office of the
government-in-exile on Monday, the daily newspaper Tribune de
Geneve reported Tuesday.
	   Juerg Blaser, spokesman for the Swiss Federal Prosecutor's
Office, confirmed Tuesday that a Geneva location was searched and
documents were confiscated, but declined to give further details.
	   The raid was part of an operation in which police also searched
the homes of three PMK members in eastern Switzerland and detained
several people.
	   The three men are signatories to the frozen PMK account, which
the group claims is used for humanitarian aid to Kosovo's
Albanians.
	   Speaking to reporters Monday, PMK spokesman Mahmuti Bardhyl
wouldn't rule out that money from the group's account is used to
buy arms.

Trade deficit narrows due to weaker domestic demand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Weaker domestic demand in recession-bound Hong
Kong led to a smaller trade deficit in the first half of this year,
a government report said Tuesday.
	   A trade deficit of 67.2 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 8.6
billion) was recorded for 1998's first six months.
	   The deficit for the same period last year was 96.5 billion Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 12.3 billion), government statistics said.
	   Overall, exports shrank 2.1 percent and imports, hit by falling
demand, dropped 5.7 percent, the statement said.
	   Re-exports from China _ which form the majority of Hong Kong's
total exports _ also decreased by 1.6 percent and domestic exports
fell by 5.4 percent.
	   ``There will be a long-term impact on Hong Kong's total exports
as more and more cargo is shipped directly from mainland ports,''
said Ken Chan, senior economist at Nikko Securities.
	   Chan said that Hong Kong is already feeling the effect as China
becomes less dependent on Hong Kong for re-exporting Chinese-made
goods.
	   ``China's total exports grew 7.6 percent, and yet we have seen a
2.1 decline in total exports in Hong Kong,'' Chan said.
	   In June, total exports decreased 2 percent, or 116.7 billion
Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 14.9 billion), from the same period
last year. Imports fell 6.4 percent, or 123.3 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 15.8 billion).

Supreme Court quashes search of former prime minister's accounts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ The Supreme Court on Tuesday quashed
three dozen orders seeking information about the bank accounts of
former Prime Minister Charles J. Haughey and his family.
	   However, the court rejected Haughey's argument that the tribunal
headed by High Court Justice Michael Moriarty was illegally
constituted.
	   The Moriarty tribunal was established last year after another
tribunal confirmed that Haughey received 1.3 million pounds (dlrs
1.9 million) from Irish supermarket executive Ben Dunne.
	   If the tribunal still wants information on the Haughey family
accounts, it will have to begin the process again, giving formal
notice of each proposed order. The Haughey family would be entitled
to contest each order.
	   On Thursday, Haughey is due to appear in Dublin District Court
to face two charges of obstructing that earlier inquiry.
	   Haughey admitted a year ago that he had received money from
Dunne during his last term of office from 1987 to 1992.
	   The earlier tribunal found no firm evidence that Dunne _ whose
Dunnes Stores account for half of all grocery sales in the Irish
Republic _ won any specific political advantages from Haughey.
Dunne was deposed as head of Dunnes Stores five years ago after his
conviction for cocaine possession in the company of two prostitutes
in Florida.
	   In their appeal to the Supreme Court, Haughey's lawyers
challenged the constitutionality of a 1921 law which authorized the
creation of tribunals.
	   Haughey and his family also contended that their constitutional
rights to privacy, to hold property and to their good name were
being infringed.

Opposition newspaper may resume publication in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ An opposition-linked Ukrainian newspaper
might resume publication following a court decision against the
Information Ministry, which ordered a halt to its printing, a news
report said Tuesday.
	   The Supreme Arbitration Court ruled Monday in favor of the
founders of the Pravda Ukrainy newspaper and nullified the
ministry's decision, the Interfax news agency said.
	   The ministry acted against the centrist opposition paper in late
January, ordering a printing house to stop publishing it because of
alleged errors in re-registration papers.
	   The decision, coming before the legislative elections in March,
was criticized by Ukrainian opposition media as part of a supposed
pattern of harassment by the authorities. The old parliament
adopted two resolutions calling on the government to allow Pravda
Ukrainy to be published.
	   In a separate move, a Kiev court recently ordered tax
authorities to return about dlrs 600,000 (1.2 million hryvna)
seized from Pravda Ukrainy.

Nottingham striker hesitates before signing with Turkish team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Nottingham Forest striker Kevin Campbell
issued a last minute condition Tuesday before signing with Turkish
soccer team Trabzonspor _ he wanted to see his prospective new
home-town first and talk it over with his wife.
	   ``We have sorted everything out, but he wants to see Trabzon and
tell his wife about it before signing,'' Trabzonspor chairman
Mehmet Ali Yilmaz said after a meeting with Campbell in Istanbul.
	   The club flew Campbell to Trabzon _ a football-crazy port city
on Turkey's eastern Black Sea coast _ by private plane and planned
to return him to Istanbul later Tuesday for the signing ceremony.
	   ``The English player is going to sign this evening after seeing
the city of Trabzon and our facilities,'' a confidant Yilmaz told
the Anatolia news agency.
	   Campbell, who scored 23 goals last season as Forest won the
English Division One title, is Trabzonspor's second English
transfer this year.
	   Gordon Milne, a former England international, took over the team
in May for a two-year term. Milne previously guided Istanbul team
Besiktas to two league titles between 1987 and 1993.
	   Trabzonspor finished third in the Turkish first division soccer
league last season.

IMF mission meets Ukrainian premier in talks on large loan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW grafs 5, 10-12 to UPDATE with details of talks; deletes
outdated material. Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund said
Tuesday that Ukraine had made significant progress toward meeting
the terms for a dlrs 2.5 billion loan intended to shore up the
country's struggling economy.
	   After meeting with IMF representatives, Premier Valery
Pustovoitenko said he was hopeful that the delegation would
recommend release of the loan.
	   National Bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko said that Ukraine ``has
never been so close'' to approval of the loan. He said the
government has adopted a ``thick pile of documents'' to qualify,
the Interfax news agency reported.
	   IMF mission chief Mohammad Shadman-Valavi, in turn, noted
``significant successes'' in economic reform but said several
issues remained to be decided by Pustovoitenko.
	   Ukrainian officials said the outstanding questions concerned
changes in the value-added tax law, excise taxes, import and export
tariffs and the new 1998 budget.
	   Approval of the loan is crucial for Ukraine, which has to repay
a dlrs 18 billion foreign debt _ including about dlrs 450 million
in August alone _ and chronically fails to collect the required
budget revenues.
	   In addition, Ukraine's hryvna currency has been under pressure
in recent months because foreign investors have exited from the
country's financial market. The National Bank has depleted its
reserves to some dlrs 1.7 billion in attempts to support the
hryvna.
	   The government has approved dozens of economic reforms since
May, trying to meet requirements set by the IMF.
	   However, a key condition had not been implemented by the time
parliament began its summer recess Friday: The new 1998 budget was
not approved and the lawmakers left the decision up to the
government.
	   Deputy premier Serhiy Tyhypko said the Cabinet would offer the
final draft to President Leonid Kuchma within two days to be signed
and implemented by a presidential decree.
	   Shadman-Valavi, the IMF mission chief, said the sides had agreed
on a series of steps to reduce tax pressure on Ukrainian businesses
and other measures but had yet to to make a final decision on how
to reduce the budget deficit.
	   Ukrainian officials say the IMF loan would be used almost in
full to replenish the National Bank's reserves, which have shrunk
by more than 15 percent in the last two months due to the need to
support the hryvna.
	   Their main hope is that renewed cooperation with the IMF would
restore foreign investors' confidence in Ukraine and let the former
Soviet republic borrow abroad at lower interest rates.
	   The IMF suspended disbursement of its aid to Ukraine last
spring, citing stalled reforms and excessive state spending.

Malaysian PM says he won't oblige Singapore
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The war of words between Southeast
Asian neighbors Malaysia and Singapore got a bit louder Tuesday,
with Malaysia refusing to shift the location of its railroad border
post.
	   ``That's our stand and we will stick to it,'' Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad told Malaysian media in Namibia on Monday. He is
on a visit to three southern African nations.
	   Mahathir's comments came three days after a Malaysian Foreign
Ministry official reportedly said Malaysia had agreed to the Aug. 1
move.
	   But differences over arrangements at the new facilities at
Woodlands in Singapore still persist, according to Malaysian news
reports.
	   Singapore proposed moving its customs, immigration and
quarantine checkpoint from the island's Tanjong Pagar train
station, saying it would improve efficiency and help prevent drug
smuggling and entry of illegal migrants.
	   Last month, Singapore Foreign Affairs Minister S. Jayakumar told
Parliament that if Malaysia insisted on keeping its checkpoint
Tanjong Pagar, the ``sequence of clearance would not only be
illogical and contrary to international practice, but could present
other problems such as in crime investigation and prosecution.''
	   Mahathir said there must be an international agreement approved
by the Cabinet and Parliament for such a shift. No other agreement
between officials would suffice, he said.
	   Singapore says Malaysia already agreed to the shift in 1993.
Kuala Lumpur says it agreed to shift its border post to another
site on land owned by the Malaysian railroad.
	   The spat over the railroad customs and immigration checkpoint is
the latest in a series of squabbles straining relations between the
two countries.
	   Malaysia was peeved when Singapore media recently criticized
Malaysia's new international airport and when Malaysia was
reportedly left out as a tourist destination by a Singapore
conference host, an accusation Singapore denies.
	   There also is a longstanding dispute over selling Malaysian
water to the island-state.
	   Over the weekend, Malaysia hit out at Singapore's port
authorities, accusing them of using ``various tactics'' to block
cargo from entering Malaysian ports.
	   Some Malaysian shippers prefer Singapore because it is faster
and more efficient.
	   ``They use all sorts of methods, including granting rebates, to
block cargo from coming to Malaysian ports. I think this is a very
selfish attitude,'' Monday's Star newspaper quoted Malaysian
Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik as saying.
	   The troubles come a year after the neighbors settled a row over
Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew's description of the
southern Malaysian state of Johor as ``notorious for shootings,
muggings and car-jackings.''
	   In 1963, Singapore joined the Malayan federation, an experiment
that failed two years later after a falling out between Lee and the
late Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman.
	   Singapore remains Malaysia's third-largest trade partner and an
important gateway into Malaysia. More than 200,000 Malaysians cross
over to Singapore each day to work.

Thousands attend funeral for actor Farid Shawqi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Nearly 3,000 fans and mourners crowded
outside a Cairo mosque Tuesday for the funeral of Farid Shawqi, the
actor known as the ``King of the Screen.''
	   Shawqi, who underwent several heart operations, died Monday in a
Cairo hospital. He was 76.
	   On Tuesday, police closed a main street in midtown Cairo as four
men carried Shawqi's coffin, draped in Egypt's red, black and white
flag, from the mosque.
	   Onlookers, curious to see movie and television stars, crowded
the street.
	   Heavyset with angular features, Shawqi earned his reputation
playing tough guy roles. He acted in nearly 400 films since
starting his career in 1949.
	   Among his best known films are ``They Made Me a Criminal,''
directed by Atef Salem, and ``The Bully,'' by Salah Abu Seif, which

Brazil readies for telecommunications revolution with sale of
</HEADLINE>
Telebras &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL ASTOR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC;

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ For millions of Brazilians it
offers hope of a telephone after years of waiting. For operators
and investors it is a once-in-a-lifetime shot at a market of 160
million people in a country with just over 20 million phones.
	   Billed as the largest privatization in Latin America, the
Brazilian government intends to sell off a controlling stake in
state-run telecommunications giant Telebras Wednesday.
	   The gargantuan auction, expected to last at least 5 1/2 hours,
should fetch at least 13.5 billion reals (dlrs 11.7 billion) _ and
possibly much more.
	   ``We are going to promote a gigantic change in this country with
the privatization of Telebras,'' Communications Minister Luiz
Carlos Mendonca de Barros told reporters Tuesday.
	   Most Brazilians would agree the change is much needed.
	   There are currently 20 million people waiting for phones lines
they purchased for as much as 970 reals (dlrs 836) to be installed.
	   The average wait for a legally purchased line, when available,
is about two years. And this shortage of lines has created an
enormous black market with prices listed in the newspapers like
stock market quotes.
	   And in this country with the world's worst distribution of
wealth, the distribution of telephones is equally skewed: 16
percent of the richest Brazilians have 81 percent of the lines,
while 57 percent of the poorest have only 2 percent of the lines.
	   Only half of Brazil's commercial enterprises have any phones at
all.
	   To meet the demand Telebras would have to invest dlrs 10 billion
a year, significantly more than the dlrs 3.5 billion a year
currently invested.
	   To remedy the situation, the government has split Telebras into
12 separate companies _ three fixed-line companies, eight cellular
companies and a long distance carrier _ which will be auctioned off
separately Wednesday.
	   Hoping to avoid the mistakes of past privatizations, the
government has set performance goals for the new companies to meet
to insure service improves.
	   The new companies will have to create 33 million new fixed phone
lines by 2007 and these phones will have be installed within a week
of purchase by 2005.
	   To insure prices remain low, the government will also sell off
concessions creating new phone companies that will compete with the
Telebras spin-offs.
	   For everyone involved _ from the government which will receive a
large cash infusion to the companies which stand to earn billions
in this large and growing market and to the ordinary Brazilians who
will have better phone service _ the privatization is a win-win
proposition.
	   Which is not to say that the sale pleases everyone.
	   Labor unions and leftist political parties oppose the
privatization, saying the government is giving the company away
cheap and that private enterprise will only provide phones to the
rich and ignore the poor.
	   There are currently some 40 injunctions filed in courts across
the country to stop the sale, and protests are expected in the
streets outside the Rio de Janeiro stock exchange where the auction
will take place.
	   In anticipation of this, the government has deployed some 400
lawyers to undo the injunctions and 1,500 police to contain
protesters.

 &UR; Tour de France scandal grows as Bigmat found with banned drugs &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with drugs found in Bigmat team van, ADDS release of
Roussel grafs 15-16, adds details on former Festina cyclists grafs
12-14, changes dateline.

<TEXT>
	   ALBERTVILLE, France (AP) _ The drugs scandal dogging the Tour de
France deepened Tuesday when customs officers found banned drugs in
a van driven by officials of the Bigmat team.
	   The discovery came in Albertville, where the cyclists arrived
Tuesday after the 16th stage of the competition, according to
judicial sources who spoke on condition of anonymity
	   No more details were immediately available. Bigmat is now the
third team under scrutiny over allegations of drug use.
	   Festina has been thrown out of the race for the use of EPO,
while officials from the TVM team are also being investigated for
supplying the banned doping substance.
	   Two top officials of the Dutch cycling team TVM were placed
under formal investigation by French authorities Tuesday for the
use of the performance-enhancing drug EPO.
	   Sporting director Cees Priem and team doctor Andrei Mikhailov
are now likely to be formally charged.
	   TVM came under the spotlight when it emerged that EPO had been
found in the car of one of its officials in March.
	   Police then found evidence of used drugs in a suitcase and trash
can during a search of the team's hotel in Toulouse and Metz,
though the nature of the drugs is still not known.
	   Meanwhile, two former Festina cyclists, Emmanuel Magnien and
Gilles Bouvard, were released from police detention Tuesday, a day
after being held for questioning by Lille police.
	   ``There is no doubt that all the former cyclists at Festina will
be interrogated,'' said main prosecutor Gerald Vinsonneau.
	   Both cyclists raced for Festina in 1997, and ``recognized there
was doping during training,'' during interviews with police in
Lille, said the chief prosecutor for the town court, Gerald
Vinsonneau.
	   Neither of the cyclists, who now race for the Francaise des Jeux
and Casino teams respectively, is currently in the Tour.
	   Meanwhile, Bruno Roussel, Festina's sporting director, was
released from custody Tuesday. He has been held since July 17.
	   Festina physiotherapist Willy Voet was released Friday, but team
doctor Eric Ryckaert remains in custody.
	   Some Festina riders continue to deny ever taking EPO or other
illegal drugs.
	   ``Bruno Roussel never asked me if I wanted to take EPO under
medical control, and I maintain that I never took it,'' Richard
Virenque, the team's No. 1 cyclist, told investigating judge
Patrick Keil, according to Tuesday's edition of the newspaper L'Est
Republicain.
	   ``I never asked for doping products and I never needed them. I
have never taken amphetamines. I am going to follow the advice of
my lawyer and file a civil complaint,'' he said.

Jurassic period dinosaur pelvis discovered in Portugal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Archaeologists said Tuesday they have
discovered a dinosaur's pelvis weighing two tons that dates from
the Upper Jurassic Period, about 140 million years ago, at a dig
north of Lisbon.
	   The bone was found near Lourinha, about 75 kilometers (47 miles)
north of the capital, and is part of a sauropod _ a 20-ton,
four-legged herbivorous dinosaur, archaeologist Isabel Mateus said
in a telephone interview.
	   Previously, parts of two other sauropods have been found in the
Lourinha area where last year archaeologists unearthed a nest of
Jurassic dinosaur eggs containing fossilized embryos.
	   Mateus, who is working at the dig, estimated the sauropod would
have stood 20 meters (66 feet) tall.
	   Miguel Telles Antunes, a professor of archaeology at Lisbon's
New University, classified the pelvis as ``a very important
artifact'' which broadened knowledge about the Jurassic period.
	   Telles Antunes told Lisbon radio TSF the find was particularly
important because it shed new light on the posture of dinosaurs.
	   The central region of Portugal is rich in evidence of dinosaurs.
Parts of skeletons and dinosaur tracks have been found in the area
in recent years.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police Tuesday captured a major
stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for the
independence of Serbia's Kosovo province, the Serbian Media Center
reported.
	   The center reported that government troops seized Malisevo,
located some 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of Pristina, at 5
p.m. (1500 GMT).
	   It said armed ethnic Albanians dispersed, and there were no
civilian casualties. There was no word of casualties among fighters
on both sides, and the report could not be independently confirmed.
	   Earlier in the day, the Yugoslav government's Tanjug news agency
said that the KLA launched a strong attack late Monday near Kijevo,
just south of the highway linking this provincial capital with Pec,
80 kilometers (50 miles) to the west.

Palestinian security chief, in shift, takes tough anti-Hamas line
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ Signaling what could be new
willingness by the Palestinian leadership to crack down on Hamas,
Yasser Arafat's chief enforcer took a confrontational tone Tuesday
in remarks about the Islamic militant group.
	   During a question-and-answer session with foreign news
organizations, Jibril Rajoub, head of Palestinian preventive
security in the West Bank, sharply criticized neighboring Jordan
for allowing Hamas to use it as a staging ground.
	   In the session near his headquarters in the West Bank town of
Jericho, Rajoub also insisted that the death of Hamas' chief
bombmaker four months ago was the result of an internal feud _
something Hamas has bitterly denied _ and declared that one of the
militant group's top political leaders should be given as long
prison term to set an example.
	   Hamas, which bitterly opposes the Oslo peace accords and has
staged suicide attacks that have killed scores of Israelis, has
long presented a thorny problem for Arafat.
	   As a rule, the Palestinian leader avoids direct confrontations
with Hamas, but relations between his government and the Islamic
group have deteriorated in recent months.
	   The remarks of Rajoub, which almost certainly indicate the
thinking of Arafat and his inner circle, reflected those growing
tensions. The comments also come at a delicate moment in efforts to
restart the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
	   During the 16-month impasse, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has incessantly criticized Arafat's Palestinian Authority
for failing to take sufficient steps to fight terrorism.
	   Rajoub stopped short of deferring to the Israeli leader on that
point, but did take sharp aim at Hamas' spiritual leader, Sheik
Ahmed Yassin, who returned to the Gaza Strip 10 months ago after
being freed from Israeli prison.
	   During a three-month fundraising tour of Arab states that ended
last month, Yassin repeatedly criticized Arafat's policies and
advocated a return to the armed Palestinian struggle.
	   Rajoub dismissed Yassin's activities, saying the sheik had
``failed in reorganizing Hamas.'' But he coupled that with the most
explicit worded warning yet from a top Palestinian official that
the sheik would not be allowed to become too powerful.
	   ``I didn't take part in the national struggle for 18 years ...
to see Sheik Ahmed Yassin leading the Palestinian people,'' Rajoub
said, adding: ``I don't think Palestinians want to live in an
Islamic state.''
	   The Palestinian security chief also took issue with what he said
was Jordan's acquiescence to being used as a prime Hamas base.
	   ``The Jordanians adopted the Hamas leadership and provide the
facilities,'' he said. ``All (Hamas') financial support is in
Jordan _ the orders come from there.''
	   Asked why Hamas had desisted in suicide attacks for nearly a
year, Rajoub said it was only because of the continued deadlock in
negotiations with Israel.
	   ``When there is no progress, there are no attacks,'' he said.
	   In the session with reporters, the Palestinian security chief
also said jailed Hamas political leader Abdel Aziz Rantisi deserved
to spend 15 or 20 years behind bars.
	   Rantisi was arrested in April and charged with endangering
national security. Last month, the Palestinian Supreme Court
ordered him released for lack of evidence, but he remains in
prison, with new charges being prepared against him.
	   Rajoub also reiterated that the death of chief Hamas bombmaker
Mohiyadine Sharif _ whose mangled body was found March 29 at the
scene of a massive car-bomb blast in the West Bank town of Ramallah
_ was the result of an internal Hamas feud. Hamas has angrily
denied that and blamed Israel for the killing.
	   Soon after the slaying, Palestinian police jailed Imad
Awadallah, a close associate of the slain member of the Hamas
military wing. Rajoub said Awadallah had confessed and would be
tried.

Statue near Buchenwald camp vandalized

 &UR; Eds: ADDS description of statue, background on Cremer. New to some
points. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WEIMAR, Germany (AP) _ Vandals sawed into a group of 3.5-meter
(11.5-foot) bronze statues of liberated prisoners of the former
Buchenwald concentration camp in eastern Germany, the museum said
Tuesday.
	   Marks from a saw and other tools were found on the statue of a
child, which is among the 11 figures depicted in the 1958 Fritz
Cremer work near the former camp, spokeswoman Ursula Hertel said.
The figure's right leg was sawn about two-thirds of the way
through, Hertel said.
	   There were no immediate suspects in the vandalism.
	   Emil Carlebach, vice president of the international committee of
Buchenwald survivors, said his group demanded that everything be
done to find and punish those responsible.
	   From 1937 to 1945, Nazis interned about 263,000 people from more
than 30 countries at Buchenwald, including communists and others
who resisted Nazi rule, Jews and Gypsies. Some 56,000 people died
there, including at least 11,000 Jews.
	   Cremer's statue depicts just-liberated prisoners in various
poses. In front, a man falls to his right knee with his arms
outstretched and hands in fists. The figure of the child is at the
edge of the group.
	   Cremer, whose work was influenced by French sculpture Auguste
Rodin, was considered one of Germany's most important creators of
sculpture commemorating victims of the Nazi era.
	   He died in 1993 at age 85.

Serbs take control of major Kosovo Liberation Army stronghold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Serbs claiming they took Malisevo. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos PRI104-106 &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police on Tuesday captured a
major stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting
for the independence of Serbia's Kosovo province, the Serbian Media
Center reported.
	   The center reported that government troops seized Malisevo, 40
kilometers (25 miles) southwest of Pristina, at 5 p.m. (1500 GMT).
	   It said armed ethnic Albanians dispersed, and there were no
civilian casualties. There was no word of casualties among fighters
on both sides, and the report could not be independently confirmed.
	   Earlier Tuesday, the Yugoslav government's Tanjug news agency
said that the KLA launched a strong attack late Monday near Kijevo,
just south of the highway linking Pristina, the provincial capital,
with Pec, 80 kilometers (50 miles) to the west.
	   Fighting along the strategic highway, which bisects the heart of
KLA-controlled territory, prompted an estimated 20,000 Albanian
civilians to join the tens of thousands of others who have left
their homes since President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown
on Albanian separatists in February.
	   Albanian families, some on foot and others crowded on flatbed
carts pulled by small tractors, could be seen Monday lining the
road, heading for KLA strongholds deeper into the rugged mountains.
	   The rebels are fighting for the independence of Kosovo, whose
population of 2 million people is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
Kosovo is located in southern Serbia, the dominant of two republics
that make up what remains of Yugoslavia.
	   On Monday, police regained control of the Pristina-Pec road from
KLA fighters, who erected barricades in early May. But on Tuesday,
police were turning back reporters driving along the road,
indicating the route was not fully secure.
	   Elsewhere, Serb police and Yugoslav troops sealed off the rebel
stronghold of Junik, 80 kilometers (50 miles) to the southwest
along the Albanian border.
	   Loudspeakers mounted on government camouflaged armored vehicles
prowled the hills above the village late Monday, demanding
``surrender, surrender.'' But the Albanians refused.
	   Serbian police estimate that there are about 2,000 people
trapped in Junik, including about 1,000 are ``highly trained'' KLA
troops. The rest are local residents and refugees who fled recent
fighting elsewhere.
	   Reporters who reached Junik late Monday saw eight bodies lying
near a small stream. Police said they were shot earlier Monday
trying to flee into Albania from Kosovo.
	   In Geneva, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimated
there are about 100,000 refugees in Kosovo. Another 25,000 have
fled to Montenegro and 13,000 to Albania.
	   ``Unless it all ends, we're going to end up with a huge mess on
our hands and a major humanitarian disaster come winter,'' UNHCR
spokesman, Kris Janowski, said.
	   According to the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center, at
least five KLA members were killed in the Serb offensive launched
Friday. The Yugoslav Army said in a statement that three of its
soldiers had been killed and five injured since Saturday.
	   Albanian analysts believe Milosevic wanted to deliver a blow to
the rebels before agreeing to future talks with moderate Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova on the fate of the province.
	   While the rebels admitted they suffered losses, they showed no
signs of giving in.
	   ``It's true that we have had losses during the clashes,'' Jakup
Krasniqi, a KLA spokesman told Albanian television late Monday.
``But the enemy has also had many losses _ both in people and
materials _ though they try to minimize them.
	   ``The KLA will come out of this Serb offensive stronger than
before,'' he said.
	   So far, the rebel organization has refused to endorse Rugova's
leadership because he opposes violence to gain independence for
Kosovo.
	   As fighting escalated, special U.S. envoy Christopher Hill
returned Monday to Pristina to continue efforts to cobble together
an Albanian delegation for talks with Milosevic.
	   Milosevic has offered to restore Kosovo's autonomy, which he
abolished in 1989, but he opposes independence for the province.
	   The Americans and Europeans also oppose independence, fearing it
will lead to greater demands by the ethnic Albanians to unite with
Albanian communities in other Balkan countries, thereby
destabilizing the entire region.

More controversy for 400m star over England suspension
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Controversially chosen for Britain's European
Championship team instead of Roger Black, 400-meter star Solomon
Wariso has to overturn a lifetime ban if he is to run for England
at the Commonwealth Games.
	   Wariso served a three-month ban four years ago after testing
positive for the stimulant pseudoephedrine and is clear to compete
either individually or for Britain.
	   But the rules of the Commonwealth Games Council for England
state that any athlete found guilty of a doping violation cannot
compete again for his country.
	   That rules Wariso out of the Sept. 11-21 Commonwealth Games in
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, unless he gets the ban lifted at an appeals
tribunal next week.
	   Wariso's latest problem comes only two days after he was chosen
for Britain's European Championship lineup in preference to Olympic
silver medalist and two-time European titlist Black.
	   Wariso overtook Black in the final stages of Sunday's 400-meter
race at the British trials to take third place behind Iwan Thomas
and Mark Richardson who qualify automatically.
	   Black is considering retirement at age 32 even though he has
been offered captaincy of the team and a place on the 1,600 meter
relay squad.

U.S. favors Caspian route to export Turkmen gas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASHGABAT, Turkmenistan (AP) _ A pipeline across the Caspian Sea
would be the most reliable way to export Turkmenistan's natural gas
to Turkey and the rest of Europe, a U.S. ambassador said Tuesday.
	   Richard Morningstar, an adviser to President Bill Clinton on the
former Soviet republics, spoke to reporters after meeting Turkmen
President Saparmurad Niyazov.
	   ``Turkmenistan must survive today,'' Niyazov said. ``That is why
we are ready to consider the possibilities of Turkmen gas exports.
But we prefer the route that will be developed faster.''
	   Morningstar and a Turkish envoy were in Turkmenistan, a former
Soviet republic in Central Asia, to try to persuade Niyazov to
speed up a decision on a pipeline.
	   Both countries have been campaigning for an oil pipeline running
from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, through Georgia to the Turkish
Mediterranean port of Ceyhan, as well as a pipeline to carry
Turkmen natural gas across the Caspian Sea to Turkey.
	   The United States favors pipeline routes to Turkey because of
its strong opposition to any plans to transport Caspian Sea oil and
gas to markets through Iran, a country that Washington considers
unreliable. However, it is the shortest and cheapest route.
	   The other possible route, through Afghanistan to the Arabian
Sea, is consider a longshot because of continued fighting in
Afghanistan and the insolvency of both Turkmenistan and Pakistan,
where the pipeline would end.
	   From Ashgabat, Morningstar is scheduled to fly to Baku,
Azerbaijan, and Tbilisi, Georgia, to discuss the pipeline route.
	   The five states bordering on the Caspian are due to meet in
Moscow on Sept. 1, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov
said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian university denied Tuesday that it had
helped Iran acquire nuclear weapons technology, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said.
	   The Baltic State University in St. Petersburg is one of nine
Russian companies or research institutions facing U.S. penalties
because the State Department says they sold technology to Iran,
Libya or North Korea that could be used for weapons of mass
destruction.
	   A Russian government commission also accused the nine agencies
of attempting to smuggle sensitive weapons technology out of the
country.
	   The penalties will include a ban on all export and import
activity between U.S. companies and the accused firms.
	   Baltic State University was accused of training Iranian
students, but rector Yuri Savelyev said Tuesday `` not one Iranian
student or trainee ever studied in this area.''
	   Savelyev said an agreement to train 25 Iranian scientists ended
two years ago, and all they were taught was Russian language,
physics, math, physical sciences and general engineering.
	   Russia has been accused by the United States and Israel in
particular of helping Iran develop its nuclear weapons program, by
training students, building a nuclear power plant in southern Iran
and providing missile technology.
	   Russia denies the missile allegations and says the nuclear plant
is for purely civilian uses. Regardless, the government has moved
recently to tighten control over the export of weapons and weapons
technology.
	   On Tuesday, the Defense Ministry said it would coordinate its
efforts with regional law enforcement agencies and the Federal
Security Service, the main successor to the KGB, to halt illegal
exports.
	   Still, the ministry reiterated that it would continue selling
sanctioned technology abroad, particularly conventional arms, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   The Defense Ministry's announcement followed a decree signed by
President Boris Yeltsin on Saturday that tightened government
control over weapons exports by specifying which Russian weapons
can be sold to what countries.

Mexican activist accused of killing party colleague
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A Mexican opposition-party activist reported
as kidnapped has turned up in prison, accused of killing a
colleague he accused of embezzling money, newspapers reported
Tuesday.
	   Leaders of the Democratic Revolution Party had reported Alfredo
Barragan kidnapped after mysterious armed men without badges beat
and seized him at a political rally Saturday in Chilpancingo,
capital of the Pacific state Guerrero.
	   Guerrero state judicial police repeatedly denied holding
Barragan or knowing where he was, the Reforma newspaper reported.
	   But on Monday, that same agency turned him over to a prison in
Chilpancingo, and announced he had confessed to the June 5 murder
of Raul Valente Catalan, a Democratic Revolution Party leader in
the town of Chichihualco, 15 miles (25 kilometers) to the
northwest.
	   Barragan is a leader of a rural political pressure group allied
with the Democratic Revolution Party, one of Mexico's three major
parties.
	   The leftist party claims that scores of its activists have been
killed, kidnapped or harassed in Guerrero, where the rugged
mountains inland from Acapulco are rife with drug traffic, violent
land disputes and guerrilla bands.
	   Government officials claim most of the cases involve local
squabbles rather than politics and deny any vendetta against the
party.
	   The newspaper Reforma quoted state officials as saying Barragan
confessed to killing Catalan because ``for a long time he had been
robbing money the government had sent us.''
	   However Barragan had not yet appeared before a judge to ratify
statements given to police, which were taken without his lawyer
present.
	   His attorney, Jose Maria Gomezcana, called ``very strange''
police denials that Barragan was in custody, Reforma reported.

	   ALBERTVILLE, France (AP) _ A third team was caught up in the
drugs scandal dogging the Tour France, after police on Tuesday
seized suspect medication in a van driven by officials of the
Bigmat team.
	   The discovery came in Chambery, on the Franco-Swiss border near
Albertville, where the cyclists arrived Tuesday after the 16th
stage of the competition.
	   Around 100 doses of medication were found in briefcases among
the team's bags during a routine inspection by customs officials,
police said.
	   The drugs were sent to a police laboratory in the city of Lyon
for analysis, police said.
	   France Info radio, citing unidentified judicial sources,
reported that the medication was a banned substance.
	   Bigmat is now the third team under scrutiny over allegations of
drug use.

Flooding expected to worsen but people show resilience

	   SURADIA, Bangladesh (AP) _ A poisonous snake slithered by in the
flood waters as Shahida Khatoon shivered on the tin roof of her
submerged hut, breast-feeding her baby of two months.
	   Nearly a third of the 5,000 people in Khatoon's Suradia village,
32 kilometers (20 miles) south of the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka,
had fled the submerged village to a relief camp.
	   Khatoon hoped it would soon be the turn of the flood waters to
go away. She stayed back with the rest.
	   But hopes are receding as torrential rains continue to lash
Bangladesh, where the worst flooding in 10 years has claimed at
least 208 lives and marooned another 10 million since July 10.
	   The overflowing rivers in the basins of the country's major
rivers _ the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna _ have inundated 36 of
the 64 districts.
	   Worse flooding may follow in another week after a fresh downpour
in the Himalayas, origin of many rivers flowing into Bangladesh
toward the Bay of Bengal, said Abdul Chowdhury, an expert at
Dhaka's Space Research and Remote Sensing Center that receives
satellite weather maps.
	   Khatoon's family of four has enough rice for two more weeks.
They don't have enough dry wood to cook food, and no drinking
water.
	   Across the country, waterborne diseases like dysentery and
diarrhea have afflicted nearly 8,000 people and claimed 14 lives,
according to the government. The number could be higher as many
cases go unreported to the officials.
	   Authorities said more than 18,000 health workers had fanned
across the flood-hit areas carrying water-purification tablets,
medicines and dry food to prevent an epidemic.
	   But health workers are yet to reach Suradia.
	   ``My two-year-old son died of diarrhea four days ago. There was
no doctor, nor any medicine,'' Amjad Hossain, a farmer whose family
is also perched on a wooden platform, said Tuesday. Yet Hossain is
reluctant to leave his makeshift home, saying life in a relief camp
on an embankment could be much worse.
	   Though floods occur ever year in Bangladesh, this year's deluge
has brought back memories of 1988, when raging waters engulfed
two-thirds of the land, including most parts of the capital city.
More than 1,400 people died that year.
	   Weather experts blame this year's severe floods on the erratic
rainfall during the monsoon months of June and July.
	   ``There was too little rain in June, while too much rain is
falling in the month of July, causing the rivers to overflow,''
Sajedur Rahman, the top official at Meteorological Department in
Dhaka, said in a telephone interview Tuesday.
	   Dhaka, the capital city of nine million located in central
Bangladesh, is bracing for floods as some of its surrounding
low-lying areas are submerged under chest-high water. Many
residents have evacuated to safer areas.
	   ``In 1988 we had witnessed most streets of the capital city go
under water,'' said Mohsin Ahmed, a businessman at Kamrangir Char,
a residential district on the southern outskirts of the city.
	   ``I'm afraid the disaster will repeat this year,'' he said.

Debate rages over Barnes, Mitchell suspensions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS spelling of Reneiri in sixth graf &QL; 
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ America's governing body for athletics is
incensed over the doping suspensions of shot putter Randy Barnes
and sprinter Dennis Mitchell by the IAAF.
	   ``USATF (USA Track and Field) is concerned and dismayed that the
IAAF chose to temporarily suspend two American athletes on the
basis of unproven allegations that they have committed a doping
offense,'' Craig Masback, executive director of organiztion, said
Monday night. ``USATF objects to the IAAF suspensions and will not
enforce them.
	   ``U.S. athletes are entitled to a full and fair hearing prior to
being declared ineligible to compete. USATF has on several
occasions informed the IAAF of its obligations under the (U.S.)
Amateur Sports Act. Therefore, we are outraged that the IAAF
knowingly breached our confidentiality rules, which were put in
place to protect those ultimately determined to be innocent.''
	   The U.S. Amateur Sports Act is a 20-year-old federal law that
governs ``amateur'' sports in the United States. The International
Amateur Athletic Federation disclosed the indefinite suspensions
Monday.
	   Masback said that Barnes and Mitchell would ``receive the full
support of USATF until such time as it is determined that they have
committed a doping offense.''
	   IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reneiri said Tuesday he could not comment
specifically on Masback's remarks. But he said IAAF rules could not
be adjusted for different national federations.
	   ``We know what the problems and laws are in the U.S.,'' Reineri
said. ``But we are the governing body for athletics for all
countries in the world, and we have to apply the rules for
everybody.''
	   He said it was now up to the U.S. federation to act on the
Barnes and Mitchell cases.
	   Barnes, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist and the world indoor and
outdoor record-holder, and Mitchell, the 1992 Olympic bronze
medalist in the 100 meters, were cited by the IAAF for failing
out-of-competition doping tests April 1.
	   Barnes, who could face a life suspension for a second offense,
was tested in Charleston, West Virginia, and Mitchell in
Gainesville, Florida.
	   Mitchell is president of USATF's Athletes Advisory Committee,
the athletes' voice in the national governing body, which has taken
a strong stance against doping.
	   His suspension was handed down last week and represents his
first doping offense.
	   The IAAF did not officially announce the suspensions, and the
precise terms of the punishment have yet to be determined.
	   These are two of the most prominent suspensions in athletics
following Ben Johnson at the 1988 Olympics, Butch Reynolds in 1990
and Mary Slaney in 1997.
	   Johnson was banned for life after two suspensions, but has
requested reinstatement. Reynolds served a 27-month suspension and
now is competing. Slaney was found innocent after several months
and also is running again.
	   The suspensions come at a time when IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch has suggested some performance-enhancing drugs be
stricken from the list of banned substances.
	   They also come as athletics in the United States is seeking to
regain its prestige and reputation but has had difficulty
attracting sponsors and television coverage.
	   To test an athlete for doping, the IAAF divides a urine sample
from the competitor into two. If the first sample is positive, the
second sample is tested to confirm the original result.
	   Reneiri said from Monaco that only the A sample from Barnes and
Mitchell have been tested. However, that is sufficient to levy a
suspension.
	   If the B samples are positive, the IAAF then rules on the
severity of the punishment pending a hearing by USATF. If the B
sample is negative, the athletes are cleared.
	   Barnes was first suspended for two years starting in 1991 for
the steroid methyltestosterone at a meet in Malmo, Sweden, in 1990.
This time, the substance is androstenedione, a banned nutritional
supplement.
	   Mitchell tested positive for excessive testosterone. If found
guilty following the B sample, he probably would receive a two-year
ban.
	   Reneiri did not know the testosterone level in Mitchell's
sample. The allowable ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone
(another natural substance) is 6:1. Anything above that level is
considered suspicious.
	   Mitchell's suspension was handed down last week, after he
finished fifth in the Goodwill Games 100 and ran on the winning
U.S. 400-meter relay team. If Mitchell is banned, he and the relay
team of Jon Drummond, Tim Harden and Maurice Greene would be
disqualified and forced to refund all prize money from the meet.
	   Mitchell was entered in the U.S. Open at Edwardsville, Illinois,
last Saturday night, but the IAAF would not allow him to compete.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) - Four men convicted in the stoning
and fatal stabbing of American student Amy Biehl won amnesties and
walked free from jail on Tuesday.
	   The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which is probing human
rights abuses committed in the fight against white rule, declared
that the crime was political and that the four men had told the
full truth -- the two criteria needed for amnesties.
	   The brutal killing of the 26-year-old student at the hands of a
mob five years ago drew international attention to South Africa's
racial violence.
	   Friends and relatives went to three separate prisons in the Cape
Town area to greet Vusumzi Ntamo, Ntobeko Peni, Mzikhona Nofemela
and Mongezi Manqina.
	   The four were 18 to 22 years old when they stoned and stabbed
Biehl to death in the Guguletu black township outside Cape Town.
They were among a crowd of blacks who attacked her car and then
chased her down the street.
	   Walking out of Brandvlei prison, in Worcester, 135 kilometers
(85 miles) northeast of Cape Town, Manqina said he was happy to be
released. His mother and other relatives hugged and kissed him.
	   ``We can't believe that he is out,'' said his mother, Evelyn
Manqina. ``As a mother I am very happy, but on the other side I am
not happy. I feel the pain of Mrs. Biehl. I am not glad because of
what my child has done.''
	   Biehl's parents, Peter and Linda Biehl had attended the amnesty
hearing and publicly forgave their daughter's killers after they
apologized for the slaying.
	   In a statement from their home in Newport Beach, California, the
Biehls said they supported the amnesty decision.
	   ``We hope they will receive the support necessary to live
productive lives in a non-violent atmosphere. In fact, we hope the
spirits of Amy and of those like her will be a force in their new
lives,'' the family said.
	   Biehl, a Fulbright scholar, was in South Africa to help with
voter registration for the nation's first all-race election in 1994
that ended apartheid.
	   The four killers, convicted and sentenced to 18 years in prison
for the murder, testified at their amnesty hearing that they
believed their political leaders wanted them to attack whites _
also called ``settlers'' by black militants _ to highlight the
grievances of blacks.
	   They cited the ``one settler, one bullet'' slogan of the Pan
Africanist Congress, a radical black group.
	   In their statement, Biehls' parents urged South Africans to
accept the decisions of the amnesty commission and to work to step
up the pace of reconciliation.
	   ``We must never forget people who lost their lives in the
struggle,'' the Biehls said. ``We must honor them in discovering
new approaches _ non-violent partnerships - to create the South
African which Nelson Mandela, Amy and those who perished dreamed of
- a new, multi-racial, democratic nation.''

	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ The body of a slain Jesuit
priest was discovered Tuesday in a puddle of blood and with a
bullet through his head, a police spokesman said.
	   Roman Catholic Rev. Michel Halbecq was shot to death sometime
during the night at the dormitory of the St. Ignace Jesuit mission
in the capital of Brazzaville, the police spokesman said on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Halbecq's naked body was discovered just after midnight. His
remains will be sent to Paris via neighboring Cameroon, the
spokesman said.
	   French diplomats are assisting in an investigation into the
killing of Halbecq, who was from France.
	   Nothing was stolen from Halbecq, said Zola Bouebassihou, a
novice Jesuit who is studying at St. Ignace.

British aid worker imprisoned by Serbs on hunger strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIPLJANE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A British aid worker imprisoned near
the Kosovo capital Pristina briefly fell unconscious Monday after
five days of hunger strike, the British Embassy in Belgrade said
Tuesday.
	   The British consul in Belgrade, Bob Corton, confirmed that a
member of the embassy staff had visited Sally Becker.
	   ``At one point during the interview, she fainted but quickly
regained consciousness. She did not object to having an intravenous
fluid attached,'' said the consul.
	   Ms. Becker was remarkably well considering that she had been
without food and drink for five days, Corton said. She was oriented
and alert and determined to continue with the hunger strike.
	   Ms. Becker, known as the angel of Mostar for her humanitarian
efforts in that Bosnian city during the 3 1/2 war, was detained on
July 16 and charged with illegally crossing the Albanian-Yugoslav
border while attempting to assist Kosovo refugees. She heads a
small humanitarian organization called Operation Angel.
	   The British aid worker was sentenced to 30 days in prison and is
being held in a prison cell in Lipljane, 20 kilometers (12 miles)
south of Kosovo.
	   On July 23, she announced that she had stopped eating and
drinking to protest the violence in Serbian Kosovo province, where
the underground Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting Serbian forces
for independence from Serbia.
	   ``Her lawyer has registered an appeal, hoping for a reduced
sentence,'' consul Corton said.
	   So far, there has been no sign from Serbian authorities whether
the sentence will actually be reduced. A decision was expected by
Wednesday.

	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Police in this normally peaceful
capital faced a rare gangland-style slaying Tuesday as they tried
to find who gunned down four men in a tea room.
	   The cardboard-patched window by the entrance of the Safari was
the first sign of the shooting, which took place late Monday
evening, hours before the redecorated tea room was to open for
business under new management.
	   Unaware of what had happened, a blond woman carrying a waitress
uniform stood smoking nervously Tuesday morning, waiting for
someone to open the door for her first day on the job.
	   ``I have a bad feeling,'' she said. ``I can't figure out what's
wrong.''
	   She was unaware that hours before police had found the bodies of
four men on the floor at the back of the tea room, where they had
been mown down by three or four other men.
	   Bloody footprints in the rear staircase and another shattered
window indicated how the attackers may have escaped.
	   ``I can't remember any crime like this,'' said Hans Gerber,
spokesman of the city police. Up to 40 officers have been assigned
to investigate the slaying in the diplomatic quarter.
	   Police refused to comment on speculation that the attack was a
feud among Turks, possibly related to debts. The new manager of the
tea room is a Turkish woman, whose whereabouts was unknown Tuesday.
	   Police said the victims were one 46-year-old Swiss man and three
Turkish nationals aged 37, 39 and 41. Police didn't release any
names.
	   The previous experience of city police with shootings has
generally involved lone, revenge-seeking gunmen.
	   Gerber said the only time he could find in city records when
four people had been shot to death was in 1993, when a 53-year-old
Swiss man killed his brother, the brother's wife and an employee in
a bakery and then turned the gun on himself.
	   Bern, with a population of about 130,000 people, is
Switzerland's fourth largest and perhaps quietest major town.
	   Police began investigating before midnight Monday after they
were alerted by neighbors who heard breaking glass.
	   Juerg Blaser, spokesman for the federal prosecutor, said there
appeared to be no connection between the slayings and three
diplomatic missions that share the building, a 10-minute walk from
the main railroad station in the city center.
	   The Italian consulate and the Ghana and Jordan embassies are
among other tenants.
	   Rolf Bellwald, a friend of the new manager, said, ``It seems
there were money problems. Her Turkish partner had debts and some
men came to her apartment to threaten her if they weren't paid.''
	   The tea room had been closed for two months because of the
change of ownership.
	   A number of people have been questioned, but no one has been
charged, police said.

Iraqi general: Iraq was prepared for U.S. Gulf War nuclear attack
</HEADLINE>

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Baghdad had feared that Israel or the
United States might use weapons of mass destruction during the 1991
Gulf War and had prepared to retaliate with chemical and biological
arms, an Iraqi officer said in a new book.
	   Lt. Gen. Hazem Abdulrazzaq al-Ayoubi, the commander of Iraq's
missile forces, said that President Saddam Hussein told him 10 days
before the Gulf War began that ``missiles carrying special warheads
should be made ready for launching once an order is given to that
effect.''
	   The retaliatory attack would have targeted U.S.-allied forces in
the Gulf or Israel.
	   The information, made public for the first time in Iraq, was
from a new book by al-Ayoubi. He is the first Iraqi Gulf War
general to print his memoirs.
	   A review of the book, which is expected out shortly, was
published Tuesday in the government weekly, al-Ittihad. The
magazine did not say when the book would be released.
	   The magazine said that Saddam heavily edited the book before it
went to press.
	   Al-Ayoubi says he received a written message from Saddam on Jan.
17, 1991, the day the allies began their massive air attacks
against Iraq that ``included an order to the missile forces to
strike Israel with the heaviest fire possible.''
	   Al-Ayoubi's book, al-Ittihad says, contains a copy of the
hand-written letter by Saddam in which he cautions his general
against using any of the chemical or biological warheads at his
disposal.
	   But another order detailing the use of chemical and biological
weapons told the general to retaliate if weapons of mass
destruction were used against Iraq.
	   The United States and its allies heavily bombarded Iraq during
the war, but never used unconventional weapons.
	   Iraq fired 39 missiles at Israel during the war. All carried
conventional warheads.
	   Al-Ayoubi said despite the allies' air and missile superiority,
they failed to destroy any of Iraq's missile launchers during the
war. He said Iraq changed launching site minutes after each missile
was fired.

Two nations set up working groups as `initiative' becomes `project'

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting with Chirac; TRIMS

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France and Egypt are setting up working groups to
advance their proposal for an international conference to break the
impasse in the Middle East peace process, their foreign ministers
announced Tuesday.
	   Hubert Vedrine of France and Amr Moussa of Egypt said the
proposal has moved from the stage of an ``initiative'' to that of a
``project.'' But both stressed it is not meant to undermine
American mediation efforts.
	   ``This is not a sports competition,'' Vedrine told reporters
after a midday meeting with Moussa.
	   The Egyptian minister on Tuesday evening gave President Jacques
Chirac what he said was a message from President Hosni Mubarak on
``the peace process and the Franco-Egyptian initiative.''
	   He told reporters the 40-minute meeting with Chirac was ``very
positive,'' but declined to elaborate. Moussa and Vedrine reported
to Chirac their efforts aimed at breaking ``a dangerous deadlock,''
said Chirac spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
	   Vedrine described the project, proposed in May during a visit by
Mubarak, as a contingency plan should U.S. efforts fail.
	   ``We are obliged to envisage the hypothesis whereby we must
prolong (the effort) in another form,'' Vedrine said. ``We're not
there today, but we have to think of it ....
	   ``If the American efforts succeed ... there will be no reason to
take other initiatives,'' Vedrine said.
	   But planning was moving forward.
	   The two officials said consultations are planned in the coming
days with the United States and other nations.
	   Neither Vedrine nor Moussa would indicate a projected date for
such a conference.
	   Moussa was completing the second day of his visit to Paris
before heading to Casablanca, Morocco, for a meeting of the Al Qods
(Jerusalem) Committee of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference, set for Wednesday and Thursday.
	   Vedrine said the working groups, which are to be in ``constant
contact,'' represent a new ``more concrete'' phase in the planning
for a conference.
	   Israeli-Palestinian negotiations have failed to advance since
the Israeli government began building Jewish housing on the
traditionally Arab side of Jerusalem in March 1997.
	   Arab nations have pressed for a more active European role in the
peace process, and France has led the way.
	   In an interview published Tuesday in the French newspaper Le
Monde, Moussa said the entire peace process would have to be
reviewed ``if Israel's attitude remains unchanged ... because this
policy will lead to catastrophe.''
	   The conference as described by officials in May would take place
in two steps, starting with a larger conference then a smaller one
including nations like Israel directly concerned with the peace
process.

BMW buys Rolls-Royce brand name, leaving VW to produce Bentleys

	   LONDON (AP) _ So much for tradition at Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.
	   Barely three weeks after Germany's Volkswagen AG bought the
company, VW and rival BMW signed a deal Tuesday to chop the luxury
carmaker in two and move production of Rolls-Royces out of the
factory in Crewe to somewhere else in England where BMW plans a
``new'' Rolls-Royce.
	   ``It's a very disappointing day,'' said Michael Shrimpton, a
lawyer who led a patriotic but futile attempt to keep Rolls-Royce
British. ``It shows we were right.''
	   Analysts say VW paid too much _ 479 million pounds (dlrs 790
million) _ when it acquired Rolls-Royce Motor Cars from the
conglomerate Vickers PLC in a deal that left out one crucial
feature: the brand name.
	   The British jet engine maker Rolls-Royce PLC controlled the
trademark and made it clear it favored a deal with BMW, its partner
in a seperate aerospace venture.
	   Facing a potentially vicious fight in courts, the three sides
instead worked out a compromise _ which executives said was signed
early Tuesday on a German golf course.
	   Rolls-Royce PLC sold the brand name to BMW for 40 million pounds
(dlrs 66 million), and BMW agreed to let VW use the name for free
until Dec. 31, 2002. BMW also withdrew its threat to cut off
supplying engines for Rolls-Royce and Bentley models.
	   On Jan. 1, 2003, BMW will launch its new Rolls-Royce Motor Cars,
while VW will rename the old company Bentley Motor Cars.
	   Analysts say VW paid too much for what it's getting, and that
the uncertainties created by the German feuding could end up
hurting both the Rolls-Royce and Bentley names.
	   ``They've damaged the brand that they're buying _ killed the
goose that laid the golden eggs,'' said Lydia Aydon, news editor of
London's weekly Auto Express. ``As a customer, would you want to
buy a Rolls-Royce now?''
	   Many Englishmen were outraged by the very thought that
Rolls-Royce could go German. The deal to separate Bentley from
Rolls-Royce will undo a partnership that dates to 1931 and has for
decades epitomized hand-made British luxury.
	   Questions about the future of the Rolls-Royce brand had already
caused problems. Orders for Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars have
dropped by about 30 percent in the last six weeks, said Graham
Morris, chairman of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, who added he now hopes
for a rebound.
	   VW thought it was in the driver's seat early this month, when it
closed the purchase of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, but private talks
about the use of the brand name soon began.
	   After the ownership of the Rolls-Royce brand was finally
resolved, BMW chairman Bernd Pischetsreider lashed out at the
``distasteful'' way Vickers sold the car company without securing a
deal for the name.
	   ``One doesn't sell the famous brand names like fake Persian
carpets made in India,'' Pischetsrieder told reporters.
	   The VW chairman, Ferdinand Piech, disputed suggestions he had
been defeated, insisting VW paid a fair price. The accord was a
better solution than a drawn-out legal fight, and Volkswagen will
end up with Bentley, an excellent top-of-the-line range that
accounts for about 70 percent of the autos sold by Rolls-Royce,
Piech told a news conference
	   ``I would have preferred to keep both brands, but the way _ how
it developed today _ I am very satisfied,'' Piech said.
	   Investors figured BMW got the best deal. BMW shares rose 2.2
percent to close at 1,745 marks (dlrs 980.23) in Frankfurt, while
VW fell 2.1 percent to close at 166 marks (dlrs 93.25).
	   Tuesday's truce ``has to be seen in part as a humiliation for
Volkswagen, but also a pragmatic development,'' said Nick Snee, a
stock analyst who follows auto companies for J.P. Morgan Securities
in London.
	   After BMW starts making Rolls-Royces and VW concentrates on
making Bentleys, the German companies will cooperate on producing
Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph models in Crewe.

As violence worsens, UN chief sends top UN envoy to Angola
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with trip expected to last about 5 days, Brahimi in
Paris, Beye replacement expected to be announced but Annan wanted
someone to go right away. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With an upsurge of violence threatening
Angola's U.N.-brokered peace accord, the U.N. chief is sending a
top official, Lakhdar Brahimi of Algeria, on an emergency mission
this weekend to the west African nation.
	   Brahimi will urge the government, and in particular the former
rebel movement UNITA ``to desist from any action which could
undermine the peace process and to resume negotiations without
delay in order to fully and expeditiously implement the remaining
provisions'' of the 1994 peace accord, a statement said.
	   Brahimi, travelling as Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special
envoy, left New York on Monday night and was to spend a few days in
Paris before continuing on to Angola this weekend. He was expected
to stay for about five days, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said
Tuesday.
	   Brahimi was to make recommendations about the future U.N.
presence in Angola following the death last month of Annan's
special representative. A replacement representative was expected
to be named but ``the situation in Angola is really so grave now
that the secretary-general felt the needed to send someone right
away,'' Eckhard said.
	   Fighting between the government and the former rebel movement
UNITA has spiraled in recent weeks, with a reported massacre last
week in which 215 people were killed, including 88 burned in their
huts, Eckhard said Monday.
	   The U.N. Angola mission dispatched a team to northeastern Lunda
Norte province over the weekend to investigate the attack in the
diamond-mining village of Bula, about 250 miles (400 kilometers)
east of Luanda.
	   Team members were told by government officials that about 40
men, armed with AK-47 rifles, hand grenades and other weapons
carried out the attack, which also injured 70. The team flew over
Bula and reported it burned and deserted, Eckhard said.
	   Human rights workers interviewed 10 of the survivors, who blamed
the attack on UNITA. Armed men surround village, entered it killing
everybody they could before looting the place and burning it to the
ground, Eckhard said. The team was to return to the village this
week to continue the investigation.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ runs diamond-mining operations in
Lunda Norte. The diamonds provide the movement with hundreds of
millions of dollars annually, analysts say, but recent Security
Council sanctions have banned UNITA's diamond exports.
	   Brahimi is Annan's special representative in his efforts at
peacemaking and preventive diplomacy. He is also the U.N. chief's
special representative to Afghanistan and was to retain that post.
	   His trip follows the June 26 death of Alioune Blondin Beye,
Annan's special representative to Angola, who perished along with
five members of the U.N. Angola mission and two pilots in a plane
crash near Abidjan, Ivory Coast.
	   The government and UNITA signed a U.N.-brokered peace pact in
1994 to end their two-decade civil war, but lingering hostility
between them has delayed the agreement's full implementation.

Chechnya criticizes Russian military maneuvers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Maskhadov planning to visit U.S. TV broadcasts
resuming, Kiriyenko-Maskhadov meet set for this week. TRIMS pvs. &QL; 
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechnya denounced Russia on Tuesday for
conducting military maneuvers designed in part to quell
disturbances inside the separatist republic.
	   The military exercises just outside Chechnya's borders are ``an
open demonstration of force, which may destabilize the military and
political situation in the entire Caucasus region,'' the Chechen
Foreign Ministry said in a statement, according to the Interfax
news agency.
	   The military exercises, which began Monday and are to last all
week, are intended to better coordinate Russian forces in the
unstable Caucasus region, which includes Chechnya, Dagestan and
several other trouble spots.
	   The training includes exercises to fight terrorist attacks,
kidnappers and smuggling _ exactly the sort of incidents on the
rise in the region.
	   Several violent incidents, including an attempt to seize the
republic's TV broadcasting center, prompted Chechen President Aslan
Maskhadov to declare a state of emergency last month.
	   The state of emergency expired Tuesday, and Maskhadov said it
would not be renewed. The government lifted a ban on the
broadcasting of Russian TV and private Chechen TV that had been in
effect during the state of emergency.
	   However, government patrols were keeping a tight hold on the
capital Grozny, with checkpoints stationed every few hundred meters
(yards) around the city.
	   The government also issued a stiff warning to the fundamentalist
Wahabbi sect, which Chechen leaders have blamed for several recent
clashes, saying the Islamic group has two days to give up its
weapons. It also ordered two Wahabbi leaders to leave Chechnya.
	   Chechnya considers itself independent since it defeated Russian
forces in a 1994-96 war of secession. But Russia and the rest of
the world still consider the republic part of Russia.
	   Maskhadov plans to visit the United States next month, his
spokesman Mairbek Vachagayev said on local television Tuesday
night. He gave no details of the visit, but urged Chechens to come
forward with any information about the April 1995 disappearance of
American Fred Cuny, along with his Russian translator and two
Russian doctors.
	   The disaster-relief expert had been in Chechnya on a mission for
the Soros Foundation, a New York-based philanthropy.
	   Russian and Chechen officials hold each other responsible for
his death, while Cuny's relatives say Russian intelligence agencies
had spread rumors that he was a spy and those rumors prompted
Chechen fighters to kill him.
	   Meanwhile, Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said he would
meet with Maskhadov later this week in what is seen as a
demonstration of Kremlin support for the Chechen president.
Vachagayev, the presidential spokesman, said the meeting would not
be canceled because of the Russian military exercises.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Two Singapore security officers fired Tuesday
at a man who had waved a knife at a border checkpoint, television
news reported.
	   The man was injured and taken to a hospital, the report said,
citing police.
	   The officers work for CISCO, a government agency within the
Ministry of Home Affairs. CISCO officials and police could not be
reached for comment Tuesday night.
	   The TV report quoted police as saying an Indian man was
confronted by three CISCO officers as he waved a parang, a type of
heavy Malay knife, while walking along the causeway that connects
Singapore and Malaysia.
	   In the ensuing scuffle, the middle finger of one officer was cut
off, it said. The other two officers then fired several rounds with
their service revolvers, including two warning shots, it added.

Brazil closes Zagallo chapter; looks toward 2002, 2006
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ With its runner-up finish roundly
claimed a disaster, the Brazilian soccer confederation now is
looking to rebuild for Japan-South Korea in four years, and the
2006 World Cup _ which it has eyes on staging itself.
	   The CBF took its first step to recovery from the 3-0 loss to
France in the World Cup final two and a half weeks ago by
dismissing coach Mario Zagallo and his entire technical staff _ and
opening the speculation season on who will replace the man at the
top.
	   On top of the list of most analysts is Paulo Cesar Carpeggiani,
a Brazilian who qualified Paraguay for the first time since 1986
and led it all the way to the quarterfinals before a 1-0 extra time
loss to France ended its hopes. Some critics called it a
``dignified'' performance.
	   But Carpeggiani might be better remembered as the Flamengo coach
that crushed Liverpool 3-0 in the 1981 Intercontinental Cup in
Tokyo.
	   Then comes Paulo Autuori, who directed Cruzeiro to the 1997 Copa
Libertadores title, and Wanderley Luxemburgo, who has taken
Corinthians to two Brazilian national championship titles.
	   A decision could drag until the end of August, when the CBF is
expected to announce new appointments.
	   Complicating, or also occupying, the CBF's decision is the 2006
World Cup, which Brazil would like to bring home for the first time
since 1950.
	   The main problem is the competitors for the 2006 tournament _
namely England and Germany, and South Africa, which new FIFA
president Sepp Blatter already has voiced strong support for.
	   Brazil wants to start as early as possible at winning full
support from the Latin American region.
	   CBF president Ricardo Teixeira said he will open the venue
campaign Wednesday, when he is scheduled to travel to Paraguay.
	   ``It is not my dream. It is the Brazilian people's dream,''
Texeira said.
	   After advancing all the way to the final in France only to be
crushed by the only moderately respected host, most Brazilians
think that the goal of winning a fifth World Cup would be easier on
home soil.
	   Zagallo ended his reign by dropping more salt in the wounds left
by the France fiasco by criticizing Brazil's performance in the
World Cup final.
	   ``That day, Brazil would not beat anybody,'' he said.
	   He still defended his decision to start Ronaldo in the title
game despite reported vomiting and a convulsions suffered by the
21-year-old striker earlier in the day.
	   ``Without any doubt'', he told reporters when asked if he would
make the same decision today. ``The player came to the technical
commission saying he was all right and wanted to play. We did not
lose because of Ronaldo's performance, but because of the impact of
his problem among the players.''

IOC denies softening stance on doping
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Following a chorus of protest over recent remarks
by Juan Antonio Samaranch, International Olympic Committee
officials insisted Tuesday the organization has not softened its
stance against performance-enhancing drugs.
	   IOC president Samaranch was harshly criticized by athletes,
sports administrators and medical experts officials in Britain,
Germany and Australia after the publication of controversial
statements in a Spanish newspaper.
	   Samaranch was quoted in El Mundo on Sunday as saying that the
IOC's list of banned substances should be drastically reduced and
suggesting that only drugs which are harmful to an athlete's health
should be prohibited.
	   Many interpreted his comments as condoning the use of
performance-enhancing drugs if they aren't harmful.
	   IOC officials did not deny the accuracy of Samaranch's reported
comments but said they were misinterpreted and did not represent a
change in policy.
	   ``Absolutely not,'' said IOC director general Francois Carrard
when asked whether Samaranch was suggesting that anti-drug rules
should be relaxed.
	   ``He never meant to give up the fight against doping or to
launch himself a change of policy,'' Carrard said in a telephone
interview from IOC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. ``There
is no change in policy.''
	   Carrard said Samaranch is not a medical expert and may not have
made himself clear on the subject, even in his native Spanish.
	   ``He's not very precise in his scientific approach,'' Carrard
said. ``Sometimes on technical issues he expresses himself maybe in
an abrupt way.''
	   On Monday, the IOC issued a statement saying its determination
to fight drugs was ``greater than ever'' and announcing the IOC
would hold a worldwide conference in January to formulate a ``clear
definition of doping.''
	   Carrard said Samaranch's remarks were in keeping with the IOC's
initiative to streamline and simplify anti-doping rules and
documents. He said current literature is too complicated for most
people to understand.
	   ``You have a feeling there are two worlds: a world of experts
who know what they are talking about, and the rest of the world for
whom these things are as mysterious as religious prophecies,''
Carrard said.
	   Carrard said Samaranch referred specifically to codeine, a
product which was previously included on the banned list but was
recently removed because it has no performance-enhancing qualities.
	   ``He (Samaranch) said surely there must be other products like
codeine which need to be reviewed and maybe eliminated,'' Carrard
said.
	   He reiterated that Samaranch is especially intent on protecting
athletes from the dangers of drug use. Abuse of some banned
products can cause serious health problems, even death.
	   ``He wanted to emphasize the health aspect,'' Carrard said.
	   The IOC official said Samaranch did not mean that some banned
performance-enhancers are harmless.
	   ``I think he meant to say any substance which you are taking
when you want to enhance performance somehow damages your health
sooner or later,'' he said.
	   Olympic administrators from several countries, including the
United States, Britain and Australia, telephoned Samaranch to seek
clarification.
	   U.S. Olympic Committee executive director Dick Schultz said
Samaranch assured him he supports the IOC and USOC banned list
completely.
	   ``There is no doubt in my mind after speaking with him that we
share the view that athletes must not be allowed to gain an unfair
advantage through the use of drugs, and that the health and safety
of the athletes is a top priority,'' Schultz said in a statement.
	   In a separate telephone interview, Schultz said Samaranch
stressed that any performance-enhancing drug should be prohibited.
	   ``He emphasized very clearly that any drug that impacts the
health of an athlete or enhances performance should be banned,''
Schultz said. ``He made that very clear.''
	   As for Samaranch's remarks in the Spanish interview, Schultz
said, `I don't think there is any question he said it, I just don't
think he understood at the time what he was saying. I feel
comfortable after talking to him today this is not a change in IOC
policy.''
	   Michael Knight, head of the organizing committee for the 2000
Sydney Games, also came away satisfied after speaking by phone with
Samaranch.
	   ``Mr. Samaranch assured me the IOC's campaign against against
drugs in sport would continue with full determination and vigor,''
Knight said.
	   ``He made it clear he believed there were no performance
enhancing drugs that did not cause harm to the health of the
athletes.''

Four men killed in gangland-style slayings in Swiss tea room
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Four men were shot to death in a
gangland-style attack on a tea room in the diplomatic quarter of
the ordinarily placid Swiss capital, police said Tuesday.
	   Officers found the bodies of the men in the back of the Safari
Tea Room. The attackers escaped, said a police spokesman.
	   Neighbors called police late Monday evening when they heard the
windows breaking at the tea room, in central Bern. The Italian
consulate and the Ghana and Jordan embassies are among other
tenants of the building.
	   Federal prosecutor spokesman Juerg Blaser said there appeared to
be no connection between the slayings and the diplomatic missions.
	   Police said the victims were one 46-year-old Swiss man and three
Turkish nationals aged 37, 39 and 41. Police did not identify the
victims.
	   The tea room, which had been closed for two months due to a
change of ownership, was to reopen Tuesday under the management of
a Turkish woman, police said. Her whereabouts were unknown Tuesday.
	   Police refused to comment on speculation that the attack was a
feud among Turks, possibly related to debts.
	   Up to 40 police officers have been assigned to the case, and a
number of people have been questioned, but no one has been charged,
police said.

Mauro Gianetti to testify before Swiss court over doping claims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss cyclist Mauro Gianetti is to
testify before a court in Lausanne over claims that he was
hospitalized after taking a drug, a judicial official said Tuesday.
	   The hearing, due in the next few days, follows a claim by two
doctors, Gerald Gremion and Jean-Pierre Randin, that Gianetti's
life was in danger after he took PFC, a hemoglobin which speeds up
oxygen intake, during last May's Tour de Romandie race in
Switzerland. Gianetti denies the allegations.
	   Magistrate Nicolas Cruchet said there was enough information in
the doctors' submission to open an inquiry, but gave no further
details.
	   The investigation is to establish whether any injuries were
caused, intentionally or by negligence, and whether anyone's life
was endangered. No accusations have been made against any named
person or entity.
	   Three teams in this year's Tour de France have come under
scrutiny over allegations of drug use. The Festina team was thrown
out of the race for the use of the performance-enhancing drug EPO.
	   Gremion, who was doctor to Swiss teams PMU Romand and Swiss
Port, has said he believes 99 percent of Tour de France cyclists
used performance-enhancing drugs.

Arazi stunned by Austrian wild card
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KITZBUEHEL, Austria (AP) _ Markus Hipfl, an Austrian wild card,
thrashed Hicham Arazi 6-2, 6-1 in a stunning upset Tuesday to reach
the third round of the dlrs 535,000 Generali Open.
	   Arazi, 24, is No. 42 in the world and the Moroccan is a stylish
clay-court player who reached the quarterfinals of the French Open
the last two years.
	   Hipfl, 20, is No. 266 in the world with no major successes
behind him.
	   But the Austrian, who had upset Spain's Galo Blanco in the
opening round, dominated Arazi and took only 48 minutes to dispatch
the listless Moroccan, who was warned once for smashing the ball
into the stands.
	   Hipfl picked up his first victory over a top-50 player. He is a
protege of Ronald Leitgeb, who also coaches and manages Austrian
star Thomas Muster, a former French Open champion and briefly No. 1
in the world.
	   Arazi appeared to be complaining of shoulder problems and
offered little resistance once Hipfl broke serve for a 3-2 lead.
	   ``I wasn't watching him, I was trying to concentrate on my
game,'' Hipfl said.
	   Yevgeny Kafelnikov, another former French Open champion,
struggled to reach the third round. The Russian had to battle hard
to prevail over Radomir Vasek of the Czech Republic, 6-7 (2-7),
6-3, 7-6 (7-4).
	   Seeded No. 2, Kafelnikov is the top seeded player in the draw
following the withdrawal of Marcelo Rios because of an injury.

Russia to modernize only 3 MiG-29 fighter jets this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will modernize only three of its MiG-29
fighter jets this year instead of the 10 to 15 initially planned,
the general designer of the MiG Aviation Company said Tuesday.
	   The Defense Ministry wants to modernize the MiG-29s to raise
their combat ability. They would become the MiG-29 SNT, a
multipurpose fighter with a newly designed cockpit, new
liquid-crystal display panels, upgraded radar and a range that has
been extended 500 kilometers (300 miles).
	   The MiG-29 is an advanced twin-engine fighter jet capable of
flying two times the speed of sound and carrying a wide variety of
weapons, including nuclear bombs.
	   Altogether, 150-180 MiGs produced in the last 10 years are to be
upgraded. But the conversion will be slower than anticipated
because of lack of money, aircraft designer Mikhail Korzhuyev told
the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The first 10-15 aircraft were to have been upgraded starting in
September at a military aircraft-repairing plant in Kubinka, near
Moscow region, and the MiG company.
	   Another 20-20 were to be modernized in 1999 and 40 every year
starting in 2000.
	   The Defense Ministry has not received the funds necessary for
the conversion, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The MiG-29 SNT will make a demonstration flight at the
prestigious Farnborough air show in England, Korzhuyev said.
	   A new two-seater fighter plane, the MiG-29 UBT, will also be on
display, but only on the ground. The UBT model is similar to the
SNT but can carry an extra fuel tank extending its flight range.

General: Iraq was prepared for U.S. nuclear attack during Gulf War
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Baghdad had feared that Israel or the
United States might use weapons of mass destruction during the 1991
Gulf War and had prepared to retaliate with chemical and biological
arms, an Iraqi officer said in a new book.
	   Lt. Gen. Hazem Abdulrazzaq al-Ayoubi, the commander of Iraq's
missile forces, said that President Saddam Hussein told him 10 days
before the Gulf War began that ``missiles carrying special warheads
should be made ready for launching once an order is given to that
effect.''
	   The retaliatory attack would have targeted U.S.-allied forces in
the Gulf or Israel.
	   The information, made public for the first time in Iraq, was
from a new book by al-Ayoubi. He is the first Iraqi Gulf War
general to print his memoirs.
	   A review of the book, which is expected out shortly, was
published Tuesday in the government weekly, al-Ittihad. The
magazine did not say when the book would be released.
	   The magazine said that Saddam heavily edited the book before it
went to press.
	   Al-Ayoubi says he received a written message from Saddam on Jan.
17, 1991, the day the allies began their massive air attacks
against Iraq that ``included an order to the missile forces to
strike Israel with the heaviest fire possible.''
	   Al-Ayoubi's book, al-Ittihad says, contains a copy of the
hand-written letter by Saddam in which he cautions his general
against using any of the chemical or biological warheads at his
disposal.
	   But another order detailing the use of chemical and biological
weapons told the general to retaliate if weapons of mass
destruction were used against Iraq.
	   The United States and its allies heavily bombarded Iraq during
the war, but never used unconventional weapons.
	   Iraq fired 39 missiles at Israel during the war. All carried
conventional warheads.
	   Al-Ayoubi said despite the allies' air and missile superiority,
they failed to destroy any of Iraq's missile launchers during the
war. He said Iraq changed launching site minutes after each missile
was fired.

<TEXT>
	   LIPLJANE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A British aid worker imprisoned near
the Kosovo capital Pristina briefly fell unconscious Monday after
five days of hunger strike, the British Embassy in Belgrade said
Tuesday.
	   The British consul in Belgrade, Bob Corton, confirmed that a
member of the embassy staff had visited Sally Becker.
	   ``At one point during the interview, she fainted but quickly
regained consciousness. She did not object to having an intravenous
fluid attached,'' said the consul.
	   She was remarkably well considering that she had been without
food and drink for five days, he said. She was oriented and alert
and determined to continue with the hunger strike.
	   From what doctors have said the period after the fifth day of a
hunger strike is critical, Corton explained.
	   In a statement released to the Press Agency news service in
Britain through her spokesman, Becker said: ``Being imprisoned for
trying to rescue wounded children brought a spotlight to my cell. I
deserve the right to speak of the suffering I have witnessed.
	   ``Actions speak louder than words, so my refusal of food and
water is my way of redirecting the spotlight on to the suffering of
two million people in Kosovo.''
	   Becker, who was dubbed the ``Angel of Mostar'' for her
humanitarian efforts in that Bosnian city during the 3{ war, was
detained on July 16 and charged with illegally crossing the
Albanian-Yugoslav border while attempting to assist Kosovo
refugees. She heads a small humanitarian organization called
Operation Angel.
	   The British aid worker was sentenced to 30 days in prison and is
being held in a prison cell in Lipljane, 20 kilometers (12 miles)
south of Kosovo.
	   On July 23, she announced to reporters that she had stopped
eating and drinking to protest the violence in Kosovo province,
where the underground Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting Serbian
forces for independence from Serbia.
	   ``Her lawyer has registered an appeal, hoping for a reduced
sentence,'' consul Corton said.
	   So far, there has been no sign from Serbian authorities whether
the sentence will actually be reduced. A decision was expected by
Wednesday.

Swiss write to U.S. finance chiefs over sanctions threats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Simon Wiesenthal Center in two final
grafs. &QL; 
 &UR; With US-Swiss Banks-Holocaust &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's embassy in Washington has
sent letters to the finance chiefs of all 50 U.S. states and 15
major cities urging them not to impose sanctions on Swiss firms,
the government's task force on World War II said Tuesday.
	   The letter, signed by the Swiss ambassador to the United States,
Alfred Defago, and Thomas Borer, the diplomat who heads the task
force, was sent out on Friday.
	   Copies were also sent to all 50 state governors.
	   New York City and state earlier this month turned up the
pressure over deadlocked talks between Swiss commercial banks,
Jewish groups and lawyers for Holocaust survivors by announcing
plans to withhold business from the banks and, if no solution is
found, from other Swiss firms. Other states also have announced
plans for sanctions.
	   Last month, the banks offered dlrs 600 million for a settlement
of claims by Holocaust survivors. Jewish leaders claimed that was
far less than the more than dlrs 1 billion the banks should be
paying.
	   ``For us and our country, justice is a continuing process that
cannot be reduced to simple dollar amounts,'' the letter said,
listing Switzerland's efforts to address its wartime past and make
amends for any wrongdoing.
	   Those efforts include a fund to help needy Holocaust survivors,
an independent panel of historians reviewing the period and a
U.S.-led committee investigating Holocaust-era assets in Swiss
banks.
	   ``It is our hope that you will join with us in calling for an
end to counterproductive rhetoric and misguided sanctions that will
only serve to delay a just and lasting conclusion, in the interests
of the survivors of the Holocaust,'' the letter concluded.
	   It noted that over 400 Swiss companies have U.S. branches or
subsidiaries and said it ``would be a major mistake to risk this
productive relationship.''
	   In a personal letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton last week,
Swiss President Flavio Cotti called on the U.S. administration to
take decisive action against the sanctions.
	   Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Los Angeles-based Simon
Wiesenthal Center, said states have a right to impose the
sanctions. ``I would not pay heed to what the Swiss government is
saying,'' he said.
	   The banks are ``going to have to come up with dlrs 1.5 billion''
if they want to settle the claims, Hier said.

Albanian party appeals for international aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The general secretary of the main
Albanian party described the Serb offensive against Kosovo
Liberation Army rebels as an attack on civilians and urged major
powers to intercede with Belgrade to stop it.
	   ``What we are dealing with here is a major offensive of the
(Serb) military and police forces, not only on KLA positions but
also on the political centers of the resistance in Kosovo,'' Nekibe
Kelmendi of the Democratic League of Kosovo said.
	   He said the successful Serb offensive on the KLA stronghold of
Malisevo was ``foremost as an attack on civilians because tens of
thousands refugees from other clash points had found shelter there.
These people are today facing the Serbian forces for the second
time.''
	   Kelmendi said the offensive would ``further worsen the crisis in
Kosovo'' because Albanians could not stand by and watch it.
	   ``What I cannot comprehend is the silence of the international
community at this latest Serb offensive of huge proportions in
which tanks and the military were openly used,'' Kelmendi said.

Dentist repossesses dentures _ right from woman's mouth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WIESBADEN, Germany (AP) _ A woman told police her dentist
stormed into a bar, tilted her head and yanked out the dentures he
made for her because she'd failed to pay her bill.
	   Police said Tuesday the 48-year-old woman has paid what was owed
since the Saturday incident in Wiesbaden, near Frankfurt, and that
they were investigating her assault complaint against the dentist.
	   The police said they've been unable to talk yet with the
dentist, whose name they did not release, but said witnesses to the
denture-snatching confirmed the story.
	   The dentist was out when officers visited his office Tuesday.
But police said an assistant showed them a plastic bag containing
the dentures and said the woman could pick them up when convenient.

New Indian tribe identified in northeastern Brazil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ A small group of farmers who for years
kept to themselves in the hills in northeastern Brazil are really
Indians of the Kalanko tribe, a Brazilian researcher said Tuesday.
	   The existence of the Kalankos _ or Enchanted People _ was
reported two months ago by Jorge Vieira, a researcher working for
the Indian Missionary Council in the northeastern state of Alagoas.
	   ``They shun outsiders and avoid confrontation and for years they
posed as simple farmers,'' Vieira said of the 208 Kalankos living
in the barren hills of Agua Branca 1,900 kilometers (1,180 miles)
northeast of Sao Paulo.
	   Vieira said by phone that the Kalankos are ``naturally
distrustful of the white man because of a long history of
persecution either by the Portuguese colonizers of the past or
today's wealthy landowners who always chased them off their land.''
	   To survive, they established themselves in the hills of Agua
Branca where no one bothered them and where for years they have
been living as typical northeastern peasants.
	   Vieira, who has been studying Brazilian tribes for 13 years,
took several months to gain the Kalankos' confidence and have them
``reveal their true identity.''

Iraq says U.S., Britain blocking food and medicine contracts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq accused the United States and Britain
on Tuesday of blocking 33 contracts for food and medicine that are
part of a U.N. oil-for-food deal.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency said that dlrs 131 million in
contracts for powdered milk, rice, tea, eggs, cooking oil, wheat,
medicine and spare parts for the railways were being held up.
	   The agency said that Iraq has submitted 104 contracts under the
current six-month phase of the deal, but that only 31 have been
approved by the U.N. sanctions committee. The remaining 40 are
apparently still under consideration.
	   The United States and Britain are members of the committee,
which must approve all of the Iraqi contracts.
	   ``The blocking of these contracts confirms that the U.S.
administration and its lackey, the British government, are
intensifying their anti-Iraq efforts,'' the spokesman said.
	   Iraq can export dlrs 5.2 billion in oil under the current phase
of the oil-for-food deal, which began in early June. The money from
the exports must be used to buy humanitarian goods.
	   The United Nations imposed sweeping trade sanctions against Iraq
after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The sanctions will only be lifted when U.N. arms inspectors
certify that Baghdad has eliminated its weapons of mass
destruction.

Brazil closes Zagallo chapter; looks toward 2002, 2006
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS third graf to show Paraguay eliminated in second
round. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ With its runner-up finish roundly
claimed a disaster, the Brazilian soccer confederation now is
looking to rebuild for Japan-South Korea in four years, and the
2006 World Cup _ which it has eyes on staging itself.
	   The CBF took its first step to recovery from the 3-0 loss to
France in the World Cup final two and a half weeks ago by
dismissing coach Mario Zagallo and his entire technical staff _ and
opening the speculation season on who will replace the man at the
top.
	   On top of the list of most analysts is Paulo Cesar Carpeggiani,
a Brazilian who qualified Paraguay for the first time since 1986
and led it all the way to the second round before a 1-0 extra time
loss to France ended its hopes. Some critics called it a
``dignified'' performance.
	   But Carpeggiani might be better remembered as the Flamengo coach
that crushed Liverpool 3-0 in the 1981 Intercontinental Cup in
Tokyo.
	   Then comes Paulo Autuori, who directed Cruzeiro to the 1997 Copa
Libertadores title, and Wanderley Luxemburgo, who has taken
Corinthians to two Brazilian national championship titles.
	   A decision could drag until the end of August, when the CBF is
expected to announce new appointments.
	   Complicating, or also occupying, the CBF's decision is the 2006
World Cup, which Brazil would like to bring home for the first time
since 1950.
	   The main problem is the competitors for the 2006 tournament _
namely England and Germany, and South Africa, which new FIFA
president Sepp Blatter already has voiced strong support for.
	   Brazil wants to start as early as possible at winning full
support from the Latin American region.
	   CBF president Ricardo Teixeira said he will open the venue
campaign Wednesday, when he is scheduled to travel to Paraguay.
	   ``It is not my dream. It is the Brazilian people's dream,''
Texeira said.
	   After advancing all the way to the final in France only to be
crushed by the only moderately respected host, most Brazilians
think that the goal of winning a fifth World Cup would be easier on
home soil.
	   Zagallo ended his reign by dropping more salt in the wounds left
by the France fiasco by criticizing Brazil's performance in the
World Cup final.
	   ``That day, Brazil would not beat anybody,'' he said.
	   He still defended his decision to start Ronaldo in the title
game despite reported vomiting and a convulsions suffered by the
21-year-old striker earlier in the day.
	   ``Without any doubt'', he told reporters when asked if he would
make the same decision today. ``The player came to the technical
commission saying he was all right and wanted to play. We did not
lose because of Ronaldo's performance, but because of the impact of
his problem among the players.''

New Azzurri coach promises more offensive play
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ New Italian national team coach Dino Zoff said to
expect more offensive play when the Azzurri begin qualifying for
the 2000 European Championship in September.
	   ``I plan a zone defense without a sweeper and two forwards in a
4-4-2 tactic similar to the one I used as a coach of Lazio,'' Zoff
said Tuesday in his first news conference since being selected to
replace Cesare Maldini.
	   Zoff, the Azzurri's former goalkeeper who has coached both Lazio
and Juventus, was named last week to replace Maldini, who was
sacked following Italy's elimination by France on a penalty
shootout in the World Cup quarterfinals.
	   Maldini, criticized for overly defensive tactics at France '98,
told Milan daily Corriere della Sera he could not understand the
reasons for his dismissal.
	   ``I'm no longer Italy's coach, without losing a game in the
World Cup. The fans still are supporting me,'' Maldini said.
	   Zoff, who signed a four-year deal through the 2002 World Cup,
did not join Maldini's critics, complimenting Italy's play in
France.
	   ``I never judged a colleague's work ... I will adapt (Italy's
play) to what the league offers,'' Zoff said.
	   Zoff, who captained Italy to the 1982 World Cup title in Spain,
will debut as manager in Liverpool, England, on Sept. 5, when the
Azzurri play Wales in an European qualifying match.
	   The coach is expected to announce Italy's roster on Aug. 30, the
day after the Italian SuperCup final between Juventus and Lazio.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Rod Laver, the only tennis player to twice
claim Grand Slams, was upgraded to serious condition Tuesday after
he suffered a stroke during an interview being taped for a
television special.
	   Laver, 59, was taken to UCLA Medical Center after being stricken
Monday. He was initially in critical condition but was listed in
serious condition Tuesday morning, said hospital spokeswoman Ruthie
Marek.
	   Several family members were at the hospital waiting to visit
Laver in the intensive care unit, but they refused to comment and
referred all questions to the hospital.
	   Laver suffered the stroke when he was being interviewed for an
upcoming series by U.S. sports cable outlet ESPN about the greatest
athletes of the 20th century, network spokesman Rob Tobias said.
	   Tobias said he didn't know exactly where or when the interview
took place.
	   Laver won 11 Grand Slam singles titles, one fewer than all-time
leader Roy Emerson, and he is the only player to sweep the four
major championships in two different years. The Australian
left-hander did it as an amateur in 1962 and as a pro in 1969.
	   Nicknamed ``Rocket'' for his powerful groundstrokes, Laver won
four Wimbledons, three Australian titles, two U.S. championships
and two French titles in singles. He also won nine Grand Slam
doubles titles.
	   During his 23-year career, he won 47 pro singles titles and was
runner-up 21 times. He also starred for Australia in Davis Cup
competition, compiling a 16-4 record in singles and a 4-0 mark in
doubles
	   Laver, who lives in Newport Beach, California, was the world's
No. 1 player in 1961, 1962, 1968 and 1969 and earned dlrs 1.5
million during his career.
	   He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in
1981.

	   ROME (AP) _ South Korea defeated Nicaragua 10-7 at the Baseball
World Championships Tuesday to move into second place in the group
B standings in a tie with Nicaragua.
	   Both countries have four wins and two losses with one round of
preliminary play to go. The top four teams from each of the two
eight-country pools advance to the quarterfinals Friday.
	   Australia, which has already clinched a quarterfinal spot, heads
into another pool B match against the United States later Tuesday
with a perfect 5-0 record.
	   The Americans, currently ranked 6th in the group, have a slim
chance of earning a quarterfinal berth.
	   At Messina, Sicily, South Korea started with a bang when
outfielder Young-Kyoon Chang smacked a three-run homer in the first
inning. South Korean pitcher Hun-Ho Kyung tossed a five-hitter and
struck out four batters to help seal the victory.
	   South Korea was runner-up to Cuba at the 1994 Worlds.
	   Cuba, the five-time defending titlist, and leader of pool A with
a perfect 5-0 record, faces the Dominican Republic (4-1) Tuesday
night. Cuba has won 36 consecutive games at the Worlds.
	   At Palermo, Sicily, the Netherlands collected 11 hits to beat
Canada 7-5 in 10 innings. Pitcher Rikkert Faneyte helped his own
cause by hitting a triple in the 10th inning.
	   The Netherlands improved its record to 3-3, and is tied for
fourth with Canada in group B.
	   Also at Palermo, Taiwan (2-4) beat Russia 7-1. The Russians have
lost all six games played and sit at the bottom of the group B
rankings, behind Taiwan.

German tax investigators raid Becker-related locations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ German investigators have raided about 30
locations linked to tennis star Boris Becker on suspicion that he
evaded taxes on millions of dollars in earnings, a newspaper
reported Tuesday.
	   The agents searched offices and apartments of Becker's friends
and sponsors Monday, the Sueddeutsche Zeitung said.
	   Becker, a three-time Wimbledon champion, the former No. 1 in the
world and the country's Davis Cup captain, remains one of Germany's
most popular personalities. He is in semi-retirement on the tennis
circuit, playing only selected tournaments.
	   Becker and his former manager Ion Tiriac are suspected of
evading taxes on millions of dollars of Becker's earnings from 1990
to 1993.
	   Becker and Tiriac have rejected the accusations ever since they
first surfaced in February last year. Prosecutors so far have
declined to charge Becker and his former manager, indicating they
did not believe they had a strong case.
	   The newspaper, in a report released in advance of its Wednesday
edition, did not specify where the raids took place.
	   Tax authorities want to find out how much time Becker spent in
Monte Carlo, the tax haven where he officially resided between 1990
and 1993.
	   Under German law, Becker would have had to spend at least 185
days in Monte Carlo to avoid paying German taxes. The investigators
believe he spent most of the time in Germany, according to the
report.
	   German tennis star Steffi Graf also has been linked to tax
evasion.
	   Her father, Peter Graf, was sentenced in January 1997 to three
years, nine months for evading taxes on dlrs 6.55 million of his
daughter's tennis earnings.
	   Graf, 59, was released from prison April 29 after serving more
than half of the sentence, including time served when he was in
investigative custody.

Randall Robinson leads U.S. activists on goodwill trip to troubled

Haiti &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ With Haiti losing friends and aid
abroad, the U.S. activist who helped force President Bill Clinton
to accept Haitian boat people is heading to Port-au-Prince to whip
up support.
	   ``We want to help in any way we can, to make Haiti's democracy
and economy a stable and viable reality,'' Randall Robinson said in
a telephone interview from his TransAfrica Forum in Washington
D.C., where he works to influence U.S. policy on Africa and the
Caribbean.
	   Robinson was expected later Tuesday, three weeks after a group
of advocates warned that the U.S. Congress is inclined to cut all
aid if Haitians do not resolve a year-old power struggle.
	   President Rene Preval invited him, said Robinson, who is
traveling with actor Danny Glover and novelist Walter Mosley.
	   Haiti has been without effective government since June 1997,
when Premier Rosny Smarth resigned to protest Preval's alleged
complicity in tainted legislative elections that favored Preval's
mentor, former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
	   Three attempts to nominate Smarth's successor have been rejected
by Parliament. On July 15, Preval nominated Education Minister
Jacques-Edouard Alexis. It could take more than a month for
legislators to reject or approve him.
	   Meanwhile, Haiti is losing aid and the good will it had when
Clinton defied Congress to send 20,000 U.S. troops to depose
military dictators and restore democracy in September 1994.
	   Clinton is seeking to double U.S. aid to Haiti, from dlrs 70
million to dlrs 140 million. Both Republicans and Democrats are
objecting.
	   ``I think we've got to be patient,'' Robinson said. ``It seems
to me that the very worst thing the United States could do would be
to slash aid precipitously.''
	   Clinton ordered the invasion in part to stem a massive flow of
Haitian boat people to Florida. In April-May 1994, Robinson went on
a 27-day hunger strike to force Clinton to let Haitian boat people
into the United States.
	   His last trip here was in June 1995, to monitor legislative
elections that had gross irregularities. Robinson declared they
were fair but most political parties withdrew from the electoral
process, charging they were rigged to favor Aristide's heirs.
	   The TransAfrica delegation will leave Haiti on Thursday, after
meetings with Preval, Aristide, and other public figures.

Pantani still in yellow after Ullrich challenge

<TEXT>
	   ALBERTVILLE, France (AP) - For more than 90 minutes defending
Jan Ullrich and current leader Marco Pantani rode together in a
thrilling head-to-head duel in Tuesday's 16th stage of the Tour de
France.
	   At the end of the 204 kilometers (127 miles), Ullrich edged
Pantani by less than 5 centimeters (2 inches) for the stage
victory. Pantani held on to the leader's yellow jersey and Ullrich
re-established himself after a poor day on Monday.
	   ``I wanted to show I was still here,'' Ullrich said. ``It was
important for the future.''
	   ``I tried to stay with him but he deserved the victory today,''
Pantani said.
	   Ullrich did most of the work, trying to break Pantani. He wanted
to cut a the gap that Pantani built Monday when Ullrich lost nearly
nine minutes to the Italian during the day.
	   The real racing happened over the last 60 kilometers (37 miles)
which they did together with no other riders in sight.
	   First up most of the 20-kilometer (12.5 mile) Madeleine peak.
Then the last 40 kilometers (25 miles) downhill at speeds
approaching 100 kph (61 mph).
	   Only on the final flat of more than 10 kilometers (6 miles) did
Pantani share pace-setting chores with Ullrich to maintain their
gap over the others.
	   ``It was difficult today,'' Pantani said. ``Jan was very strong.
After his bad day yesterday (Monday) he made a different race
today.''
	   In the final stretch both sprinted and Ullrich came out ahead
but just barely over Pantani.
	   American Bobby Julich, who was in second entering the day to
Pantani, was dropped by the two on the final climb. He managed to
finish 1 minute 49 seconds behind to hold onto second place overall
by 14 seconds over Ullrich.
	   He was third on the day, coming in in the group with Fernando
Escartin of Spain.
	   Julich now trails Pantani by 5:42 in the overall standings with
Ullrich now at 5:56.
	   ``I struggled a little on the Madeleine. Then I was cramping on
the downhill but I pushed the pace at the end to save my second,''
Julich said.
	   At the beginning of the day he had led Ullrich by 2:03. At one
point he was trailing Ullrich by more than 2:10 but cut the gap to
conserve second place.
	   Tuesday's stage had five climbs but all were between 950 meters
(3,106 feet) and 2,000 meters (6,540 feet). In contrast to the wet
conditions Monday, it was sunny nearly the entire way.
	   Ullrich made a bold move on the final climb. He was trying to
cut the gap to have a chance in Saturday's time trial to hold on to
the title.
	   In the last time trial, Ullrich gained 4:21 over Pantani. In
last year's final time trial, Ullrich gained nearly four minutes.
	   But after he failed to gain any seconds on Pantani Tuesday,
Ullrich thinks it will be hard to overtake Pantani.
	   ``I didn't think that Marco was able to win here after the Tour
of Italy,'' Ullrich said. ``I didn't think he was in good shape. I
tip my hat to him.''
	   Pantini refused to acknowledge victory yet.
	   ``The Tour is not finished yet,'' Pantani said.
	   France's Stephane Heulot and Germany's Rolf Aldag built up a
lead of more than six minutes enterng the final climb up the
Madelaine peak.
	   But midway up Ullrich looked around then broke away from the
small group of favorites. Only Pantani followed.
	   For the rest of the climb it was Ullrich looking straight ahead
with Pantani riding just behind the German's back wheel.
	   By the top they had passed Aldag and Heulot and built up about
two minutes on the group that included Julich and Escartin, third
entering the day.
	   Then came the downhill ride and Ullrich's final lunge for his
fifth stage victory in the Tour de France.
	   Wednesday's 17th stage is the last full day in the Alps from
Albertville to Aix les Bains, 149 kilometers (92.6 miles) with
three climbs but ending with a long downhill.
	   The Tour ends Sunday.

Palestinian security chief, in shift, takes tough anti-Hamas line
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with more Rajoub quotes on Netanyahu, trims &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ Signaling new willingness to move
against Hamas, Yasser Arafat's chief enforcer scoffed Tuesday at
the Islamic group's spiritual leader and threatened to keep another
Hamas official in jail for years.
	   During a question-and-answer session with foreign news
organizations, Jibril Rajoub, head of Palestinian preventive
security in the West Bank, also called Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu a ``racist and a liar'' who is out for
bloodshed.
	   ``He is leading to war, but we are not afraid of war,'' Rajoub
told reporters in the West Bank town of Jericho. ``War would be on
both sides, not only in the Palestinian areas.''
	   Such harsh anti-Netanyahu rhetoric is not particularly unusual
coming from a Palestinian official. Rajoub's comments on Hamas,
though, could mark a change of direction in dealing with the
radical Islamic group.
	   Israel demands that Arafat crack down hard on Hamas, but the
Palestinian leader, mindful of the group's popular following,
generally avoids direct confrontations with it.
	   But Rajoub's remarks, which almost certainly reflect the
thinking of Arafat and his inner circle, point to escalating
tensions between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas.
	   Hamas _ which opposes the Oslo peace accords and has staged
suicide attacks that have killed scores of Israelis _ came under
fire from Rajoub on several fronts during the wide-ranging
discussion with reporters.
	   He suggested the Palestinian Authority would make an example of
a top Hamas political leader, Abdel Aziz Rantisi, who was arrested
in April and charged with endangering national security after he
criticized Arafat.
	   Last month, the Palestinian Supreme Court ordered Rantisi
released for lack of evidence, but he remains in prison, with new
charges being prepared against him. Rajoub said he deserved to
spend 15 or 20 years in prison.
	   The Palestinian security chief also hit at another Hamas sore
point, saying a Hamas military activist would stand trial for the
slaying of the group's chief bombmaker, Mohiyadine Sharif.
	   Sharif's mangled body was was found March 29 at the scene of a
massive car-bomb blast in the West Bank town of Ramallah. Hamas
angrily denied the Palestinian Authority's claim that the
bombmaker's death was the result of an internal feud.
	   Soon after the slaying, Palestinian police jailed Imad
Awadallah, a close Hamas associate of the slain man. Rajoub said
Awadallah had confessed to the killing and would be tried.
	   Also, in an unusual public criticism of Jordan, Rajoub accused
its government of allowing Hamas to use the neighboring state as a
staging ground.
	   ``The Jordanians adopted the Hamas leadership and provide the
facilities,'' he said. ``All (Hamas') financial support is in
Jordan _ the orders come from there.''
	   Rajoub's comments came at a delicate moment in efforts to
restart the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. During the 16-month
impasse, Netanyahu has incessantly criticized Arafat for failing to
take sufficient steps to fight terrorism.
	   Rajoub said sardonically that he wasn't ``looking for some
certification from Netanyahu'' on anti-Hamas efforts, but even so,
he took sharp aim at Yassin, the group's ailing, paralyzed
spiritual leader.
	   During a three-month fundraising tour of Arab states that ended
last month, Yassin repeatedly criticized Arafat's policies and
advocated a return to the armed Palestinian struggle.
	   In most explicit warning yet to Yassin from a top Palestinian
official, Rajoub said the sheik would not be allowed to assume too
much power.
	   ``I didn't take part in the national struggle for 18 years...to
see Sheik Ahmed Yassin leading the Palestinian people,'' he said.
``I don't think Palestinians want to live in an Islamic state.''

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Alleging that ``many
irregularities'' had marred Cambodia's election, opposition parties
asked Tuesday that new votes be taken in disputed precincts if
wrongdoing was found.
	   They also threatened to boycott the National Assembly if their
complaints were not heeded, bringing the prospect that Cambodia
will remain in a state of political turmoil.
	   The opposition parties anticipate that official election results
will favor the ruling party of strongman Hun Sen, although only a
small number of partial results have been released so far from
Sunday's election.
	   The National Election Committee has released preliminary
official tallies for half the communes in 11 of the 21 provinces.
Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party was well ahead of its opponents.
	   Opposition suspicions have been stirred by the circulation of an
unofficial tally by Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian Peoples Party,
showing it had won 67 of the National Assembly's 122 seats.
	   According to CPP figures, the royalist FUNCINPEC party of Prince
Norodom Ranariddh took 42 seats and the Sam Rainsy Party just 13.
Ranariddh was deposed by Hun Sen, his co-premier, in a coup last
year.
	   FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party issued a statement saying
they ``cannot accept the results of these elections'' until their
allegations of irregularities in voting, ballot counting and
results reporting had been thoroughly investigated by national and
international observers.
	   But most of the 700 international election observers, upon whose
support the opposition parties are depending, appeared inclined to
certify the election as free and fair enough to be considered
legitimate, pending the full release of credible results.
	   ``The balloting and counting processes were generally well
administered, and the atmosphere on the balloting and counting days
was largely upbeat,'' said a statement from a U.S. delegation sent
by the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs and
the International Republican Institute.
	   It added, however, that such an accomplishment could not
``negate the violence, extensive intimidation, unfair media access
and ruling party control of the administrative machinery that
characterized the pre-election period.''
	   A small but prestigious observer group whose co-leader is former
Australian Ambassador Tony Kevin issued a more-or-less unqualified
endorsement of the polls.
	   The statement from the Volunteer Observers for the Cambodian
Elections _ widely seen as sympathetic to Hun Sen _ said it
believed the election ``was an authentic expression of the
Cambodian people's choice.''
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said,
``The charges of fraud and irregularities leveled by Prince
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy are serious allegations. And we are urging
the Cambodian authorities to investigate them thoroughly, to ensure
that the results reflect the will of the Cambodian people.
	   ``With respect to Hun Sen's claim of a victory, the same holds
true. While we know that the Cambodian people voted in large
numbers -- and deserve congratulations for doing so -- it's
premature in the extreme for anyone to declare victory because a
large percentage of the votes have not been counted.''
	   Hun Sen's party, meanwhile, shrugged off opposition threats to
boycott the new National Assembly and suggested a coalition.
	   ``If they don't, the current government will go until probably
2003, but I think they should uphold national interests and join a
coalition government,'' said Svay Sitha, a CPP steering committee
member.
	   If Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy boycott the National Assembly, they
could block its ability to meet because two-thirds of the members
must be present.
	   The dispute raised the prospect of more turmoil in a country
that suffered the Khmer Rouge genocide of the 1970s and 30 years of
civil war and strife. In the latest round, Hun Sen deposed
Ranariddh as co-prime minister last year in two days of fighting in
the capital.
	   The co-premiership emerged from U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993
meant to usher in a new era of peace and democracy.
	   Ranariddh won, but Hun Sen, who came to power in 1985 under the
harsh Vietnamese occupation that followed the Khmer Rouge, forced
his way into a coalition by threatening war.
	   Hun Sen called the elections in a bid to win back international
aid and legitimacy, but used violence, including murder, against
opposition activists and intimidation of voters to ensure his
victory.

Serbs capture major Kosovo Liberation Army stronghold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS and UPDATES with more details on Malisevo, rebels
attacking Serb military convoy, situation in Junik; CHANGES byline,
EDITS. &QL;

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Backed by tanks, Serb police drove
Kosovo Liberation Army fighters from a major stronghold Tuesday and
fought to hold the main road which cut through the heart of rebel
territory in central Kosovo.
	   Elsewhere, government forces tightened their noose around
another KLA bastion _ Junik _ located near the border with Albania,
which the insurgents use as a sanctuary and source of arms.
	   The Serbian Media Center reported that government troops entered
the town of Malisevo, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of
Pristina, at 5 p.m. (1500 GMT). It said armed ethnic Albanians
dispersed, and there were no civilian casualties.
	   The Kosovo Information Center quoted an Albanian writer who
lives near Malisevo, Xhevdet Bajraj, as confirming that the rebels
had pulled out of the town and that ``only civilians have been left
behind.''
	   Bajraj appealed to the International Committee of the Red Cross
to help the ``tens of thousands'' of civilians, including many
refugees, stranded in Malisevo.
	   Last week, the ICRC said that many of the 40,000 civilians who
fled fighting in another town, Orahovac, had taken shelter in
Malisevo. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimated that
half of the Orahovac refugees had fled to Malisevo.
	   In Pristina, the general-secretary of the Democratic League of
Kosovo, Nekibe Kelmendi, accused the Serbs of seeking ``to destroy
the defenseless civilian Albanian population and cleanse Kosovo of
Albanians.''
	   ``This will further worsen the crisis in Kosovo,'' said
Kelmendi, an aide to moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova. ``You
cannot expect Albanians in Kosovo to calmly watch what is
happening.''
	   The loss of Malisevo was the latest in a series of setbacks
suffered by the ethnic Albanian rebels, whose firepower is vastly
inferior to that of the government forces.
	   There was no word of casualties among fighters on both sides.
	   The rebels are fighting for the independence of Kosovo, whose
population of 2 million people is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
Kosovo is located in southern Serbia, the dominant of two republics
that make up what remains of Yugoslavia.
	   Earlier in the day, a column of 60 tanks was seen heading for
Malisevo. An nearby village, Bubavec, was reported to be ablaze,
the Albanian center said.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency said that ``a great number
of Albanian terrorists ... left Tuesday, in panic, their huge
separatist-terrorist nucleus in Malisevo and fled into nearby
woods.''
	   In Geneva, UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski said up to 65,000
people were believed to have been in Malisevo, normally a small
town, including about 20,000 refugees from Orahovac.
	   Elsewhere, Serb forces continued their siege of Junik, 80
kilometers (50 miles) to southwest of here. Police and army troops
surrounded the KLA stronghold Monday and demanded the village
surrender.
	   The Albanian center claimed Serb forces near Junik executed an
entire ethnic Albanian family of 20, including children, after they
had raised a white sheet as a sign of surrender. The report could
not be independently confirmed.
	   Albanian sources said one KLA member was killed and 15 wounded
in Junik. The Serbs suffered three dead, all policemen, the center
said. But the count appeared incomplete and could not be confirmed.
	   Serbian police estimate that there are about 2,000 people
trapped in Junik, including about 1,000 are ``highly trained'' KLA
troops. The rest are local residents and refugees who fled recent
fighting elsewhere.
	   The Serb center also said Yugoslav troops prevented a group of
KLA fighters from escaping into Albania about 90 kilometers (55
miles) southwest of here. The center said dozens of fighters
surrendered.
	   Meanwhile, ethnic Albanians said that KLA fighters Tuesday
ambushed a military convoy in a valley near the village Lapusnik,
25 kilometers (15 mile) west of Pristina.
	   The Albanian center said fighting was still raging and the Serbs
were suffering heavy losses.The report could not be confirmed.
	   Lapusnik is located near the main highway from Pristina to Pec,
Kosovo's second largest city 80 kilometers (50 miles) to the west.
Serb forces cleared the highway Monday and removed KLA barricades
erected in May.
	   Both Serb and Albanian sources reported KLA counterattacks
Tuesday in several areas near the road.

Israeli general: U.S. can still stop Iranian missile project
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's new chief of military intelligence
said Tuesday that Iran's missile program could still be halted if
the United States put more pressure on Russia to cut off funds
flowing to the Islamic Republic's military, an official said.
	   In his first appearance before the country's Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee, Maj. Gen. Amos Malka said ``There is still a
window of opportunity for the United States and the international
community to put pressure on Russia,'' according to an official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Last week, Iran test-fired a ballistic missile reportedly
capable of reaching Israel. Iran later confirmed that the Shihab-3
had been successfully tested, but said it is for purely defensive
purposes.
	   Russia has denied helping the Iranian missile project, but Malka
told the parliamentary committee Tuesday that without the aid of
Russian companies, Iran would never have gotten as far as it has
with the program. ``If the aid is cut off, the project could be
stopped, or at least delayed for many months,'' Malka was quoted as
saying.
	   Israel has long warned of Iran's rapidly advancing missile
capabilities and a nuclear weapons program. Malka said the
Shihab-3, which has a potential range of 800 miles (1,300 km.)
posed a new danger for the Jewish state.
	   Malka was quoted as telling the committee that Iran recently
stepped up the pace of its program for fear that Russia, under
pressure from the United States, would prevent Russian companies
from aiding the project.
	   Israeli Trade Minister Natan Sharansky last week asked U.S.
Vice-President Al Gore, who was visiting Moscow, to try harder to
prevent the transfer of the missile technology to Iran.

Debate rages over Barnes, Mitchell suspensions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS spelling of Reineri throughout. &QL; 
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ America's governing body for athletics is
incensed over the doping suspensions of shot putter Randy Barnes
and sprinter Dennis Mitchell by the IAAF.
	   ``USATF (USA Track and Field) is concerned and dismayed that the
IAAF chose to temporarily suspend two American athletes on the
basis of unproven allegations that they have committed a doping
offense,'' Craig Masback, executive director of organiztion, said
Monday night. ``USATF objects to the IAAF suspensions and will not
enforce them.
	   ``U.S. athletes are entitled to a full and fair hearing prior to
being declared ineligible to compete. USATF has on several
occasions informed the IAAF of its obligations under the (U.S.)
Amateur Sports Act. Therefore, we are outraged that the IAAF
knowingly breached our confidentiality rules, which were put in
place to protect those ultimately determined to be innocent.''
	   The U.S. Amateur Sports Act is a 20-year-old federal law that
governs ``amateur'' sports in the United States. The International
Amateur Athletic Federation disclosed the indefinite suspensions
Monday.
	   Masback said that Barnes and Mitchell would ``receive the full
support of USATF until such time as it is determined that they have
committed a doping offense.''
	   IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said Tuesday he could not comment
specifically on Masback's remarks. But he said IAAF rules could not
be adjusted for different national federations.
	   ``We know what the problems and laws are in the U.S.,'' Reineri
said. ``But we are the governing body for athletics for all
countries in the world, and we have to apply the rules for
everybody.''
	   He said it was now up to the U.S. federation to act on the
Barnes and Mitchell cases.
	   Barnes, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist and the world indoor and
outdoor record-holder, and Mitchell, the 1992 Olympic bronze
medalist in the 100 meters, were cited by the IAAF for failing
out-of-competition doping tests April 1.
	   Barnes, who could face a life suspension for a second offense,
was tested in Charleston, West Virginia, and Mitchell in
Gainesville, Florida.
	   Mitchell is president of USATF's Athletes Advisory Committee,
the athletes' voice in the national governing body, which has taken
a strong stance against doping.
	   His suspension was handed down last week and represents his
first doping offense.
	   The IAAF did not officially announce the suspensions, and the
precise terms of the punishment have yet to be determined.
	   These are two of the most prominent suspensions in athletics
following Ben Johnson at the 1988 Olympics, Butch Reynolds in 1990
and Mary Slaney in 1997.
	   Johnson was banned for life after two suspensions, but has
requested reinstatement. Reynolds served a 27-month suspension and
now is competing. Slaney was found innocent after several months
and also is running again.
	   The suspensions come at a time when IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch has suggested some performance-enhancing drugs be
stricken from the list of banned substances.
	   They also come as athletics in the United States is seeking to
regain its prestige and reputation but has had difficulty
attracting sponsors and television coverage.
	   To test an athlete for doping, the IAAF divides a urine sample
from the competitor into two. If the first sample is positive, the
second sample is tested to confirm the original result.
	   Reneiri said from Monaco that only the A sample from Barnes and
Mitchell have been tested. However, that is sufficient to levy a
suspension.
	   If the B samples are positive, the IAAF then rules on the
severity of the punishment pending a hearing by USATF. If the B
sample is negative, the athletes are cleared.
	   Barnes was first suspended for two years starting in 1991 for
the steroid methyltestosterone at a meet in Malmo, Sweden, in 1990.
This time, the substance is androstenedione, a banned nutritional
supplement.
	   Mitchell tested positive for excessive testosterone. If found
guilty following the B sample, he probably would receive a two-year
ban.
	   Reneiri did not know the testosterone level in Mitchell's
sample. The allowable ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone
(another natural substance) is 6:1. Anything above that level is
considered suspicious.
	   Mitchell's suspension was handed down last week, after he
finished fifth in the Goodwill Games 100 and ran on the winning
U.S. 400-meter relay team. If Mitchell is banned, he and the relay
team of Jon Drummond, Tim Harden and Maurice Greene would be
disqualified and forced to refund all prize money from the meet.
	   Mitchell was entered in the U.S. Open at Edwardsville, Illinois,
last Saturday night, but the IAAF would not allow him to compete.

Medical expert: Biggest growth in HIV cases in Moscow region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The virus that causes aids is spreading more
quickly in Moscow than in any other region of Russia, a medical
expert said Tuesday.
	   About 940 HIV-positive patients have been registered in Moscow
this year, up 229 over 1997, said Professor Vadim Pokrovsky, head
of the Russian Center for the Prevention and Treatment of AIDS. He
attributed the spread of the virus to increased drug use and to
prostitutes, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Growth has slowed in the four regions that previously topped the
HIV registries because prevention measures have gone into effect
and ``too many already are infected in those regions,'' Interfax
quoted Pokrovsky as saying.
	   The AIDS prevention center said that 8,956 HIV cases have been
registered in Russia since 1987, with 4,399 of the cases registered
last year alone and 1,932 new cases recorded already this year,
Interfax said. Of the 320 people in Russia suffering from
full-blown AIDS, 210 have died.
	   Russian officials have repeatedly warned that there may actually
be 10 times more HIV cases than officially recorded. The country
lacks comprehensive diagnostic and treatment programs.

 &UR; Palestinians, Israelis to resume peace talks Tuesday
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with talks underway; fresh Netanyahu comment,
INCORPORATES material from Israel-Poll; CHANGES byline
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israeli and Palestinian officials went
back to the negotiating table Tuesday to discuss the scope of a
long overdue Israeli troop withdrawal and an American peace plan to
get it off the ground.
	   But expectations for a breakthrough were low and a senior
Palestinian negotiator said before the talks began that reported
Israeli proposals were not acceptable.
	   Negotiating teams were meeting privately in Tel Aviv for the
first time after a week-long breakdown between the sides. The
Palestinians suspended talks July 15th after only three days,
saying Israel had offered no new ideas and was still rejecting the
U.S. peace initiative which calls for an Israeli withdrawal from an
additional 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Tuesday, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, told the
Voice of Palestine radio, that the Palestinians had agreed to
resume talks because Israeli negotiators had called and said they
wanted to ``present ideas.''
	   But Erekat called reported Israeli proposals for sharing
security control of a small area of the West Bank ``diversions.''
	   ``We will not take them seriously,'' Erekat said and reiterated
that the Palestinians would not consider any proposals that were
not in line with the U.S. initiative.
	   Israel has refused to accept the American plan, and talks have
been deadlocked for months.
	   A poll conducted by a Tel Aviv University think tank and
released Tuesday, found that support among Israeli Jews for a
Palestinian state has dropped in the past year. The survey,
conducted annually by the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies, also
found a decrease in the willingness of Israeli Jews to return land
for peace _ from 54 percent to 44 percent, although support
remained high _ 83 percent, compared to 89 percent in 1997 _ for
continuing peace talks with the Palestinians.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, speaking to
reporters in Tel Aviv, said he hoped Tuesday's talks would
``succeed in advancing the process one step forward.''
	   He said he would ``continue to meet with the Palestinian
Authority to make advancements.''
	   Israel has balked at turning over more than 10 percent more of
the West Bank to the Palestinians before a final peace settlement
is reached. But Israeli media reports said Israel was proposing
sharing security control with the Palestinians in another 3 percent
on land in the Judean Desert. Israel reportedly wants the land to
be a nature reserve where the Palestinians would be prohibited from
building _ an idea the Palestinians have rejected.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was ``working to
reach an agreement.'' ``We are considering different options,'' in
order to reach a deal, he told Israel TV.
	   Israeli legislators will vote Wednesday on a preliminary bill to
dissolve the Knesset. The bill, submitted by lawmakers from the
opposition Labor and Meretz parties, is a largely symbolic step to
protest Netanyahu's handling of the peace process. It would have to
pass three further readings _ each requiring an absolute majority
of 61 legislators _ to take effect.
	   On Monday, the Knesset passed a vote of no-confidence in the
government by a vote of 42 to 20, but failed to come up with the 61
votes required to bring down the government.

Palestinian security chief, in shift, takes tough anti-Hamas line
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with more Rajoub quotes on Netanyahu.
TRIMS. &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ Signaling new willingness to move
against Hamas, Yasser Arafat's chief enforcer scoffed Tuesday at
the Islamic group's spiritual leader and threatened to keep another
Hamas official in jail for years.
	   During a question-and-answer session with foreign news
organizations, Jibril Rajoub, head of Palestinian preventive
security in the West Bank, also called Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu a ``racist and a liar'' who is out for
bloodshed.
	   ``He is leading to war, but we are not afraid of war,'' Rajoub
told reporters in the West Bank town of Jericho. ``War would be on
both sides, not only in the Palestinian areas.''
	   Such harsh anti-Netanyahu rhetoric is not unusual from a
Palestinian official. Rajoub's comments on Hamas, though, could
mark a change of direction in dealing with the radical Islamic
group.
	   Israel demands that Arafat crack down on Hamas, but the
Palestinian leader, mindful of the group's popular following,
generally avoids direct confrontation with it.
	   But Rajoub's remarks, which almost certainly reflect the
thinking of Arafat and his inner circle, point to escalating
tensions between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas.
	   Hamas _ which opposes the Oslo peace accords and has staged
suicide attacks that have killed scores of Israelis _ came under
fire from Rajoub on several fronts during the wide-ranging
discussion with reporters.
	   He suggested the Palestinian Authority would make an example of
a top Hamas political leader, Abdel Aziz Rantisi, who was arrested
in April and charged with endangering national security after he
criticized Arafat.
	   Last month, the Palestinian Supreme Court ordered Rantisi
released for lack of evidence, but he remains in prison, with new
charges being prepared against him. Rajoub said he deserved to
spend 15 or 20 years in prison.
	   The Palestinian security chief also hit at another Hamas sore
point, saying a Hamas military activist would stand trial for the
slaying of the group's chief bomb-maker, Mohiyadine Sharif.
	   Sharif's mangled body was found March 29 at the scene of a
massive car-bomb blast in the West Bank town of Ramallah. Hamas
angrily denied the Palestinian Authority's claim that the
bomb-maker's death was the result of an internal feud.
	   Soon after the slaying, Palestinian police jailed Imad
Awadallah, a close Hamas associate of the slain man. Rajoub said
Awadallah had confessed to the killing and would be tried.
	   Also, in an unusual public criticism of Jordan, Rajoub accused
its government of allowing Hamas to use the neighboring state as a
staging ground.
	   ``The Jordanians adopted the Hamas leadership and provide the
facilities,'' he said. ``All (Hamas') financial support is in
Jordan _ the orders come from there.''
	   Rajoub's comments came at a delicate moment in efforts to
restart the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. During the 16-month
impasse, Netanyahu has incessantly criticized Arafat for failing to
take sufficient steps to fight terrorism.
	   Rajoub said sardonically that he wasn't ``looking for some
certification from Netanyahu'' on anti-Hamas efforts, but even so,
he took sharp aim at Yassin, the group's ailing, paralyzed
spiritual leader.
	   During a three-month fundraising tour of Arab states that ended
last month, Yassin repeatedly criticized Arafat's policies and
advocated a return to the armed Palestinian struggle.
	   In most explicit warning yet to Yassin from a top Palestinian
official, Rajoub said the sheik would not be allowed to assume too
much power.
	   ``I didn't take part in the national struggle for 18 years...to
see Sheik Ahmed Yassin leading the Palestinian people,'' he said.
``I don't think Palestinians want to live in an Islamic state.''

Police seize suspect medication from Bigmat team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with police searching TVM team hotel

<TEXT>
	   ALBERTVILLE, France (AP) _ A third team was caught up in the
drugs scandal dogging the Tour France, after police on Tuesday
seized suspect medication in a van driven by officials of the
Bigmat team.
	   The discovery came in Chambery, on the Franco-Swiss border near
Albertville, where the cyclists arrived Tuesday after the 16th
stage of the competition.
	   Around 100 doses of medication were found in briefcases among
the team's bags during a routine inspection by customs officials,
police said.
	   The drugs were sent to a police laboratory in the city of Lyon
for analysis, police said.
	   France Info radio, citing unidentified judicial sources,
reported that the medication was a banned substance.
	   Bigmat is the third team under scrutiny over allegations of drug
use.
	   Festina has been thrown out of the race for the use of EPO,
while officials from the Dutch TVM team are also being investigated
for supplying the banned doping substance.
	   Police on Tuesday night conducted a search of the TVM hotel in
Albertville at the request of an investigating judge. Officers
cordoned off the hotel, and could be seen searching through team
cars.
	   Two top TVM officials were placed under formal investigation by
French authorities Tuesday for the use of the performance-enhancing
drug EPO.
	   Sporting director Cees Priem and team doctor Andrei Mikhailov
are now likely to be formally charged.
	   TVM came under the spotlight when it emerged that EPO had been
found in the car of one of its officials in March.
	   Police then found evidence of used drugs in a suitcase and trash
can during a search of the team's hotel in Toulouse and Metz,
though the nature of the drugs is still not known.
	   Meanwhile, two former Festina cyclists, Emmanuel Magnien and
Gilles Bouvard, were released from police detention Tuesday, a day
after being held for questioning by Lille police.
	   ``There is no doubt that all the former cyclists at Festina will
be interrogated,'' said main prosecutor Gerald Vinsonneau.
	   Both cyclists raced for Festina in 1997, and ``recognized there
was doping during training,'' during interviews with police in
Lille, said the chief prosecutor for the town court, Gerald
Vinsonneau.
	   Neither of the cyclists, who now race for the Francaise des Jeux
and Casino teams respectively, is currently in the Tour.
	   Meanwhile, Bruno Roussel, Festina's sporting director, was
released from custody Tuesday. He has been held since July 17.
	   Festina physiotherapist Willy Voet was released Friday, but team
doctor Eric Ryckaert remains in custody.
	   Some Festina riders continue to deny ever taking EPO or other
illegal drugs.
	   ``Bruno Roussel never asked me if I wanted to take EPO under
medical control, and I maintain that I never took it,'' Richard
Virenque, the team's No. 1 cyclist, told investigating judge
Patrick Keil, according to Tuesday's edition of the newspaper L'Est
Republicain.
	   ``I never asked for doping products and I never needed them. I
have never taken amphetamines. I am going to follow the advice of
my lawyer and file a civil complaint,'' he said.

Drought killing Cuban crops; more than 500,000 need food aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The World Food Program warned Tuesday that
500,000 Cubans need emergency food aid after the worst drought in
40 years killed food crops in the east of the Carribean country.
	   Earlier this month, an interagency evaluation mission, organized
by the WFP, visited the five eastern provinces of Las Tunas,
Holguin, Granma, Santiago de Cuba and Guantanamo on the communist
island _ the Caribbean's biggest country.
	   ``During the visit, we determined that 539,000 people were
directly affected in these provinces as a consequence of reduced
food availability and lowered incomes,'' said Francisco Roque
Castro, WFP regional manager for Central America and the Caribbean,
who led the mission. ``Out of this total, 280,000 are agricultural
and livestock producers.''
	   WFP is processing an emergency operation to provide food rations
to more than 500,000 people for six months. Initial estimates put
the cost at dlrs 7 million.
	   Food production in the five provinces has dropped by 42 percent,
Roque said. Out of the 609,648 tons (553,000 metric tons) expected
to be produced, more than 259,000 tons (234,000 metric tons) were
lost, he said.

Asian nations seek more aid, end to standoff in Myanmar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new material, recasts; changes byline &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM RAUM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Strapped Asian nations sought more
assistance from wealthy countries on Tuesday as they wrapped up a
wide-ranging diplomatic conference. Participants also sought to end
a standoff in Myanmar.
	   The United States and key allies orchestrated an effort to
pressure Myanmar's military regime to end a highway impasse between
Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and security forces.
	   ``Aung San Suu Kyi should be able to travel freely in her own
country,'' said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. ``We hope
very much that there will be a resolution to the issue.''
	   In a tense conference, delegates from the United States, New
Zealand, Australia, Canada, Japan, South Korea, and the European
Union confronted Myanmar Foreign Minister Ohn Gayaw over the
crisis.
	   They also delegated U.S., Australian and Japanese diplomats in
the capital of the country formerly known as Burma to try to meet
with the democratic activist. She has been stuck on a rural Myanmar
highway surrounded by government security personnel since last
Friday.
	   The annual forum sponsored by the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations concluded with lighthearted skits _ including an
``East-West Story'' love duet by Albright and Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov and an Indian number poking fun at its
nuclear tests _ and a serious appeal for new financing and
investment for the region.
	   But the United States, Japan and other countries did not
announce any new aid packages and said that while they will
continue to help, Southeast Asian countries themselves must
persevere with painful political and economic reforms if they are
to recover.
	   ``Official assistance can help countries in this region get
through the worst days of the economic crisis,'' Albright said.
``But we also have to recognize that it is not going to solve the
deeper, long-term problems they face.''
	   China's representative, meanwhile, told the concluding session
of the ASEAN conference the region's economic crisis ``will stay at
a low ebb for a period of time.''
	   Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said Asia's recovery must come
from within for it to be lasting. He reiterated a Chinese pledge
not to devalue its currency.
	   The conference chairman, Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo
Siazon, said the rich countries had a ``paramount role'' in
restoring economic vibrancy to the region.
	   Siazon said the United States should increase its share of
funding to the International Monetary Fund. The IMF's reserves have
been depleted by bailouts of several Asian nations in the past
year. The Clinton administration's request for dlrs 18 billion for
the IMF has been languishing in Congress for months.
	   The highway standoff in Myanmar once again occupied much of the
discussions on the sidelines of the conference.
	   Suu Kyi has been stuck in her car and surrounded by government
security personnel since last Friday, when she was stopped on her
way to a meeting with supporters.
	   At the hastily arranged meeting on Tuesday to confront the
Myanmar foreign minister, ``a lot of pressure was exerted on the
leadership of Myanmar to change their ways, their policies,'' said
Wolfgang Schuessel, president of the European Council, the European
Union's policy-making body.
	   ``I hope this can have some impact,'' Schuessel added. ``The
blockade of Aung San Suu Kyi in the car is absolutely unbearable.''
	   Several participants voiced skepticism over claims by Cambodian
strongman Hun Sen that his ruling party had won a clear-cut victory
in Sunday's parliamentary elections.
	   ``The only thing we know for a fact is that the Cambodian people
voted in large numbers as they did in the previous election,''
Albright said.
	   In Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Hun Sen claimed a landslide victory in
parliamentary elections for his Cambodian People's Party, prompting
allegations of fraud by the opposition.
	   Albright told a news conference: ``I think it is premature for
anyone to declare major victory, because as far as I know not a
large percentage of the vote has been counted.''

Iraq says U.S., Britain blocking food and medicine contracts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq accused the United States and Britain
on Tuesday of blocking 33 contracts for food and medicine that are
part of a U.N. oil-for-food deal.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency said that dlrs 131 million in
contracts for powdered milk, rice, tea, eggs, cooking oil, wheat,
medicine and spare parts for the railways were being held up.
	   The agency said that Iraq has submitted 104 contracts under the
current six-month phase of the deal, but that only 31 have been
approved by the U.N. sanctions committee. The remaining 40
apparently are still under consideration.
	   The United States and Britain are members of the committee,
which must approve all of the Iraqi contracts.
	   ``The blocking of these contracts confirms that the U.S.
administration and its lackey, the British government, are
intensifying their anti-Iraq efforts,'' the spokesman said.
	   Iraq can export dlrs 5.2 billion in oil under the current phase
of the oil-for-food deal, which began in early June. The money from
the exports must be used to buy humanitarian goods.
	   The United Nations imposed sweeping trade sanctions against Iraq
after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The sanctions will only be lifted when U.N. arms inspectors
certify that Baghdad has eliminated its weapons of mass
destruction.

Experts say cancer treatment shows no evidence of cure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Clinical tests using a cocktail of hormones and
vitamins prescribed by an Italian doctor showed no evidence the
treatment cures cancer, medical experts said Tuesday.
	   The Di Bella treatment, named after Dr. Luigi Di Bella, who
developed it years ago and then lobbied the government for
permission to use it, was studied by doctors for the government's
health institute.
	   The study was carried out on 136 patients, or about a third of
those using the treatment on an experimental basis. In 75 percent
of the cases studied, the cancer worsened or the patient died, the
doctors found, according to the Italian news agency ANSA.
	   The final word is up to the minister of health, Rosy Bindy, who
suggested in a television interview that the government was
prepared to order a halt to the testing.
	   Earlier this year hundreds of cancer patients streamed to Di
Bella's office in the northern city of Modena for prescriptions,
and they and their relatives demonstrated in cities throughout
Italy to push for clinical trials.
	   The treatment centers on the natural hormone of somatostatin,
coupled with vitamin A derivatives.
	   In past months, the Italian doctor has traveled to Argentina and
Canada in search of sponsors, but came back to Italy after a panel
of Canadian doctors found little evidence that his treatment was
effective.

Israeli general: U.S. can still stop Iranian missile project
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's new chief of military intelligence
said Tuesday that Iran's missile program could still be halted if
the United States put more pressure on Russia to cut off funds
flowing to the Islamic Republic's military, an official said.
	   Appearing before a parliamentary committee, Maj. Gen. Amos Malka
said ``There is still a window of opportunity for the United States
and the international community to put pressure on Russia,''
according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Last week, Iran test-fired a ballistic missile reportedly
capable of reaching Israel. Iran later confirmed that the Shihab-3
had been successfully tested, but said it is for purely defensive
purposes.
	   Russia has denied helping the Iranian missile project, but Malka
told the committee Tuesday that without the aid of Russian
companies, Iran would never have gotten as far as it has with the
program. ``If the aid is cut off, the project could be stopped, or
at least delayed for many months,'' Malka was quoted as saying.
	   Israel has long warned of Iran's rapidly advancing missile
capabilities and a nuclear weapons program. Malka said the
Shihab-3, which has a potential range of 800 miles (1,300
kilometers), posed a new danger for the Jewish state.
	   Malka was quoted as telling the committee that Iran recently
stepped up the pace of its program for fear that Russia, under
pressure from the United States, would prevent Russian companies
from aiding the project.
	   Israeli Trade Minister Natan Sharansky last week asked U.S. Vice
President Al Gore, who was visiting Moscow, to try harder to
prevent the transfer of the missile technology to Iran.

For the first time, more U.N. civilians than military killed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ For the first time, more U.N. civilians
than U.N. military personnel are killed while performing their
duties, a U.N. spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Seventeen U.N. civilians have been killed so far this year _ the
same number killed all of last year. Thirteen U.N. military
personnel have been killed since January, compared with 44 last
year.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan called this year's high number of
civilian deaths, particularly in international aid programs, an
``alarming'' development. He has asked for a review of the security
of U.N. personnel, spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
	   ``We're placing civilians in more and more dangerous
situations,'' Annan told a high-level staff meeting Monday. ``This
is unacceptable,'' Eckhard quoted him as saying.
	   In the past two weeks, five U.N. civilians have been killed,
including an Italian working for the U.N. World Food Program who
was robbed and shot dead near his home in Burundi. Four members of
a U.N. observer team from Poland, Uruguay, Japan and Tajikistan
were ambushed and shot in their heads in Tajikistan.
	   Earlier this month in Afghanistan, the bodies of two kidnapped
Afghan nationals working for the United Nations were found near the
eastern city of Jalalabad.
	   General Assembly President Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine
expressed a ``renewed feeling of sadness, concern and outrage''
over the recent spate of killings in ``trouble spots'' around the
world.
	   ``Reports of attacks against international aid workers have
become almost routine, but there should be nothing routine in the
reponse of the international community to those heinous crimes,''
he said in a statement.
	   Eckhard said he was unsure how the development would influence
the recruitment of U.N. humanitarian workers.
	   ``I suspect that because of the high motivation factor of those
who work as humanitarian workers would mean that this would not
have a negative impact, but that's just speculation,'' he said.
	   The United Nations has made ongoing efforts to assess and reduce
risk to its personnel, especially since the Bosnian war and
peacekeeping efforts in Somalia, Eckhard said.
	   ``But despite that, the number of people killed this year is
alarmingly high,'' he said.
	   U.N. security wasn't to blame, Eckhard said. ``The risk of harm
in these missions has gotten unusually high.''

 &UR; Palestinians, Israelis to resume peace talks Tuesday
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATING with talks underway; fresh Netanyahu
comment, INCORPORATES material from Israel-Poll; CHANGES byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israeli and Palestinian officials went
back to the negotiating table Tuesday to discuss the scope of a
long overdue Israeli troop withdrawal and an American peace plan to
get it off the ground.
	   But expectations for a breakthrough were low and a senior
Palestinian negotiator said before the talks began that reported
Israeli proposals were not acceptable.
	   Negotiating teams were meeting privately in Tel Aviv for the
first time after a weeklong breakdown between the sides. The
Palestinians suspended talks July 15th after only three days,
saying Israel had offered no new ideas and was still rejecting the
U.S. peace initiative which calls for an Israeli withdrawal from an
additional 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told the Voice of
Palestine radio Tuesday that the Palestinians had agreed to resume
talks because Israeli negotiators had called and said they wanted
to ``present ideas.''
	   But Erekat called reported Israeli proposals for sharing
security control of a small area of the West Bank ``diversions.''
	   ``We will not take them seriously,'' Erekat said, and reiterated
that the Palestinians would not consider any proposals that were
not in line with the U.S. initiative.
	   Israel has refused to accept the American plan, and talks have
been deadlocked for months.
	   A poll conducted by a Tel Aviv University think tank and
released Tuesday found that support among Israeli Jews for a
Palestinian state has dropped in the past year. The survey,
conducted annually by the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies, also
found a decrease in the willingness of Israeli Jews to return land
for peace _ from 54 percent to 44 percent, although support
remained high _ 83 percent, compared to 89 percent in 1997 _ for
continuing peace talks with the Palestinians. The poll had a margin
of error was 2.8 percent.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, speaking in Tel
Aviv, said he hoped Tuesday's talks would ``succeed in advancing
the process one step forward.''
	   He said he would ``continue to meet with the Palestinian
Authority to make advancements.''
	   Israel has balked at turning over more than 10 percent more of
the West Bank to the Palestinians before a final peace settlement
is reached. But Israeli media reports said Israel was proposing
sharing security control with the Palestinians in another 3 percent
on land in the Judean Desert. Israel reportedly wants the land to
be a nature reserve where the Palestinians would be prohibited from
building _ an idea the Palestinians have rejected.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was ``working to
reach an agreement.'' ``We are considering different options,'' in
order to reach a deal, he told Israel TV.
	   Israeli legislators will vote Wednesday on a preliminary bill to
dissolve the Knesset. The bill, submitted by lawmakers from the
opposition Labor and Meretz parties, is a largely symbolic step to
protest Netanyahu's handling of the peace process. It would have to
pass three further readings _ each requiring an absolute majority
of 61 legislators _ to take effect.
	   On Monday, the Knesset passed a vote of no-confidence in the
government by a vote of 42-20, but failed to come up with the 61
votes required to bring down the government.

King Hussein says he has cancer, undergoing chemotherapy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ King Hussein told his people Tuesday that
he is undergoing treatment for lymphatic cancer and said he expects
to recover fully.
	   Hussein said he first received chemotherapy on Sunday and ``my
general condition is excellent, my mind is clear and my morale is
high.''
	   Hussein, who has been hospitalized in the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minnesota since July 14 spoke in a satellite interview
with Jordanian television.
	   Hussein, 62, spoke strongly in two interviews in Arabic and
English.
	   ``This is a new battle among the many battles and with God's
help, we will fully overcome this problem,'' Hussein said. He wore
a light-blue shirt and a dark-blue tie.
	   The clinic, in a statement released Tuesday, said Hussein has
lymphoma, or cancer of the lymphatic tissue, and ``this condition
is highly treatable with chemotherapy.''
	   It said Hussein will receive six chemotherapy treatments every
21 to 24 days. Each treatment will last four days.
	   The clinic said results of the first cycle of chemotherapy ``are
very encouraging.''
	   ``His temperature has returned to normal and the blood tests
show signs of significant improvement,'' the clinic said.
	   Hussein is the longest-reigning ruler in the Middle East. He is
due to celebrate 46 years on the throne in August 11.
	   Hussein underwent surgery to remove cancer from his ureter and
left kidney at the Mayo Clinic in 1992 and has had regular medical
checkups at the clinic since.
	   He had an operation in November 1997 to remove an inflamed lymph
gland that was found to be benign. In April 1997, he had surgery
for an enlarged prostate that also was benign.

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israeli and Palestinian officials went
back to the negotiating table Tuesday to discuss the scope of a
long overdue Israeli troop withdrawal and an American peace plan to
get it off the ground.
	   But expectations for a breakthrough were low and a senior
Palestinian negotiator said before the talks began that reported
Israeli proposals were not acceptable.
	   Negotiating teams met for three hours privately in Tel Aviv for
the first time after a week-long breakdown between the sides. The
Palestinians suspended talks July 15th after only three days,
saying Israel had offered no new ideas and was still rejecting the
U.S. peace initiative which calls for an Israeli withdrawal from an
additional 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Israel radio reported that the sides would meet again Thursday.
	   Tuesday, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, told the
Voice of Palestine radio, that the Palestinians had agreed to
resume talks because Israeli negotiators had called and said they
wanted to ``present ideas.''
	   But Erekat called reported Israeli proposals for sharing
security control of a small area of the West Bank ``diversions.''
	   ``We will not take them seriously,'' Erekat said and reiterated
that the Palestinians would not consider any proposals that were
not in line with the U.S. initiative.
	   Israel has refused to accept the American plan, and talks have
been deadlocked for months.
	   A poll conducted by a Tel Aviv University think tank and
released Tuesday, found that support among Israeli Jews for a
Palestinian state has dropped in the past year. The survey,
conducted annually by the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies, also
found a decrease in the willingness of Israeli Jews to return land
for peace _ from 54 percent to 44 percent, although support
remained high _ 83 percent, compared to 89 percent in 1997 _ for
continuing peace talks with the Palestinians.
	   The poll had a margin of error was 2.8 percent.

Pantani still in yellow after Ullrich challenge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Optional lead
 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALBERTVILLE, France (AP) _ Jan Ullrich did everything he could
to defend his Tour de France title. However, at the end of the 16th
stage, he was only a fraction ahead of rival Marco Pantani.
	   And after their thrilling head-to-head that lasted more than 90
minutes, Ullrich practically conceded his title to Pantani.
	   ``I tip my hat to him. He's the winner of the next Tour de
France,'' Ullrich said.
	   But Pantani was cautious: ``The Tour is not finished yet,'' he
said.
	   At the end of the 204 kilometers (127 miles), Ullrich edged
Pantani by less than 5 centimeters (2 inches) for the stage
victory. Pantani held on to the leader's yellow jersey and Ullrich
re-established himself after a poor day on Monday.
	   ``I wanted to show I was still here,'' Ullrich said. ``It was
important for the future.''
	   ``I tried to stay with him but he deserved the victory today,''
Pantani said.
	   Ullrich did most of the work, trying to break Pantani. He wanted
to cut a the gap that Pantani built Monday when Ullrich lost nearly
nine minutes to the Italian during the day.
	   The real racing happened over the last 60 kilometers (37 miles)
which they did together with no other riders in sight.
	   First up most of the 20-kilometer (12.5 mile) Madeleine peak.
Then the last 40 kilometers (25 miles) downhill at speeds
approaching 100 kph (61 mph).
	   Only on the final flat of more than 10 kilometers (6 miles) did
Pantani share pace-setting chores with Ullrich to maintain their
gap over the others.
	   ``It was difficult today,'' Pantani said. ``Jan was very strong.
After his bad day yesterday (Monday) he made a different race
today.''
	   In the final stretch both sprinted and Ullrich came out ahead
but just barely over Pantani.
	   American Bobby Julich, who was in second entering the day to
Pantani, was dropped by the two on the final climb. He managed to
finish 1 minute 49 seconds behind to hold onto second place overall
by 14 seconds over Ullrich.
	   He was third on the day, coming in in the group with Fernando
Escartin of Spain.
	   Julich now trails Pantani by 5:42 in the overall standings with
Ullrich now at 5:56.
	   ``I struggled a little on the Madeleine. Then I was cramping on
the downhill but I pushed the pace at the end to save my second,''
Julich said.
	   At the beginning of the day he had led Ullrich by 2:03. At one
point he was trailing Ullrich by more than 2:10 but cut the gap to
conserve second place.
	   Tuesday's stage had five climbs but all were between 950 meters
(3,106 feet) and 2,000 meters (6,540 feet). In contrast to the wet
conditions Monday, it was sunny nearly the entire way.
	   Ullrich made a bold move on the final climb. He was trying to
cut the gap to have a chance in Saturday's time trial to hold on to
the title.
	   In the last time trial, Ullrich gained 4:21 over Pantani. In
last year's final time trial, Ullrich gained nearly four minutes.
	   But after he failed to gain any seconds on Pantani Tuesday,
Ullrich thinks it will be hard to overtake Pantani.
	   ``I didn't think that Marco was able to win here after the Tour
of Italy,'' Ullrich said. ``I didn't think he was in good shape.''
	   France's Stephane Heulot and Germany's Rolf Aldag built up a
lead of more than six minutes enterng the final climb up the
Madelaine peak.
	   But midway up Ullrich looked around then broke away from the
small group of favorites. Only Pantani followed.
	   For the rest of the climb it was Ullrich looking straight ahead
with Pantani riding just behind the German's back wheel.
	   By the top they had passed Aldag and Heulot and built up about
two minutes on the group that included Julich and Escartin, third
entering the day.
	   Then came the downhill ride and Ullrich's final lunge for his
fifth stage victory in the Tour de France.
	   Wednesday's 17th stage is the last full day in the Alps from
Albertville to Aix les Bains, 149 kilometers (92.6 miles) with
three climbs but ending with a long downhill.
	   The Tour ends Sunday.

Mantilla, Kucera and Slovene Urh move to the second round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UMAG, Croatia (AP) _ Second seed Felix Mantilla of Spain, the
defending champion, moved Tuesday into the second round of the dlrs
400,000 Croatia Open Umag tournament, defeating Lars Burgsmuller of
Germany, 6-3, 6-3.
	   Also advancing were Karol Kucera of Slovakia, seeded third,
fourth-seeded Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil, but also Slovene Borut
Urh, a rare showing in an ATP tournament.
	   Mantilla started with a 4-2 advantage, but Burgsmuller broke to
4-3.
	   The Spaniard then easily made it 6-3 and 5-0 in the second set.
But here, he lost his serve twice, and in the end had to fight much
harder than anyone thought to overcome Burgsmuller, the ATP's No.
143.
	   ``I sort of got relaxed at 5-0,'' Mantilla said afterward.
``I'll have to think about it and when I come to a 5-0 next time, I
have to win 6-0, not 6-3.''
	   Kucera, ATP's No. 11 and last week's finalist in Stuttgart,
ousted Sergi Bruguera, 6-4, 6-0.
	   Bruguera started better, led 3-0, but Kucera turned the tables
on the much more experienced Spaniard.
	   The crucial moment came in the first set, at 5-4 and 40-0 for
Bruguera: Kucera served, won the game and then did not lose another
game until the end of the match. Bruguera, a two-time French Open
finalist, is now ranked 78th in ATP.
	   Brazil's Gustavo Kuerten defeated Marc-Kevin Goellner of
Germany, 6-0, 7-6 (7-3). He started winning seven games. Goellner
recovered and managed to balance play. Still, Kuerten broke for 4-2
in the tie-breaker and continued to play well, not giving Goellner
a real chance.
	   Borut Urh of Slovenia, the world's No. 391, gave himself a nice
present on his 24th birthday _ a 5-7, 6-4, 6-3 victory over Stefano
Cobolli of Italy.
	   Also moving to the second round were Jordi Burillo of Spain,
Bohdan Ulihrach of the Czech Republic and Adrian Voinea of Romania.

Fujimori marks eight years in power with promise to fight poverty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP photo LIM103

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ With his popularity hurt by poverty and
economic discontent, President Alberto Fujimori on Tuesday used his
key Independence Day speech to promise to help Peru's poor
majority.
	   In his annual address to the nation given in Congress, Fujimori
did not say whether he would run for a third consecutive term in
office from 2000, the question in most people's minds.
	   Opposition legislators held up signs saying ``No to Fraud!'' in
reference to what they charged was Fujimori's intention to
circumvent a constitutional ban on his candidacy and illegally run
again.
	   Fujimori has not said whether he will run again.
	   ``In the two years that remain (in his government), I will work
to fight poverty, create jobs, overcome our border problem with
Ecuador and combat drug trafficking,'' Fujimori said.
	   Tuesday marked not only the 177th anniversary of Peru's
Independence and his eighth year in power, but was Fujimori's 60th
birthday.
	   Fujimori, known for his authoritarian leadership style, boasted
that his government has brought economic stability and growth to
Peru, ending inflation that had topped 7000 percent and attracting
foreign investment.
	   But he admitted that this high growth had not succeeded in
reducing poverty, which still affects one in two Peruvians.
	   ``The positive economic indicators we have known have not
succeeded in reversing a recurrent problem: poverty,'' he said.
	   He gave few details on how he would reduce poverty and reassured
foreign investors that he would not change the free market economic
reforms that have transformed Peru's once-statist economy.
	   Instead, he asked Peruvians to have patience while the program
created jobs. He promised to eliminate various taxes on businesses
in the coming months, hoping to spur job creation.
	   Popular reaction to the brief, uneventful speech was largely
negative.
	   ``He didn't announce any new jobs or pay raises. The economic
crisis continues; so what does it matter what he said?'' said
Javier Puertas, a former accountant who sells children's books
door-to-door since losing his job.
	   Fujimori's popularity, which topped 80 percent in 1992, has
fallen to 31 percent, according to a poll by the private poll
Apoyo.
	   ``The main concerns of Peruvians are jobs and poverty, which
have become Fujimori's main political weak points,'' said Apoyo
analyst Guillermo Loli.
	   Apoyo polled 510 Lima residents on July 18, 19 with a margin for
error of 4 percent.

	   MURCIA, Spain (AP) _ An explosion rocked a Spanish gun shop
Tuesday, setting it ablaze and injuring two people, the Red Cross
said.
	   Thick black smoke billowed into the air after the blast in the
center of this southeastern coastal town.
	   The explosion touched off a series of smaller detonations from
ammunition and other material, a Red Cross spokesman said.
	   Two people were hospitalized with minor injuries _ a man who was
inside the shop and another who lived in an apartment above it.
	   Firefighters extinguished the blaze, the spokesman said.
	   The cause of the explosion was not known.

Tugs extract cargo ship stuck in mud in Lisbon port
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with ship freed from mud

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Tugboats aided by a rising tide Tuesday
freed a Cypriot cargo ship that ran aground in Lisbon port during a
harbor pilots' strike.
	   The 35,000-ton freighter, Ioannis M, got stuck on a mudbank
Monday as it maneuvered without the usual help of harbor pilots who
guide ships into port.
	   A first attempt to free it failed early Tuesday. After a crane
lifted most of the ship's cargo of soya onto two barges to lighten
its weight and increase buoyancy, tugs successfully dragged it to
the quay during the evening high tide.
	   The incident sharpened the dispute between the pilots and the
government, which has refused to negotiate and last week scrapped a
law requiring ships' captains to hire a pilot.
	   The striking pilots warned that the stranded vessel's fuel tanks
could crack open and spew oil into the Tagus estuary.
	   Portugal's harbor pilots began their 14-day strike on July 21,
initially choking the flow of imports and exports by sea. The
repeal of the law forcing captains to hire pilots has since allowed
most ships to enter the country's ports unassisted.
	   The harbor pilots are demanding a pay hike, a risk bonus and the
right to set their own working conditions.
	   Following widespread allegations of corruption among harbor
pilots, the government this year placed them under the supervision
of the port authorities _ a move resisted by the pilots.
	   More than 90 percent of the country's 80 harbor pilots are under
investigation for corruption, extortion and criminal association,
according to the government.

Rights group condemns Sierra Leone rebel atrocities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Rebel soldiers and armed militiamen
are terrorizing the countryside of Sierra Leone, maiming, raping
and murdering their victims, a human rights groups said Tuesday.
	   It's been six months since Sierra Leone's military government
was driven from power, but renegade soldiers allied with the old
regime continue to run amok in the eastern region near the border
with Liberia.
	   ``What's happening in Sierra Leone today is so gruesome it
defies imagination,'' said Peter Takiambudde, the Africa director
for the New York-based Human Rights Watch.
	   In a report issued Tuesday, the human rights group condemned the
continued attacks on civilians in that West African country and
urged the international community to do more to bring a halt to the
seemingly random violence.
	   Thousands of civilians, including many woman and children, have
been killed or mutilated by forces loyal to an alliance of rebels
linked to Sierra Leone's former military junta, the Human Rights
Watch report said.
	   ``With no recognizable political platform, the (rebels) are
committing widespread and egregious atrocities against unarmed
civilians in an attempt to regain power,'' said Takiambudde, citing
the Human Rights Watch study.
	   Perhaps thousands more have been abducted by the rebels, the
report said.
	   A West African coalition army led by Nigeria drove Lt. Col.
Johnny Koroma's military junta from power in February, but has yet
to curb rebel fighting.
	   The coalition force, known as ECOMOG, cleared the way for the
return of Sierra Leone's elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
	   The Human Rights Watch report, however, also accused Kabbah's
forces of abuses, including extrajudicial killings and torture.
	   ``Demobilizing soldiers in this conflict is key,'' Takiambudde
said. ``The United Nations is going to have to pay particular
attention to human rights in order for that process to be
successful.''
	   The United Nations recently voted to send military observers to
Sierra Leone to help disarm warring factions.

director and cyclists.

<TEXT>
	   ALBERTVILLE, France (AP) _ A third team was caught up in the
drugs scandal dogging the Tour France, after police on Tuesday
seized suspect medication in a van driven by officials of the
Bigmat team.
	   The discovery came in Chambery, on the Franco-Swiss border near
Albertville, where the cyclists arrived Tuesday after the 16th
stage of the competition.
	   Around 100 doses of medication were found in briefcases among
the team's bags during a routine inspection by customs officials,
police said.
	   The drugs were sent to a police laboratory in the city of Lyon
for analysis, police said.
	   France Info radio, citing unidentified judicial sources,
reported that the medication was a banned substance.
	   Bigmat is the third team under scrutiny over allegations of drug
use.
	   Festina has been thrown out of the race for the use of EPO,
while officials from the Dutch TVM team are also being investigated
for supplying the banned doping substance.
	   Police on Tuesday night conducted a search of the TVM hotel in
Albertville at the request of an investigating judge.
	   After cordoning off the hotel, the officers left with the team's
sporting director, Hendrick Redant, and four cyclists, some of whom
covered their faces with coats. Police also left with bags
containing medication.
	   A police official at the scene, who requested anonymity, said
the cyclists would undergo medical tests at a local hospital.

kept alive the humor of a hot, dry, unforgiving Texas.
	   No one knows any longer where most of the tall tales originated,
but they live on, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram noted.
	   The stories bear retelling in the current heat wave _ on
Tuesday, temperatures in north Texas reached triple digits for the
23rd consecutive day.
	   During a particularly dry spell, legend has it, a sad Texan once
prayed, ``I wish it would rain _ not so much for me, I've seen it _
but for my 7-year-old.''
	   Some responses to heat gleaned from Texas folklore:
	   _ It was so dry that the trees were whistlin' for the dogs.
	   _ It was so dry that the cows were giving evaporated milk.
	   A visitor to Texas once asked, ``Does it ever rain out here?''
	   ``Yes, it does,'' a rancher replied. ``Do you remember that part
in the Bible when it rained for 40 days and 40 nights?''
	   ``Yes, I'm familiar with Noah's flood,'' the visitor said.
	   ``Well,'' the rancher said, ``we got two and a half inches
during that spell.''
	   Elmer Kelton wrote in ``The Time It Never Rained,'' a novel
about the 1950s drought: ``During the long Texas drought of the
1950s a joke _ probably already as old as the state _ was told
again and again about a man who bet several of his friends that it
never would rain again, and collected from two of them.''

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Tugboats aided by a rising tide Tuesday
freed a Cypriot cargo ship that ran aground in Lisbon port during a
harbor pilots' strike.
	   The 35,000-ton freighter, Ioannis M, got stuck on a mudbank
Monday as it maneuvered without the usual help of harbor pilots who
guide ships into port.
	   A first attempt to free it failed early Tuesday. After a crane
lifted most of the ship's cargo of soya onto two barges to lighten
its weight and increase buoyancy, tugs successfully dragged it to
the quay during the evening high tide.

Supreme Court rejects strip clubs' bid to halt NYC porn crackdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL BLOOD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The U.S. Supreme Court Tuesday refused to halt
New York's crackdown on strip clubs and smut shops, leaving X-rated
businesses two choices: close down or cover up.
	   Attorneys for the clubs had asked the court last week to suspend
zoning rules that will exile most sex-oriented businesses to the
gritty, industrial fringes of New York. But after a series of lower
courts sided unanimously with the city, the high court declined to
step in.
	   The regulations prohibit sex-oriented theaters, bookstores,
massage parlors and dance clubs from operating within 500 feet (150
meters) of houses, houses of worship, schools or one another. City
officials estimate that in coming months, 144 clubs and shops will
be forced to close or change the way they do business.
	   In recent days, dancers in some clubs have started wearing
bikinis or T-shirts. Merchants have been adding non-porn keychains
and coffee mugs to their stocks of X-rated videotapes in a hope
that city inspectors will look the other way.

Croatia requests extradition of WW II camp commander's wife
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia has asked Argentina to extradite
Nada Sakic, the wife of the commander of Croatia's worst World War
II concentration camp, Croatian state television reported late
Tuesday.
	   The commander, Dinko Sakic, was previously extradited and is
already in Croatian custody.
	   In its extradition request, the Croatian Ministry of Justice
said Nada Sakic is wanted here on suspicion of crimes against
humanity.
	   The 76-year-old Sakic, also known as Esperanza, is believed to
have run a female block at the Stara Gradiska camp, a part of the
Jasenovac concentration camp when she was only 16.
	   Tens of thousands of Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and insurgent Croats
were killed at Jasenovac, the worst of more than 20 concentration
camps run by Croatia's World War II Nazi puppet state.
	   Last Friday, Sakic was arrested in Argentina, where she and her
husband lived since the end of the war, following an extradition
request from Yugoslavia, which has filed charges of genocide
against her.
	   Croatia apparently moved to request Nada Sakic's extradition to
prevent her from being tried in Serb-dominated Yugoslavia, where
she would face a much tougher trial. The majority of Jasenovac
victims were Serbs.
	   On Saturday, the district attorney in Zagreb requested a
criminal investigation against Nada Sakic, saying she is suspected
of ``torturing ... inmates in the camp of Stara Gradiska in
1942-45, which led to the death of a large, so far unknown number
of persons.''
	   The district attorney's office also recommended she be jailed
upon arrival to Croatia.
	   Dinko Sakic, 76, who reportedly ran Jasenovac, was extradited
from Argentina in June on suspicions of war crimes committed
against civilians.
	   The ongoing criminal investigation against him is expected to
lead to an indictment and eventual trial.

Gianetti to testify before Swiss court over doping claims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss cyclist Mauro Gianetti is to
testify before a court in Lausanne over claims that he was
hospitalized after taking a drug, a judicial official said Tuesday.
	   The hearing, due in the next few days, follows a claim by two
doctors, Gerald Gremion and Jean-Pierre Randin, that Gianetti's
life was in danger after he took PFC, a hemoglobin which speeds up
oxygen intake, during last May's Tour de Romandie race in
Switzerland. Gianetti denies the allegations.
	   Magistrate Nicolas Cruchet said there was enough information in
the doctors' submission to open an inquiry, but gave no further
details.
	   The investigation is to establish whether any injuries were
caused, intentionally or by negligence, and whether anyone's life
was endangered. No accusations have been made against any named
person or entity.
	   Three teams in this year's Tour de France have come under
scrutiny over allegations of drug use. The Festina team was thrown
out of the race for the use of the performance-enhancing drug EPO.
	   Gremion, who was doctor to Swiss teams PMU Romand and Swiss
Port, has said he believes 99 percent of Tour de France cyclists
used performance-enhancing drugs.

Parnevik believes Swede will win Scandinavian Masters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Jesper Parnevik says a Swede is likely
to win the Scandinavian Masters _ and he doesn't necessarily mean
himself.
	   ``There are lot of good Swedes. Joakim Haeggman won last year
and Patrik Sjoland has played extremely well. He's my hottest
tip,'' Parnevik, the crowd favorite, told the Swedish news agency
TT.
	   Sjoland won the Italian Open and placed ninth at the Dutch Open
last Sunday. It was the seventh time this season the 27-year-old
finished among the top ten.
	   Justin Rose, the English teen-ager who many are comparing to
Tiger Woods after tying for fourth in the British Open, is making
his second pro start.
	   ``Tiger Woods was unique as an amateur and has blossomed into a
full-grown pro. Justin Rose has had one good tournament and done
marvelously well. He has to do more good results before one can
judge if the British Open was a one-time occasion.'' Parnevik said.
``Then we'll have to see if he can handle the pressure from
sponsors who want results.''
	   Other entries in the tournament are England's Lee Westwood, who
won the 1996 tournament for his first tour title.
	   Westwood has three victories this year and also won the PGA
Tour's Freeport-McDermott Classic. He tops the European tour money
list with total earnings of dlrs 970,593.
	   Parnevik, 33, won the 1995 tournament at the Barseback course in
Malmoe, to become the first Swedish player to win a European tour
event in Sweden.
	   At the recent British Open he placed fourth with Rose.
	   ``I felt like I had a great chance to win this year, greater
than last year. No one outpaced the rest during the final day and
there were chances, but it just didn't gel,'' Parnevik said.
	   On Monday, Parnevik played an exhibition game against LPGA Tour
regular Catrin Nilsmark. He lost by one stroke. It was his first
golf game in 14 days, but come Thursday he expected to be ready for
battle.
	   ``It will be a big event and lots of spectators. So the energy
will flow.''
	   The course at Kungsangen has been partly designed by Swedish pro
Anders Forsbrand. The purse is worth dlrs 1.32 million, the
winner's share is dlrs 219,195.

EU's External Affairs commissioner pledges more aid to Serbs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Hans van den Broek, the
European Union's external affairs commissioner, Tuesday promised
more financial assistance to the moderate Bosnian Serb leadership.
	   Earlier in the day, Van den Broek also made a trip to the
eastern Bosnian Serb town of Bijeljina, where he announced a number
of additional programs that have been allocated now also for the
eastern part of the Bosnian Serb half of Bosnia.
	   The east of the Republic Srpska, as the Serb half of Bosnia is
called, will now also see European Union programs in the
agricultural field.
	   ``I told (Bosnian Serb) President (Biljana) Plavsic that
tomorrow in the European Commission we will decide to release
another 15 million ECU for infrastructure, rehabilitation and
reconstruction,'' Van den Broeck told reporters after meetings in
Banja Luka.
	   ``On the whole, we can say that the programs that are under
preparation or implementation amount now for (Republic) Srpska to
over ... 130 million ECU, humanitarian assistance not included,''
he said.
	   He also expressed satisfaction with progress achieved so far in
the Bosnian Serb part of the country.
	   Plavsic told reporters that Serbs in Bosnia must also ``accept
European standards'' regarding reforms and development projects.

U.N. human rights chief urges end to Myanmar standoff
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. human rights chief urged
Myanmar's military government and Aung San Suu Kyi on Tuesday to
settle their differences as the pro-democracy activist spent a
fifth day in her car surrounded by security officials.
	   The impasse is latest in what appears to be ``a developing
pattern of restriction of the rights to freedom of movement and to
freedom of association of Mrs. Suu Kyi'' and members of her party,
said Mary Robinson, high commissioner for human rights.
	   Local authorities stopped Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel
Peace Prize, Friday morning on a rural road 32 kilometers (19
miles) outside of Yangon, halfway on her journey to Bassein to meet
members of her political party, the National League for Democracy.
They refused to let her proceed, and she has refused to return to
Yangon.
	   Robinson urged the two sides ``to resolve the current standoff
peacefully and quickly.''
	   ``There are legitimate concerns about Mrs. Suu Kyi's health and
security,'' Robinson said in a statement.
	   A government officer has said he believed Suu Kyi had enough
food and water to spend a week in the car. The government has
called the episode a publicity stunt.
	   Robinson called on the government ``to guarantee the rights of
freedom of movement and association of all citizens and to
accelerate the process of national reconciliation leading to the
enjoyment of all human rights.''
	   The impasse is latest in what appears to be ``a developing
pattern of restriction of the rights to freedom of movement and to
freedom of association of Mrs. Suu Kyi'' and members of her party,
Robinson said.
	   Myanmar's current regime came to power in 1988 after violently
crushing a nationwide democracy uprising. It ignored the results of
a 1990 election Suu Kyi's party won by a landslide.
	   Suu Kyi has been traveling to tell party members not to obey a
military order to report to authorities twice a day under the
``Habitual Offenders Act,'' a law reserved for those considered
heinous criminals by the government.
	   In her battle to bring democracy to Myanmar, also known as
Burma, Suu Kyi has tried three times in recent weeks to break away
from her military security detail and drive out to the provinces to
meet supporters. She has been stopped by the government each time.
	   On Tuesday in Manila, Philippines, a group of Asian nations and
their allies orchestrated an effort to pressure Myanmar's military
regime to end the highway impasse.

Saudi Arabia, Yemen agree to evacuate border areas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Saudis, Yemenis agreeing to evacuate border
areas &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal
held talks in Yemen Tuesday on a border conflict and the two sides
agreed to evacuate areas that are under dispute, a Saudi official
said.
	   Yemen has long contested Saudi Arabia's claim to three Red Sea
islands, as well as parts of the Empty Quarter, a vast desert with
potentially lucrative oil fields.
	   Saudi forces killed three Yemeni guards last week on the
disputed Red Sea island of Duwaima. Saudi Arabia said its forces
fired in self-defense.
	   The official Saudi Press Agency said Yemeni President Ali
Abdullah Saleh on Tuesday ``renewed his country's keenness to find
a final and acceptable solution to the border issue through common
understanding.''
	   Prince Saud returned to Saudi Arabia late Tuesday.
	   A Saudi official in Jiddah said the two countries would evacuate
disputed areas until a solution was found. The official spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Yemen has accused Saudi Arabia of setting up military posts in
disputed areas and claims Saudi border guards have entered Yemeni
territory and fired at Yemeni forces and civilians.
	   In 1995, Saudi Arabia sent 20,000 troops and hundreds of tanks
across the frontier before Syrian mediation secured a cease-fire
and withdrawal.
	   The two countries share a 2,000-kilometer (1,300-mile) frontier.

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Rod Laver was conscious and off the critical
list Tuesday, a day after he had a stroke while being interviewed
for a television show.
	   The tennis great, who turns 60 on Aug. 9, was in serious
condition in the intensive care unit at UCLA Medical Center.
	   Several family members waiting to visit Laver refused comment,
referring all questions to the hospital.
	   Laver, an Australian who lives in nearby Newport Beach, is the
only tennis player to win two Grand Slams _ as an amateur in 1962
and as a professional seven years later.
	   ESPN spokesman Rob Tobias said Laver was stricken Monday
afternoon during an interview by a freelance crew at the Westwood
Marquis Hotel near UCLA. The ESPN special will feature the
century's greatest athletes.
	   ``As soon as the crew saw there was a problem, they sought
prompt medical attention,'' Tobias said. ``Fortunately, UCLA
Medical Center is located within a couple blocks of where the
interview was being taped.''
	   Laver, a redheaded left-hander, is one of the giants of his
sports.
	   Nicknamed ``Rocket'' for his powerful ground strokes, he is the
only player to have won two Grand Slams _ the Australian Open,
French Open, All-England (Wimbledon) and U.S. Open titles in one
calendar year.
	   He was the world's No. 1 player in 1961, 1962, 1968 and 1969,
and was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in
1981.
	   Laver won 11 Grand Slam singles titles _ one fewer than all-time
leader Roy Emerson. Bjorn Borg and Pete Sampras have also won 11
Grand Slam events.
	   Laver won four Wimbledons, three Australian Open titles, two
U.S. Open championships and two French Open crowns. He also won
nine Grand Slam doubles championships.
	   During his 23-year career, Laver won 47 pro singles titles and
was runner-up 22 times. He also starred for Australia in the Davis
Cup, with records of 16-4 in singles and 4-0 in doubles. During one
stretch, Australia won the Davis Cup 15 times in 18 years.

UEFA Cup: 0-0 in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Sarajevo and Germinal Ekeren
played to a listless 0-0 draw Tuesday, but the visiting Belgians
advanced to the next round of the UEFA Cup tournament on the
strength of a 4-1 victory at home.
	   It was Sarajevo's chance to play in an international tournament
for the first time in years because the 3 1/2-year war that was
over in e 1995 had abruptly ended all national and international
sports activities.
	   That's why the young team with no international experience did
not take the loss too seriously.
	   ``If we don't make it, it won't be a tragedy. These are pioneer
steps of this generation into European soccer,'' the leadership of
the team wrote in a statement to local media on Tuesday.
	   The fans didn't seem to mind either. Those 15,000 at the stadium
continued dancing and supporting their team till the last minute of
the game.
	   Of those who decided to watch the match on TV, many switched to
satellite TV, although they could not understand the
English-speaking commentator. They were simply delighted seeing a
Bosnian TV appear on Eurosport.

Food pours into southern Sudan, but the starving keep dying

<TEXT>
	   AJIEP, Sudan (AP) _ Another baby dies, and another mother cries
out in the steamy night. For Chok Abiei Kueth, the screams are all
in a day's work.
	   He buries the dead for a living, a busy job in southern Sudan,
devastated by war and famine. He used to trade tea, when there was
still a market for such goods.
	   Relief food is pouring into southern Sudan in
multimillion-dollar air drops _ the world's largest relief
operation. But starving Sudanese, in conditions so desperate that
mothers stare at their skeletal children in horrified disbelief,
are still dying by the thousands.
	   Why is the food aid not helping? Why did it take so long to get
here? And why is nothing being done to stop the 15-year civil war
that has created yet another famine in Africa's largest country?
	   An estimated 1.5 million people have died in the civil war, and
the arable land lies fallow. Ongoing violence keeps farmers from
their fields.
	   The United Nations and individual governments condemn the
endless killing and call for emergency food relief for an estimated
2.6 million people in rebel- and government-held areas of Sudan.
But those with influence don't seem able or willing to end the war.
	   Aid agencies can only deal with the war's effects.
	   The U.N. World Food Program is air-dropping 9,500 tons of food
per month _ at a cost of dlrs 30 million _ into southern Sudan in
the world's largest aid operation.
	   Earlier this month, WFP director Catherine Bertini urged the
international community to stop the Sudan war. On Wednesday, she
will address the issue again before a U.S. congressional committee.
	   ``We recognize we have an advocacy responsibility on behalf of
people ... to blow the bells and whistles to alert others to
respond,'' said Michael Sackett, WFP's eastern Africa regional
manager.
	   ``In the meantime we do the best possible job, short-term and
Band-Aid though it is.''
	   The United States, which tacitly supports the Sudan People's
Liberation Army in its fight against Sudan's Islamic government, is
the largest donor, with dlrs 75 million in contributions this year.
	   Late last year, WFP estimated 250,000 people in southern Sudan
would need food aid by spring because of poor harvests.
	   But in January, a failed attack by SPLA forces on Wau, the
government-held capital of Bahr el-Ghazal province, resulted in
widespread looting of food stocks and a government ban on further
relief flights into the area.
	   An estimated 100,000 people fled Wau, abandoning fields that
could have provided food.
	   It took two months of behind-the-scenes negotiations before
relief flights could resume. By then, famine had set in.
	   ``Why do governments support the SPLA for years and not respond
to a humanitarian crisis?'' lamented WFP spokeswoman Michele
Quintaglie.
	   At a feeding center in Ajiep, flooded with 70,000 people fleeing
the wretchedness of war and hunger, death is never far away.
	   People so thin their bodies already appear mummified lie naked
on mats in the compound, flies swarming above them. Mothers curl
their long narrow frames around infants who reach painfully for
sagging, empty breasts.
	   Relief food seems to be fueling the war. And while everyone is
ready to point a finger, few seem ready to take responsibility.
	   The SPLA, whose top officials live comfortably in neighboring
Kenya or elsewhere, deny claims by relief agencies that they divert
relief food for their troops.
	   A rebel spokesman this week accused the Kenya-based Operation
Lifeline Sudan, the umbrella group for U.N and other aid agencies,
of corruption and inefficiency. UNICEF said the charge should be
investigated.
	   Government forces often loot or burn food stocks if they fear
rebels will get them.
	   The Sudanese government does not allow military transport
aircraft, which have the largest capacity for aid drops, to fly
into southern Sudan for fear they could be carrying arms for the
rebels.
	   And the United Nations is criticized for cooperating with both
the government _ by not pushing hard enough against the flight ban
_ and the rebels.
	   Southern Sudan lacks roads, airstrips and other basic
infrastructure. So the WFP is doubtful that a three-month
cease-fire to allow humanitarian access to Bahr el-Ghazal can help.
	   Doctors Without Borders is working frantically to double the
capacity of the Ajiep feeding center, the only one within six days'
walking distance, to about 5,000 people and cut down on the
estimated 120 deaths a day.
	   When a civilian C-130 transport plane dropped 16 tons of corn on
Ajiep, hundreds of people stood along the edges of the drop site,
watching bags of life splat in the mud. The food was carried off by
local aid workers paid in food.
	   Old men, women and children scrambled in on their hands and
knees to pluck every last kernel of corn from sacks that had burst
upon impact. A handful could mean the difference between life and
death.
	   ``Our children are dying,'' said Lual Madut Lual, an old man who
watched the mayhem. ``Tell the world to come and ask why our people
are dying.''

	   MURCIA, Spain (AP) _ An explosion rocked a Spanish gun shop
Tuesday, setting it ablaze and injuring two people, the Red Cross
said.
	   Thick black smoke billowed into the air after the blast in the
center of this southeastern coastal town.
	   The explosion touched off a series of smaller detonations from
ammunition and other material, a Red Cross spokesman said.
	   Two people were hospitalized with minor injuries _ a man who was
inside the shop and another who lived in an apartment above it.
	   Firefighters extinguished the blaze, the spokesman said.
	   The cause of the explosion was not known.

A year after the bite, Tyson seeks license
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TRENTON, New Jersey (AP) _ A year and a month after the bite
that got him banned, Mike Tyson is seeking to get his career back
in New Jersey.
	   New Jersey regulators are being asked to decide whether Tyson
has paid his debt for biting Evander Holyfield and can return to
the ring.
	   Tyson, his wife, a psychiatrist and fellow boxers Bobby Czyz and
Chuck Wepner will testify on his behalf at an administrative
hearing Wednesday before the state Athletic Control Board.
	   The three-member panel will have 45 days to decide whether Tyson
has ``good character, honesty, integrity and responsibility,'' as
required by state boxing law. No decision is expected Wednesday,
according to spokesman Roger Shatzkin.
	   ``Basically, we want to show what Mike has done and has not done
in the last year,'' said Tyson lawyer Anthony Fusco Jr. ``We want
to show he's competent to accept a license and that that kind of
behavior that went on in the Holyfield fight won't reoccur.
	   ``You can't bury somebody for the rest of his life for one foul,
although it was a significant foul,'' he said.
	   But questions have been raised whether New Jersey _ and not
Nevada _ should be state to grant Tyson a license. Some people,
including regulators in both states, say Tyson should return to
Nevada for his regulatory repentance.
	   Fighting for Holyfield's WBA heavyweight title on June 28, 1997,
Tyson inexplicably bit his opponent's right ear. After a
four-minute delay, the fight resumed and he bit him on the left
ear, prompting referee Mills Lane to disqualify Tyson.
	   The Nevada State Athletic Commission swiftly revoked Tyson's
license to box and fined him dlrs 3 million, leaving him eligible
to apply for reinstatement after one year.
	   According to Fusco, Tyson decided to apply for a license in New
Jersey because he likes fighting in Atlantic City and has ties to
the state, being a former resident of Bernardsville.
	   But there also was the fear by Tyson's handlers that Nevada
regulators would make him wait longer to get his license, and a
further layoff would diminish his skills. Tyson adviser Shelly
Finkel told the Las Vegas Sun last week that he did not think
Nevada would have re-licensed the fighter.
	   Asked about the reports that Nevada would have delayed granting
Tyson a license, Marc Ratner, the commission's executive director,
said: ``It is unfair to prejudge what the Nevada commission would
have done, just as it would be unfair for the Nevada commission to
prejudge what would be done at this hearing.''
	   The move to New Jersey has drawn criticism from boxing insiders
and regulators.
	   ``They should direct him to Nevada, which revoked the license in
the first place,'' boxing promoter Bob Arum said. ``Let Nevada make
the first ruling. To do anything otherwise is to destroy the sport
of boxing.''
	   Under federal law, one state does not have to abide by
suspensions levied in other states.
	   Yet Nevada wants other states to respect its ban. New York
Attorney General Dennis Vacco said a ``yes'' vote would violate the
spirit of cooperation between states.
	   ``If any state breaks ranks with Nevada and awards Mr. Tyson a
license at this point, it would severely undermine the objective of
discipline and weaken the solidarity we are trying to achieve
through interstate cooperation in the policing of boxing,'' Vacco
wrote last week in a letter to New Jersey Attorney General Peter
Verniero.

EU imposes sanctions on Angola's UNITA movement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union imposed a series of
sanctions aimed at Angola's former rebel movement, UNITA, including
restrictions on trade in diamonds that do not have government
certificates of origin.
	   UNITA is accused of masscring more than 200 people in
northeastern Angola last week in a military campaign that violates
the peace agreement signed in 1994. UNITA has denied any part in
the killings.
	   An EU statement listed prohibitions against:
	   - The import of Angolan diamonds unless they have a certificate
of origin from Angola's Government of Unity and National
Reconciliation;
	   - The supply of petroleum products to Angola through
undesignated points of entry;
	   - The supply of mining equipment and mining services in areas of
Angola which are not under state control;
	   - The supply or aircraft or aircraft components through
undesignated points of entry.
	   The 15 EU countries also called for freezing funds and financial
resources of UNITA and UNITA officials that are held outside
Angola.
	   According to the statement from the EU Council of Ministers,
``no funds or financial resources shall be made available for their
benefit.''
	   The sanctions and other measures were agreed in principle by EU
member states July 3.

King Hussein says he has cancer, undergoing chemotherapy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ King Hussein told Jordanians on Tuesday
that he is undergoing treatment for lymphatic cancer and said he
expects to recover fully.
	   Hussein said he first received chemotherapy on Sunday and ``my
general condition is excellent, my mind is clear and my morale is
high.''
	   Hussein, who has been hospitalized in the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minnesota, since July 14, spoke in a satellite interview
with Jordanian television.
	   Hussein, 62, spoke strongly in two interviews in Arabic and
English.
	   ``This is a new battle among the many battles and with God's
help, we will fully overcome this problem,'' Hussein said. He wore
a light-blue shirt and a dark-blue tie.
	   The clinic released a statement Tuesday on behalf of Lt. Gen.
Dr. Samir Farraj, Hussein's private physician, that said Hussein
has lymphoma, or cancer of the lymphatic tissue, and ``this
condition is highly treatable with chemotherapy.''
	   It said Hussein will receive six chemotherapy treatments every
21 to 24 days. Each treatment will last four days.
	   The clinic said results of the first cycle of chemotherapy ``are
very encouraging.''
	   ``His temperature has returned to normal and the blood tests
show signs of significant improvement,'' the clinic said.
	   Hussein is the longest-reigning ruler in the Middle East. He is
due to celebrate 46 years on the throne in August 11.
	   Hussein underwent surgery to remove cancer from his ureter and
left kidney at the Mayo Clinic in 1992 and has had regular medical
checkups at the clinic since.
	   He had an operation in November 1997 to remove an inflamed lymph
gland that was found to be benign. In April 1997, he had surgery
for an enlarged prostate that also was benign.

Serbs capture major Kosovo Liberation Army stronghold

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Backed by tanks, Serb forces drove
ethnic Albanian fighters from a major stronghold Tuesday and
battled to hold the main road through the heart of rebel territory
in central Kosovo.
	   Government soldiers also tightened their noose around another
Kosovo Liberation Army bastion, Junik, near the border with Albania
_ the insurgents' sanctuary and source of arms.
	   The Serbian Media Center reported that government troops entered
Malisevo, a town 25 miles (400 kilometers) southwest of the
provincial capital, Pristina. It said armed ethnic Albanians
dispersed, and there were no civilian casualties.
	   There was no word of casualties among fighters on both sides.
	   The Kosovo Information Center quoted Xhevdet Bajraj, an Albanian
writer who lives near Malisevo, as saying the rebels had pulled out
of Maliveso and that ``only civilians have been left behind.''
	   Bajraj appealed to the Red Cross to help the ``tens of
thousands'' of civilians, including many refugees, in Malisevo.
	   In Geneva, UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski said up to 65,000
people were believed to have been in Malisevo, most of them
refugees who fled fighting elsewhere.
	   The general-secretary of the Democratic League of Kosovo, Nekibe
Kelmendi, accused the Serbs of seeking ``to destroy the defenseless
civilian Albanian population and cleanse Kosovo of Albanians.''
	   The rebels are battling for the independence of Kosovo, whose
population of 2 million is 90 percent ethnic Albanian. Kosovo is
located in southern Serbia, the dominant of Yugoslavia's two
republics.
	   A column of 60 tanks was seen heading for Malisevo earlier
Tuesday. A nearby village, Bubavec, was reported to be ablaze, the
Kosovo Information Center said.
	   Also Tuesday, ethnic Albanians said KLA fighters ambushed a
military convoy near Lapusnik, a village 15 miles west of Pristina.
The Kosovo Information Center, run by independence-seeking
Albanians, said the fighting was still raging and the Serbs were
suffering heavy losses. The report could not be confirmed.
	   Lapusnik is near the main highway from Pristina to Pec, Kosovo's
second largest city 50 miles (80 kilometers) to the west. Serb
forces cleared the highway Monday and removed KLA barricades
erected in May.
	   Both Serb and Albanian sources reported KLA counterattacks
Tuesday in several areas near the road.
	   Serbian police estimate 2,000 people are trapped in Junik,
including about 1,000 KLA troops. Police and army troops surrounded
the KLA stronghold 50 miles southwest of Pristina on Monday.
	   The Kosovo Information Center claimed Serb forces near Junik
executed an ethnic Albanian family of 20 people, including
children, after they raised a white sheet in surrender. The report
could not be independently confirmed.

Palestinians, Israelis to resume peace talks Tuesday

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Fresh comments from Palestinian negotiator, no
breakthrough after Tuesday's session, raises attribution for talks
Thursday &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israeli and Palestinian officials went
back to the negotiating table Tuesday to discuss the scope of a
long overdue Israeli troop withdrawal and an American peace plan to
get it off the ground.
	   But after three hours of talks, chief Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat said no breakthrough had been reached. Erekat said
Israeli negotiators had tried to raise issues that negate the
American proposal, but those were rejected by the Palestinians.
	   ``The positions remain as they were,'' Erekat said.
	   ``We told them that anything that doesn't contradict the (peace)
agreement and the American initiative, we will permit. Anything
that contradicts the proposal, we will reject,'' Erekat said.
	   Negotiating teams met privately in Tel Aviv for the first time
after a week-long breakdown between the sides. The Palestinians
suspended talks July 15th after only three days, saying Israel had
offered no new ideas and was still rejecting the U.S. peace
initiative.
	   Erekat, told the Voice of Palestine radio earlier that the

	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ One of four Germans suspected of
attacking a French police officer after a World Cup soccer game was
released from custody but still faces reduced charges, prosecutors
said Tuesday.
	   The 23-year-old suspect from Herne was seen in photos of the
July 21 attack bending over the French officer, Daniel Nivel, who
was seriously injured and remains in a coma.
	   The suspect maintained he was trying to keep others from
continuing to beat Nivel. Prosecutors said that other witnesses
have since come forward to support his story.
	   Prosecutors dropped charges of suspicion of group attempted
murder against him, but he still faces charges of suspicion of
causing serious bodily harm.

Fetisov retires after Red Wings second Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM CANAVAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (AP) _ Defenseman Vyacheslav
Fetisov, who started the influx of players from the former Soviet
Union to the National Hockey League, retired Tuesday rather than
stay with the Detroit Red Wings in a limited playing role.
	   Fetisov will become an assistant coach with the New Jersey
Devils, where he got his start as an NHL player in 1989.
	   The 40-year-old Fetisov's retirement came a little more than a
month after he helped the Red Wings to an emotional second straight
Stanley Cup by sweeping the Washington Capitals in four games.
	   It was a title that the Red Wings dedicated to defenseman
Vladimir Konstantinov and team massage therapist Sergei
Mnatsakonov, who were seriously injured in a limousine crash six
days after Detroit won the Cup in June 1997.
	   Fetisov bruised his chest and ribs in that same crash, but
recovered and had a fulltime role on Scotty Bowman's team last
season.
	   Considered by many the greatest Soviet defenseman, Fetisov
called his decision to retire a tough one since he felt he might
have been able to play for a few more years.
	   However, the Red Wings offered him a reduced role for next
season that he said would have meant playing only 30 or so games.
	   At the same time, the Devils offered Fetisov a three-year
contract as an assistant to Robbie Ftorek, who replaced Jacques
Lemaire as New Jersey coach after last season.
	   ``To be honest, I was waiting to the last moment to see if
(general manager) Kenny (Holland) would make a different offer,''
Fetisov said in a telephone conference call arranged by the Devils.
	   When it didn't come, Fetisov accepted the coaching offer from
Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello, had arranged for Fetisov to
come to the United States and the NHL.
	   The defenseman played for the Devils until 1995 when he was
traded in April to Detroit for a draft pick.
	   Ironically, the Devils beat Detroit for the Stanley Cup that
year, but Fetisov attained his ultimate goal two years later,
winning the first of two Cups with the Red Wings.
	   ``In addition to being a world-class athlete, Slava Fetisov is a
well-respected, first-class individual,'' Lamoriello said. ``With
over 20 years spent as a player in both international and NHL
competition, the experience he brings to the Devils will be
beneficial to both our veteran and younger players.''
	   The former captain of the famed Central Red Army team, Fetisov
also won two Olympic gold medals and nine world titles playing for
the then Soviet Union. He played 13 seasons for the Central Red
Army team, was twice named his country's player of the year while
winning the Gold Stick Award as Europe's top player in 1984.
	   Fetisov had 36 goals and 192 assists in 546 NHL games. He had
two goals and 26 assists in the playoffs.

Palestinians, Israelis to resume peace talks Tuesday

negotiator, no breakthrough after Tuesday's session, raises

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israeli and Palestinian officials went
back to the negotiating table Tuesday to discuss the scope of a
long overdue Israeli troop withdrawal and an American peace plan to
get it off the ground.
	   But after three hours of talks, chief Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat said no breakthrough had been reached. Erekat said
Israeli negotiators had tried to raise issues that negate the
American proposal, but those were rejected by the Palestinians.
	   ``The positions remain as they were,'' Erekat said.
	   ``We told them that anything that doesn't contradict the (peace)
agreement and the American initiative, we will permit. Anything
that contradicts the proposal, we will reject,'' Erekat said.
	   Negotiating teams met privately in Tel Aviv for the first time
after a week-long breakdown between the sides. The Palestinians
suspended talks July 15th after only three days, saying Israel had
offered no new ideas and was still rejecting the U.S. peace
initiative.
	   Erekat told the Voice of Palestine radio earlier that the
Palestinians had agreed to resume talks because Israeli negotiators
had called and said they wanted to ``present ideas.''
	   The two sides agreed to ``contact each other to set a time for a
new meeting, which could be on Thursday,'' he said.
	   The U.S. plan, which the Palestinians have accepted, calls for

Argentina's Ortega appears headed to Italy's Sampdoria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ After months of uncertainty, the
future of Argentina's Ariel Ortega appears to be taking shape.
	   Ortega, who starred in Argentina's midfield during the World Cup
wearing Diego Maradona's old number 10, has been looking to leave
his Spanish first-division club, Valenica.
	   Antonio Caliendo, a representative for Ortega, told the Buenos
Aires sports daily Ole Tuesday it appeared likely the fleet-footed
Argentine would sign with the Italian club Sampdoria if the
directors of Valencia agreed.
	   ``He likes the idea much more than playing in England,''
Caliendo said.
	   The English clubs Manchester United and Tottenham showed
interest in signing Ortega, who expressed his desire to leave the
Spanish club ealier this year after his playing time dwindled.
	   Ortega, or ``El Burrito'' as he is known by Argentine fans,
talked of returning to Argentina's River Plate, where he played
before moving to Valencia, but the team could not afford him.

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Henning Harnisch, one of the best German
basketball players, said Tuesday he was ending his career.
	   Harnisch, a forward who was a star on Germany's national team
that surprisingly won the European Championship in 1993, also had a
share in 14 national club titles in Germany. His last club was Alba
Berlin.
	   Harnisch, 30, decided to end his career although he reportedly
had an offer to transfer to Kinder Bologna, the Italian team that
won the European club title last season.

Spanish aquarium lets visitors swim with the exhibits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain, (AP) _ An aquarium in a posh resort is inviting
people to scuba dive with baby sharks.
	   Starting Wednesday, visitors to the Puerto Banus Aquarium in the
posh Andalusian resort of Marbella can pay 6,000 pesetas (40
dollars) for a guided look at undersea life.
	   In addition to a species of small shark called a smouth hound,
the exhibits in one of the aquarium's tanks include stingrays,
lobsters and bright yellow lemon fish.
	   Then there's the pale pink damsel fish, which has blue and green
stripes and the habit of changing sex from female to male.
	   The goal of it all is education, says Eva Maria Luna, a
spokeswoman for the aquarium. ``We want to bring people closer to
the sea,'' she said.
	   Those who want to take the plunge must pass a short training
course and go down with a professional scuba diver as a lifeguard.
	   Once underwater they can even feed the sharks -- 14 babies about
a foot (30 centimeters) long and an adult about twice that size.
Luna insisted that the smouth hound is picky about what it eats _
fish, not humans.
	   ``They are voracious, but not with people.''

Colombian national team captain hit with record MLS fine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Miami Fusion midfielder and Colombian national
team captain Carlos Valderrama was fined a record dlrs 10,000 by
Major League Soccer on Tuesday, his penalty for refusing to train
with his American club.
	   The 36-year-old mifielder refused to particpate in practice on
Friday, hours after Argentine coach Cacho Cordoba was fired and
replaced by Ivo Wortman. He also failed to show up for Saturday
morning's training session and Wortman did not take the disgruntled
player to Boston for Sunday's game against the New England
Revolution.
	   The fine was double the previous largest fine issued by MLS, a
dlrs 5,000 sanction to Tampa Bay goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli earlier
this month.
	   Ravelli also was suspended six games for kicking a ball which
struck referee Ruben Rodhas in the Mutiny's 3-2 loss to New England
on July 4.
	   Miami won Wortman's debut against the Revolution, 2-1. Wortman
was to meet with Valderrama later Tuesday to discuss his status for
Miami's home match Wednesday night against Columbus.
	   Valderrama, who was voted the Most Valuable Player in the past
two MLS All-Star games, is scheduled to start for the World team
vs. the United States in this year's contest on Sunday in Orlando,
Florida.
	   The MLS' 1996 season MVP and one of three finalists for the
award last year, Valderrama had played in two league and one U.S.
Open Cup matches since his return from the World Cup on July 18.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ U.S. boxers had a good day at the Goodwill Games
Tuesday, winning four quarterfinal bouts including two over Cuban
foes.
	   Teaunce Shepherd of Marquette, Michigan beat Rudinelson Hardy of
Cuba 16-3 in the opening featherweight bout at the Theater at
Madison Square Garden, before Ricardo Williams Jr., of Cincinnati

Varvaes of Argentina 9-8; and Jermain Taylor of Little Rock,
Arkansas, who beat light-middleweight Nurzhin Smanov of Kazahkstan
by the same score.
	   The only losses for Americans came in the light-heavyweight
division, where Cuba's Isael Alvarez beat Anthony Stewart of
Chicago 7-2; and super-heavy, where Paolo Vidoz of Italy beat Keith
Govan of Phoenix 8-1.
	   In an unusual early round meeting of top-name international
boxers, world championship silver Paata Gvasaliya of Russia stopped
Lukas Koneecny, the bronze medalist, at 1:12 of the fourth round in

Moya, the 1996 champion here, only managed to win two more games.

Northern Ireland legislation enabling early release of political
</HEADLINE>
prisoners becomes law

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Legislation enabling the early release of about
400 paramilitary prisoners under Northern Ireland's Good Friday
peace agreement became law Tuesday after being rushed through
parliament.
	   Lawmakers voted by 343 to 10 votes to approve the Northern
Ireland (Sentences) Bill, which was presented to parliament on June
4.
	   Under the terms of the bill, Mo Mowlam, the senior British
politician in charge of the province, has said that all
paramilitary groups which maintain a cease-fire and cooperate with
a commission charged with supervising weapons handovers from the
groups will qualify for their convicted militants to be released.
	   The releases are expected to take place in the next two years
and Northern Ireland's prison chief Alan Shannon said Tuesday that
the Maze high security prison is likely to be wound down when its
prisoners are released, with up to 1,000 prison officers loosing
their jobs.
	   ``Certainly if the accelerated release scheme goes ahead as
planned I think we will see a fairly rapid progressive run-down of
the Maze over the next two years,'' Shannon said.
	   Early releases for paramilitary convicts are a key provision of
the April 10 peace agreement, endorsed in a May 22 referendum. The
accord provides for Northern Ireland to have a Protestant-Catholic
power-sharing assembly and formal links with the Irish Republic. A
second bill setting up that assembly is expected to become law by
Friday.
	   Mowlam said the bill stipulated that each prisoner's case will
be reviewed individually, that prisoners deemed still dangerous to
the public would be kept inside, and that those released will be
jailed again if they return to violence.
	   The Sentence Review Board is expected to meet for the first time
next week to start the early release program. The first prisoner
releases are expected in the autumn.
	   Mowlam is Wednesday expected to give lawmakers a list of which
paramilitary groups' prisoners will be eligible for early release.
Currently, the Irish Republican Army, which wants a united Ireland,
and two pro-British Protestant-based groups, the Ulster Defense
Association and Ulster Volunteer Force, have maintained cease-fires
and their political allies have endorsed the agreement. About 3,400
people have died in nearly 30 years of violence in Northern
Ireland.
	   Members of dissident groups that have not declared cease-fires
are not eligible for parole.

	   AJIEP, Sudan (AP) _ Another baby dies, and another mother cries
out in the steamy night. For Chok Abiei Kueth, the screams are all
in a day's work.
	   He buries the dead for a living, a busy job in southern Sudan,
devastated by war and famine. He used to trade tea, when there was
still a market for such goods.
	   Relief food is pouring into southern Sudan in
multimillion-dollar air drops _ the world's largest relief
operation. But starving Sudanese, in conditions so desperate that
mothers stare at their skeletal children in horrified disbelief,
are still dying by the thousands.
	   Why is the food aid not helping? Why did it take so long to get
here? And why is nothing being done to stop the 15-year civil war
that has created yet another famine in Africa's largest country?
	   An estimated 1.5 million people have died in the civil war, and
the arable land lies fallow. Ongoing violence keeps farmers from
their fields.
	   The United Nations and individual governments condemn the
endless killing and call for emergency food relief for an estimated
2.6 million people in rebel- and government-held areas of Sudan.
But those with influence don't seem able or willing to end the war.
	   Aid agencies can only deal with the war's effects.
	   The U.N. World Food Program is air-dropping 9,500 tons of food
per month _ at a cost of dlrs 30 million _ into southern Sudan in
the world's largest aid operation.
	   Earlier this month, WFP director Catherine Bertini urged the
international community to stop the Sudan war. On Wednesday, she
will address the issue again before a U.S. congressional committee.
	   ``We recognize we have an advocacy responsibility on behalf of
people ... to blow the bells and whistles to alert others to
respond,'' said Michael Sackett, WFP's eastern Africa regional
manager.
	   ``In the meantime we do the best possible job, short-term and
Band-Aid though it is.''
	   The United States, which tacitly supports the Sudan People's
Liberation Army in its fight against Sudan's Islamic government, is
the largest donor, with dlrs 75 million in contributions this year.
	   Late last year, WFP estimated 250,000 people in southern Sudan
would need food aid by spring because of poor harvests.
	   But in January, a failed attack by SPLA forces on Wau, the
government-held capital of Bahr el-Ghazal province, resulted in
widespread looting of food stocks and a government ban on further
relief flights into the area.
	   An estimated 100,000 people fled Wau, abandoning fields that
could have provided food.
	   It took two months of behind-the-scenes negotiations before
relief flights could resume. By then, famine had set in.
	   ``Why do governments support the SPLA for years and not respond
to a humanitarian crisis?'' lamented WFP spokeswoman Michele
Quintaglie.
	   At a feeding center in Ajiep, about 60 miles (100 kms) north of
Wau, flooded with 70,000 people fleeing the wretchedness of war and
hunger, death is never far away.
	   People so thin their bodies already appear mummified lie naked
on mats in the compound, flies swarming above them. Mothers curl
their long narrow frames around infants who reach painfully for
sagging, empty breasts.
	   Relief food seems to be fueling the war. And while everyone is
ready to point a finger, few seem ready to take responsibility.
	   The SPLA, whose top officials live comfortably in neighboring
Kenya or elsewhere, deny claims by relief agencies that they divert
relief food for their troops.
	   A rebel spokesman this week accused the Kenya-based Operation
Lifeline Sudan, the umbrella group for U.N and other aid agencies,
of corruption and inefficiency. UNICEF said the charge should be
investigated.
	   Government forces often loot or burn food stocks if they fear
rebels will get them.
	   The Sudanese government does not allow military transport
aircraft, which have the largest capacity for aid drops, to fly
into southern Sudan for fear they could be carrying arms for the
rebels.
	   And the United Nations is criticized for cooperating with both
the government _ by not pushing hard enough against the flight ban
_ and the rebels.
	   Southern Sudan lacks roads, airstrips and other basic
infrastructure. So the WFP is doubtful that a three-month
cease-fire to allow humanitarian access to Bahr el-Ghazal can help.
	   Doctors Without Borders is working frantically to double the
capacity of the Ajiep feeding center, the only one within six days'
walking distance, to about 5,000 people and cut down on the
estimated 120 deaths a day.
	   Even dropping food from the air won't solve the problem. When a
civilian C-130 transport plane dropped 16 tons of corn on Ajiep
recently, hundreds of people stood along the edges of the drop
site, watching bags of life splat in the mud. The food was
collected by local aid workers, who are paid in food to keep them
healthy enough to distribute the aid.
	   Old men, women and children scrambled in on their hands and
knees to pluck every last kernel of corn from sacks that had burst
upon impact. A handful could mean the difference between life and
death.
	   ``Our children are dying,'' said Lual Madut Lual, an old man who
watched the mayhem. ``Tell the world to come and ask why our people
are dying.''

US wins, improving its chances of gaining quarterfinal berth

	   ROME (AP) _ The United States handed Australia its first loss in
the Baseball World Championships Tuesday, keeping U.S. hopes alive
in the race for a quarterfinal berth.
	   A home run by Texas Tech catcher Joshua Bard in the fifth inning
helped the U.S. team of college players beat Australia 8-5 at
Palermo, Sicily. The Australians, which have already secured a spot
in Friday's quarterfinals, started the game with a perfect 5-0
record.
	   ``Australia is a good ball club and we are very happy to have
beat them,'' said U.S. coach Ron Polk. ``We hit the ball better.''
	   The United States, the Netherlands and Canada are currently tied
for fourth place in group B with one round of preliminary play
remaining.
	   The top four teams from each of the two eight-country pools
advance to Friday's quarterfinals.
	   To make the cut, the United States needs to beat Canada
Wednesday and the Netherlands must lose to Australia.
	   ``We still got our backs against the wall,'' said Polk. ``But
hopefully Australia will take care of the Netherlands and we will
take care of Canada.''
	   The Americans have not won these championships since 1974, the
last time the country hosted the event.
	   Although the tournament is open to professionals for the first
time, no major leaguers are participating. Some minor leaguers are
playing for Canada, the Dominican Republic and other countries.
	   In other pool B games, South Korea defeated Nicaragua 10-7 to
move into second place in the group standings in a tie with
Nicaragua. Both countries have four wins and two losses.
	   At Messina, Sicily, South Korea started with a bang when
outfielder Chang Young-Kyoon smacked a three-run homer in the first
inning. South Korean pitcher Kyung Hun-Ho tossed a five-hitter and
struck out four batters to help seal the victory.
	   South Korea was runner-up to Cuba, the five-time defending
titlist, at the 1994 Worlds. Cuba has won 36 consecutive games at
the Worlds.
	   Rain forced cancellation of Tuesday's night game between Cuba,
the leader of pool A, and the Domenican Republic (4-1). The game
could be rescheduled for Thursday.
	   At Palermo, the Netherlands collected 11 hits to beat Canada 7-5
in 10 innings. Pitcher Rikkert Faneyte helped his own cause by
hitting a triple in the 10th inning.
	   Also at Palermo, Taiwan (2-4) beat Russia 7-1. The Russians have
lost all six games played and sit at the bottom of the group B
rankings, behind Taiwan.
	   In other pool A games, Japan defeated China 4-1, Panama beat
South Africa 5-4, and Spain won against Italy, 13-6.

King Hussein says he has cancer, undergoing chemotherapy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details on Hussein's appearance, background on
the disease, CLARIFIES that Hussein's doctors said the cancer was
highly treatable, ADDS survival rate &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ King Hussein told his people Tuesday that
he is undergoing treatment for lymphatic cancer and said he expects
to recover fully.
	   Hussein said he first received chemotherapy on Sunday and ``my
general condition is excellent, my mind is clear and my morale is
high.''
	   Hussein, who has been hospitalized at the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minnesota since July 14 spoke in a satellite interview
with Jordanian television.
	   Hussein, 62, spoke strongly in two interviews in Arabic and
English.
	   ``This is a new battle among the many battles and with God's
help, we will fully overcome this problem,'' Hussein said.
	   The king wore a light-blue shirt with the top button undone and
a loosely knotted tie.
	   His face was slightly red and puffy.
	   A statement by Hussein's physicians Tuesday said they had
concluded that he was suffering from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or
cancer of the lymphatic tissue, and ``this condition is highly
treatable with chemotherapy.''
	   It said Hussein will receive chemotherapy treatment
intravenously for four days every 21 to 24 days. He will receive
six cycles of treatment.
	   The statement, released at the Mayo Clinic, said results of the
first cycle of chemotherapy ``are very encouraging.''
	   ``His temperature has returned to normal and the blood tests
show signs of significant improvement,'' the doctors said.
	   There were no immediate details on which type of non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma Hussein was battling.
	   Low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is not curable but is very
responsive to treatment and the 5-year survival rate is about 75
percent.
	   High-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is curable with aggressive
treatment, but survival is usually less than 1 1/2 years if there
is not a complete remission after treatment. Sixty to 80 percent of
sufferers enter a complete remission with chemotherapy.
	   Hussein is the longest-reigning ruler in the Middle East. He is
due to celebrate 46 years on the throne on August 11.
	   Hussein underwent surgery to remove cancer from his ureter and
left kidney at the Mayo Clinic in 1992 and has had regular medical
checkups at the clinic since.
	   He had an operation in November 1997 to remove an inflamed lymph
gland that was found to be benign. In April 1997, he had surgery
for an enlarged prostate that also was benign.

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ After months of uncertainty, the
future of Argentina's Ariel Ortega is now clear.
	   Sampdoria of Italy's first division bought the fleet-footed
Argentine from Spain's Valencia for dlrs 12 million, a local news
agency reported Tuesday.
	   The 24-year-old Ortega, who starred in Argentina's midfield
during the World Cup wearing Diego Maradona's old number 10, had
been looking for months to leave Valencia, a Spanish first-division
club.
	   The English clubs Manchester United and Tottenham showed
interest in signing Ortega, who expressed his desire to leave the
Spanish club earlier this year after his playing time dwindled.
	   ``He likes the idea much more than playing in England,''
Caliendo told Ole, a Buenos Aires sports daily.
	   Ortega, or ``El Burrito'' as he is known by Argentine fans,
talked of returning to Argentina's River Plate, where he played
before moving to Valencia, but the team could not afford him.

Two U.S. pilots die in Colombia plane crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A small airplane crashed into the
jungles of southern Colombia, killing two U.S. pilots who were in
the country to help eradicate drug crops, officials said Tuesday.
	   A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman in Bogota identified the men as Gary
Clyde Chestnut, 46, of Leesburg, Alabama, and Wayne Harley Mulgrew,
46, of Napa, California.
	   Their Thrush plane, used for fumigating illicit drug crops, went
down during a training flight Monday near the town of San Jose de
Guaviare, about 175 miles (280 kilometers) southwest of the capital
Bogota.
	   Authorities said they didn't know what caused the crash.
	   ``They enter the gallery of heroes who have given so much to the
fight against drug trafficking,'' Colombian police chief Gen. Rosso
Jose Serrano said.
	   The wreckage was located Tuesday a few miles outside of San Jose
de Guaviare, where rescue teams arrived to evacuate the bodies.
	   Leesburg and Mulgrew worked for the U.S.-based Dainco company,
which helps train Colombian pilots to fumigate drug crops, police
said.
	   Leftist rebels control much of the dense jungle in the southern
state of Guaviare, but the U.S. Embassy said there was no evidence
linking them to the crash.
	   In the last four years, seven helicopters and four airplanes
used to fumigate illicit coca and poppy crops have crashed or been
shot down by Colombian guerrillas.
	   Three U.S. civilian pilots have died in the past 14 months while
aiding Colombia in anti-narcotics operations.

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ A leading presidential candidate has
charged members of Venezuela's military are planning an
assassination attempt or a coup to prevent him from winning
December's presidential race or taking office.
	   Hugo Chavez, who is leading in the polls, based the allegation
on information from intelligence sources including some inside the
military.
	   Government officials had no immediate comment. They plan to
provide security for all presidential candidates this week with the
official start of the campaign.
	   Chavez is drawing support from poor and middle-class Venezuelans
angry over widespread political corruption. Some businessmen and
conservative sectors fear he will impose a dictatorship and failed
socialist economic policies.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The World Food Program warned Tuesday that
the worst drought in 40 years has killed crops in eastern Cuba,
leaving more than 500,000 people in need of emergency food aid.
	   Earlier this month, an interagency evaluation mission, organized
by the WFP, visited the five eastern provinces of Las Tunas,
Holguin, Granma, Santiago de Cuba and Guantanamo on the communist
island _ the Caribbean's biggest country.
	   ``During the visit, we determined that 539,000 people were
directly affected in these provinces as a consequence of reduced
food availability and lowered incomes,'' said Francisco Roque
Castro, WFP regional manager for central America and the Caribbean,
who led the mission. ``Out of this total, 280,000 are agricultural
and livestock producers.''
	   WFP is processing an emergency operation to provide food rations
to more than 500,000 people for six months. Initial estimates put
the cost at dlrs 7 million.
	   Food production in the five provinces has dropped by 42 percent,
Roque said. Out of the 609,648 tons expected to be produced,
259,000 tons were lost, he said.
	   ___
	   OAXACA, Mexico (AP) _ A leftist rebel group has claimed
responsibility for shooting two soldiers, a week before a statewide
election in the southern state of Oaxaca.
	   A communique issued late Monday in the name of the Popular
Revolutionary Army raised concerns that the shadowy organization
might interfere with state elections on Sunday.
	   Gunmen traveling in a van opened fire on soldiers at the
military reserve on the outskirts of Oaxaca city, about 11 p.m.
Saturday.
	   Mexico's Interior Minister Francisco Labastida, said most
members of the EPR were in jail, leaving it at less than half the
strength it had in 1996, when it staged a stunning series of
coordinated raids in several states.
	   ___
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ A judge on Tuesday ordered the detention
of the environmental group Greenpeace's ship the Rainbow Warrior
after activists on board occupied a shrimp farm they charged was
damaging the environment.
	   The Rainbow Warrior and its 16 crew members remained in the port
of Muisne, 115 miles (190 kilometers) northwest of Quito, on
Tuesday. They had planned to leave for Costa Rica.
	   ``We do not understand why the port captain of Muisne has
detained our ship,'' said a Greenpeace communique read over a radio
station. ``Greenpeace denounces this act as lacking any legal base
since no Ecuadorean laws were broken.''
	   Greenpeace activists on Sunday occupied a shrimp farm in Muisne,
breaking open dike to a shrimp breeding pond and planting trees in
a symbolic attempt to reforest the tropical mangrove cut down to
build the shrimp farm.
	   Shrimp is one of Ecuador's top exports and environmentalists
charge the construction of the shrimp farms has destroyed much of
its coastal mangroves.
	   Activists said the farm they occupied was illegally built and
they had come at the request of local environmentalists.
	   Judge Lenin Quinonez ordered the detention of the boat at the
request of local shrimp farmers led by South Korean businessman
Yenwin Chukam whose shrimp pond was damaged by the activists.
	   Chukam has charged the activists broke a dike, which released
hundreds of his shrimp larvae into the ocean, doing dlrs 38 million
in damage.
	   ___
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A church cook accused of covering up the
murder of a bishop was released pending trial on Tuesday, but a
priest accused in the case remains in prison.
	   Judge Isaias Figueroa Medina granted a motion to allow Margarita
Lopez out of prison without bail, though she may not leave the
country and has to report to police every 15 days.
	   Lopez and a priest, Mario Orantes, were arrested last week on
charges of involvement in the April 26 killing of Bishop Juan
Gerardi, who headed the church human rights office.
	   Orantes, 39, had reported finding the bishop's bludgeoned corpse
at the San Sebastian church, where both lived.

Cullen reaches century mark at age 22
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) _ Christian Cullen will play his
100th first-class rugby union match for New Zealand on Saturday,
quite a feat for the fullback who's in his fifth season and only
22.
	   ``I didn't even know I was close,'' said Cullen, who is
preparing along with the rest of the All Blacks for Saturday's
Bledisloe Cup and Tri Nations test match against Australia.
	   ``They seem to have just flown by. Talking to people like Frank
Oliver, he said it took him ages to get 10 tests. These days you
can almost get that in one year.''
	   In his 99 games, Cullen has scored 87 tries, including 27 in 27
games for the All Blacks. But thanks to the current All Blacks
scoring drought, he is slipping from his try-a-test average to 23
tries in his last 26 tests.
	   And he hasn't scored a try in his last three games. Never in his
first-class career has Cullen gone four consecutive games without
scoring a try. (djp)

UN chief urges more cooperation with regional groups
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged more
cooperation Tuesday between U.N. agencies and regional groups such
as ASEAN and the OAU to deal with the world's ``more diverse and
more deadly forms of conflicts.''
	   The U.N. chief opened a two-day meeting on cooperation between
the United Nations and regional organizations by stressing the need
for coordinated, preventive action.
	   ``In an era when the principal threat to human security comes
from new, more diverse and more deadly forms of conflicts, the
United Nations and regional organizations have an opportunity _
indeed an obligation _ to enhance cooperation for the prevention of
such conflicts,'' Annan said.
	   ``I say `obligation' because the nature of modern conflict is
threatening the very fabric of human coexistence,'' he told
representatives from groups including the European Union, the
Organization of Islamic Conference and the Organization of American
States.
	   He recommended more frequent consultations, better information
and staff exchanges.
	   The recent appointment of a U.N. liaison officer at the
headquarters of the Organization of African Unity, in Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia was a model to be replicated, Annan said.

King Hussein says he has cancer, undergoing chemotherapy

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ King Hussein told Jordanians on Tuesday
that he is undergoing treatment for lymphatic cancer and said he
expects to recover fully.
	   Hussein said he first received chemotherapy on Sunday and ``my
general condition is excellent, my mind is clear and my morale is
high.''
	   Hussein, who has been hospitalized at the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minnesota since July 14, spoke in a satellite interview
with Jordanian television.
	   Hussein, 62, spoke strongly in two interviews in Arabic and
English.
	   ``This is a new battle among the many battles and with God's
help, we will fully overcome this problem,'' Hussein said.
	   The king wore a light-blue shirt with the top button undone and
a loosely knotted tie.
	   His face was slightly red and puffy.
	   A statement by Hussein's physicians Tuesday said they had
concluded that he was suffering from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or
cancer of the lymphatic tissue, and ``this condition is highly
treatable with chemotherapy.''
	   It said Hussein will receive chemotherapy treatment
intravenously for four days every 21 to 24 days. He will receive
six cycles of treatment.
	   The statement, released at the Mayo Clinic, said results of the
first cycle of chemotherapy ``are very encouraging.''
	   ``His temperature has returned to normal and the blood tests
show signs of significant improvement,'' the doctors said.
	   There were no immediate details on which type of non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma Hussein was battling.
	   Low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is not curable but is very
responsive to treatment and the five-year survival rate is about 75
percent.
	   High-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is curable with aggressive
treatment, but survival is usually less than 1 1/2 years if there
is not a complete remission after treatment. Sixty percent to 80
percent of sufferers enter a complete remission with chemotherapy.

Colombian national team captain hit with record MLS fine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS spelling of Wortmann throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Miami Fusion midfielder Carlos Valderrama was
fined a record dlrs 10,000 by Major League Soccer on Tuesday for
refusing to train with his American club.
	   The 36-year-old midfielder refused to particpate in practice on
Friday, hours after Argentine coach Cacho Cordoba was fired and
replaced by Ivo Wortmann. He also failed to show up for Saturday
morning's training session and Wortmann did not take the
disgruntled player to Boston for Sunday's game against the New
England Revolution.
	   The fine was double the previous largest fine issued by MLS, a
dlrs 5,000 sanction to Tampa Bay goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli earlier
this month.
	   Ravelli also was suspended six games for kicking a ball which
struck referee Ruben Rodhas in the Mutiny's 3-2 loss to New England
on July 4.
	   Miami won Wortmann's debut 2-1 against the Revolution. Wortmann
was to meet with Valderrama later Tuesday to discuss his status for
Miami's home match Wednesday night against Columbus.
	   Valderrama, voted MVP of the last two MLS all-star games, is
scheduled to start for the World team vs. the United States in this
year's contest on Sunday at Orlando, Florida.
	   The MLS' 1996 season MVP and one of three finalists for the
award last year, Valderrama had played in two league and one U.S.
Open Cup matches since his return from the World Cup on July 18.

Kwan: ``There's room for improvement''
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ In the days before Wednesday's start
of the Goodwill Games figure skating competition, Michelle Kwan
watched a tape of her silver medal performance in the Olympics.
	   Like any great athlete, she learned some things.
	   ``I thought it was good,'' she said. ``There was a smile on my
face as I watched. I said, `Push, Michelle! Push! You can do it!'
	   ``I saw things I can improve on. There are some things I could
have done better. I needed a little more oomph to the long
program.''
	   Now, Kwan hopes the oomph is there and she can maintain it right
through the next four years to the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City.
She is positive about the prospects.
	   ``It's not what's out there,'' she said. ``It's what I want. I
love competing. I love the challenge. I don't feel I'll be that
old. I'll be 21. Pul-eese!''
	   Kwan remembered that on the day of the gold medal long skate in
Nagano, she was not herself.
	   ``I was a little too nervous, more nervous than usual,'' she
said. ``I tried to take a nap and I couldn't sleep a wink. I was a
little too overwhelmed.''
	   The result was a silver medal, not the gold she wanted so badly.
	   ``When I started last year, I thought if I didn't win, what
would I do?'' Kwan said. ``My life would be over. The thing I've
learned from skating is that's not all there is. I feel there's
more to accomplish than the gold.''
	   So that has been her agenda during a long post-Olympic tour
which winds up this week at the Nassau Coliseum, in a competition
Kwan is expected to win.
	   Expectations, however, don't always come through. Kwan,
remember, led the Nagano figure skating after the short program
only to be overtaken for the gold medal by longtime rival Tara
Lipinski.
	   Since then, Lipinski has moved on to the pros _ a gray area when
it comes to figure skating _ leaving Kwan to carry on without her,
stripping the sport of what was developing into a delicious
rivalry.
	   ``I miss Tara,'' she said. ``I believe it would attract more
attention if she continued to compete in the amateurs. But you
never know who's coming up. It could be anybody. I see a lot of
kids coming up, kids doing triples. I was amazed.''
	   The 18-year-old Kwan is vastly different from the skater coach
Frank Carroll found in the Pacific Coast championships in 1993.
	   ``I saw a wonderful little girl with spring in her legs and joy
in her face and no discipline whatsoever,'' he said.
	   The spring and joy are still there. The discipline has come bit
by bit along with maturity. Carroll told an anecdote to show just
how grown-up this teen-ager has become.
	   ``She's trained hard for this event,'' he said of the Goodwill
Games. ``She's been very consistent.''
	   However, there were some down days, too.
	   ``One day,'' Carroll said, ``she was in a funk. She really
wasn't into it.''
	   Finally, the exasperated coach aporoached Kwan.
	   ``I said to her, `What do you want me to say or do?''' Carroll
recalled.
	   ``She said, `I want you to say nothing and do nothing. It's not
your problem. It's my problem. Give me two or three minutes and
I'll snap out of it.'
	   ``Three minutes later, she was great. She's in charge of
herself.''
	   Kwan knows she controls her own destiny on ice.
	   ``It's little things,'' she said. ``Hopefully, the next time you
see me compete, I'll be that much better.''

Pak drawing comparisons to Woods

<TEXT>
	   WINDSOR, Ontario (AP) _ Electric fans whirred above as Se Ri
Pak, cheeks flushed from the muggy heat, faced a standing-room-only
crowd of reporters who wanted to know how she became so good so
young.
	   Virtually unnoticed outside the interview room Tuesday was
Colleen Walker, the defending champion of this week's du Maurier
Classic, the last major of the year on the LPGA Tour.
	   ``Forget Tiger,'' Walker said, peeking into the interview room
for a glimpse at the 20-year-old Korean. ``This is the real
phenom.''
	   If nothing else, she has won more majors than Tiger Woods.
	   Just three months ago, Pak was just another foreign rookie on
the LPGA Tour with a promising game. She had yet to finish in the
top 10, and only six of her 29 rounds were in the 60s.
	   Funny how three months and nine tournaments can change
everything.
	   First, Pak won the LPGA Championship in May. Two months later,
she became the first woman under 21 to win two majors by beating
amateur Jenny Chausiriporn in a 20-hole playoff at the U.S. Women's
Open.
	   And then, in Woods-like fashion, her season really took off.
	   Pak didn't just win the week after the Open, she overwhelmed.
She set two LPGA scoring records at the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic _
a 10-under 61 in the second round, and a 261 for 72 holes.
	   Last week, she won for the fourth time in nine tournaments by
beating out Dottie Petter at the Giant Eagle Classic.
	   During her incredible surge to the top of women's golf, a sign
in the gallery at the Jamie Farr Classic spoke volumes: ``Tiger
Out. Pak In.''
	   The comparisons are clearly worth noting.
	   Both have taken their tours by storm before turning 21. Woods
won twice and finished 24th on the money list in just eight
tournaments in 1996. No one else on the LPGA has won more than
twice this year, and Pak is virtually a lock to become the first
player since Nancy Lopez to win player of the year and rookie of
the year.
	   Both have an incredible mental prowess shaped by their fathers.
Earl Woods used to jingle change in his pocket to teach his son
focus. Jun-chul Pak made his daughter hit balls in a cemetery at
night.
	   Both have a smile they can turn on at the drop of a putt.
	   And both have a game that can only bring the best out in those
around them. Tom Lehman and Mark O'Meara, among others, have said
that Woods' presence on the PGA Tour made them take their game to
another level. Pak's play is sure to inspire Annika Sorenstam,
Karrie Webb and Kelly Robbins.
	   ``She's keeping everybody on their toes, and I think that's
good,'' Walker said.
	   But comparing Pak to Woods at this stage is a reach, and
comparing their impact to golf is premature.
	   Woods was like a freight train that could be heard coming from
miles away. If it wasn't his appearance on the Mike Douglas show at
age 2, it was his three straight U.S. Amateur titles as a
teen-ager, his multimillion-dollar endorsements when he turned pro
and, above all, his performance.
	   In Woods' first 18 PGA Tour events, he won six times, not the
least of which was his record-setting win at the Masters. Because
of Woods, golf became appealing to children and minorities.
	   Pak has won four times in her first 18 LPGA Tour events, and she
is certainly getting more attention than Webb, who became the first
LPGA player to go over dlrs 1 million in a season as a 21-year-old
rookie in 1996.
	   Unlike Webb, Sorenstam and Robbins, Pak likes the attention that
seems to grow each week.
	   ``Even in practice rounds, many people follow me,'' Pak said.
``Before, the only people were my caddie. But now they pay
attention to me, and that makes me feel better.''
	   The LPGA is clamoring for a personality, something it hasn't had
since Lopez won nine times, including five tournaments in a row,
during her rookie season of 1978.
	   What they have in Pak is not yet clear.
	   Her struggle with the English language _ ``they make big loud''
_ is charming, and there is no question her smile can make up for
that. For now, her appeal has more to do with curiosity of who she
is.
	   Pak says she is not Tiger Woods, but she wouldn't mind being
Nancy Lopez.
	   She may never be as marketable as either _ at least in this
country. But a victory this week at du Maurier would give her as
many majors as the 41-year-old Lopez. She also would become only
the fourth woman to win three majors in a year.
	   And that might be enough to put Pak in a league of her own.

Golf Channel signs up LPGA for four more years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   The LPGA Tour has always been able to count on The Golf Channel
to televise up to a dozen tournaments a year. That will continue to
be the case through the year 2004.
	   Under a contract extension, The Golf Channel will own the rights
to about 15 events a year. It will televise between 10 and 12
tournaments, depending on its heavy schedule.
	   Terms were not disclosed, although LPGA commissioner Jim Ritts
said it was in line with other increases in golf.
	   ``It's very similar to the contract we've had in the past _
other than Jim's price keeps going up,'' said Joe Gibbs, chief
executive officer of The Golf Channel. ``But his product keeps
going up as well.''
	   The amount of television exposure for women's golf keeps going
up, too.
	   Just four years ago, only 19 of the LPGA's 37 events were on TV.
This year, 34 of the 42 tournaments will be broadcast.
	   Gibbs said his cable channel is available in 20 million homes
around the world _ 17.5 million in the United States.
	   ``We expect that number to be closer to 25 million at the end of
the year, and exceeding 30 million at the end of next year,'' he
said. ``When this new contract kicks in, they're (LPGA) looking at
approximately 30 million homes or more.''
	   Gibbs said there were no immediate plans for Fox, a third owner
of The Golf Channel, to televise any of the LPGA Events.
	   ``Should something come up in the future, I think the LPGA will
be amenable to those discussions,'' Gibbs said. ``But there are no
concrete plans to do that.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; FATHER AND SON: &LR;  Al Geiberger lost the bet and now has to play.
	   Two years ago, Geiberger played a round at Sahalee Country Club
with his son, Brent, who was then on the Nike Tour.
	   Brent reminded his father that Sahalee would be the host of the
PGA Championship in 1998, and then laid down the challenge _ if he
qualified for the PGA, his father would have to join him.
	   Brent has won enough money on the PGA Tour since last year's
championship to qualify, and Al will be using his lifetime
exemption from winning the PGA in 1966.
	   ``It's time for me to honor my obligation,'' Geiberger said.
``We're really looking forward to it. I don't know if they will
pair us together, but we're going to have fun.''
	   It will be the first time a father and son have competed in the
same PGA Championship.
	   Geiberger, the first player to shoot 59 in a PGA Tour event, has
not played in the PGA since 1985, five years after he had surgery
to remove most of his large intestine.
	   In the past four years, he has recovered from a torn left
rotator cuff, knee surgery, the removal of heel spurs and a damaged
finger. He was the comeback player of the year on the Senior PGA
Tour in 1996, when he won in Naples.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; GRAND SLAM UPDATE: &LR;  Mark O'Meara may have done neighbor Tiger
Woods a small favor by winning the British Open.
	   O'Meara and Lee Janzen had already made up half the field for
the dlrs 1 million PGA Grand Slam of Golf on Nov. 17 in Hawaii, a
made-for-TV event for the winners of the four majors.
	   By adding the British Open to his Masters victory, the PGA will
have to find an alternate. At this point, Woods leads the alternate
list with 210 points. Jose Maria Olazabal is next at 172 points,
followed by Paul Azinger at 137.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; WATTS IN AMERICA: &LR;  Before British Open runner-up Brian Watts
decides whether to give up the lucrative _ although obscure _ life
on the Japanese tour next year, he'll get another sample of the PGA
Tour.
	   Watts has received a sponsor's exemption into next week's Buick
Open in Grand Blanc, Mich., before playing in the PGA Championship.
	   ``The Buick people thought he was exempt based on his standing
on the tour, but when they found he wasn't, they gave him one,''
said Mike Biggs of Cornerstone Sports.
	   Watts won dlrs 329,000 in the British Open, in which he lost to
Mark O'Meara in a playoff. That's enough to finish in the top 125
on the PGA Tour money list and avoid having to qualify.
	   And now, he'll have a chance to add to that.
	   Along with the Buick Open and the PGA, Watts is eligible for the
World Series of Golf. After that, he'll return to Japan for two
more tournaments.

Caver rescued after 30-foot (10-meter) fall onto stalagmite
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMILTON, New Zealand (AP) _ A 28-year-old Englishman is in
hospital Wednesday with serious injuries after falling 30 feet (10
meters) onto a stalagmite in the Waitomo Caves, 50 miles (75 kms)
southwest of Hamilton.
	   A police spokesman said John Vale, an English chef on a working
holiday in New Zealand, had a puncture in his lower back from the
fall, internal injuries and that he lost a lot of blood in the
cave.
	   Rescuers including a doctor reached Vale about six hours after
he fell in an area of the cave known as Gardener's Gut on Monday,
said the spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   An ambulance spokesman said getting the injured man out of the
wet, dark caves had been ``like threading a needle blindfolded with
one hand tied behind your back.''
	   Dr. Uresh Naidu, from Waikato Hospital's emergency department,
described the rescue on National Radio:
	   ``We waded, crawled and crouched in waist-deep water, with walls
covered in sharp limestone, while carrying all our equipment, which
made it very cumbersome.''
	   Vale needed a drip inserted because of the amount of blood lost
from the puncture wound near one of kidneys.
	   ``It's a pretty nasty injury after a high fall and a fair bit of
impact. He was cold and in shock because he had lost a lot of
blood. He was conscious through most of it,'' said Naidu.
	   ``It was pretty nerve-wracking because it was dark, dangerous
and slippery underfoot and there were bugs and spiders all over the
place.''

Manning, Colts agree to contract
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HANK LOWENKRON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANDERSON, Indiana (AP) _ Peyton Manning's agent and Indianapolis
Colts president Bill Polian reached agreement on contract terms for
the top draft pick on Tuesday, the club announced.
	   Team spokesman Craig Kelley said no details were available on
the agreement between Polian and agent Tom Condon. He said final
details on the agreement would be completed Wednesday.
	   Negotiations to get Manning, who has missed eight practices
since workouts began at Anderson University on Friday, were
conducted for most of the day about 45 miles (72 kilometers) south
of here at the team's headquarters.
	   Polian and Condon weren't available for comment. They didn't
immediately respond to telephone messages.
	   The agreement came two days after quarterback Ryan Leaf, the
second overall pick, reached agreement on a five-year, dlrs 31.25
million deal with the San Diego Chargers that included an dlrs
11.25 million signing bonus. Although Polian and Condon didn't say
so, it was believed they would wait for the Leaf deal to be
finalized to give them a better framework for negotiations.
	   Polian had said while he had been seeking to tie up Manning for
longer, Leaf's contract made the Colts more willing to accept a
five-year contract.
	   Manning has said he wasn't determined to beat Leaf's deal.
	   Time was an issue for the Colts, because Indianapolis' de facto
starter right now is Kelly Holcomb, a career third-stringer.
Indianapolis has already awarded the starting job to Manning, and
he needs every snap he can take with the exhibition season set to
start in less than two weeks. The regular season starts Sept. 6.
	   Meanwhile, linebacker Quentin Coryatt missed his third day
straight day of practice. He left camp this weekend without
explanation and coach Jim Mora said he is as mystified about the
situation as anyone. Coryatt's agent, George Zucker, telephoned the
Colts earlier in the week about the situation but neither he nor
the team have made any public comment.
	   Marshall Faulk was another player who has been missing practice
this week, sidelined by a sore left knee that has made him a
spectator since Friday.
	   Mora did get two players on the field who had been excused
earlier for personal reasons _ linebacker Jeff Herrod and safety
Robert Blackmon.

Jurassic period dinosaur pelvis discovered in Portugal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Archaeologists said Tuesday they have
discovered a dinosaur's pelvis weighing two tons that dates from
about 140 million years ago at a dig north of Lisbon.
	   The bone was found near Lourinha, about 75 kilometers (47 miles)
north of the capital, and is part of a sauropod _ a 20-ton,
four-legged herbivorous dinosaur, archaeologist Isabel Mateus said.
	   Parts of two other sauropods previously were found in the
Lourinha area, where last year archaeologists unearthed a nest of
dinosaur eggs containing fossilized embryos.
	   Mateus, who is working at the dig, estimated the sauropod would
have stood 20 meters (66 feet) tall.
	   Miguel Telles Antunes, a professor of archaeology at Lisbon's
New University, classified the pelvis as ``a very important
artifact'' that could broaden knowledge about the period, known as
the Upper Jurassic. Scientists know less about the Upper Jurassic
than later periods.
	   Telles Antunes told Lisbon radio TSF the find was particularly
important because it shed new light on the posture of dinosaurs.
	   Parts of skeletons and dinosaur tracks have been found in the
central region of Portugal area in recent years.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ White House intern Monica Lewinsky has been
given blanket immunity in exchange for testimony in the six-month
investigation of her relationship with President Bill Clinton, her
attorneys said Tuesday. Ms. Lewinsky's mother, Marcia Lewis, also
was granted the same level of protection from prosecution in
relation to conversations she had with her daughter about Ms.
Lewinsky's relationship with Clinton. After talking to prosecutors
for five hours on Monday, Ms. Lewinsky has agreed to testify that
she had a sexual relationship with the president, legal sources
said. Ms. Lewinsky's account also includes information relevant to
prosecutor Kenneth Starr's probe of possible obstruction of justice
by Clinton and his associates in Paula Jones' sexual harassment
case against the president, said the sources, speaking on condition
of anonymity. But she did not say Clinton asked her to lie, the
sources said. (US-CLINTON INVESTIGATION)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces drove ethnic Albanian
fighters from a major stronghold Tuesday and battled to hold the
main road through the heart of rebel territory in central Kosovo.
Government soldiers also tightened their noose around another
Kosovo Liberation Army bastion, Junik, near the border with Albania
_ the insurgents' sanctuary and source of arms. The Serbian Media
Center reported that government troops entered Malisevo, a town 25
miles (40 kilometers) southwest of the provincial capital,
Pristina. It said armed ethnic Albanians dispersed, and there were
no civilian casualties. There was no word of casualties among
fighters on both sides. In Geneva, UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski
said up to 65,000 people were believed to have been in Malisevo,
most of them refugees who fled fighting elsewhere.
(YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israeli and Palestinian officials went
back to the negotiating table Tuesday to discuss the scope of a
long overdue Israeli troop withdrawal and an American peace plan to
get it off the ground. But after three hours of talks, chief
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said no breakthrough had been
reached. Erekat said Israeli negotiators had tried to raise issues
that negate the American proposal, but those were rejected by the
Palestinians. Negotiating teams met privately in Tel Aviv for the
first time after a weeklong breakdown between the sides. The
Palestinians suspended talks July 15th after only three days,
saying Israel had offered no new ideas and was still rejecting the
U.S. peace initiative. The two sides agreed to ``contact each other
to set a time for a new meeting, which could be on Thursday,'' he
said. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIAN)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Legislation enabling the early release of about
400 paramilitary prisoners under Northern Ireland's Good Friday
peace agreement became law Tuesday after being rushed through
parliament. Mo Mowlam, the senior British politician in charge of
the province, has said that under the legislation all paramilitary
groups that maintain a cease-fire and cooperate with a commission
charged with supervising weapons handovers from the groups will
qualify for their convicted militants to be released. The releases
are expected to take place in the next two years. Early releases
for paramilitary convicts are a key provision of the April 10 peace
agreement, endorsed in a May 22 referendum. (BRITAIN-NORTHERN
IRELAND)
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Four South African men convicted
in the stoning and fatal stabbing of U.S. student Amy Biehl won
amnesties and walked free from jail on Tuesday. South Africa's
Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which is probing human rights
abuses committed in the fight against white rule, declared that the
crime was political and that the four men had told the full truth _
the two criteria needed for amnesties. The killing of the
26-year-old student at the hands of a mob five years ago drew
international attention to South Africa's racial violence. Friends
and relatives went to three separate prisons in the Cape Town area
to greet Vusumzi Ntamo, Ntobeko Peni, Mzikhona Nofemela and Mongezi
Manqina. The four were 18 to 22 years old when they stoned and
stabbed Biehl, who was white, to death in the Guguletu black
township outside Cape Town. (SOUTH AFRICA-BIEHL AMNESTY)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Blue-chip stocks tumbled Tuesday in volatile
trading as the stock market's renewed profit jitters were
compounded by worries about Monica Lewinsky's deal to testify about
her relationship with President Bill Clinton. The Dow Jones
industrial average sank 93.46 points _ or 1 percent _ to close at
8,934.78, but recovered from a 211-point plunge that put the
measure nearly 500 points below its record of 9,337.97, set less
than two weeks ago on July 17. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   FLINT, Michigan (AP) _ General Motors Corp. reached a tentative
agreement with its biggest union Tuesday to end an almost two-month
battle that virtually shut down GM's North American production and
cost the No. 1 automaker dlrs 2.2 billion, union officials said.
Negotiators resolved issues at the two striking parts plants in
Flint and also at three other locations not on strike. A dispute at
two brake plants in Dayton, Ohio, was the last obstacle to a
comprehensive settlement. The agreement announced Tuesday
``resolves all the issues that were present at all the locations
... and puts together a framework that we think we can use to then
resolve the issues at Dayton,'' UAW Vice President Richard
Shoemaker said. (US-GM-STRIKES)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Barely three weeks after Germany's Volkswagen AG
bought the company, VW and rival BMW signed a deal Tuesday to chop
the luxury carmaker in two and move production of Rolls-Royces out
of the factory in Crewe to somewhere else in England where BMW
plans a ``new'' Rolls-Royce. Analysts say VW paid too much _ 479
million pounds (dlrs 790 million) _ when it acquired Rolls-Royce
Motor Cars from the conglomerate Vickers PLC in a deal that left
out one crucial feature: the brand name. The British jet engine
maker Rolls-Royce PLC controlled the trademark and made it clear it
favored a deal with BMW, its partner in a separate aerospace
venture. (BRITAIN-ROLLS ROYCE)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In the latest mega-combination to transform the
telecommunications industry in the United States, Bell Atlantic
Corp. and GTE Corp. announced Tuesday a dlrs 52.9 billion deal that
would create the second-biggest telephone company behind AT and T.
The merger would combine Bell Atlantic's dominance of local
telephone services from Maine to Virginia with GTE's unique
offering of both local and long-distance services to mostly rural
and suburban areas scattered across the United States. The addition
of GTE would enable Bell Atlantic to crack the long-distance
market, but initially only in GTE areas. The combined behemoth
would have 63 million local telephone lines in 38 states and
revenue of dlrs 53 billion. (US-BELL ATLANTIC-GTE)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Consumer confidence fell almost 3 points in July
as Americans became more concerned that the economy will slow in
coming months and that jobs will be harder to find. The Conference
Board reported Tuesday that its index of consumer confidence fell
to 135.4 in July from a revised 138.2 reached in June, which was a
29-year high. July's decline was larger than Wall Street analysts'
had expected. Consumer sentiment is important because consumer
spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's overall economic
activity. (US-ECONOMY)
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's economy is expected to shrink by 3
percent this year because of Asia's financial turmoil, a leading
bank reported Tuesday. In a midyear review of the territory's
economy, the Hang Seng Bank said the economic adjustment, though
painful, was necessary for Hong Kong's competitiveness. It said
unemployment in Hong Kong is expected to edge up to above 5 percent
in the second half of this year, and that inflation is forecast to
fall to a 12-year low of 2 percent by the end of 1998. (HONG
KONG-ECONOMY)
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ For millions of Brazilians it
offers hope of a telephone after years of waiting. For operators
and investors it is a once-in-a-lifetime shot at a market of 160
million people in a country with just over 20 million phones.
Billed as the largest privatization in Latin America, the Brazilian
government intends to sell off a controlling stake in state-run
telecommunications giant Telebras Wednesday. The gargantuan auction
should fetch at least 13.5 billion reals (dlrs 11.7 billion).

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Popular children's show host Xuxa
Meneghel gave birth to a baby girl early Tuesday morning, following
one of the most highly publicized pregnancies in recent memory
here.
	   Articles about Xuxa, 35, shopping for baby clothes filled local
newspapers and magazines, alongside ultrasound images of the baby
as she developed in her mother's womb.
	   Brazilian television interrupted programming during the wee
hours to announce Sasha, weighing 7.2 pounds (3.3 kg) and measuring
20.4 inches (51 cms), had been at born at 12:45 a.m. (0345 GMT) by
caesarian section.
	   Live updates continued throughout the night.
	   Idolized by a generation who grew up watching her on television,
Xuxa's pregnancy caused something of a stir in predominantly
Catholic Brazil because she said she wasn't going to marry the
baby's father, model Luciano Szafir, 30.
	   Last weekend, Szafir and Xuxa couple reportedly separated. At
the time, the model said their separation would not prevent him
from attending the birth of their daughter.

	   SIROS, Greece (AP) _ The son of Albania's prime minister was
being held pending trial Tuesday, following his arrest on this
resort island for possession of a small quantity of hashish.
	   Fatos Nano's 20-year-old son Sokol was arrested Friday after
police found four cigarettes laced with hashish in his possession.
	   A trial was scheduled Wednesday, and Nano was expected to be
released after paying a fine.
	   Nano has for the past year been studying at the University of
Salonica, in northern Greece.
	   ___
	   MADRID, Spain, (AP) _ An aquarium in a playground for the rich
is inviting people to scuba-dive with baby sharks.
	   Starting Wednesday, visitors to the Puerto Banus Aquarium in the
Spanish resort of Marbella can pay 6,000 pesetas (40 dollars) for a
guided look at undersea life.
	   Inside the aquarium are small sharks, stingrays, lobsters and
bright yellow lemon fish.
	   Then there's the pale pink damsel fish, which has blue and green
stripes and changes its sex from female to male.
	   Eva Maria Luna, a spokeswoman for the aquarium said scuba-diving
in the tank was safe.
	   ``Many people don't dare because they think you need to be an
athlete in great physical condition. You don't. All you need to do
is breathe and swim.''
	   Those who want to take the plunge must pass a short training
course and go down with a professional scuba diver as a lifeguard.
	   Once underwater they can even feed the sharks -- 14 babies about
a foot long (30 cm) and an adult about twice that size.
	   ___
	   VIRGINIA BEACH, Virginia (AP) _ Rapper ODB was MIA on Tuesday.
	   A judge issued a warrant for his arrest when the member of the
popular group The Wu-Tang Clan failed to appear in court on a
shoplifting charge.
	   The rapper, whose real name is Russell Tyrone Jones, allegedly
stole a dlrs 50 pair of Nike shoes from a store in Virginia Beach
on July 4, three days after walking out of a New York hospital with
gunshot wounds he suffered during an apparent robbery.
	   No lawyer appeared Tuesday in General District Court to
represent ODB, 29. He had concerts scheduled for Tuesday and
Wednesday nights at the Key Club in West Hollywood, Calif.
	   Wu-Tang Clan's record label, Loud, referred calls about ODB to
the Elektra Entertainment Group, which handles his solo recordings.
Jana Fleishman, a publicist for Elektra in New York, said the
company had no comment.
	   In February, ODB crashed the stage at the Grammys and hijacked a
microphone from Shawn Colvin. He apparently was upset at losing the
best rap album Grammy to Puff Daddy.
	   ___
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Mike Tyson is ready to take a swipe at acting.
	   The boxer, who's expected to return to the ring soon, has agreed
to play himself in the film ``Black and White,'' the Daily News
reported Tuesday
	   Set in the Big Apple, the script involves white prep school
students who have a ``reckless infatuation with black hip-hop
life,'' director James Toback said.
	   The plot deals with the murder of a black child and the
protection of the murderer by a white student's father.
	   Tyson is involved because one of the central characters admires
him.
	   ``I've known Mike for years. I think he's going to be great,''
he said.
	   ___
	   ALTHORPE, England (AP) _ Villagers in Althorpe are getting used
to befuddled tourists heading the wrong way to Princess Diana's
grave.
	   And the only help they can offer: Turn south, drive 120 miles
(200 kms) or so and there you are.
	   The tourists' confusion is easily understood. Diana is buried on
the grounds of Althorp House in Northamptonshire, 65 miles (100
kms) northwest of London. But most maps don't show the house, just
the nearby village of Great Brington.
	   Some maps do show Althorpe, a village 185 miles (300 kms) north
of London.
	   Yvonne Sleight, who runs the Lansdowne House Hotel in Althorpe,
said lost travelers had been turning up since the princess' death
last year.
	   ``They are usually quite intelligent people but I don't think
they have researched their trip very well,'' Mrs. Sleight said.
	   ``They are a bit gobsmacked (shocked) when they realize they are
in the wrong place.''

Ullrich, Pantani do best to make Tour forget drug scnadal

1600 GMT &QL;

	   ALBERTVILLE, France (AP) _ A stirring duel between the defending
champion and, perhaps, future champion almost made the drug
problems of the Tour de France seem far away.
	   Almost.
	   Jan Ullrich waged a head-to-head battle with current leader
Marco Pantani over the last 60 kilometers (37 miles) of Tuesday's
Tour de France stage.
	   For 90 minutes they rode together, Pantani most of the time just
behind Ullrich's wheel, before finally sharing some pace setting
duties.
	   At the end less than two centimeters separated them with Ullrich
winning the 16th stage. Third was Bobby Julich, nearly two minutes
behind.
	   The American barely held on to second in the overall standings,
14 seconds ahead of Ullrich but 5 minutes, 42 seconds behind
Pantani.
	   Ullrich practically conceded his title to Pantani.
	   ``I tip my hat to him. He's the winner of the next Tour de
France,'' Ullrich said.
	   But Pantani was cautious: ``The Tour is not finished yet,'' he
said.
	   While Ullrich was being congratulated for his stage victory and
Pantani being given the leader's yellow jersey to wear for another
day, two other teams on the Tour were being investigated for drug
misuse.
	   Police on Tuesday seized suspect medication in a van driven by
officials of the Bigmat team.
	   Around 100 doses of medication were found in briefcases among
the team's bags during a routine inspection by customs officials in
Chambery, on the Franco-Swiss border near Albertville.
	   The drugs were sent to a police laboratory in the city of Lyon
for analysis, police said.
	   Bigmat is the third team under scrutiny over allegations of drug
use.
	   Festina has been thrown out of the race for the use of EPO,
while officials from the Dutch TVM team are also being investigated
for supplying the banned doping substance.
	   Police on Tuesday night conducted a search of the TVM hotel in
Albertville at the request of an investigating judge.
	   With new drug revelations happening again, Ullrich and Pantani
did their best to keep the exciting action on the road.
	   Ullrich took off and only Pantani followed among the small group
of favorites heading up the 20-kilometer (12.5 mile) peak of
Madeleine.
	   ``I wanted to show I was still here,'' Ullrich said. ``It was
important for the future to have a day like today.''
	   He lost nine minutes to Pantani in wet conditions on Monday.
	   ``I was much better in this stage and I wanted to attack as a
way of thanking my team, who have worked so hard for me on the
Tour,'' said Ullrich.
	   Over the last 40 kilometers (25 miles) the pair went downhill at
speeds approaching 100 kph (61 mph).
	   Only on the final flat of more than 10 kilometers (6 miles) did
Pantani share pace-setting chores with Ullrich to maintain their
gap over the others.
	   ``It was difficult today,'' Pantani said. ``Jan was very strong.
After his bad day (Monday) he made a different race today.''
	   In the final stretch both sprinted and Ullrich came out ahead
but just barely over Pantani.
	   Wednesday's 17th stage is the last full day in the Alps from
Albertville to Aix les Bains, 149 kilometers (92.6 miles) with
three climbs but ending with a long downhill.
	   The Tour ends Sunday.

Basketball-crazy Greeks get chance to win another title

expected by 1700 GMT &QL;

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greek basketball fans know a great chance
when they see one.
	   ``We made our mark on basketball when we won (the 1987) European
Championship,'' said Achilles Kontouris, who runs a bar-restaurant
just around the corner from the Acropolis.
	   ``If the big-name Americans were here, maybe it would be better
for my business. But this is better for our basketball,'' he added.
	   The Greeks are Europe's most passionate basketball fans. They're
also renown for violence. Clashes with Spanish police three months
ago in the European club championship forced Barcelona organizers
to cage in 5,000 AEK Athens fans and arrest dozens.
	   Greek basketball federation president George Vasilakopoulos has
promised ``draconian measures'' when the 12-day championship
started Wednesday at 18,000-seat Olympic stadium and 14,000 Peace
and Friendship stadium.
	   ``Whether it's politics or sports, Greeks can get violent about
it,'' said Helia Lioulia, a 21-year-old working behind the counter
at a downtown art store as temperatures hovered around 40 C (104 F)
outside. ``My boyfriend wants to go, but I'm a little afraid of the
violence sometimes.''
	   ``Anything Greeks do, they do in a loud way. You don't see many
quiet Greeks.''
	   The winner Aug. 9 could be one of eight or nine teams including
the no-name Americans. Yugoslavia won the worlds in 1990, the last
time the United States didn't field a Dream Team.
	   But Yugoslavia _ like the United States and almost every other
team here _ is minus NBA players due to the lockout. Only Australia
is expected to have Dallas Mavericks center Chris Anstey.
	   Yugoslavia is missing the NBA's Vlade Divac and will key around
four Europe-based players _ center Zeljko Rebraca, playmaker
Aleksander Djordjecvic and forwards Dejan Bodiroga and Vlado
Scepanovic.
	   The contenders? A long list would include Lithuania, Yugoslavia,
the United States, Russia, Italy, Greece and Canada. Countries like
Spain and Argentina could also be in there.
	   The Americans and coach Rudy Tomjanovich opened Wednesday with
Brazil and face Lithuania on Thursday and South Korea Friday in
first-round games.
	   Tomjanovich tentatively listed his starting five as Jason
Sasser, Michael Hawkins, Jimmy Oliver, David Wood and Gerard King,
a mix of CBA and European club players that epitomizes the mishmash
put together when the all-stars were dropped four weeks ago.
	   ``We're going to use defense as our foundation,'' Tomjanovich
said Tuesday. The Americans have been impressive in three
exhibition wins over Spain, France and Italy. ``So far, we've done
a great job on the boards and that will be our key.''
	   The newest member of the 12-man U.S. team is Duke standout
Trajan Langdon, who was dropped last week in the final cut and then
called back from the United States when Mateen Cleaves was lost
with a sprained ankle in Saturday's 80-75 win over Italy.
	   ``Obviously, being cut was a big disappointment,'' he said. ``I
feel bad now for my teammate (Cleaves), but it's good to be back.''
	   ``At first I was worried about the NBA guys resenting us
playing,'' he added. ``But I talked to coach K (Duke coach Mike
Krzyzewski) and he said not to worry about it, `You're not in the
NBA yet'.''
	   In opening games Wednesday: South Korea vs. Lithuania, Japan vs.
Russia, United States vs. Brazil, Yugoslavia vs. Puerto Rico,
Nigeria vs. Spain, Senegal vs. Italy, Australia vs. Argentina,
Greece vs. Canada.

U.S. boxers have solid day against Cubans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Benitez victory over Mantila &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A 17-year-old ranked No. 2 in the United States
kept a very good day for U.S. boxers at the Goodwill Games rolling
Tuesday with a decision over a world champion from Cuba.
	   Roberto Benitez outpointed flyweight champ Manuel Mantilla 12-8.
It was the fifth quarterfinal victory for U.S. fighters on the
second day of boxing, and the third over a Cuban foe.
	   Another Marquette boxer, 20-year-old Teaunce Shepherd, beat
Rudinelson Hardy of Cuba 16-3 in the opening featherweight bout at
the Theater at Madison Square Garden, before Ricardo Williams Jr.,
of Cincinnati beat Damian Austin 6-2 at light-welterweight.
	   ``At the beginning of the fight, I felt like I had to establish
my jab to get some respect from my opponent, and it worked,''
Shepherd said. ``There's an intimidation factor involved with Cuban
boxers, an aura, but I feel like it's coming to an end.''
	   Also posting victories were flyweight John Medina, who edged
world championship bronze medalist Omar Varvaes of Argentina 9-8;
and Jermain Taylor, who beat light-middleweight Nurzhin Smanov of
Kazahkstan by the same score.
	   The only losses for Americans in the early going came in the
light-heavyweight division, where Cuba's Isael Alvarez beat Anthony
Stewart of Chicago 7-2; and super-heavy, where Paolo Vidoz of Italy
beat Keith Govan of Phoenix 8-1.
	   In an unusual early round meeting of top-name international
boxers, world championship silver Paata Gvasaliya of Russia stopped
Lukas Koneecny, the bronze medalist, at 1:12 of the fourth round in
their light-welterweight fight.

Tune out of Bledisloe Cup test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Australian winger Ben Tune was
Wednesday ruled out of Australia's Bledisloe Cup and Tri Nations
rugby union test against New Zealand in Christchurch on Saturday.
	   Tune has a chronic knee injury which forced him from the field
during Australia's 14-13 loss to South Africa in Perth on July 18.
	   Jason Little has recovered from a calf strain and will take
Tune's place on the wing, while Damian Smith retained his place on
the bench.
	   Prop Richard Harry was earlier ruled out also with a knee
injury, with Dan Crowley staying in the front row.
	   Australia has a 1-0 lead going into the second Bledisloe test
and has its best chance of winning the Cup since its one-off test
win in 1994.
	   The Australian team: Matt Burke, Jason Little, Daniel Herbert,
Tim Horan, Joe Roff, Stephen Larkham, George Gregan, Toutai Kefu,
David Wilson, Matt Cockbain, John Eales (captain), Tom Bowman,
Andrew Blades, Phil Kearns, Dan Crowley. Reserves: Chris Whittaker,

Bildt challenges Sweden to abandon tax-and-spend ways
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GRISSLEHAMN, Sweden (AP) _ With pleasure boats bobbing in the
small harbor and shoppers dawdling over coffee at a red clapboard
cafe, Grisslehamn seems the essence of a country basking in
comfort. But Carl Bildt sees Sweden as a nation on the skids.
	   In a speech in Grisslehamn, 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of
Stockholm, that was the symbolic opening of his campaign for prime
minister, Bildt portrayed Sweden as a country crippled by high
taxes and afraid to face the future.
	   Bildt, who was prime minister in 1990-94, sees the Sept. 20
national elections as a watershed for Sweden: the point at which it
decides whether to plunge into the competition of an increasingly
globalized economy, or stay aloof, sticking to the high-tax social
democratic ways that have dominated Sweden this century.
	   For Bildt, the choice is clear. ``I do not accept ... that
Sweden will have higher taxes and worse standards than most other
countries in the European Union,'' he said in the Saturday speech.
``Socialism is dead.''
	   But for Swedes, the choice is murky. One of four people
questioned in a survey published Tuesday were undecided how they
would vote.
	   Of those with an opinion, 39.5 percent supported the governing
Social Democrats, 26.5 percent supported Bildt's conservative
Moderates and the others scattering their picks among five smaller
parties, said the poll conducted by the Gallup company and
published in the business newspaper Dagens Industri.
	   The Social Democrats, meanwhile, contend that Sweden is on
course for the future. Unemployment is down to 6.9 percent after
rising into double digits during the economic crisis of the early
'90s, the government foresees a budget surplus by 2000 and there's
enough money coming in that the government will lower cigarette
taxes by 8.5 kronor (dlrs 1.1) a pack in August.
	   A painful point for the government is that Sweden's cherished
and widely admired public medical care system has deteriorated in
the past several years because of funding cuts, with frequent media
reports on overcrowded hospital wards and yearlong waits for
surgery.
	   ``When it comes to queues for the treatment of usual sickenesses
and operations, we should have zero tolerance,'' said Bildt, who
proposes expanding the nascent privatized medical care system.
	   The medical system, along with Sweden's other extensive social
services, is funded through taxes that are among the world's
highest: national and local income tax totals about 55 percent of
income. Bildt's Moderates propose cutting the national by five
percentage points.
	   It is unclear if that would be enough to satisfy the concerns of
Swedish companies, including telecommunications giant LM Ericsson,
that have threatened to move their headquarters out of the country
unless taxes are lowered.
	   Many of the companies also are concerned over Sweden's decision
to stay out of the first round of the European Union's
single-currency plan, a move that Bildt views as a crucial mistake.
	   ``Sweden has Europe's most pusillanimous government,'' he said.
``They are afraid of the future.''

Laver improved a day after stroke

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Tennis great Rod Laver was conscious and off
the critical list, a day after he had a moderate stroke while being
interviewed for a television show, a doctor said.
	   Laver, who turns 60 on Aug. 9, was in serious condition in the
intensive care unit at UCLA Medical Center.
	   ``He's definitely not paralyzed,'' said Dr. Neil Martin,
co-director of the hospital's stroke center.
	   However, Martin said Tuesday, Laver ``is not entirely out of the
woods yet.''
	   The redhaired left-hander was still having some difficulty
speaking and had some problems with his right arm and right leg.
Surgery was not planned unless Laver's condition deteriorates,
Martin told reporters during a news conference outside the
hospital.
	   ``He's in good spirits, the best possible spirits as one can
expect,'' Martin said.
	   Laver will likely remain in the hospital for a week to 10 days,
Martin said.
	   ``It's impossible to say if he's going to have 100 percent
recovery,'' Martin said. ``He should improve dramatically over the
next couple months.''
	   Several family members waiting to visit Laver refused comment
earlier, referring all questions to the hospital.
	   Laver, an Australian who lives in Newport Beach, California, is
the only tennis player to win two Grand Slams _ as an amateur in
1962 and as a professional seven years later.
	   The doctor said Laver's ``excellent physical condition''
improves his ``potential for recovery.''
	   ESPN spokesman Rob Tobias said Laver was stricken Monday
afternoon during an interview by a freelance crew at the Westwood
Marquis Hotel near UCLA. The ESPN special will feature the
century's greatest athletes.
	   Within minutes, Laver suddenly developed a severe headache,
began slurring his words and having trouble with his right hand,
Martin said. However, he was never unconscious, the doctor said.
	   ``As soon as the crew saw there was a problem, they sought
prompt medical attention,'' Tobias said. ``Fortunately, UCLA
Medical Center is located within a couple blocks of where the
interview was being taped.''
	   Nicknamed ``Rocket'' for his powerful ground strokes, Laver is
the only player to have won the Australian, French and U.S.
championships and Wimbledon in one calendar year twice.
	   He was the world's No. 1 player in 1961, 1962, 1968 and 1969,
and was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in
1981.
	   Laver won 11 Grand Slam singles titles, one fewer than career
leader Roy Emerson. Bjorn Borg and Pete Sampras have also won 11
Grand Slam events.
	   Laver won Wimbledon four times, the Australian Open three times
and the U.S. and French opens twice each. He also won nine Grand
Slam doubles championships.
	   During a 23-year career, Laver won 47 pro singles titles and was
runner-up 22 times. He also starred for Australia in the Davis Cup,
with records of 16-4 in singles and 4-0 in doubles. During one
stretch, Australia won the Davis Cup 15 times in 18 years.
	   ``He's been an incredible role model for all of us,'' said
current Australian standout Patrick Rafter, the No. 1 seed in the
Mercedes-Benz Cup tournament being played on the UCLA campus. ``He
was a fantastic player, but definitely I see him more as an idol
and someone I can look up to and respect.
	   ``I feel proud when I'm out on the court because he's done so
much for us already and he's laid the foundation. I just want to
keep it going.''
	   Rafter, 25, is ranked fifth in the world. He will defend his
U.S. Open championship later this summer.

Dollar lower in Tokyo, Japanese stocks decline slightly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen in early
trading Wednesday on optimism a veteran politician known for his
financial expertise will become Japan's next finance minister.
Tokyo stocks declined slightly.
	   The dollar bought 140.99 yen in early trading, down 0.95 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate of
141.35 yen overnight.
	   The dollar lost ground against the yen after Japanese papers
reported former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, a ruling party
elder and economic policy wonk, was likely to be named as finance
minister, traders said.
	   Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, who is expected to be voted in
Thursday as Japan's next prime minister, has been courting Miyazawa
to serve as finance minister in his Cabinet.
	   Obuchi has pledged to appoint a political heavyweight as finance
minister in order to speed efforts to stimulate the sluggish
Japanese economy and carry out needed economic reforms.
	   In New York, the dollar weakened in part due to a drop in U.S.
stock prices and concern about a former White House intern's
decision to testify about her relationship with President Clinton,
traders said.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, meanwhile, share prices opened
lower following the decline overnight on Wall Street.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues fell
23.33 points, or 0.14 percent, to 16,091.21 in the first half hour
of trading. On Tuesday, it gained 170.18 points, or 1.07 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section lost 1.84 points, or 0.15 percent, to 1,240.38. It
had risen 8.24 points, or 0.67 percent, the previous day.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.305 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.310 percent,
driving its price up to 111.05 yen from 111.03 yen.

Serbs reportedly capture major rebel stronghold in Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Even as Serb forces continue to deal
ethnic Albanian separatists another setback on the battlefield,
diplomat efforts to bring peace to Kosovo apparently are beginning
to show progress.
	   Serb forces ousted rebel fighters from the major stronghold of
Malisevo on Tuesday, the latest in a series of setbacks suffered by
the Kosovo Liberation Army, whose firepower is vastly inferior to
that of the government forces. Serb forces also continued their
siege of Junik, 80 kilometers (50 miles) to southwest of Pristina.
	   There was no word of casualties among fighters on both sides.
	   The upsurge in fighting during the last ten days has caused tens
of thousands of civilians to flee their homes. But even as the
death toll has risen in the Serbian province, diplomats apparently
see a glimmer of hope.
	   An American-led effort to forge a broad-based Kosovo Albanian
bargaining team to initiative peace talks with Serb authorities is
beginning to bear fruit, the U.S. State Department said Tuesday.
	   Spokesman James P. Rubin said an ``all-party executive'' is
being formed for the purpose of negotiating a cease-fire with the
Serbs and achieving a degree of self-government for Kosovo's
dominant Albanian population.
	   ``We hope we'll be able to put this together very soon,'' Rubin
said.
	   In Pristina, the Serbian Media Center reported that government
troops entered the town of Malisevo, about 40 kilometers (25 miles)
southwest of Pristina, late Tuesday. It said armed ethnic Albanians
dispersed, and there were no civilian casualties.
	   The Kosovo Information Center quoted an Albanian writer who
lives near Malisevo, Xhevdet Bajraj, as confirming that the rebels
had pulled out of the town and that ``only civilians have been left
behind.''
	   Bajraj appealed to the International Committee of the Red Cross
to help the ``tens of thousands'' of civilians, including many
refugees, stranded in Malisevo.
	   Last week, the Red Cross said that many of the 40,000 civilians
who fled fighting in another town, Orahovac, had taken shelter in
Malisevo. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimated that
half of the Orahovac refugees had fled to Malisevo.
	   The rebels are fighting for the independence of Kosovo, whose
population of 2 million people is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
	   KLA commander Gani Shehu, speaking from Junik, told Albanian
Television in a phone interview that the town sheltering thousands
of refugees was being shelled non-stop from several directions as
Serb forces pursued their siege.
	   Shehu said dozens of children were wounded and a 17-year-old
youth, Mehmet Zekaj, was killed.
	   In Geneva, UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski said up to 65,000
people were believed to have been in Malisevo, normally a small
town, including about 20,000 refugees from Orahovac.
	   Serbian police estimate that there are about 2,000 people
trapped in Junik, including about 1,000 are ``highly trained'' KLA
troops.
	   The Serb center also said Yugoslav troops prevented a group of
KLA fighters from escaping into Albania about 90 kilometers (55
miles) southwest of here. The center said dozens of fighters
surrendered.
	   Meanwhile, ethnic Albanians said that KLA fighters Tuesday
ambushed a military convoy in a valley near the village Lapusnik,
25 kilometers (15 mile) west of Pristina.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ In a barren valley amid the desert hills
outside Lima, foreign executives and Peru's wealthy line up at the
Over-the-Hill gun club to blast semiautomatic pistols at cardboard
silhouettes.
	   Once, the targets represented leftist rebels out to kidnap or
execute the rich. Now they are cash-hungry criminals, and the
shooting has an urgency not seen since the height of Peru's
guerrilla war, members say.
	   ``We're no longer shooting for fun. We're shooting for survival.
The criminals are more dangerous than the rebels,'' says Jose
Carlos Laredo, a prominent lawyer.
	   A wave of violent crime fed by poverty, corrupt cops and weapons
left over from the guerrilla war that wound down in the early 1990s
has rattled Peru's elite, who are arming themselves once again.
	   Violent crime in Lima has tripled since 1992, with a staggering
one-third of the capital's residents falling victim to a violent
crime last year, according to police and government statistics.
	   Nervous executives have flooded the Over-the-Hill club to learn
how to shoot, Laredo says. The row of Mercedes Benzes in the gravel
parking lot backs his claim.
	   Across Latin America, cities that once prided themselves on low
crime rates are facing surges in crime, helping to make Latin
America the world's most violent region as measured by murder
rates.
	   Latin America now averages 30 homicides for every 100,000
people, six times the world average and four times the rate in the
United States, according to United Nations figures.
	   In Mexico City, crime has exploded in the past four years. The
number of attacks on tourists has doubled this year, with 20
attacks each day, says Maria del Pilar Hiroishi, secretary of
tourism for the Mexico City legislature.
	   In Santiago, Chile, Latin America's model for development with a
burgeoning free-market economy, armed robbery soared 62 percent
between 1995 and 1997, according to the Civic Peace Foundation, a
private research center.
	   ``We used to watch American gangster films and think, 'Those
people are crazy up there.' Now those films seem boring,'' says
Edgar Vigo, owner of Grovi, one of Peru's largest private security
companies.
	   Most Over-the-Hill club members have taken classes on how to
drive to escape kidnappers. They take different routes to work each
day and live in walled-in suburbs protected by armed guards.
	   Fearing investor flight, President Alberto Fujimori decreed
draconian anti-crime legislation in May that stiffens sentences and
allows authorities to try violent criminals as ``terrorists'' in
the secret military courts it uses to process suspected guerrillas.
	   Fujimori also put the feared National Intelligence Service,
which has been linked to human rights abuses, in charge of breaking
up kidnapping gangs.
	   Human rights groups warn the moves will turn Peru into a virtual
police state, but most Lima residents support the president. Polls
say nearly 80 percent of the city's residents consider crime the
most serious problem they face, far outstripping poverty.
	   ``We have learned that without firmness there will be no
order,'' said Fujimori, who gained fame for crushing the rebels and
hyperinflation.
	   What most terrifies Lima's upper and middle classes is a wave of
``quickie kidnappings'' usually lasting less than a day.
	   Kidnapping victims are forced to empty their bank accounts and
often their homes under threat of death, torture or rape. Richer
victims are sometimes held for days and tortured to get them to
reveal their assets.
	   An average of 12 kidnappings happen every day in Lima, says
Sergio Zimic, director of Peruvian operations for Miami-based
American Security, which bullet proofs cars.
	   A Canadian geologist working in Peru who was kidnapped along
with his wife as they left a posh restaurant, estimates one of
every three of his foreign colleagues has been a victim of a
``quickie kidnapping.''
	   He wants to return to Canada. ``It's not livable in Lima
anymore,'' he says, asking to remain anonymous because of anxiety
about kidnappers.
	   Peru's crime is partly a legacy of the war against leftist
guerrillas that has killed 30,000 people since 1980, experts say.
Many of the weapons once used by the revolutionaries ended up in
the hands of criminals.
	   In addition, as part of a campaign to clean up Lima's corrupt
police force, authorities have been firing corrupt officers and
many have turned to crime, officials say. Some 1,200 were kicked
off the force in 1995 alone.
	   ``What we have seen in the past year is the organization of
these people from individual criminals into heavily armed gangs,''
says retired Gen. Hector Jhon-Caro, former head of Peru's
anti-terrorism police.

	   YAGUACHI, Ecuador (AP) _ Dozens of townsfolk helped beat murder
suspect Washington Piloso to death. But when police came, no one
admitted to seeing a thing.
	   Residents of this poor farming town caught Piloso on June 20 and
accused him of killing an off-duty police officer during a robbery.
	   They stripped him to his underwear and kicked him savagely while
he crawled through the dust of the sun-baked dirt street, police
say. The mob doused him in gasoline and were about to burn him
alive when police intervened. Piloso died two hours later in a
hospital.
	   No one has identified the attackers. And no one seems upset by
the killing.
	   ``Everyone said he was a criminal. It's good he was killed,''
says shopkeeper Juan Garcia.
	   In rural villages and urban slums across Ecuador, residents are
lynching, beating or burning suspected criminals in growing
numbers, handing out the justice they say the law fails to provide.
	   Mobs killed 24 crime suspects in 1997 and lynched 12 in the
first five months of this year, police say.
	   Many of the vigilante killings take place in remote Indian
communities where there is little police presence and residents
apply their own laws for crimes ranging from murder to cattle
rustling.
	   Defenders of vigilante justice say communities must protect
themselves against rising lawlessness because police don't.
	   ``It is a very serious social symptom. People no longer believe
in judges'' and the justice system, says Francisco Bolona,
president of the Supreme Court in Guayaquil, Ecuador's biggest city
about a half-hour drive from Yaguachi.
	   Police say they can do little about Piloso's killing without the
support of the community.
	   ``Investigating the lynching is difficult because nobody admits
to knowing anything, even though many people were present,'' says
Guayaquil's police chief, Jorge Molina.
	   Five days after Piloso died, a mob in the village of Flavio
Alfaro north of Guayaquil beat and burned a man they suspected of
raping a 4-year-old girl.
	   The mob also beat the man's mother when she tried to stop them.
She ran to the police station to get help, but the mob threatened
to burn the officers alive if they tried to intervene. They stayed
at the station.
	   In the resort town of Playas on the Pacific coast, residents
tried to drag a man they suspected of raping a child from a holding
cell in the police station. They were stopped, and he turned out to
be the wrong man.

The poorest of Haiti's poor depend on U.S. combat medics
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ They have every imaginable ailment,
from oozing lesions to cancerous tumors.
	   The only medical care they can count on comes from a handful of
American soldiers still in Haiti nearly four years after the U.S.
military intervention.
	   Neither Haiti's state hospital nor its elected government,
restored to power by U.S. troops in 1994, can afford to treat them.
	   Every Wednesday, residents of Pele _ one of the worst slums in
the Western Hemisphere _ line up at the Missionary Brothers of
Charity school to wait under the boiling sun to be treated by
medics attached to the U.S. Support Group.
	   Raymonde Pierre-Gustave's pelvis was crushed when she got pinned
between two trucks. The 34-year-old spent three days at the State
University Hospital before she was kicked out _ untreated.
	   ``They said no doctor was available and that there was nothing
the matter with me,'' Pierre-Gustave said, lying painfully on a
bench in the courtyard while waiting to be seen by U.S. Army
medics.
	   The Army Medical Task Force in Haiti has 13 officers and 36
enlisted personnel normally assigned to Fort Hood, Texas. It is
part of the 250- to 300-soldier U.S. Support Group, which includes
engineers who are building wells and schools. About 130 of the
soldiers are security personnel.
	   ``This is valuable hands-on training, as close as a medic can
get to combat experience,'' said Capt. Kevin Duffy of Gilbert,
Minnesota, the field hospital's executive officer.
	   Put into operation in March 1996, the support group was
gradually detached from the 20,000-member U.S.-led multinational
force that intervened in September 1994 to disband Haiti's
murderous army and restore a democratically elected government.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton extended the support group's mission
until the end of this year, despite objections from Republican
congressmen who worry about the risks and expense of open-ended
involvement in Haiti.
	   ``The American people should know it's not a military
operation,'' Clinton insisted in December.
	   The mission likely will be extended again if Haitian President
Rene Preval asks.
	   Support group medics treat U.S. military and embassy personnel
as well as 300 U.N. civilian police instructors. But they devote
most of their work to ``the poorest of poor Haitians,'' said the
field hospital's commander, Maj. James Swenson, an orthopedic
surgeon from Seattle.
	   The medics hold clinics at a half-dozen sites in slums
throughout Port-au-Prince to examine hundreds of ailing people
daily. The most serious cases are sent to the U.S. Army field
hospital, which with 14 beds is the best-equipped medical facility
in Haiti.
	   Since 1996, U.S. military medical units have helped more than
60,000 Haitians, including 11,500 outpatients in the past five
months. Swenson has performed 150 operations since his tour of duty
began in February.
	   ``Whatever we give them is better than what they are getting
from their (Haitian) brothers,'' said Staff Sgt. Donald Pena of San
Antonio.
	   On a recent Wednesday, he and other soldiers treated 300
patients at the Missionaries of Charity compound in Pele.
	   The day's patients included Borneus Commissaire, 35, whose left
leg was crushed in August 1996 when a dump truck he was loading
tipped over. He spent three months at the State University
Hospital, but received no care. Then he suffered untended at home
before seeking help from the medics.
	   ``When he was brought in, maggots had eaten the flesh back and
you could see the bone,'' said Swenson, who amputated Commissaire's
leg below the knee in June.
	   About 75 percent of Haiti's 7.2 million people live in absolute
poverty, and 40 percent have no access to modern medical care. The
State University Hospital, which caters to the urban poor, has a 30
percent mortality rate.
	   Haiti's leaders seem unable or unwilling to cope. The country
hasn't had a fully functional government for more than a year
because of political squabbling. The economy has slumped, and the
Health Ministry hasn't received a 1998 budget.
	   The contrast between the impeccable, air-conditioned tent that
is the field hospital and the grisly shantytowns the patients come
from is striking.
	   Wounds fester and gangrene sets in. Unset broken bones cripple
the injured. Fetuses that die in the womb aren't removed, and their
mothers die.
	   That is the rule, not the exception, Swenson said.
	   ``The living standard here is unimaginable to people back
home,'' he said.

Stevenson upsets No. 8 seed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STANFORD, California (AP) _ San Diego's Alexandra Stevenson, who
decided to try her hand at qualifying rather than receive an
automatic bid, reached the round of 16 in the Bank of the West
women's tennis tournament Tuesday with a 6-1, 7-5 victory over No.
8 seed Rita Grande of Italy.
	   Stevenson was offered, but turned down, a wild card spot in the
tournament.
	   ``It was better at this point because I haven't played a lot of
matches,'' said Stevenson, who turns 18 in December. ``It was the
first time I qualified into a WTA event and it feels great.''
	   Stevenson's victory in the first round means a match against
either top seed Lindsay Davenport or first-round winner Kimberly
Po, who play on Wednesday.
	   In other matches, Amy Frazier defeated Janet Lee 3-6, 6-2, 6-3;
Po beat Australia's Nicole Pratt 7-5, 6-0; Ukraine's Elena
Tatarkova topped Sandra Caci 7-6 (7-1), 2-6, 7-5; and France's
Anne-Gaelle Sidot defeated Japan's Miho Saeki 7-6 (7-4), 2-6, 6-3.
	   ``My plan was to come out hitting because I knew she got in
later than most of the girls,'' said Stevenson, a senior at La
Jolla Country Day School. ``I don't know if she's heard of me
before.''
	   Stevenson, ranked 192nd in the world, hadn't played since
failing to qualify for Wimbledon.
	   ``I haven't been out there a lot,'' Stevenson said. ``If I play
a lot, I could move up quickly.''
	   In late matches, Mary Joe Fernandez was scheduled to play Chanda
Rubin and Jennifer Capriati was to meet Corina Morariu.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Four South African men convicted
in the stoning and fatal stabbing of U.S. student Amy Biehl are
free, having won amnesties from the commission probing abuses
committed during the country's apartheid era.
	   South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission declared that
the crime was political and that the four men had told the full
truth _ the two criteria needed for amnesties.
	   The brutal killing of the 26-year-old student at the hands of a
mob five years ago drew international attention to South Africa's
racial violence.
	   Friends and relatives went to three separate prisons in the Cape
Town area to greet Vusumzi Ntamo, Ntobeko Peni, Mzikhona Nofemela
and Mongezi Manqina when they were freed Tuesday.
	   The four were 18 to 22 years old when they stoned and stabbed
Biehl, who was white, to death in the Guguletu black township
outside Cape Town. They were among a crowd of blacks who attacked
her car and then chased her down the street.
	   Walking out of Brandvlei prison, in Worcester, 135 kilometers
(85 miles) northeast of Cape Town, Manqina said he was happy to be
released. His mother and other relatives hugged and kissed him.
	   ``We can't believe that he is out,'' said his mother, Evelyn
Manqina. ``As a mother I am very happy, but on the other side I am
not happy. I feel the pain of Mrs. Biehl. I am not glad because of
what my child has done.''
	   Biehl's parents, Peter and Linda Biehl had attended the amnesty
hearing and publicly forgave their daughter's killers after they
apologized for the slaying.
	   In a statement from their home in La Quinta, California, the
Biehls said they supported the amnesty decision.
	   ``We hope they will receive the support necessary to live
productive lives in a nonviolent atmosphere. In fact, we hope the
spirits of Amy and of those like her will be a force in their new
lives,'' the family said.
	   Biehl, a Fulbright scholar, was in South Africa to help with
voter registration for the nation's first all-race election in 1994
that ended apartheid.
	   The four killers, convicted and sentenced to 18 years in prison
for the murder, testified at their amnesty hearing that they
believed their political leaders wanted them to attack whites _
also called ``settlers'' by black militants _ to highlight the
grievances of blacks.
	   They cited the ``one settler, one bullet'' slogan of the Pan
Africanist Congress, a radical black group.

Food pours into southern Sudan, but the starving keep dying

	   AJIEP, Sudan (AP) _ Relief food is pouring into southern Sudan
in the world's largest relief operation, but starving Sudanese are
still dying by the thousands.
	   Why is the food aid not helping? And why is nothing being done
to stop the 15-year civil war that has created yet another famine
in Africa's largest country?
	   An estimated 1.5 million people have died in the civil war, and
the arable land lies fallow. Ongoing violence keeps farmers from
their fields.
	   Earlier this month, U.N. World Food Program director Catherine
Bertini urged the international community to stop the Sudan war. On
Wednesday, she will address the issue again before a U.S.
congressional committee.
	   The United Nations and individual governments condemn the
endless killing and call for emergency food relief for an estimated
2.6 million people in rebel- and government-held areas of Sudan.
But those with influence don't seem able or willing to end the war.
	   Aid agencies can only deal with the war's effects.
	   The U.N. pogram is air-dropping 9,500 tons of food per month _
at a cost of dlrs 30 million _ into southern Sudan in the world's
largest aid operation.
	   ``We recognize we have an advocacy responsibility on behalf of
people ... to blow the bells and whistles to alert others to
respond,'' said Michael Sackett, WFP's eastern Africa regional
manager.
	   ``In the meantime we do the best possible job, short-term and
Band-Aid though it is.''
	   The United States, which tacitly supports the Sudan People's
Liberation Army in its fight against Sudan's Islamic government, is
the largest donor, with dlrs 75 million in contributions this year.
	   Late last year, WFP estimated 250,000 people in southern Sudan
would need food aid by spring because of poor harvests.
	   But in January, a failed attack by SPLA forces on Wau, the
government-held capital of Bahr el-Ghazal province, resulted in
widespread looting of food stocks and a government ban on further
relief flights into the area.
	   An estimated 100,000 people fled Wau, abandoning fields that
could have provided food.
	   It took two months of behind-the-scenes negotiations before
relief flights could resume. By then, famine had set in.
	   ``Why do governments support the SPLA for years and not respond
to a humanitarian crisis?'' lamented WFP spokeswoman Michele
Quintaglie.
	   At a feeding center in Ajiep, about 60 miles (100 kms) north of
Wau, flooded with 70,000 people fleeing the wretchedness of war and
hunger, death is never far away.
	   People so thin their bodies already appear mummified lie naked
on mats in the compound, flies swarming above them. Mothers curl
their long narrow frames around infants who reach painfully for
sagging, empty breasts.
	   Relief food seems to be fueling the war. And while everyone is
ready to point a finger, few seem ready to take responsibility.
	   The SPLA, whose top officials live comfortably in neighboring
Kenya or elsewhere, deny claims by relief agencies that they divert
relief food for their troops.
	   A rebel spokesman this week accused the Kenya-based Operation
Lifeline Sudan, the umbrella group for U.N and other aid agencies,
of corruption and inefficiency. UNICEF said the charge should be
investigated.
	   Government forces often loot or burn food stocks if they fear
rebels will get them.
	   The Sudanese government does not allow military transport
aircraft, which have the largest capacity for aid drops, to fly
into southern Sudan for fear they could be carrying arms for the
rebels.
	   And the United Nations is criticized for cooperating with both
the government _ by not pushing hard enough against the flight ban
_ and the rebels.
	   Southern Sudan lacks roads, airstrips and other basic
infrastructure. So the WFP is doubtful that a three-month
cease-fire to allow humanitarian access to Bahr el-Ghazal can help.
	   Doctors Without Borders is working frantically to double the
capacity of the Ajiep feeding center, the only one within six days'
walking distance, to about 5,000 people and cut down on the
estimated 120 deaths a day.
	   Even dropping food from the air won't solve the problem. When a
civilian C-130 transport plane dropped 16 tons of corn on Ajiep
recently, hundreds of people stood along the edges of the drop
site, watching bags of life splat in the mud. The food was
collected by local aid workers, who are paid in food to keep them
healthy enough to distribute the aid.
	   Old men, women and children scrambled in on their hands and
knees to pluck every last kernel of corn from sacks that had burst
upon impact. A handful could mean the difference between life and
death.
	   ``Our children are dying,'' said Lual Madut Lual, an old man who
watched the mayhem. ``Tell the world to come and ask why our people
are dying.''

Japan's industrial production rises in June
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Ending a four-month decline, Japan's industrial
production rose 1.3 percent in June from May, the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry announced Wednesday.
	   MITI said, however, that the rise was temporary, noting that
industrial production remains in a downtrend as inventories were
still high in relation to shipments.
	   Still, the rise in output at the country's factories and mines,
adjusted for seasonal factors, was greater than economists had
expected.
	   For the coming two reporting months, MITI forecast that
industrial production will rise 0.1 percent in July from June,
followed by a fall of 0.4 percent during August.
	   Sectors that enjoyed month-on-month rises in production during
June included steel at 1.7 percent, autos and other transportation
at 5.6 percent, and precision machinery at 5.1 percent.
	   Among declining sectors were paper and pulp at 0.4 percent and
textiles at 0.5 percent.

Puerto Rico lawmakers set date for statehood vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Puerto Rico's legislature will hold
a special session Aug. 12 to determine whether to authorize a
plebiscite on the island's future relationship with the United
States.
	   Gov. Pedro Rossello surprised islanders Saturday by announcing
he would call a non-binding vote in December on whether the U.S.
territory should apply to become the 51st state, request
independence or remain a commonwealth under the control of
Congress.
	   Rossello supports statehood.
	   Senate President Charlie Rodriguez announced the special session
Tuesday.
	   Though acknowledging that the plebiscite in itself would not
force any changes in the island's status, Rossello said he hopes it
would add momentum to a bill in the U.S. Congress that would ask
Puerto Ricans to choose between statehood, independence or the
current commonwealth arrangement.
	   The bill passed the U.S. House of Representatives by one vote in
March but appears stalled in the Senate. Even if the Senate
approves the bill and Puerto Ricans choose statehood, the final
decision on whether the island becomes a state rests with Congress.

Ivanisevic loses in first round of Mercedes Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Wimbledon finalist Goran Ivanisevic lost
Tuesday to Guillaume Raoux of France, 6-4, 6-4, in the first round
of the dlrs 340,000 Mercedes-Benz Cup men's tennis tournament.
	   England's Tim Henman made a successful Los Angeles debut beating
Grant Stafford of South Africa, 6-3, 6-0. Henman, the second seed,
served 10 aces to win the match in just under an hour.
	   Ivanisevic, playing in his first tournament since losing to Pete
Sampras in a grueling five-set final at Wimbledon, did not look
sharp. He committed 13 double faults to go along with 13 aces. His
biggest serve was clocked at 138 mph.
	   Sixth-seed Wayne Ferreira of South Africa was also an upset
victim against Sargis Sargsian of Armenia, 6-2, 6-1. Sargsian
needed only 57 minutes for the win.
	   Eighth-seed Vince Spadea rallied to beat Marcos Ondruska of
South Africa, 2-6, 6-3, 6-3.
	   Other first-round winners were Jeff Tarango over Alejandro
Hernandez of Mexico, 6-2, 6-2, and Michael Joyce beat Michael
Tebbutt of Australia, 7-5, 2-6, 7-5.
	   ``Goran didn't play like he did at Wimbledon, for sure,'' Raoux
said. ``He missed a lot, he gave me a lot of points. He didn't play
like someone who practices very much. At the end, I was waiting a
little bit more for him to miss. After you break him, the toughest
part of the job is made.''
	   Henman is looking ahead to next month's U.S. Open in New York,
the last Grand Slam tournament of the year.
	   ``This is my first match of the summer on hard courts,'' said
Henman who is ranked 12th on the ATP computer. ``It's a good build
up for the U.S. Open. I knew this match wasn't going to be easy. We
played for the first time in Nottingham in June and I won in the
third set, 7-6. My serve worked and I got some free points on my
serve.''
	   Tuesday night's featured matches include top-seed Patrick Rafter
of Australia against Ramon Delgado of Paraguay and fifth-seeded
Andre Agassi against Bob Bryan.

Pippen has back surgery
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICK GANO &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Scottie Pippen, who helped the Chicago Bulls win
their sixth National Basketball Association title last month,
underwent back surgery at a Chicago hospital this week, a procedure
his doctor said is not career-threatening.
	   Dr. Michael Schafer, chairman of Northwestern Memorial
Hospital's department of orthopedic surgery, performed the back
operation Monday.
	   He performed similar surgery on Pippen in 1988.
	   ``I was very pleased with the surgery. The operation was
successful, and I expect Mr. Pippen will have no trouble in
resuming his career,'' Schafer said in a statement Tuesday from
Pippen's agent, Jimmy Sexton.
	   Pippen, a free agent, expects a rapid and full recovery without
an effect on his playing career, the statement said.
	   Pippen, who was not available for comment Tuesday, also
consulted with Dr. Robert G. Watkins, a specialist in Los Angeles.
	   Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf, approached before Tuesday
night's Tampa Bay Devil Rays-Chicago White Sox game at Comiskey
Park, said he did not know about Pippen's operation.
	   During the NBA lockout, he is not permitted to talk with
players.
	   ``I'm not allowed to comment. He's not a member of our team.
He's a free agent,'' Reinsdorf said.
	   Pippen, 32, hurt his back in the NBA Finals after being knocked
to the floor several times while drawing charges.
	   He received a cortisone injection before Game 6 and was severely
limited as the Bulls beat the Utah Jazz to claim their sixth title
of the 1990s.
	   When all non-operative alternatives were exhausted, Schaefer and
Pippen made the decision to operate, according to the statement.
	   As he was recovering from foot surgery last November, Pippen
stunned the Bulls by saying he preferred a trade and didn't want to
play for the team again.
	   After missing the first 35 games, he backed off, but his
unhappiness with team management, especially general manager Jerry
Krause, didn't diminish. He was angry about a long-term contract
that paid him well below market value and also miffed that he had
been on the trade block last summer.
	   Chosen as one of the NBA's greatest 50 players, Pippen made just
dlrs 2.7 million last season.
	   Pippen has said he would prefer to go a Western Conference team
that plays an up-tempo style more conducive to his open-court
skills while looking for the big contract he thinks he's always
deserved as the talented sidekick of Michael Jordan.

After diplomatic conference, Albright heads for Papua New Guinea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps previous to UPDATE with Albright remarks. &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM RAUM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Responding to calls by strapped Asian
countries for more assistance, U.S. Secretary of State on Wednesday
cautioned, ``this crisis is not going to be resolved by aid
alone.''
	   The Asian countries issued their appeal for aid during a
wide-ranging diplomatic conference that ended Tuesday. Participants
also sought to end a tense standoff in Myanmar.
	   The United States and key allies orchestrated an effort to
pressure Myanmar's military regime to end a highway impasse between
Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and security forces.
	   ``The military leaders of Burma must enter into a dialogue with
the opposition movement that so clearly represents its people,''
Albright told a breakfast meeting of American businessmen and
businesswomen Wednesday as she prepared to head for Papua New
Guinea and then Australia.
	   Myanmar is also known as Burma, a designation still used by U.S.
officials.
	   In a tense conference, delegates from the United States, New
Zealand, Australia, Canada, Japan, South Korea, and the European
Union confronted Myanmar Foreign Minister Ohn Gayaw over the
crisis.
	   They also delegated U.S., Australian and Japanese diplomats in
the capital of Myanmar to try to meet with the democratic activist.
She has been stuck on a rural Myanmar highway surrounded by
government security personnel since Friday.
	   On the economic crisis, the United States, Japan and other
countries did not announce any new aid packages and said that while
they will continue to help, Southeast Asian countries themselves
must persevere with painful political and economic reforms if they
are to recover.
	   ``Foreign direct assistance will be essential to getting this
region back on track,'' Albright said at an American Chamber of
Commerce breakfast. ``But we also have to recognize that this
crisis is not going to be resolved by aid alone.''
	   After three days in the Philippines, Albright was traveling
Wednesday to Papua New Guinea to discuss disaster relief with the
island nation's leaders as they recover from a deadly tsunami, and
then on Australia.
	   China's representative, meanwhile, told the concluding session
of the ASEAN conference the region's economic crisis ``will stay at
a low ebb for a period of time.''
	   Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said Asia's recovery must come
from within for it to be lasting. He reiterated a Chinese pledge
not to devalue its currency.
	   The conference chairman, Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo
Siazon, said the rich countries had a ``paramount role'' in
restoring economic vibrancy to the region.
	   Siazon said the United States should increase its share of
funding for the International Monetary Fund. The IMF's reserves
have been depleted by bailouts of several Asian nations in the past
year. The Clinton administration's request for dlrs 18 billion for
the IMF has been languishing in Congress for months.
	   The highway standoff in Myanmar once again occupied much of the
discussions on the sidelines of the conference.
	   Suu Kyi has been stuck in her car and surrounded by government
security personnel since last Friday, when she was stopped on her
way to a meeting with supporters.
	   At the hastily arranged meeting on Tuesday to confront the
Myanmar foreign minister, ``a lot of pressure was exerted on the
leadership of Myanmar to change their ways, their policies,'' said
Wolfgang Schuessel, president of the European Council, the European
Union's policy-making body.
	   ``I hope this can have some impact,'' Schuessel added. ``The
blockade of Aung San Suu Kyi in the car is absolutely unbearable.''
	   Several participants voiced skepticism over claims by Cambodian
strongman Hun Sen that his ruling party had won a clear-cut victory
in Sunday's parliamentary elections.
	   ``The only thing we know for a fact is that the Cambodian people
voted in large numbers as they did in the previous election,''
Albright said.
	   In Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Hun Sen claimed a landslide victory in
parliamentary elections for his Cambodian People's Party, prompting
allegations of fraud by the opposition.
	   Albright said at a news conference: ``I think it is premature
for anyone to declare major victory, because as far as I know not a
large percentage of the vote has been counted.''

ethnic Albanian separatists setbacks on the battlefield, diplomatic
efforts to bring peace to Kosovo apparently are beginning to show
progress.
	   Serb forces ousted rebel fighters from the major stronghold of
Malisevo on Tuesday, the latest defeat for the Kosovo Liberation
Army, whose firepower is vastly inferior to that of the government

Tokyo man dies of heat stroke while mowing grass
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A 28-year-old man died of heat stroke while mowing
grass in Tokyo, a fire department spokesman said Wednesday,
bringing to five the number of heat-related deaths in Japan this
month.
	   The man, whose name was not disclosed, died Tuesday after being
taken unconscious to a nearby hospital for treatment after mowing
grass at an apartment complex, said Mikio Endo, a spokesman for the
Tokyo Fire Department.
	   The man, a part-time worker, became ill at midmorning and took a
rest on the grass. He was found unconscious when colleagues checked
on him about an hour later, Endo said.
	   Two other Tokyoites were also hospitalized Tuesday after
developing symptoms of heat stroke, he said.
	   Temperatures climbed to 33 Celsius (91 Fahrenheit) Tuesday in
Tokyo, according to the Meteorological Agency, much higher than the
average late July temperature of 26.8 degrees C (80.2 F).
	   A total of 130 people in Tokyo have been taken to hospitals by
ambulance since July 3, when the department began compiling heat
stroke statistics for the summer, Endo said.
	   At least three others in Japan, including a Tokyo man, died of
sunstroke in early July, when the country was engulfed in
unseasonal high pressure.
	   Usually the Tokyo area remains cool during the monthlong rainy
season that ordinarily lasts until mid-July.

Dollar edges lower, Japanese stocks advance moderately
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Nikkei morning close, midday dollar and bond
price &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar edged lower against the yen
Wednesday morning on optimism a veteran politician known for his
financial expertise will become Japan's next finance minister.
Tokyo stocks advanced moderately.
	   The dollar bought 141.03 yen in late morning, down 0.91 yen from
late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate of
141.35 yen overnight.
	   The dollar moved lower against the yen after Japanese newspapers
reported former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, a ruling party
elder and economic policy expert, was likely to be named as finance
minister, traders said.
	   Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, who is expected to be voted in
Thursday as Japan's next prime minister, has been courting Miyazawa
to serve as finance minister in his Cabinet.
	   Obuchi has pledged to appoint a political heavyweight as finance
minister in order to speed efforts to stimulate the sluggish
Japanese economy and carry out needed economic reforms.
	   In New York, the dollar fell in part due to a drop in U.S. stock
prices and concern about a former White House intern's decision to
testify about her relationship with President Clinton, traders
said.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices opened moderately
lower after an overnight fall on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones
industrial avenge closed at 8,934.78 on Tuesday, down 93.46.
	   But buying from public pension fund reversed the course by
midmorning, traders said.
	   Activity remained light, with most investors waiting to see who
will become the new finance minister.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained
80.61 points, or 0.50 percent, to 16,195.15 at the end of the
morning session. On Tuesday, it gained 170.18 points, or 1.07
percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section added 3.01 points, or 0.24 percent, to 1,245.23. It
had risen 8.24 points, or 0.67 percent, the previous day.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.315 percent from Tuesday's finish of
1.310 percent, driving its price down to 110.98 yen from 111.03
yen.

Employee sues United Airlines over alleged pay discrimination
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A female employee has sued United Airlines Inc.'s
Japan branch over alleged discrimination in the payment of special
allowances to married workers only, a court official said
Wednesday.
	   The 52-year-old employee, whose name was not disclosed, filed
the suit with the Tokyo District Court on Tuesday and is seeking 16
million yen (dlrs 114,000) in compensation, said the official, on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Hideki Isayama, spokesman for United's Japan subsidiary, said
the airline could not comment on the suit as details were as yet
unavailable.
	   In filing the suit, the woman claimed that the company's work
regulations, which provide a monthly family allowance totaling
16,500 yen (dlrs 118) to married workers, discriminates against
single employees, the Asahi newspaper reported.
	   The woman, who claimed she has suffered the pay discrimination
for the past 28 years, was also hurt by remarks from a company
official who allegedly said that she should marry if she wanted to
receive the allowance, the Asahi reported.
	   In Japan, the payment of a family allowance is a common practice
at most companies.
	   United, a major U.S. airline with headquarters in Chicago, Ill.,
employs about 1,100 workers in Japan, said Isayama.

Albright, Primakov ham it up as star-crossed lovers in skit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With ASEAN &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM RAUM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ She wore a red rose in her hair. He
had one tucked in his cap.
	   And diplomats from more than 20 nations howled as U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright and Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov cooed, pranced around the stage and serenaded each other
as the star-crossed lovers in ``West Side Story.''
	   ``The most beautiful song I ever heard, Yevgeny, Yevgeny,
Yevgeny, Yevgeny,'' belted out Albright. ``I just met a boy named
Yevgeny. And suddenly that name means no zero sum game for me.''
	   Forsaking his usual translator, Primakov sang back in English:
``Madeleine Albright. I just met a girl named Madeleine Albright.
... And suddenly I find, she thinks she'll change my mind ... for
free.''
	   And then he ad-libbed: ``Never!''
	   The playful skit _ renamed ``East-West Story'' _ brought down
the house at Tuesday night's banquet concluding an annual
diplomatic forum sponsored by the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations.
	   Not to be outdone, the Indian delegation produced a skit poking
fun at their nuclear tests in May.
	   ``Why such fuss over a few crackers in the Thar,'' said one line
in the song, referring to the desert where India stunned the world
with the tests.
	   ``They weren't as loud as Nevada and Lop Nor,'' the song said,
mentioning the sites of U.S. and Chinese tests.
	   But the Albright-Primakov production was clearly the
show-stopper.
	   At the final banquet of the annual meeting, delegations
traditionally perform either cultural dances or song parodies.
	   Last year, Albright was the hit with an Evita-style rendition of
``Don't Cry for Me ASEAN.''
	   Albright gave Primakov the first draft of the skit at a meeting
in Geneva in May.
	   The banquet was behind closed doors. But interviews with
participants and members of the audience, and reviewing a tape
recording obtained by The Associated Press, helped reconstruct the
scene.
	   The opening number featured the two delegations as the street
gangs Jets and Sharks, snapping their fingers, with music from the
famous Leonard Bernstein score playing in the background. A Russian
ran out onto the stage and spray-painted graffiti on a wall. An
American chased him off with a knife. The chorus was made up of top
aides to Albright and Primakov, clad in jeans and T-shirts.
	   Then Albright and Primakov appeared on stage, wearing nearly
identical garb: long, embroidered regional shirts called
``barongs.''
	   ``Ladies and gentlemen. Tonight won't be just any night,'' said
State Department spokesman James Foley in introducing the skit.
``For this hot Manila night, we will see if the last ripples of
rancor will finally give way to the first stirrings of love.''
	   Albright and Primakov did not disappoint. To the tune of the
snappy dance number ``America'' (``I want to live in America
...''), Albright and Primakov alternated lines.
	   Albright: ``Detargeting missiles was so easy.''
	   Primakov: ``With no enemy you are unhappy.''
	   Albright: ``I expand NATO to Hungary.''
	   Primakov: ``Biggest mistake in history.''
	   The entire Russian and American delegations came on stage for
the finale, ``Tonight.''
	   ``Tonight, tonight. In harmony tonight,'' they sang. ``Tonight,
tonight. We do not have to fight. Going mad. Launching bombs. Into
space.''
	   ``Tonight, tonight. We are one bunch tonight. Don't you see?
That is it. That is true.''

U.S. criticizes argument that development must precede democracy

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on Wednesday criticized a long-held tenet of autocrats in
Asia: that citizens must have rice in their stomachs before they
can be given political freedoms.
	   The key role of democracy and free market policies in weathering
the region's economic turmoil was a main theme of Albright's speech
before the American Chamber of Commerce in Manila.
	   Albright was in town for annual meetings with nine Southeast
Asian foreign ministers.
	   One-third of U.S. exports go to Asia, and U.S. companies have
more than dlrs 130 billion invested in the region. The Asian crisis
has slowed America's exports and increased its trade deficit,
Albright noted.
	   On Asia's recovery, she said experience has taught that
``corruption must be frankly discussed and vigorously fought.''
	   ``Economies powered by open and sound financial policies will be
better able to adjust to the global market than economies that are
closed and hobbled by financial favoritism,'' she said.
	   The Philippines has not been as badly hurt by the economic
turmoil as neighboring countries because of
democratically-developed policies of reform, she said.
	   Over the years, many one-party or military governments in Asia
have argued that people must be properly fed and educated before
they can participate in the fractious, complicated business of free
expression and democratic decision-making.
	   Proponents of that view range from Vietnam's Communist Politburo
to Malaysia's anti-Communist Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. The
latter is now Southeast Asia's longest-serving leader since another
proponent of the rice-first view, Indonesia's Suharto, was ousted
in May by mass protests over the economic crisis.
	   Albright said she hoped the debate over whether development or
democracy comes first was ending. Both are needed and they
reinforce one another, she said.
	   ``Clearly, no one has the right to tell the people of any
country that they must experience one before they can enjoy the
other. For history does not support such a claim and justice does
not permit it,'' Albright said.
	   ``In fact, our experience in the last year teaches a very
different lesson: democracies are better able to adjust than
regimes which are autocratic.''
	   Albright also took the occasion to praise Philippine President
Joseph Estrada's stated commitment to open and accountable
government, express hope for democratic development in Cambodia
after its election last Sunday, and urge Myanmar's ruling generals
to enter into dialogue with the pro-democracy movement.

Cambodians await fuller election results as parties wrangle

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Partial election results released
Wednesday by Cambodia's top independent monitoring group confirmed
that strongman Hun Sen's party had staked a lead over his rivals,
but apparently less than the boasted landslide.
	   With official results slowly being compiled, the figures of the
Committee for Free and Fair Elections in Cambodia were scrutinized
to balance claims by the Cambodian People's Party that it had
crushed the opposition in Sunday's parliamentary elections.
	   The main opposition leaders, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam
Rainsy, have called the process a fraud and threatened to paralyze
the government, plunging the tragedy-stricken country into another
round of turmoil.
	   Hun Sen, who has kept a low profile since Sunday's vote, was to
travel Wednesday to the northern province of Siem Reap for talks
with King Norodom Sihanouk, the prince's father.
	   Thun Saray, COMFREL's president, said his group was ``ready to
do investigations to provide proof'' into reports of irregularities
alleged by Ranariddh, Sam Rainsy and others.
	   COMFREL said that with 56.3 percent of the vote counted
nationwide, 40.5 percent had gone for Hun Sen's party, 32.8 percent
to the royalist FUNCINPEC headed by Ranariddh, and 14.2 percent to
the Sam Rainsy Party.
	   But it remained difficult to determine how the popular vote
would translate in dividing up the 122 National Assembly seats.
	   In the two multiple-constituency provinces where COMFREL was
able to determine seats, Kampot and Svay Rieng, three in each went
to Hun Sen's party. The party has claimed four in each.
	   If the COMFREL figures are mirrored in the official count by the
National Election Committee, the final result could look more like
50-odd seats for the CPP, rather than the 67 the party is claiming.
	   Under those figures _ which many Cambodians disbelieve _
Ranariddh's party would get 42 seats and Sam Rainsy's just 13.
	   Ranariddh, deposed as co-prime minister by Hun Sen in a bloody
coup last year, and Sam Rainsy have denounced the claimed results
as a fraud and demanded recounts and re-balloting in some areas.
	   They have threatened to boycott the National Assembly,
preventing the two-thirds attendance needed to hold meetings.
Leading officials of Hun Sen's party have suggested they join a
coalition or see the current government continue another five
years.
	   International observer groups generally endorsed Sunday's vote,
when an estimated 90 percent of the 5.4 million registered voters
cast ballots, and counting Monday as free and fair enough to
reflect the general will of the Cambodian people.
	   But they offered their judgments before the final count, which
may still take days. Several also noted that the pre-election
period was marred by violence, including murder, and intimidation,
mostly against opposition supporters.
	   The U.N.'s human-rights office released a report Monday saying
it was investigating reports of an additional 12 killings in the
final week of the campaign to see if they were politically
motivated.
	   Ranariddh's royalist party won U.N.-organized elections backed
by 20,000 peacekeepers in 1993. But Hun Sen, who came to power in
1985 under the Vietnamese military occupation that succeeded the
genocidal Khmer Rouge, refused to accept defeat and threatened
civil war.
	   The two men formed a co-premiership, which shattered last year
when Hun Sen deposed the prince in two days of fighting in the
capital. Both men have called the arrangement a recipe for
instability and refused to form another.
	   Unlike 1993, the Khmer Rouge is virtually extinct. Thousands of
rebels have made peace since 1996 and voted Sunday for the first
time in their lives. Two seats in areas dominated by them have
reportedly been divided between the CPP and the Sam Rainsy Party.
