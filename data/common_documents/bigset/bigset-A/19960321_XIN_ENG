<HEADLINE> Roundup: African Youth To Take Challege In Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(By Chen Cailin)
</P>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Young men and women from
African countries are gathering at Africa Hall in Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia, to attend the first Pan-African Conference on Youth
and Development.
</P>
<P>
This is a function heralding for the first time the full
participation of the young people of the world's poorest
continent in the social and economic development of their
countries.
</P>
<P>
African youth enjoys a large population of up to 122 million
between 15 and 24, accounting for nearly 19 percent of the
continent's total population.
</P>
<P>
Over the next 30 years, the population of the young is
estimated to make up 21 percent of the total in the continent.
</P>
<P>
As they have constituted one-third of the labour force of
Africa, they are having and will continue to have a key role to
play in the development of the continent.
</P>
<P>
However, the conditions of the African youth have much to
impove despite the adoption of African Regional Plan of Action on
Youth in 1983 and the promotion of "participation, development
and peace" advanced during the International Youth Year of 1985.
</P>
<P>
Young people have been forced to the centre of many of
Africa's internal conflicts, as fighters or victims. The
proliferation of orphanages testifies to the phight of hundreds
of thousands of children across Africa.
</P>
<P>
As a result, many children and young people in Africa have no
opportunity to go to school. While a number of African countries
register an enrolment of only 50 percent of the school-age
children, most can't ensure that more than 50 percent of the
primary school leavers have access to secondary ones.
</P>
<P>
To be more deplorable, only two percent of the relevant age
group are receiving post-secondary and tertiary education. The
number of school dropouts is higher among girls than boys with
girls constituting two-thirds of those deprived of education.
</P>
<P>
The African youth is seriously subjected to unemployment or
underemployment as well. It is estimated that out of the total
unemployed in Africa, 60-75 percent are the young.
</P>
<P>
Young Africans are also being reckoned as bearing the brunt of
the killer Aids disease, "a disease of the young adult male and
female in Africa".
</P>
<P>
Among African youths inflicted by Aids, the highest
proportions of the infected are between 16 and 29 years. The
World Health Organization predicts that 14 million HIV infections
will have occurred in Africa by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
In the face of the hard realities, the on-going youth
conference recommends that African governments implement
policies to empower and mobilize young people.
</P>
<P>
The meeting calls for concerted action by both governments and
non-governmental organizations to provide Africa's youth with
knowledge, skills and opportunities of taking their role in the
continent's socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
The meeting suggests that 5 percent of the regular budget of
the Organization of African Unity be allocated to undertakings to
the youth.
</P>
<P>
Young Africans represent the future of the continent. As
furture parents and leaders, they need investment for all the
knowledge and skills to be used in building a promising
land.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Calls on Eliminating Racism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali today called on all governments and
non-governmental organizations demonstrating stronger and more
demanding political will to eliminate racism and racial
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
In the message on the International Day for Elimination of
Racial Discrimination, Boutros-Ghali said that the international
community was gathering together to honor the victims of racism
and racial discrimination, ask why these phenomenon continue and
seek means capable of putting an end to their manifestation.
</P>
<P>
He noted the commemoration of the Sharpeville massacre in 1960
in South Africa awakened people to the resurgence of racist
ideologies and practices, particularly in the economic and social
spheres, to the persistence of the subtle forms of racism and
racial discrimination that assume the shapes of nationalism or of
national or continental preference.
</P>
<P>
"It reminds us that our world, full as it is of information on
the different peoples inhabiting it, is not free from xenophobia,
hatred and ethnic conflict," he said.
</P>
<P>
"On the five continents, migrant workers, asylum seekers,
ethnic, national and religious minorities and indigenous
populations are every day faced with discriminatory practices and
exposed to racist violence," he continued.
</P>
<P>
"Freedom of movement between different countries is
increasingly being subjected to restrictive measures, some of
which seem to be inspired by racist and xenophobic
considerations," he said.
</P>
<P>
In December 1993 when proclaiming the Third Decade to Combat
Racism and Racial Discrimination, the U.N. General Assembly urged
all governments, the specialized agencies and intergovernmental
and non-governmental organizations to redouble their efforts to
put an end to racism and racial discrimination, he reviewed.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the 21st century, the political will to eliminate
racism and racial discrimination must be stronger and more
demanding. "This is why human beings and their rights must be
placed at the center of the concerns of states and all peoples,"
he stressed.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 21 (Xinhua) -- China's Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen praised today the friendly and
cooperative relations between China and Kuwait, describing it "an
example to be reckoned with."
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remarks in a congratulation message sent today to
Kuwaiti First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sabah
al-Ahmed al-Sabah to mark the 25th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that "the existing friendly and cooperative ties
between China and Kuwait, which are based on the principal of
mutual respect, mutual benefit and equality, have registered
profound and overall development over the past 25 years."
</P>
<P>
He added that the bilateral ties are growing rapidly due to the
attention paid by leaders of both sides and the common efforts of
the two governments.
</P>
<P>
Qian Qichen said he hoped that the friendly and cooperative
relations would witness further growth through the joint efforts
of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official from the Chinese Embassy in
Kuwait, trade volume between China and Kuwait exceeded 229 million
U.S. dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Kuwaiti exports to China stood at 124
million dollars last year, while imports from China amounted to
104 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that loans granted to China by the Kuwaiti Fund for
Arab Economic Development over the past few years amounted to over
600 million dollars for financing about 20 construction projects
in China.
</P>
<P>
China and Kuwait established diplomatic ties on March 22, 1971.
</P>
<P>
The first deputy prime minister and foreign minister of Kuwait,
Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah, today praised China's firmness and
courage in the international arena in support of kuwait's just
causes.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kuwait News Agency, Sheikh Sabah spoke highly
of the friendly Kuwaiti-Chinese relations in a message sent to
his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen.

<HEADLINE> Europe, US at Odds over Rearming Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Western Europe and the United
States are at odds over rearming Bosnia, which threatens to blow a
hole in their relationship delicately reconstructed after the
Dayton accords on former Yugoslavia were reached three months ago,
according to press reports here today.
</P>
<P>
The United States is seeking to gather as much as one billion
US dollars for a so-called "Train and Equip" program, which
would be used to build up the Bosnia-Croat federation forces
before the NATO-led implementation force leaves in December.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration says that such a force was needed to
offset the "serious advantage" of the Bosnia Serb forces which
will control the other half of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
But European governments argue that the American plan could
wreck the already slender chances of genuine reconciliation in the
Balkans, play into the hands of hard-liners in all ethnic groups
and trigger a fresh arms race in the region.
</P>
<P>
They also argue that it runs counter to the spirit of the Dayton
accords. Instead, they say, all parties should be giving full
support to negotiations to reduce the levels of armaments held by
the three warring parties which are under way in Vienna in
accordance with the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
Klaus Kinkel, german foreign minister, said that it is not
right to undermine arms control in the Balkans by rearmament of
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
British and French sources also said they were worried that
arming the Muslims and Croats while NATO was still in Bosnia could
place alliance forces in danger.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the contrast between US and European
priorities in Bosnia reflects a broader difference of approach to
the region.
</P>
<P>
The Americans have always perceived the war in Bosnia as one of
aggression by the Bosnian Serbs, while some European countries
spread the blame more widely.
</P>
<P>
European countries have been most concerned with stabilizing
the region and containing the conflict, even if this involves
concessions to the Serb side, while the US regards this as
excessive.

<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Provisional figures released
today by Statistics Netherlands showed Dutch exports reached a total
value of 313.5 billion guilders(one Dutch guilder equals about 0.604
US$) in 1995, nine percent more than in 1994. Imports rose by ten
percent to 282.4 billion guilders.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Dutch trade with European Union countries was

<HEADLINE> UK Annual Inflation Rate Falls to 2.7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Britain's annual rate of inflation
fell from 2.9 percent to 2.7 percent in February, the lowest level
in 15 months, according to the Central Statistical Office (CSO)
today.
</P>
<P>
But the underlying rate excluding volatile home loan costs
which varying in line with swings in official interest rates
rather than changes in core inflation pressures, picked up to 2.9
percent from 2.8 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
The rise in underlying inflation partly reflected strong rises
in areas such as household goods and may indicate that shopkeepers
are trying to restore their dwindling profit margins after being
forced to discount prices heavily in the January sales.
</P>
<P>
Some economists say that it will be very difficult for the
authorities to justify a rate cut when they meet in April 1, and
it is probably that interest rates are on hold until May at the
earliest.
</P>
<P>
But other analysts say the political imperative for
vote-winning interest rate cuts remains strong as the ruling
Conservative Party gears up for a general election which must be
held in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Tension Mounting in South Lebanon after Hezbollah's Suicide Attack (II) (by Shao Jie) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Meanwhile, Secretary General of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah
Hassan Nasrallah said at a press conference in a Hezbollah office
in Beirut today that the guerrilla war which his party spearheads
in south Lebanon "would continue as long as the Israeli occupation
remains."
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah emphasized that Hezbollah preserves the right of
firing back by launching Katyusha rockets into northern Israel in
case that the Israeli forces attack civilians in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"The only way to distance the Jewish settlements in northern
Israel from the resistance's touch is not to touch the civilians
in the south," Nasrallah said.
</P>
<P>
Clarifying a link of his party with Syria and Iran, the
Hezbollah leader said, "Our decision is taken by our ourselves,
and Iran and Syria are supporting our legitimate right."
</P>
<P>
He said the Wednesday suicide attack as well as other
operations carried out recently by Hezbollah guerrillas against
the Israeli occupation forces in the border strip, carved by
Israel in 1985, are a "natural" part of the resistance against the
Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
"The recent operations came within its natural course and the
(Israeli) threats can not change anything," the Shiite Hezbollah
leader said.
</P>
<P>
He identified the suicide bomber as Ali Munif Ashmar, born in
1976 in Adaiseh town presently occupied by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah underlined that the Islamic Resistance, the military
wing of his militant Hezbollah, "can break through all the
security blockades of the Israeli occupation forces and it can
move at any place in the occupied bordering area."
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the buffer zone reported that one Israeli
officer was killed and five Israeli soldiers were wounded when
the Hezbollah suicide bomber blew himself up near an Israeli
convoy on a road between the southern Lebanese villages of Rub
Tlateen and Adaiseh.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army confirmed that an army captain was killed and
an Israeli civilian wounded in the suicide raid.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the attack, Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres
reacted by saying that Israel "will not rely on letters and
promises. We will respond to these terrorist acts the way we see
fit and whenever we decide."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Tension Mounting in South Lebanon after Hezbollah's Suicide Attack (I) (by Shao Jie) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Tension is mounting in south
Lebanon after a member of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of
God, carried out a suicide attack on an Israeli military convoy in
the Israeli self-styled security zone.
</P>
<P>
Israeli occupation forces continued bombardments until late
this afternoon at suspected guerrilla bases of Hezbollah in
south Lebanon and western Beqaa.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the south reported that the Israeli
bombardments this afternoon focused at Iglim Al-Toffah, a southern
Lebanese ridge often used by Moslem guerrillas as a spring board
to launch attacks at Israeli forces and their client South Lebanon
Army (SLA) militia in the "security zone."
</P>
<P>
The sources reported that the occupation forces in the
position of Aishiyeh in the Jezzine area fired heavy artilleries
at the height of Jabel Ar-Rafih, and the hills near the towns of
Sejoud, Rihan, Wadi Akhdar and the Nabaa At-Tasah basin.
</P>
<P>
Israeli forces also bombarded Serira, Jabel Abu Rashid and
Zarkata Al-Jabour in western Beqaa.
</P>
<P>
The first round of the Israeli retaliatory bombardments started
immediately after the suicide bombing on Wednesday afternoon,
breaking a relative calm in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Security sources reported that some 300 shells hit various
southern Lebanese areas opposite the buffer zone in only three
hours.
</P>
<P>
The second round of the bombardments began at midnight and the
third started at dawn this morning.
</P>
<P>
At least one local villager, identified by the security
sources in the south as Mohammed Qabisi at Sadiqein, was wounded
in the bombardments.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Radio monitored here reported this afternoon that the
Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) were continuing the investigation
into the suicide raid near the Taiba village in the "security
zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted its correspondents in the area as saying that
IDF soldiers have been warned of the danger of a possible
existence of car bombs.
</P>
<P>
It added that a meeting is scheduled tonight between Northern
Command Chief General Amiran Livine and local village heads in
northern Israel.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The South African police
service is being infiltrated by "agents provocateurs" who are
planning to overthrow the present government, President Nelson
Mandela said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing community leaders in Newcastle in the Kwazulu/Natal
Province, Mandela said there was still a tendency among all
ethnic groups to think in terms of their race.
</P>
<P>
"The white domination is past, never to return," he said, but
adding that other race groups also thought in terms of their
race, reacting to the recent murder of three police officials in
the Kwazulu/Natal Midlands region last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The local government elections are scheduled for Kwazulu/Natal
on May 29 this year,
</P>
<P>
"The African National Congress (ANC) has committed itself to a
code of conduct for the elections which we hope will be embraced
by all parties," said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the political violence in Kwazulu/Natal
between the ANC and its rival Inkatha Freedom Party has claimed
20000 lives in the strife-torn province since 1980s.

<HEADLINE> IGADD Summit Opens In Nairobi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
said here today that efforts to expand and revitalize the
Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD)
is receiving world wide attention.
</P>
<P>
President Moi said this at the State House, Nairobi, when he
officially opened the IGADD summit which was attended by heads of
state from Uganda, Eritrea and the Sudan, Prime Minister from
Ethiopia and Minister for Foreign Affairs from Djibouti's.
</P>
<P>
President Moi said IGADD was thus urged to speedily complete
the exercise of revitalization and cooperation in order to
attract additional assistance form the international community.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan President observed that the African region was
facing an ever increasing threat of marginalization due to a
number of unfavorable factors including rapid increase of
population.
</P>
<P>
As a result of this, President Moi said there thus had arisen
the urgent need to create an enabling environment both within and
between states if the IGADD member countries were to survive this
unfavorable climate.
</P>
<P>
He said it was in recognition of this urgent need that IGADD
set in motion the institutional framework to focus on economic,
trade, social communication, humanitarian and security aspects of
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The summit which will end on Friday discussed among other
things the revitalization and expansion of IGADD and the peace in
the Sudan.

<HEADLINE> Power Workers in Greece Go on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Power workers in Greece today
began a 48-hour strike in support of demands concerning salary
increases and social security issues.
</P>
<P>
According to union sources, participation in the strike is
high, with 100 percent of technicians taking part and 70 percent
of the administrative personnel.
</P>
<P>
The Public Power Corporation (PPC) Assistant General Director
Raphael Maiopoulos said that three thermoelectric facilities had
been put out of operation today along with four hydroelectric
stations, resulting in a power loss of 1250 megawats.
</P>
<P>
The present capacity of the power network is 5,300 megawats and
the maximum anticipated demand may reach 5,400 megawats later
today. Maiopoulos said this meant the risk of a large area
blackout would probably be avoided today.
</P>
<P>
After the protest rally, striking power workers marched to the
labour ministry building where a delegation met with minister
Evangelos Yannopoulos.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Defense Minister Costas
Eliades left here today for Moscow for an official visit at the
invitation of his Russian counterpart Pavel Grachev.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Cyprus News Agency reported that the two
ministers will sign an agreement on technical cooperation in
defense matters.
</P>
<P>
Russia will offer technical support to Cyprus for arms
purchased or to be purchased from Moscow, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Cyprus bought 70 million U.S. dollars' worth of
Russian armored vehicles, BMP-3, which were displayed during a
military parade in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, Cyprus has shown interest in
buying Russian T-80 tanks and S-300 medium-range anti-aircraft
missiles.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot minister is accompanied by the National Guard
Commander, Lieutenant-General Nicolaos Vorvolakos.

<HEADLINE> NATO Urged to Keep Force in Bosnia After Pullout Date </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- NATO Bosnian peace
implementation troops are under growing pressure to stay longer in
the country than planned withdrawal at the end of the year, local
press reports today quoted American and NATO officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that international military and civilian
authorities are warning that the U.S.-brokered fragile Bosnian
peace could collapse without the presence of 60,000-strong NATO
peacekeepers as tensions have been growing among the three former
warring factions in the former Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. NATO allies in Europe have said that they believe
NATO should keep at least a reduced military force in Bosnia
beyond the currently scheduled pull-out time.
</P>
<P>
The pressure came as the Clinton administration continues to
insist that 17,000 American troops will withdraw from Bosnia only
nine months from now.
</P>
<P>
European nations are worried that the delicate tasks of
resettling refugees and rebuilding Bosnia are likely to fail
without the security of outside peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon also acknowledged in a recent intelligence
assessment that without major economic and political rebuilding,
the war-torn Balkan nation was likely to fragment and fall back
into conflict after the U.S.-led NATO forces pull out in December.
</P>
<P>
The one-year term for the NATO troops was set by U.S. President
Bill Clinton when he decided to send American ground troops into
Bosnia despite sharp criticism by the Republican-controlled U.S.
Congress last December.
</P>
<P>
But many international officials in Bosnia say that a total
withdrawal of the NATO troops in one year could be disastrous as
the tasks of rebuilding the country have hardly begun.

<HEADLINE> UN Members Slow to Send Police to Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has
deployed less than half the 1,721 police officers in Bosnia three
months after it began sending international civilian police
monitors and trainers there, the New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
So far, only 693 civilian police monitors destined for Bosnia
had reported for duty, with the largest groups coming from France,
Ghana, Jordan and Pakistan. Another 252 are in Zagreb, Croatia,
awaiting deployment.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which promised 200 police officers, is one
of the primary defaulters. Only 33 Americans have reached the
Balkans, and the scheduled arrival of another contingent this week
was canceled, according to U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
Another 50 Americans are not expected until next month, and
U.N. officials are waiting to hear about the remaining 117.
</P>
<P>
Member states were relatively quick to pledge enough officers
to fill the request for 1,721 people. But, they were very slow in
supplying the U.N. with names and then in actually sending the
officers.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, about 10 percent of arriving troops have failed
driving or language tests and have been sent home. English is the
working language of the Bosnian mission, so all police officers
must be able to speak it fluently for day-to-day training and in
emergencies, when misunderstanding could be dangerous.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes U.S. Proposed Aid Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government today
welcomed the U.S. government's proposal to maintain a
15-million-dollar aid package for Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The administration of Bill Clinton has submitted its 1997
budget to the U.S. Congress, including the aid package for Cyprus,
which has been divided since the 1974 Turkish invasion.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, Cyprus government
spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides described as "positive" the
U.S. government proposal to have its Economic Support Funds (ESF)
for Cyprus maintained in 1997 without any retrenchment.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that while most of the U.S. aid packages
worldwide were cut by the Congress last year, those for Cyprus,
Israel and Egypt were maintained.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides also noted that the U.S. aid for Greece and Turkey
was reduced by 40 percent, despite the maintenance of the 7:10
ratio.

LONDON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
announced in the House of Commons that elections to a peace forum
in Northern Ireland would be held on May 30 as "a viable and

<P>
110 representatives will be elected to the peace forum from

Major reiterated that Sinn Fein, political wing of the Irish
Republican Army (IRA), would not be included in the all-party
talks until the IRA restored its cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
He warned threat of terrorism continued to hang over the peace
process and he challenged the IRA: "There was never any
justification for their actions. Their excuses are running out."

been reached with the American organizers of the Atlanta games to
ensure that the Olympic flame would not be used for commercial
purposes, as in the past.

<HEADLINE> Britain To Increase Investment In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 21 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 leading British firms
are planning investments in Zimbabwe worth over 56 million US
Dollars over the next two years, the British High Commission said
here today.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the British High Commission to Zimbabwe said
Britain was now the largest foreign investor in the country, with
over 400 subsidiaries of UK companies.
</P>
<P>
''Total UK book investment in 1994 amounted to 433 million US
Dollars. New investment since May 1994 has totaled some 42
million US Dollars, with 10 prominent UK firms planning
re-investments with a total value of over 56 million US Dollars
in 1996 and 1997,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, Clarke, who is
on an official four-day visit to Zimbabwe, has pledged Britain's
commitment to support the Zimbabwean government's economic reform
program, the first phase of which ended last December.
</P>
<P>
Clarke, who arrived here yesterday, said while he could not go
into detail about the level of the UK support for the second
phase of the reforms, his government would be willing to finance
priority projects identified by the Zimbabwean government.
</P>
<P>
Britain is one of the western world's leading donors financing
Zimbabwean market reforms, with total balance-of-payments aid
since 1990 exceeding 111 million US Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Clarke also said British support for the land resettlement
program would be known once discussions have been held with the

<HEADLINE> Five UN Agencies' Employees Abducted In Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Five foreign nationals serving
the United Nations agencies in Somalia, were abducted by
unidentified gunmen at the Ballidogle Airport 90 kilometers
southwest of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The foreigners were taken hostage after a brief quarrel took
place between them and militiamen stationed at the airport,
according to eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
Four of the abducted are reported to be working for the
UNICEF while the fifth is the country representative of the
World Health Organization (WHO) in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
It is not known yet where the gunmen are keeping the foreign
hostages and the reason behind the abduction, but according to
their behavior, the gunmen usually ask for a huge ransom for the
safe release of the kidnaped. The incident may have had a
militia political background mainly over contract disputes or
wrong application for a contract termination severance.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the foreigners were traveling from
Mogadishu to Nairobi, Kenya. The area between Ballidogle and
Mogadishu has been very tense for the last few days after General
Aideed deployed a large number of militia from Baidoa to combat
Osman Hassan Atto who recently threatened the tax imposition of
Aideed in Merca which is the largest revenue-making source for
his government since he crowned himself as the president of
Somalia in mid-June last year.
</P>
<P>
No statement was released by the government of Aideed over the
fate of the abducted international expatriates. The incident is
jeopardizing the assistance to needy Somalis by the international
humanitarian agencies. It also proves the insecurity at the
Ballidogle Airport. The Russian built military base was serving
General Aideed as the only international airport for the South
Mogadishu government after the Mogadishu International Airport
was closed immediately after the departure of the International
community from Somalia in early March 1995.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Business Inventories Up in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 21 (xinhua) -- Business inventories in U.S.
increased by 0.6 percent in January because of the severe weather
which slowed the business activities, the Commerce Department
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Inventories totaled a seasonally adjusted 982.6 billion U.S.
dollars in January, up from 977.3 billion in last December.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said the increase was the first since
last October, when backlogs grew by 0.7 percent. Inventories were
flat in November and fell 0.4 percent in December, the first
decline since a 0.1 percent dip in March 1994.
</P>
<P>
Analysts had attributed the slow economic growth during the
fourth quarter in part to excess inventories that led to slower
production to shrink stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
But they said that the growth of inventories in January was
mainly due to the severe cold and snow storms which prevented
consumers from shopping and manufacturers and wholesalers from
shipping goods.
</P>
<P>
Business sales fell by 0.6 percent in the month, totaling 695.6
billion dollars, compared to 699.9 billion in December.
</P>
<P>
The inventory-to-sales ratio reached 1.41, meaning it would
take 1.41 months to exhaust stockpiles at the January sales rate.
The ratio was 1.42 in November and 1.40 in December.
</P>
<P>
In January, both manufacturers and wholesalers saw stockpiles
rise 0.7 and retailers experienced a 0.2 percent gain. Sales were
down in all categories--0.9 percent for manufacturers, 0.6 percent
for wholesalers and 0.1 percent for retailers.

<HEADLINE> Britain Alarmed for Mad Cow Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Up to one third of schools in
Britain have banned beef from dinner menus as the British
government admitted for the first time on Wednesday that mad cow
disease might be passed to humans by eating beef.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that British doctors had discovered a new
strain of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), the human form for
which there is no cure, and this CJD has been found in 10 people
under the age of 42, seven of whom have died.
</P>
<P>
With fears that younger people could be particularly at risk,
Britain's Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell has announced an
emergency meeting this weekend to draw up advice for parents on
whether children should continue to eat beef products.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Local Authority Cateres Association said today that
one third of 30,000 schools across the country no longer serve
beef and many more schools are expected to join the boycott.
</P>
<P>
The association said that it would urge the government to offer
clear guidance about the risks.
</P>
<P>
Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association
of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, the second largest
teaching union, warned that parents were very concerned and
suggested that it would be better to take beef off the menu in the
short term.
</P>
<P>
But Prime Minister John Major stressed in the parliament this
afternoon that there is no scientific proof children are more at
risk from the CJD than adults.
</P>
<P>
He told MPs that further advice was being sought regarding
children and the fatal brain disease.
</P>
<P>
Major made this statement following the advice from government
advisor Professor John Pattison who assured parents there was no
need to stop their children eating beef now.
</P>
<P>
Pattison maintained that the issue of children being at greater
risk was not simple and that parent must wait until the government
medical advisory group had met at the weekend.

<HEADLINE> UK Criticizes France's Banning of British Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Britain today criticized France's
decision to suspend all imports of British beef in the wake of a
scare over disease, or "mad cow" disease, saying it was unjustified.
</P>
<P>
Douglas Hogg, British agriculture minister, told BBC television
that Britain thinks it is "an unreasonable decision and quite
unnecessary".
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a wholly disproportionate response and that, I
think, raises very strong questions of illegality," he said.
</P>
<P>
France banned the imports of beef and cattle a day after the
British government said its scientific committee had deduced there
might be a link between "mad cow" disease and its fatal human
equivalent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Belgium today also announced that it is banning all
imports of live cows, beef and beef products from Britain.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Belgian farm minister said that the move was
taken in anticipation of more definitive measures expected from a
meeting of European Commission experts to be held on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Germany today also called for Europe-wide banning of beef and
beef products from Britain, according to reports from Bonn.

<HEADLINE> South Korea, Saudi Arabia Reach Semi-finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA, LUMPUR, March 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and Saudi
Arabia clinched the remaining two semi-final berths by blanking
China and Kazakhstan respectively at the Asian Zone Olympic
soccer's qualifying tournament Group B on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, repeating its triumph over China 4-1 in a
qualifier for the Barcelona Olympics four years ago, scored a 3-0
win over the Chinese, who needed only a draw to secure a seat in
the top two of the group.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese were pressed hard from the beginning, attempting to
hold the South Korean to a tie by nearly concentrating all their
strength on the defense.
</P>
<P>
The South Koreans, with better teamwork and individual skill,
spared no efforts in fierce attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese eleven barely kept their goal intact until the 35th
minute when Lee Ki-Hyung opened the account for South Korea.
</P>
<P>
China stepped up attacks in the second half but only to concede
two more goals for making too many errors.
</P>
<P>
Lee Woo-Young nailed the two goals in the 57th and 63rd minute.
</P>
<P>
Simutaniously, Saudi Arabia whitewashed the winless Kazakhstan
4-0. Obied Al Dossary spearheaded the winner, scoring three goals
in the 36th, 55th and 64 minute. Ibrahim Isa hit the first goal
just two minutes into the game.
</P>
<P>
South Korea topped the group with two wins and one draw while
Saudi Arabia was second with 1-2-0. China collected 1-1-1 in third,
followed by the winless Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
The semi-finals will start on Sunday with South Korea against
Iraq and Japan facing Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Concerned About Russian Duma's Revocation of  Soviet Dissolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali is concerned about the Russian parliament's
decision to revoke the dissolution of the former Soviet Union, his
spokeswoman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Last week's decision by the Duma, Russia's lower house, is "at
variance with the universally recognized norms of international
law, embodied in the Charter of the United Nations." Therese
Gastaut told reporters.
</P>
<P>
She said the Secretary-General is "confident" that regional
cooperation between members of Commonwealth of Independent States
which are fully recognized and independent U.N. member states,
will be strengthened according to "internationally accepted
procedures."
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the U.N. on Thursday, Ukrainian President
Leonid Kuchma said he believed the Russian parliament's decision
has no legal implications for his country, one of the former
Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the resolution is politically important and
forces all the new republics to reconsider Russia's policies.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian President arrived in Geneva on Thursday morning
for a two-day official visit to Switzerland, the first such visit
by a Ukrainian leader since the country's split from the former
Soviet Union in 1991.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Former Greek Prime Minister
Andreas Papandreou was discharged from hospital today with
hundreds of Greeks lined the streets to express their good wishes.
</P>
<P>
According to physicians treating the 77-year-old former
premier, who was admitted to the hospital four months ago with a
serious respiratory problem, Papandreou's clinical condition is
"very good", allowing him to be treated on an out-patient basis.
</P>
<P>
Initially suffering from a lung infection, Papandreou was
subsequently diagnosed as having pneumonia which adversely
affected his cardiac and kidney function.
</P>
<P>
His condition worsened up until Christmas day when there was a
great improvement which has continued until today, supported by
intensive physiotherapy and kidney dialysis.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou resigned as prime minister on january 15 due to his
health but retained the presidency of the ruling Panhellenic
Socialist Movement (PASOK) party.
</P>
<P>
Doctors treating him have said he should refrain from active
participation in politics during the first month of his
recuperation at home.

<HEADLINE> CIA Head Says U.S. Vulnerable to Chemical Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) Director John Deutch has issued a grim warning about
the growing threat of biological and chemical weapons against the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"The ability of our country or, I might say, any other country
in the developed world to protect their infrastructure from a
terrorist attack based on nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons
is very, very small indeed," Deutch said when testifying before a
U.S. Senate Armed Service subcommittee on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The hearing fell on the first anniversary of the attack on the
Tokyo subway system by a fanatic religious group, Aum Shinrikyo.
</P>
<P>
The CIA head said that the United States is "very poorly"
equipped to defend itself against a terrorist group armed with
biological or chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that the threat of an attack by a group
armed with relatively cheap and easy-making biological and
chemical weapons was much greater than that posed by the threat of
"loose nukes" or black-market nuclear weapons technology.
</P>
<P>
Although U.S. lawmakers are increasingly concerned about the
proliferation of the former Soviet Union nuclear weapons and
materials, Deutch said that he saw very little evidence that
nuclear weapons technology had become missing from Russia.

<HEADLINE> Banharn On Prospect of Thai-Chinese Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-archa said here today that economic and trade cooperation
between Thailand and China will be deepened in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The next 10 years will be the third decade since Thailand and
China established diplomatic ties in 1975 and it is also a new
decade in the two countries' relations, Banharn said in an
exclusive interview with Bangkok-based Chinese reporters.
</P>
<P>
The first decade was for the two countries to build mutual
trust and the second was for them to develop friendly cooperation
in the economic and trade fields, Banharn said.
</P>
<P>
In the third decade, developing multi-lateral trade
cooperation, especially in projects related to the Golden
Quadrangle, the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, will be more important for the
two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai prime minister said that bilateral trade has reached
three billion U.S. dollars and Thailand has become the eighth
largest foreign investor in China with more than 2,000 projects
involving four billion U.S. dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the current Thai-Chinese ties, Banharn said that
over the past 20 years, relations between the two countries have
achieved an overall development.
</P>
<P>
Banharn said that since he took office as prime minister,
frequent exchanges of visits by government officials,
parliamentary leaders, business people and scientists have taken
place between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
As the two countries enjoy long-term friendly relations, this
friendship has taken root deep among the peoples of the two
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have the sincerity and desire to develop their
friendly relations, therefore these relations will be able to
achieve sustained development, he said.

<HEADLINE> India Set to Enter Global Launch Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 21 (Xinhua) -- India is set to enter into the
global launch vehicle market with the successful launch of polar
satellite launch vehicle, PSLV-D3, today, the Press Trust of India
(PTI) said.
</P>
<P>
The launch that cost India 45 crore rupees (about 12.8 million
US dollars), though delayed by 72 hours, achieved its goal of
placing a 930-kg remote sensing satellite into polar orbit of
807/816 km with precision against the planned 817 km.
</P>
<P>
The indigenously-developed PSLV-D3 rocket lifted off from the
launch pad in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, at 10:23 hours local
time at the end of the 72-hour countdown, followed the
predetermined trajectory almost as planned and placed the IRS-P3
satellite in the orbit in 17 minutes and 22 seconds, PTI said.
</P>
<P>
It said the four-staged rocket with two liquid propellant based
stages and two solid propellant based ones soared into the sky and
ejected the satellite in less than 18 minutes with each of the
stages igniting, burning and separating almost as programmed.
</P>
<P>
India successfully launched a rocket of model PSLV-D2 in 1994.
The 44-meter-high rocket PSLV-D3 is the third and last in the
developmental series of India's polar satellite launch vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Indian Vice President K.R. Narayanan hailed the launch as
"triumph of self-reliance."

ATHENS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Greek President Costis
Stephanopoulos left today for a two-day official visit to Albania
and the signing of a friendship and cooperation treaty.
</P>
<P>
Stephanopoulos, who is accompanied by foreign minister
Theodoros Pangalos, will hold talks with his Albanian counterpart
Sali Berisha and other senior officials, as well as Orthodox
Archbishop Anastasios of Tirana and all Albania and
representatives of the Greek monority organization "Omonia".
</P>
<P>
According to reports, talks will focus on education of the
Greek minority in the neighbouring country, telecommunications and
transport issues.
</P>
<P>
The relations between the two Balkan states hit the lowest ebb
in 1994 following tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions, mass
deportations of Albanian workers from Greece and a trial of ethnic
Greek leaders in Tirana.
</P>
<P>
But the ice was broken last March with a visit by then Greek
Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias.
</P>
<P>
Greece is Albania's second biggest investor after Italy and the
friendship pact is expected to open the way for more
Greek-Albanian joint ventures.

<HEADLINE> Banharn to Seek New Ways for Economic Cooperation With  China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-archa said here today that he will bring along with him Thai
business people on his forthcoming visit to Beijing to explore new
ways of economic, trade and investment cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
Banharn will make an official visit to China from March 24-29
at the invitation of Chinese Premier Li Peng. In addition to
Beijing, the capital, he will also travel to Xi'an, Shanghai and
Shantou.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Bangkok-based Chinese
correspondents today, Banharn said his visit, symbolizing a
continuation of Thailand's policy of Thai-Chinese friendship as
followed by his predecessors, is of great significance both to
Thailand and China.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the visit, apart from meeting with his
Chinese counterpart Li Peng and Chinese President Jiang Zemin, he
will also meet with some provincial leaders. The meetings will
help promote bilateral cooperation, because it is essential to
expand economic, trade and investment cooperation between the two
countries to the provincial level.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the foreign ministers of the two countries
will sign an agreement on Thailand's opening a consulate general
in Shanghai in 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai-based Thai consulate general will be Thailand's
third in China. The other two are based in Guangzhou and Kunming
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Banharn said his government follows a policy of friendship with
all of Thailand's neighbors and Thailand's friendship with China
has a long history.
</P>
<P>
He said it is necessary to further strengthen Thai-Chinese
friendly ties through bilateral goodwill exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Referring to China's reform and opening up, Banharn said that
since China began its reform and opening up in 1978, its annual
economic growth has been rapid at around 10 percent and the living
quality of the Chinese people has improved considerably.
</P>
<P>
He said both Thailand and China are among the fast growing
economies. The two countries' policies are correct, he added.

MOSCOW, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry
today reiterated that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China and
that the Taiwan issue is an internal matter for the country.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigory Karasin stressed in an
interview with the Itar-Tass news agency that Russia's position
"remains unchanged."
</P>
<P>
"We proceed from the fact that Taiwan is an inalienable part
of China, and the Taiwan issue is an internal affair of the

</P>
<P>
He said that Russia "has been closely following the
development of events in the Taiwan Straits, where a certain
tension has developed."
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass also quoted a directive on Russia-Taiwan links signed
by Russian President Boris Yeltsin in September 1992, saying
Russia will not develop official state-level relations with
Taiwan. The directive also says there is one China only in the
world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.
</P>
<P>
A story carried in the Russian official newspaper "Rossiiskaya
Gazeta" today criticized the United States for its interfering in
China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The story pointed out that the situation in the Taiwan Straits
will not affect Yeltsin's visit to China in April.

<P>
DHAKA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government today
called on the people of all walks of life to resume their normal
activities by opening shops, business establishments and
educational institutions and resuming commercial and private
transportation on roads.
</P>
<P>
The government said in a press release that marked progress had

major port city of Chittagong after more security measures had
been adopted in these two metropolitan cities.
</P>
<P>
The government began deploying army troops in Dhaka and
Chittagong Wednesday to assist civil power in maintaining law and
order badly impaired by the opposition-launched indefinite
strike-like "non-cooperation" campaign.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ulster Voting Plan Under Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The British government's plans for
elections designed to pave the way for all-party peace talks on
the future of Northern Ireland were condemned by both unionists
and nationalists on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Patrick Mayhew will
formally unveil the plan and the date of election, in
parliament today.
</P>
<P>
But a BBC report ahead of the announcement revealed the plans
involve a complicated system for electing 110 members of a planned
peace forum, from which delegates will be chosen to attend the
all-party talks on the future of Ulster on June 10.
</P>
<P>
Voters will elect 90 members to the forum, five from each of
the 18 parliamentary constituencies in Northern Ireland and an
extra 20 members from the whole province.
</P>
<P>
Britain wants to hold the elections to test electoral support
of rival Irish nationalist and pro-British Unionist parties in the
province.
</P>
<P>
But nearly all the main political parties in the warn-torn
province have come out against the plan, describing it as
unworkable.
</P>
<P>
The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), a left-of-center
group favoring peaceful reunification of Ireland, labeled the
plans as "absolute nonsense."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with BBC Radio, Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of
SDLP, said that the government was "giving way to the unionists"
and any elected body, at worst, would be "an interference" with
all-party peace negotiations scheduled for June 10.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army
(IRA), accused the British government of not being serious about
the planned all-party negotiations and trying to "frustrate the
desire for proper inclusive all-party talks", BBC TV reported.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said the government wants to shift
responsibility for any future failure away from itself and onto
the political parties involved.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Unionist Party, an implacable foe of the IRA,
said Northern Ireland should be a single constituency and
candidates should be elected under a single party list system, so
that voters could choose as a bloc the party they prefer and each
party get seats proportionate to their total vote.
</P>
<P>
But the Ulster Unionist Party, the largest Protestant party
committed to continued link with London, and the Alliance Party,
which holds a neutral position in the conflict, supported the
plans.

<HEADLINE> India's Janata Dal Blamed for Failure to Form Third  Front </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Communist Party of India
(Marxist) General Secretary Harkishan Singh Surjeet has accused
the Janata Dal of lacking proper initiative for building up a
third front sincerely pursued by the left parties, the Press Trust
of India reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the CPI(M) mouthpiece Ganashakti published
today, Surjeet said it was unfortunate that at a time when there
was a "great interest among the masses towards the proposed third
front," some constituents of the National Front remained bogged
down in internal crisis.
</P>
<P>
The National Front, comprising a group of parties including the
Janata Dal, has been considering an alliance with the left parties
to make use of the favorable situation in the context of the
hawala case. Few of the leaders of the National Front have been
involved in the 18-million-U.S.-dollar bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
"Even adequate initiative on the part of the Janata Dal, the
major constituent of the National Front, is lacking," Surjeet
lamented.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the Janata Dal for failing to accelerate the
leftist efforts to build up a third national alternative to the
ruling Congress Party and the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party in
the coming elections.
</P>
<P>
The CPI(M) leader said possibilities of a third force were
based on "realistic ground" and he hoped that the Janata Dal,
whose Political Affairs Committee will meet tomorrow, would be
able to take specific decisions on building up a third force.

eggs.

<HEADLINE> WHO Warns of Worldwide Tuberculosis Epidemic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 21 (Xinhua) - Up to half a billion people could
get tuberculosis(TB) in the next 50 years unless immediate action
is taken, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned here today.
</P>
<P>
Nearly three million people died from TB in 1995, one million
more than the number who died during the worst years of an
epidemic at the beginning of the centry, a WHO report said today.
</P>
<P>
TB has become the principal killer of people with the HIV virus
and kills more women than all causes of maternal mortality
combined, said the report, published ahead of World TB Day on
March 24.
</P>
<P>
The WHO estimates nearly half of the world' refugees may be
infected with the disease.
</P>
<P>
"Anyone can catch TB simply by inhaling a TB germ that has been
coughed or sneezed into the air. These germs can remain in the air
for hours, even for years," said Dr. Arata Kochi, director of the
WHO Global TB Program.
</P>
<P>
TB has returned with avengeance after two decades of neglect by
governments and researchers and increased air travel and migration
have helped its spread throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
The WHO recommends a strategy known as directly observed
treatment, or DOTS, to fight TB. The DOTS strategy, which has been
proved successful, can cure nearly 95 percent of TB patients,
using medicines that cost less than 11 dollars in some parts of
the world.
</P>
<P>
But only 10 percent of the world's TB patients are being
treated with the DOTS strategy. WHO Director General Dr Hiroshi
Nakajima warned that the longer the widespread introduction of
this treatment is delayed, the less likely it is the disease will
be eradicated.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Vows to Continue Guerrilla War against Israel's Occupation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The secretary general of the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, stressed here today that
a guerrilla war which his party spearheads in south Lebanon would
continue as long as Israel occupies Lebanon's land.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Nasrallah told a press conference in a Hezbollah office
in Beirut that "the resistance would continue as long as the
Israeli occupation remains."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that Hezbollah preserved the right of firing
back by launching Katyusha rockets into northern Israel in case
that the Israeli forces attack civilians in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said that a suicide attack carried out Wednesday by a
Hezbollah fighter against an Israeli military convoy in the
occupied enclave in south Lebanon is a "natural" part of the
resistance against the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
"The recent operation came within its natural course and the
(Israeli) threats can not change anything," the Shiite Hezbollah
leader said.
</P>
<P>
He identified the suicide bomber as Ali Munif Ashmar, born in
1976 in Adaiseh town presently occupied by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah underlined that the Islamic Resistance, the military
wing of his militant Hezbollah, "can break through all the
security blockades of the Israeli occupation forces."
</P>
<P>
"And the resistance can move at any place in the occupied
bordering area," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the buffer zone reported that one Israeli
officer was killed and five Israeli soldiers were wounded when the
Hezbollah suicide bomber blew himself up near an Israeli convoy on
a road between the southern Lebanese villages of Rub Tlateen and
Adaiseh.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army confirmed that an army captain was killed and
an Israeli civilian wounded in the suicide raid.
</P>
<P>
And the attack evoked immediate retaliatory bombardments by
Israeli forces at suspected guerrilla targets, but no casualties
were reported.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the attack, Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres
reacted by saying that Israel "will not rely on letters and
promises. We will respond to these terrorist acts the way we see
fit and whenever we decide."
</P>
<P>
Just on day before the suicide bombing, the Israeli premier
announced that he had received information that Hezbollah was
about to scale down its operations.

<P>
The findings also show that family contribution is the most
important source of financial support for students, with 90 percent
of respondents depending on this to some degree.
</P>
<P>
Students also rely on earnings from part-time employment and
personal savings, with 69 percent and 56 percent, respectively,
depending on these to cover at least part of their expenses.

<HEADLINE> Land Prices in Japan's Urban Areas Fall for 5th Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Land prices in three of Japan's
major cities slumped for the fifth year in a row in 1995, and
further falls are likely, Kyodo News said today.
</P>
<P>
The drop reflects the continuing slide in the economy after the
asset-inflated bubble burst the late 1980s, Kyodo News said.
</P>
<P>
The average price of land for commercial use in Tokyo, Osaka,
Nagoya and surrounding areas on January 1 this year fell 16
percent on a year earlier, following a 14.8 percent drop in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The average price of residential land in the three
areas dropped 4.6 percent after a 2.5 percent tumble in the
previous year, Kyodo News said in a report.
</P>
<P>
These land prices, calculated on a nationwide survey of land
prices based on real estate deals, serve as a barometer for land
deals and the evaluation of inheritance and real estate taxes,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
"The downward trend in commercial-area land prices in the major
urban area is likely to continue for a while," Kyodo News cited an
official of the Japanese National Land Agency as saying.

BUCHAREST, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Anghel Iordanescu of Romanian
national soccer team trainer said on Thursday he had changed his
mind to quit in protest that his allegations of match rigging in
local championships had been ignored.
</P>
<P>
He said he wanted to take the team to the European soccer
championships and was responding to public pressure to stay on at
the head of the national team.
</P>
<P>
Iordanescu, a national hero for taking Romania to the 1994
World Cup quarterfinals in the United States.
</P>
<P>
He announced on Monday that he was quitting because soccer
authorities had ignored his claims of widespread rigging.
</P>
<P>
"I was most pained by the fact that the practice of rigging
local championship games was public knowledge, and yet nobody
ever took any step against it," he was quoted as saying.
</P>

Several local club presidents have attacked Iordanescu over
his allegations, calling them unwarranted and unfounded, reports

<HEADLINE> Nepali PM Plans to Call Mid-term Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba is planning to call a mid-term election if his
coalition government could survive a no-confidence motion in the
parliament Sunday, a local evening newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
As some MPs of the second ruling National Democratic Party
(RPP) have decided to withdraw their support for the three-party
government led by the Nepali Congress (NC) party and to vote for
the motion, Deuba, whose government could no longer secure
majority support in the present parliament, would call a mid-term
election even if the motion is defeated, the Nepali language
Mahanagar evening daily reported by quoting sources close to the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Communist Party of Nepal (UML) Wednesday
tabled the no-confidence motion against the Deuba government in a
special house session, where a vote on the motion would be held
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The UML has requested the ruling partner RPP to support its
motion and offered to form a RPP-UML coalition government with RPP
leader Lokendra Bahadur Chand as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
But RPP President Surya Bahadur Thapa rejected the UML proposal
and maintained his party should remain in the present ruling
coalition.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the RPP party have been divided into two camps led
by Chand and Thapa respectively with opposing opinions over the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Although the party issued a directive Wednesday ordering all
its MPs to vote against the no-confidence motion, some of them
have vowed to vote for it.
</P>
<P>
With its 19 MPs in the 205-seat House of Representatives, the
RPP holds the key to the survival of the Deuba government as the
main ruling party NC and the main opposition UML party hold 86 and
88 seats respectively in the house.

<HEADLINE> Dead Sturgeon to Publicize Wildlife Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have decided to
stuff and mount a dead Chinese sturgeon and display it as an
urgent call for public awareness of wild animal protection.
</P>
<P>
The 3.33-m-long female sturgeon died of serious internal
and external injuries six days after it was netted at the mouth of
the Minjiang River on the southeastern coast of China last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Contributing to its demise was the fact that it was kept out of
water too long -- three to four hours -- after it was
captured, experts who tried to save it revealed.
</P>
<P>
"The fishermen who netted the rare fish should have adopted
proper and timely protection measures," the experts said, "But
their knowledge of wildlife protection was too poor."
</P>
<P>
The stuffed fish will be displayed at the Zuohai Aquarium in
this capital of east Chinas' Fujian Province, where the sturgeon
died.
</P>
<P>
The dead sturgeon, weighing about 300 kg (about 660 lb) and 15
to 20 years old, was the second one found at the Minjiang River's
mouth in this century. Locals said a fish this large has never
been caught before.
</P>
<P>
An adult Chinese sturgeon is generally 1.7-2.5 m long and weighs
150 to 300 kg.
</P>
<P>
Existing on the earth for 140 million years, Chinese sturgeons
are mainly found in the Yangtze River. This species has been on
the verge of extinction in recent years and it has been listed
among wildlife under strict protection in China.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Council Member Accuses Israel of Expanding Jewish Settlements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 21 (Xinhua) -- A member of the Palestinian
legislative council today accused Israel of trying to expand its
Jewish settlements in the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Cairo-based Sawt Al-Arab (Voice of
Arabs) Radio, Saeb Erakat said that Israel has violated the
Palestinian-Israeli agreements and restored its occupation in many
areas of the West Bank. The interview was carried by the Middle
East News Agency (MENA).
</P>
<P>
Since the holding of the Summit of Peacemakers in the Egyptian
resort of Sharm el-Sheikh last Wednesday, he said, the Israeli
authorities have taken more repressive measures against over 2
million Palestinians in the self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Israel has adopted punitive measures against the Palestinians,
including the closure of the West Bank and Gaza, since February
25, when Palestinian Islamic extremists started a series of
suicide bombings in Israel, which left 58 people dead.
</P>
<P>
Describing conditions of the Palestinian people as tragic,
Erakat was quoted as saying that acts of violence will not be
brought to a halt unless security is guaranteed for all,
particularly the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Israeli, Palestinian Extremists Collude to Wreck Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat has said that the Israeli ultra-rightwing
Jewish extremists acted in collusion with the Islamic militants of
Hamas and Jihad to wreck the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview published by today's Egyptian
English-language newspaper Al-Ahram Weekly, Arafat said that the
Palestinian security forces have seized missiles and explosives,
which only exist in the Israeli arsenal, in the possession of
extremists of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) and Jihad
(Holy War).
</P>
<P>
"High and influential Israeli circles" provided Hamas and Jihad
with this advanced weaponry, Arafat was quoted as saying in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
"It is regrettable that there is clear and documented
coordination between the Israeli and Palestinian extremists,"
Arafat said in the interview.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper published every Thursday, Arafat
indicated that the Islamic militants have the backing of Iran and
unnamed Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was quoted as saying that the Palestinian Authority has
"asked Iran, some Arab states and the other concerned parties to
halt their support for the Palestinian Islamist organizations and
their dangerous actions."
</P>
<P>
In the interview, the Palestinian leader also accused Israel of
using security as a pretext for collective punishments against the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"What has security got to do with preventing the supplies of
food and medicine and punishing children and sick people, some of
whom have died because Israeli roadblocks prevented them from
reaching hospitals for treatment?" said Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Israel has imposed a closure of the Palestinian self-rule areas
of Gaza and the West Bank since February 25 when Palestinian
Islamic extremists started a series of suicide bombings in Israel,
which killed 58 people.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also suggested that the 13 Arab states which took part
in last week's "Summit of Peacemakers" in the Egyptian Red Sea
resort of Sharm el-Sheikh should hold a coordination meeting in
advance of a follow-up conference to the summit, which will talk
place in Washington at the end of this month, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"Arab coordination is necessary in advance of the Washington
meeting in order to achieve fruitful results," he was quoted as
saying.

<HEADLINE> New Indian Government May Take Over After May 15 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The new Indian government is
likely to be installed in the third week of May, perhaps without
waiting for the Indian-held Jammu and Kashmir poll results to be
announced, according to the Times of India today.
</P>
<P>
Assuming that the electorate gives a clear-cut verdict,
official sources said the question of who will form the next
government might be answered by May 10 when most of the results
would be known.
</P>
<P>
"The new government can be formed any day after May 15," V.N.
Gadgil, a spokesman for the ruling Congress Party, said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission announced on Tuesday that the general
elections will be held in four phases from April 27 to May 21. But
the poll process across the country except in Indian-held Jammu
and Kashmir will end on May 14, including the announcement of
results.
</P>
<P>
Only three of the 543 seats to the Lok Sabha (lower house of
parliament) will be contested in the second phase of polling in
Indian-held Jammu and Kashmir, scheduled for May 21, so it is
believed that the voting on May 21 can barely affect the outcome
of the entire elections.

</P>
<P>
The International Film Market (FILMART '97), organized by the
Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) and the Hong Kong
Movie Producers and Distributors Association, is scheduled to be
held between March 18 and 21, 1997.

Hong Kong is the world's third largest film maker next to the
United States and India, producing 200 titles a year, and it is
also the second largest film exporter in the world.
</P>

Kuo expressed his wish that the film gala next year would
promote Hong Kong's role as the leading international film
distribution hub in Asia. Overseas exhibitors can find an easy
access to Asia's increasingly lucrative film market, he said.

sales companies, film and video distributors, and providers of

BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The question of Hong Kong
residents' nationality must be handled flexibly, according to the
Chinese government's policy and Hong Kong residents' actual

</P>
<P>
This decision was made when the first session of the legal panel

</P>
<P>
Discussing the concrete implementation of the Nationality Law

It was also proposed that the Preparatory Committee submit
the Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China to the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to interpret
its implementation in the Hong Kong SAR.

Reviewing the two proposals of the legal panel of the

<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
said here today that maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and
stability not only reflects the aspirations of the Hong Kong
compatriots, but also those of the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark at a meeting with a shipping transportation
delegation from the Hong Kong Shipowners Association, led by its
chairman George S.K. Chao here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said that at present the Preparatory Committee of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region is stepping up its work.
</P>
<P>
After 1997, he stressed, the Chinese government's principles
regarding Hong Kong such as "one country, two systems" and "Hong
Kong people governing Hong Kong" will remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Li said continuously keeping the position of Hong Kong as an
international financial, trade and shipping center is an important
condition for maintaining its prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
A more prosperous and stable Hong Kong will not only be
beneficial to the Hong Kong compatriots, but also important for
the growth of the mainland's economy, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chao expressed the belief that after 1997, Hong Kong's economy
would be more prosperous, its container freight volume will grow
and its shipping industry will be boosted.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was sure that Hong Kong would continuously
maintain its status as an international shipping center under the
Chinese government's principles of "one country, two systems" and
"Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong".

<HEADLINE> Manila to Hike Capital Outlay for Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
double the capital outlay for infrastructure next year to 73.8
billion pesos (2.952 billion US dollars) from 37.434 billion pesos
(1.497 billion dollars) in the 1996 budget.
</P>
<P>
The Developmental Budget Coordinating Committee (DBCC)
disclosed today it is proposing a cash budget of 479.3 billion
pesos (19.172 billion dollars) for 1997.
</P>
<P>
This will be an increase of 15.35 percent over the 1996 budget
of 415.5 billion pesos (16.62 billion us dollars).
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the 1997 budget is to be allocated for social
services, particularly education and infrastructure programs.
</P>
<P>
The DBCC is working on a capital expenditure of 94.7 billion
pesos (3.788 billion dollars) for the coming year, 12.4 billion
pesos (496 million dollars) more than the outlay of 82.3 billion
pesos (3.292 billion dollars) for this year.
</P>
<P>
The 15.35 percent hike in the capital outlay for next year
would go mostly to infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the increase in capital expenditure for
1997 is expected to improve the country's standing in the region
in terms of public sector capital outlays as a percentage of gross
domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has been lagging behind other nations in the
region in this particular economic indicator.
</P>
<P>
The country's public sector capital outlays as a percentage of
GDP were the lowest at 3.2 percent in 1993 as against 12.5 percent
for Thailand, 8.2 percent for Indonesia, 5.8 percent for Malaysia
and 4.3 percent for Singapore.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Delhi High Court has
ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to complete
within seven days the investigation into a payoffs case concerning
a no-confidence motion in 1993, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Suraj Mandal, a member of parliament from Jharkhand Mukti
Morcha (JMM), allegedly received a huge amount of money to vote
for the P.V. Narasimha Rao government during the 1993
no-confidence motion.
</P>
<P>
The money was alleged paid by Prime Minister Rao or somebody
else on his behalf. The Delhi High Court had earlier ordered the
CBI to investigate the source of the payoffs.
</P>
<P>
A CBI counsel handed on Wednesday the investigating agency's
original verification report to the court and said that the agency
was "on the eve of registering a regular case against Suraj
Mandal."
</P>
<P>
But the judges of the court expressed their disappointment when
the counsel said it would need at least six more months to
register the case.
</P>
<P>
Saying that this matter of "national importance" brooked no
delay, the judges directed the agency to try to complete the
investigation within seven days. The case was fixed for hearing

<HEADLINE> Ikeda Ends Visit to Russia with "Very Good" Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko
Ikeda ended his visit to Russia today after what he described as
"very good" talks with Russian leaders.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda met Russian President Boris Yeltsin and held separate
talks with Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets and
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov during his two-day stay.
</P>
<P>
He said he valued Russia's efforts to carry out democratic
reform and said Tokyo was ready to assist in the reforms where
possible.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Yeltsin, Ikeda handed over a message
from Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto offering
assistance in preparing for the nuclear security summit meeting of
the G-7 countries and Russia in Moscow in April.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin asked Japan to support Russia's accession to the G-7,
the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president also noted that cooperation between the
two countries should not be limited to the Tokyo Declaration,
rather it should be used as the basis for further development of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with Primakov, Ikeda urged Russia to continue
dialogue on security issues and suggested holding a meeting
between the Russian Defense Minister and head of the Japanese
Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Primakov told Ikeda that Russia is taking steps to demilitarize
the disputed Kurile islands -- Iturup, Kunashir, Khabomai and
Shikotan -- and has already withdrawn all troops from
Shikotan. Russia has halved the number of troops on the islands
from 7,000 in 1992 to 3,500.
</P>
<P>
Primakov stressed that the Tokyo Declaration signed in 1993
reflects both countries' intention to continue talks on a peace
treaty and resolve the territorial dispute over the four tiny
islands according to international law.
</P>
<P>
After the first meeting of the Russian-Japanese joint
commission held on Wednesday afternoon, Soskovets told reporters
both sides agreed in principle on the use of Tokyo's
500-million-U.S.-dollar loan to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Part of the loan will be used to develop investment
projects in Russia's far east region.
</P>
<P>
Soskovet also said Russia and Japan needed to discuss a new,
general two-billion-dollar investment loan.

NEW DELHI, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Indian National

directly from business houses rather than taking them secretly,
the Hindustan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet Minister Sitaram Kesri, who is also treasurer of the

industrial houses asking them to donate liberally for the election
fund.
</P>

In the letters, Kesri listed the achievements of the Congress
Party and suggested that industrialists and businessmen should

He said the Congress Party is in favor of cutting down election
expenses and also supports the state funding of elections.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> HK Telecom to Tap Mass Mobile Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Telecom will increase
the capacity of its mobile telephone network by two-thirds within
two years, according to a spokesman for the company.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director Allen Ma said on Wednesday that Hong Kong
Telecom CSL, the company's mobile telephone division, needs the
capacity to serve a new customer base - the middle class - because
the market for business users is almost saturated.
</P>
<P>
"The business market is drying up so we need to explore the
mass markets," he said.
</P>
<P>
As Hong Kong's four mobile-telephone companies battle for the
broad-based consumer market, their capacity to serve many
thousands of new customers will be key to their profitability.
</P>
<P>
CSL said earlier this month it will expand its capacity to
500,000 users from 300,000. Ma said Telecom plans to invest 600
million HK dollars in its network in the year ending March
1997.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Tamil Rebels Attack Thalladi Bridge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops
Wednesday night repulsed an attack by a large number of Sea Tigers
of Tamil rebels directed at the Thalladi bridge in Mannar in the
north of the country, according to military sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the Sea Tigers arrived at the bridge and
directed small arms fire at the police and army guards stationed
on either side of the bridge.
</P>
<P>
The Tigers were aiming to blast the bridge which connects the
Mannar Island to the mainland, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources quoted military officials as saying that they did
not suffer any casualties but were unable to ascertain immediately
the number of the Tigers killed.
</P>
<P>
A team of military men were at the spot this morning engaged in
search operations in the area and they believed that the Tigers
suffered heavily.
</P>
<P>
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels in the
recent past were seen building up in large numbers in certain
areas in Mannar and intelligence reports indicate their main aim
is to blast the Thalladi bridge, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting for a separate state in the
north-east of Sri Lanka since 1983. More than 50,000 people have
been killed in the civil war.

ISLAMABAD, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan today welcomed the US

<HEADLINE> Construction of HK New Airport Goes on Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Construction at Chek Lap Kok,
the site for Hong Kong's new airport, has been going smoothly and
the project is on target for completion on time for an April 1998
opening, said Alistair Thomson, the Airport Authority's Head of
Construction.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Authority's regular media briefing at the site
today, Thomson said: "The size of the project and the speed with
which it is being accomplished is extraordinary."
</P>
<P>
Right across the 1,248-hectare platform, installation of
massive amounts of drainage, ducting and other necessary services
below-ground and bulk excavation works has steadily given way to
airfield works and infrastructure above ground.
</P>
<P>
Thomson said that the Airfield Works Joint Venture began its
contract just 11 months ago. The contractor has moved on to
substantial formation of the runway and taxiways by laying crushed
aggregate sub-base and basecourse prior to asphalting the runway.
</P>
<P>
Piling for the "Super Terminal One", the massive air cargo
facility, has been completed on schedule; the air catering
franchisees and the fuel supply franchisee are progressing with
their contracts for construction.
</P>
<P>
He said that progress on the passenger terminal building has
also been good, with more than 10,000 cubic meters of concrete
being placed every week. The arrivals hall structure is very close
to completion.

<HEADLINE> HK Consumer Price Indices Further Moderate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Consumer Price Index of
Hong Kong was 7.3 percent higher in February 1996 than in the same
month of last year, according to the latest statistics released by
the Census and Statistics Department today.
</P>
<P>
The corresponding rate of increase in January was 6.8 percent,
according to the statistics.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said that, reflecting a general
moderation in inflationary pressures from both domestic and
imported sources, the prices of most consumer items continued to
show less rapid increases in February.
</P>
<P>
These included clothing and footwear, durable goods, alcoholic
drinks and tobacco, housing cost, fuel and light, and meals away
from home.
</P>
<P>
Taking the first two months of the year together, the increase
in Consumer Price Index averaged seven percent over the same
period of last year, which was significantly slower than the
corresponding average increase of 9.1 percent in 1995.

<HEADLINE> US Civil Rights Leader On Nigeria's Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The massive turnout of voters for
the zero-party ward delegates election last Saturday was
indicative of the confidence Nigerians have in the
transition-to-civil-rule program of the military government, an
American civil rights group has observed.
</P>
<P>
The ward delegates election is the first of a series of
elections under the three-year transition program announced by
Nigerian Head of State General Sani Abacha last October.
</P>
<P>
The group, now in Nigeria to monitor the process of the
transition and alleged human rights violation, expressed
satisfaction with the freedom which pervaded the atmosphere
during the election.
</P>
<P>
"We are impressed that the boycott that was said will attend
the process did not take place. We are also impressed that the
chaos believed by critics will mar the election did not happen,"
the group leader, Roy Innis, said during a visit to the New
Nigerian newspaper in Kaduna, north Nigeria, yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Innis said the initial impression of chaos and disorder
created was the handiwork of an international conspiracy to
tarnish the image of Nigeria and the present Nigerian
administration.
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of what the administration in Washington thinks of
the program what we have seen gives us the confidence it will be
a success all through," said Roy Innis, who is the National
Chairman of Congress of Racial Equality (CORE).
</P>
<P>
The group remarked that Nigeria has been a victim of the
"savagery" which truth had been subjected to in the international
media.
</P>
<P>
Innis said that his group had, for instance, discovered that
the tribunal which tried the nine executed Ogoni leaders was not
peculiar to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"We used it in America for a long time for special situation.
We used it when (former US President) Abraham Lincoln was
murdered. The world court used it to try war criminals and the
system is still in use in trying criminals of the bosnian war,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
To protest against Nigeria's execution of nine Ogoni activists
for murder in South Nigeria, the Commonwealth has suspended
Nigeria's membership in the world organisation, and the United
States and a few other western countries have imposed sanctions
against Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The US civil rights leader regretted that the media
capitalised on the ignorance of their various publics to
orchestrate the so-called human rights abuses in the Ogoni case.
The CORE national chairman criticised other US organisations
notably the influential Washington-based Trans-Africa for their
narrow approach in their policies regarding Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He criticised the Director of Trans-Africa, Randall Robinson,
for rebuffing a delegation of black newspaper publishers, who
came to Washington to report on their trip to Nigeria. enditem

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's Funcinpec Party Holds National Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Funcinpec party, the
largest of Cambodia's four ruling parties, opened its second
national congress at its headquarters here today.
</P>
<P>
The congress, which was attended by more than 4,500 party
representatives, will review and approve the new by-laws and
internal regulations of the party, said Funcinpec Chairman Norodom
Ranariddh, who is also the country's first prime minister, in an
opening speech.
</P>
<P>
It will also vote for the 120 members of the National Advisory
Board and choose the next steering committee, Ranariddh said.
</P>
<P>
The Funcinpec party was founded on March 21, 1981 by Samdech
Norodom Sihanouk, the then head of state. The party has become the
biggest ruling party since the U.N.-organized general elections in
May 1993.
</P>
<P>
Funcinpec held its first national congress in the northern
province of Oddar Meachey in February 1992, when it was in
opposition to one of its current coalition partners, the Cambodian
People's Party (CPP).
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Ranariddh reviewed the achievements made by his
party in the past years.
</P>
<P>
He said as the chairman of Funcinpec, he had led the party to
take part in the 1993 general elections.
</P>
<P>
The victory of Funcinpec allowed it to contribute to the
organization of the present royal government, which has rebuilt
and preserved a stable constitutional monarchy, he added.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that Funcinpec has firmly abided by its fundamental
principles based on unity and solidarity, on Sinhanoukism and
nationalism.
</P>
<P>
The party will continue to work to preserve the solidarity and
national unity, and to strengthen and develop itself, Ranariddh
said.
</P>
<P>
He also said he hoped the friendly alliance and collaboration
with other parties, the CPP in particular, will be safeguarded to
maintain the security, peace and progress in Cambodia.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Older Folks Enjoying Life More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The elderly in east China's
Shanghai are enjoying a comfortable and happy life, thanks to the
services provided by local neighborhood committees and services,
with many saying that they could not live without them.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Xiaomei, who lives alone, gives an example. Not long ago,
she was suffering from acute diarrhea in the middle of the night,
but only had to push a button to get help. Staff members of a
nearby neighborhood committee heard the buzzer and rushed her to a
hospital where she got help.
</P>
<P>
The city now has installed the buzzers in the homes of more
than 2,400 old folks who live alone.
</P>
<P>
Most of the neighborhood committees also provide milk
deliveries, laundry service, and do shopping for daily
essentials. They have also set up clinics especially for those who
have difficulty getting to hospitals. Some staff members even care
for the elderly in their homes.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is China's major city to be faced with the problem of
an aging population. The city now has 2.21 million people at or
above the age of 60, who account for 17 percent of the total urban
population.
</P>
<P>
Of these, more than 200,000 are above the age of 80, and
120,000 cannot take care of themselves, with some 60,000
bed-ridden.
</P>
<P>
The situation has aroused the attention of the municipal
government. Several years ago, local neighborhood committees were
encouraged to help the elderly to live a better life in their
remaining years.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, 50 homes for the aged run by
neighborhood committees have been improved and expanded. Almost
all are equipped with dining halls, bathrooms, laundry facilities,
and entertainment centers.
</P>
<P>
To meet various demands of the elderly, most neighborhood
committees have set up entertainment rooms, tea houses, schools,
and match-making centers.
</P>
<P>
At present, 98.9 percent of the city's neighborhood committees
have voluntary service groups and facilities. There are usually
some 750,000 people taking part in various services for the
elderly at any given time.

last November.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete said the problems included intimidation in the refugee
camps and cross-border raids into Rwanda and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Others were inadequate judicial systems in Rwanda and Burundi
and continued violence in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister added the presidents promised to reduce
tension, hostility, insecurity and distrust in the area,
encourage the return of refugees as well as stimulate economic
rehabilitation and development.
</P>
<P>

street or perching on the tall surrounding buildings. Their
numbers are so large that people often stop to have a look.
</P>
<P>
"They're like sand blowing in the sky" a boy said, trying to
count the number.
</P>
<P>
A nearby woman said that the crows disappear in the morning but
come back at dusk and their numbers are increasing.
</P>
<P>
"It is a rare phenomenon," said Qiu Hongjie, deputy
secretary-general of the Liaoning Wild Animal Protection
Association, who attributes it to improvement of the quality of
urban garbage which is the major food source for crows in
winter. The low capture rate and rise in temperature are also
factors.
</P>
<P>
The number of crows living around the city is increasing by 10
percent annually, according to a survey.

<HEADLINE> China Condemns US Congress's Resolution on Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government strongly
condemned here today the US House of Representatives for its
adoption of a resolution, "wantonly claiming that the US should
help defend Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people "express our resolute
opposition to and strong indignation at this detestable act of the
US side which constitutes a serious encroachment upon China's
sovereignty and a gross interference in China's internal affairs,
and has intensified the tension across the Taiwan Straits," said
Shen Guofang, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the US House of Representatives adopted the
resolution on March 19.
</P>
<P>
In his statement to a press conference here this afternoon,
Shen noted that the question of Taiwan is purely an internal
affair of China which brooks no interference by any foreign
country.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan is China's sacred territory. It is not a US
protectorate. Some people in the US congress, in disregard of the
national feelings of the Chinese people, are attempting to
obstruct, by a show of force, the Chinese nation from realizing
the reunification of the motherland, which is doomed to failure,"
Shen stressed.
</P>
<P>
The position of the Chinese government and people on
safeguarding state sovereignty and territorial integrity is firm
and unshakable, the spokesman said, adding, "We demand the US side
strictly adhere to the principles set forth in the three Sino-US
Joint Communiques and the basic norms governing international
relations and immediately stop its erroneous activities of
encroaching upon China's sovereignty and interfering in China's
internal affairs."

<HEADLINE> Ambassador: Germany Will Fight against PKK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Germany is determined to combat
violence by the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The Daily News quoted German ambassador to Turkey Hans-Joachim
Vergau as saying that "the law is that terrorism is forbidden."
</P>
<P>
"We fight terrorism without compromise, and those that
undertake violent actions disrupting our public order will have
to face the strictest counter-measures from the authorities," he
said
</P>
<P>
More than 300 people were injured in pitched battles at the
weekend as German police tried to stop thousands of Kurds from
attending a banned protest organized by the PKK in Dortmund,
Germany.
</P>
<P>
"The origin of PKK terrorism is in Turkey, finally the PKK
activists are Turks. So the events have made the question more
pressing," the German ambassador said. "What is the policy of
Turkey to mitigate the underlying problem of this violent
opposition?"
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 people have been killed in clashes between
the Turkish government troops and the PKK rebels since the PKK
started to fight for independence in southeastern Turkey in
1984.
</P>
<P>
German Interior Minister Manfred Kanther has said that the PKK
carries terrorism not only to Turkey, but also to the whole of
Europe.

<HEADLINE> Zambia To Control Larger Grain Borers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 21 (Xinhua)-- The Zambian government is taking
measures to control the larger grain borer pests that are now
threatening to wipe out the expected bumper harvest of maize this
year, Times of Zambia reported today.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted Deputy Agriculture Minister Dickson Matutu as
saying that a ban of grain movements from the infested areas
had been put in place to control the spread of pests which could
destroy between 30 to 40 percent of grain stocks.
</P>
<P>
The government would soon import chemicals and beetles to fight
pests, which originated in Tanzania from where zambia was currently
importing maize, Matutu said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the outbreak of the pests to illegal entry of maize
into Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The government was seeking assistance from the Food and
Agriculture Organization and the European Union to fight
the pests, he added.
</P>
<P>
Zambia is expected to harvest about 15 million bags (90 kg per
bag) of maize this year, 50 percent more than in 1995. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 21 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei Province
has plans to look for more ways to raise funds to fuel its
economic expansion over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
"We will open foreign-funded banks" and develop urban
cooperative banks in some major cities, Governor Ye Liansong said.
</P>
<P>
The province intends to issue more stocks and bonds, by
selecting enterprises with good returns for the Hong Kong and
overseas securities trading centers.
</P>
<P>
Hebei is expected to expand its fund-raising to local
governments and enterprises and tighten the central government's
money policy.
</P>
<P>
"We will also try to attract capital from outside Hebei and
encourage the use of capital that is lying idle for infrastructure
projects," the governor said.
</P>
<P>
Finance departments in Hebei will continue to finance highway,
port, railway, airport, electricity, and posts and
telecommunications development this year. The province is also
considering setting up funds for agriculture, energy, transport,
urban construction, and technology.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995), loans
provided by local financial institutions increased by more than 20
percent annually. Officials with the Hebei Branch of the People's
Bank of China said that local banks have paid attention to
foreign-funded enterprises and large cooperative projects.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, local banks had loaned 3.4 billion yuan to
foreign-funded firms as part of the effort to find sufficient
capital for them.

<HEADLINE> Summer Palace Lake Older than Old Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The famous lake at Beijing's
historical Summer Palace is 2,000 years older than historians had
believed.
</P>
<P>
Researchers using 20th century technology have discovered that
the ancient Kunming Hu lake was formed as long as 3,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Until recently it was believed that the lake was only 1,500
years old.
</P>
<P>
Close to the Western Hills, the Summer Palace is the largest
park in Beijing, and attracts millions of visitors every year.
</P>
<P>
Covering an area of 220 hectares, the Kunming Hu Lake
constitutes the major part of the park.
</P>
<P>
Its original two names were WengShan Bo and Western Lake, but
it was renamed Kunming Hu lake when Emperor Qianlong of Qing
Dynasty (1644-1911) celebrated his mother's 60th birthday.
</P>
<P>
The theory that the lake was formed 1,500 years ago has been
repudiated by geological research results, which shows that the
lake was more than 3,500 years old, over 400 years older than the
history of the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Researchers made the discovery by analysing the lake deposits
sampled from the lake bed during the period of 1990-1991, when the
municipal government launched a large-scale project to dredge the
lake's silt.

<HEADLINE> Three Wise Old Men from Tibet (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- When you drink tea, you are
supposed to savor it, when you need advice, you are supposed to
get it from the old people.
</P>
<P>
The old Tibetan saying proved its wisdom once again when three
elderly Tibetans returned home from abroad and refuted Dalai
Lama's preaching of "Tibetan independence". The three pledged to
contribute to the safeguarding of China's unification.
</P>
<P>
Dainba Chilai, Gyaincain Cunpi and Zhaxi Wangdui are all in
their 70s.
</P>
<P>
Dainba Chilai, 77, used to be a senior official in the Dalai
Lama's "exiled government" after fleeing China in 1959.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that he was "unaware of the truth" when he left his
motherland and family 37 years ago. While abroad, he was involved
in the "the independence of Tibet" activities.
</P>
<P>
"But we got nowhere," he said. "Though we did all we could for
all those years, not a single country has ever recognized Tibet as
an independent country.
</P>
<P>
"With the passage of time, I became disillusioned with the
unrealistic political ploy of the Dalai Lama clique," he said,
adding that the so-called "independence of Tibet" is no more than
"castles in the air".
</P>
<P>
After careful consideration he returned home and settled in
Tibet in 1985.
</P>
<P>
"I heard that some hard-liners abroad swore at me," he
said. "But I don't care because I have made the right choice."
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that 30,000 overseas Tibetans have
visited the Tibet Autonomous Region, and 2,000 have settled in
their homeland.
</P>
<P>
Zhaxi Wangdui, 73, was the manager of a manor in Qonggyai
County, owned by the Sera Monastery, one of the three largest
monasteries in Tibet, before the peaceful liberation of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
He said his relatives and friends in Tibet wrote to him in the
early 1980s, saying that the government policies are popular and
that their living standard had risen substantially. They also
urged him to come back as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"Then I was dubious at what they said," he said. "But I did
want to come back, to have a look with my own eyes."

<P>
Zhaxi Wangdui came back to Tibet on a visit in 1983.
</P>
<P>
"Seeing is believing," he said, "Although Qonggyai is still
considered a poor county in Tibet, great changes have taken place
in the rural areas there."
</P>
<P>
"I would say that farmers there are now really living in
heaven, compared with their lives before Tibet's peaceful
liberation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhaxi Wangdui, who eventually returned to Tibet in 1985,
advised Tibetans residing abroad to come back, and see with their
own eyes what Tibet looks like today, before drawing conclusions.
</P>
<P>
Gyaincain Cunpi shares his view. The 72-year-old buddhist said
what the communists have done in Tibet embodies the true meaning
of Buddhism -- bringing happiness to all.
</P>
<P>
Citing tremendous changes that have taken place in Tibet since
the peaceful liberation, he said, "We should follow our
consciences."
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can deny that the Communist Party of China has done so
many good things for Tibetans," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the soul boy for the 10th Panchen Lama, the three
men became quite excited.
</P>
<P>
Dainba Chilai said, "I was honored to attend the ceremony of
drawing lots from a gold urn to choose the reincarnated boy of the
late 10th Panchen Lama. I will never forget the scene for the rest
of my life."
</P>
<P>
"It is most sacred and convincing to choose the reincarnated
boy of the Panchen Lama by drawing lots in front of the statue of
Sakyamuni," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the irresponsible comments made by some people
abroad on the selection of the new Panchen Lama were "what we
expected, because these people never want us to live in peace."
</P>
<P>
In accordance with historical conventions and religious
rituals, the confirmation of the new Panchen Lama is subject to
the central government's approval, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
After coming back, the three wise old men were all well
received by local governments. Now they all work in the local
committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference.

HEFEI, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Anhui Province has covered 200,000
ha of barren land along the Yangtze River in the southwestern part
of the province over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The afforestation project was designed to curb soil erosion and
water losses in the area, one of the regions plagued by serious
soil erosion and water loss.
</P>
<P>
It cost the province 40 million yuan and took 16 million
workdays for farmers to complete the project.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the five-year effort has increased the area's
forest coverage rate from 31 to 40 percent, and its timber
resources by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The project also cut the area's soil erosion by 30 percent, or
from 2,539 tons per square kilometer a year to 1,824 tons.
</P>
<P>
Farmers also benefited economically from the project as many
species of trees planted produce cash crops, such as oranges,
tangerines, and Chinese chestnuts.

CHONGQING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- As the deadline for the
blocking of the Yangtze River by the Three Gorges Dam draws near,
Sichuan and Hubei provinces are wasting no time in resettling
schools that will disappear under water.
</P>
<P>
By the time the new reservoir will be full of water, submerging
over 600 schools in Sichuan and Hubei provinces. It will mean the
resettlements of 200,000 schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
The countdown to the resettlement has already started to ensure
the successful damming of the Yangtze in November of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Wanxian City, which shoulders the heaviest resettlement task,
is busy building or merging schools.
</P>
<P>
The city has introduced a series of preferential policies or
financial schemes to aid the relocation of schools.
</P>
<P>
Hubei's Yichang City, the dam site, has moved Sujia, Tanjiatuo
and other three schools to its new district -- Xiaoxita
town. Since 1993, the city has invested over four million yuan
(about 482,000 US dollars) in repairing and expanding schools,
ensuring the education of more than 600 additional students.

<HEADLINE> Greater Access to Radio and TV Programs in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- A radio and TV broadcasting system,
with Lhasa at the center, now covers all parts of the Tibet
Autonomous Region, providing knowledge, information, and
entertainment to local people.
</P>
<P>
China put a total of 190 million yuan (22 million US dollars)
into Tibet's radio and television system during the Eighth
Five-Year Plan (1991-1995).
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, work on 550 township-level receiving
stations was basically completed, meaning that the needs of the
autonomous region's radio and television center, which is
scheduled to begin operation this May, had been met.
</P>
<P>
The population coverage rate of the Tibet radio and TV systems
has improved by 15 percentage points and 14 percentage points, to
55 percent and 50 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Cities where prefectural commissioners' offices are located and
some counties now have access to programs of the Central
Broadcasting Station and Tibet Broadcasting Station, and two to
three programs of the China Central Television Station and Tibet
Television Station.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, Tibetans now have more than 200,000
radios and over 120,000 TV sets.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), Tibet is scheduled
to raise the radio and TV coverage rate to 80 and 70 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region is set to gradually increase its capacity
to present more radio and TV programs from elsewhere that have
been translated into the Tibetan language. By the end of the Ninth
Five-Year Plan, annual volume of such programs is expected to
reach 3,400 hours and 800 hours, up from 1,800 hours and 400 hours
respectively.

WELLINGTON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Reserve Bank

for "some time to come."
</P>
<P>
Bank Governor Don Brash said inflationary pressure over the
past 12 and 18 months was worse than expected.

<P>
He attributed the problem to the rising property prices and the
high lending rates of banks.

<P>
The Reserve Bank expected the country's inflation to start
subsiding in the middle of this year. New Zealand's underlying
inflation is forecast to peak at two percent in March.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will complete the
amendment of its alien business law in the next three months to
facilitate foreign firms' operations in the country, a senior Thai
official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar on "Thai Economic Policy and Foreign Investment,"
Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Viravan said that under the new law,

<P>
He added the privileges for foreign companies to set up
representative offices in Thailand will take effect next month.
</P>
<P>
The official expressed the government's determination to make
Thailand an even freer market allowing competition.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said the government's move to amend Thailand's
conservative alien business law is aimed at easing the critical

industrial sector, especially the shortage of engineers and
scientists.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Ruling Partner Fails to Reach Decision on  No-confidence Motion Against Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 21 (Xinhua) -- A whole day meeting of leaders
of the National Democratic Party (RPP), Nepal's second ruling
party, Wednesday did not finalize the party's stance on a
no-confidence motion against the government.
</P>
<P>
The 12-hour marathon meeting of RPP central committee ended at
midnight without any decision on the no-confidence motion as party
leaders were divided into two camps with opposing opinions over
the issue.
</P>
<P>
One group of leaders loyal to parliamentary party leader
Lokendra Bahadur Chand boycotted the meeting from the evening to
show their disagreement with those led by party president Surya
Bahadur Thapa who argued that RPP should oppose the no-confidence
motion and remain in the three-party ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's meeting resulted in the absence of the RPP leaders
from a special parliament session where the main opposition
Communist Party of Nepal (UML) tabled the no-confidence motion
against the coalition government led by the Nepali Congress (NC)
party.
</P>
<P>
The house was scheduled to hold a vote on the no-confidence
motion Sunday.
</P>
<P>
UML has requested RPP to support the motion and proposed to
form a RPP-UML coalition government with RPP leader Chand as prime
minister to replace the present NC-led one under Sher Bahadur
Deuba.
</P>
<P>
But the Thapa faction in RPP leadership maintained that RPP
should not align with UML because UML wanted a mid-term election
in the near future which would reduce RPP's presence in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Without a single majority party in the parliament, political
situation in Nepal has been volatile in recent two years with the
rival NC and UML parties having almost the same strength in the
lower house with 86 and 88 MPs respectively.
</P>
<P>
With its 19 seats in the 205-seat house, RPP holds the key to
the survival of the present government. The third ruling party,
the Nepal Goodwill Party, has 3 MPs.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 24 of all the 41 RPP central members had
agreed to support the government. They directed at the Wednesday
meeting all the party's MPs to vote against the no-confidence
motion.
</P>
<P>
Among those RPP leaders in favor of the opposition-tabled
motion and a new RPP-UML coalition were five ministers of the
present government including Agriculture Minister Padma Sundar
Lawati and Local Development Minister Kamal Thapa, local reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Lawati said Wednesday that the ministers favoring the motion
would resign from the cabinet after they hold discussion on the
issue today.

<HEADLINE> China Floats First Commercial Papers Denominated in Foreign Exchanges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- China has floated its first
commercial papers denominated in foreign exchanges. The floatation
took place in Shenzhen, a special economic zone in south China's
Guangdong Province, says today's Shanghai Securities News.
</P>
<P>
The South China Securities Company underwrote ten million US
dollars worth of commercial papers for the Zhongjin Industrial
Company, says the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The public floating of the commercial papers denominated in
foreign exchanges has attracted many investors, and experts point
out that this adds trading products to China's financial market.
</P>
<P>
Of the nine-month Zhongjin commercial papers, those denominated
in US dollars carry an annual interest rate of 6.125 percent, and
those denominated in Hong Kong dollars have an annual interest
rate of 7.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Returns from these papers are about 40 percent higher than from
deposits in foreign exchanges, and trading in the papers will
start in designated financial institutions after the issue is
completed.
</P>
<P>
The papers can also be discounted at banks or treated as
marketable equities for mortgage loans.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper discloses that three or four more enterprises are
expected to issue commercial papers denominated in foreign
exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Homework and TV hit Chinese Students' Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- School homework and watching too
much TV has been blamed for creating a growing number of
overweight children with impaired vision in China.
</P>
<P>
A survey launched by the China Education Commission has
revealed that the physical health of Chinese students has
improved. But many serious problems still exist, says the report.
</P>
<P>
The survey, involving 310,000 students in 1,800 schools
nationwide, showed that the number of overweight children and
nearsighted students has increased rapidly. There are more young
people with relatively low endurance and small vital capacity.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which covered 21 provinces across the country, is
the last large-scale to be carried out in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
So much homework and watching too much TV caused the increasing
number of nearsighted persons, and lack of outdoor sports activity
is another reason for the deterioration children's physique, says
the report.
</P>
<P>
Experts have now called for effective measures to be adopted to
spread general knowledge about health care, and ensure that
children and students have enough time to participate in sport.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka's Opposition Slates Army Deployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's major opposition
parties Wednesday criticized the government for deploying army in
the capital city of Dhaka and the largest port city of Chittagong,
vowing to continue their current non-cooperation campaign to oust
the government.
</P>
<P>
The largest opposition Awami (people's) League (AL) chief
Sheikh Hasina Wednesday told leaders of various professional
groups that the government has become illegal and the people will
make an all-out campaign to topple it down at any cost.
</P>
<P>
The government Wednesday called out the army in a bid to
restore order in public life and road and rail communication
between Dhaka and Chittagong when the opposition-led
non-cooperation campaign entered the 12th day.
</P>
<P>
After the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) won the
February 15 elections, the opposition launched a series of
campaigns to press for the resignation of the government,
annulment of last month's polls and fresh vote under a neutral
caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
Amir Hossain Amu, presidium member of the AL, criticized the
deployment of army by the "illegal" government as its last weapon
to protect it in the face of intensified mass movement throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
Amu said people were not involved in destructive activities.
They are engaged in an unarmed non-cooperation campaign in a
democratic and constitutional way to realize their legitimate
voting right.
</P>
<P>
The other two major opposition parties Wednesday also denounced
the deployment of army, saying their non-cooperation campaign
cannot be stopped by any "conspiracy or crooked means."
</P>
<P>
Jatiya (national) Party's acting chairman Rahman Chowdhury
said: "this is a national army, and cannot be used against public
opinion."
</P>
<P>
Jamaat-e-Islami Secretary General Matiur Rahman Nizami
indicated that the deployment of army signified the futility of
the present government.
</P>
<P>
This step made it clear that the BNP government had no grip
over the situation, he added.

DHAKA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- A boy was killed and 20 others,
including four firefighters, were injured when a devastating fire
Wednesday gutted some 500 shanties and small plastic factories at
Islambagh in Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the fire started from a thatched house and
immediately spread and engulfed the whole half-a-kilometer slum
area. Several adjoining buildings were also damaged by the flame.
</P>
<P>
The men living in the slum dwellers are mostly rickshaw-pullers
while the women are workers in garment factories.
</P>
<P>
A fire service spokesman said they spent about 5 hours to bring
the flame under control as they had to face a lot of difficulties
to reach the spot through alleys.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the fire rendered more than 10,000 people
homeless and the extent of damage could not be ascertained
immediately.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives on Wednesday voted 257-163 to let states deny free
public education to children of undocumented aliens.
</P>
<P>
Opponents, however, criticized the move as going too far in the
fight against illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
A 1982 Supreme Court ruling says that all children, regardless
of their legal status, are entitled to free public education under
equal protection guarantees in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
After an appeal by House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the House also
voted to impose new English proficiency requirements on
skill-based immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Gingrich also argued for the amendment to let states
turn away illegal immigrants from the schoolhouse door, drawing
furious criticism.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said that providing free education to illegal aliens
was costing California a minimum of 1.7 billion U.S. dollars a
year, New York 634 million dollars, Florida 424 million dollars
and Texas 419 million dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The joint Russian-Ukrainian
commission for cooperation convened here today to prepare for a
long-delayed visit by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to Kiev.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who co-chairs the
commission with his Ukrainian counterpart Yevgeny Marchuk, told
reporters after the meeting that the two sides had found a
solution to Ukraine's debt to Russia.
</P>
<P>
They had also discussed more than 14 other issues including
bilateral trade and economic cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The commission will prepare at least seven documents, including
a comprehensive treaty of friendship and cooperation and an
agreement on the division of the Black Sea Fleet, to be signed
during Yeltsin's upcoming visit, he added.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's visit, initially planned for last summer but
postponed due to the dispute over the division of the Black Sea
Fleet, is now scheduled for early April.
</P>
<P>
Marchuk said that the commission will meet at least twice a
year and its next session in Kiev will discuss 20 issues, which
will be prepared by eight working groups.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russia's Black Sea Fleet Commander
Vice-Admiral Viktor Kravchenko met Ukrainian Navy Commander
Vice-Admiral Vladimir Bezkorovainy in Ukraine to discuss in detail
the splitting-up of the fleet.
</P>
<P>
The Black Sea Fleet has been the stumbling block in relations
between the two former Soviet republics. Though Yeltsin and then
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk signed an agreement in
principle on its division, the problem has not been fully
resolved.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Won't Be Nuclear-Free This Year, Says Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior Ukrainian official today
ruled out the possibility of his country becoming a non-nuclear
state this year, contradicting comments by U.S. officials over the
deadline for Ukraine's nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Gorbulin, secretary of the National Security Council,
said that it was impossible for Ukraine to be a nuclear
weapons-free state by 1996, despite recent statements by two
U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to speeches made by U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher and Defense Secretary William Perry.
</P>
<P>
Before meeting Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma, the
U.S. Secretary of State told reporters on Tuesday that Ukraine
should be a nuclear weapons-free state this year. Perry said
earlier this year that he hoped Ukraine would be rid of nuclear
arms before June or July 1996.
</P>
<P>
With the Soviet Union's disintegration in 1991, Ukraine
inherited a large number of nuclear weapons including 1,300
intercontinental ballistic missile warheads, 600 air-to-ground
cruise missile warheads and 176 missile launchers.
</P>
<P>
According to a 1994 joint statement signed by the presidents of
Ukraine, Russia and the United states, Ukraine has committed
itself to the complete destruction of nuclear weapons within its
territory, the independent Ukraine Press Agency said today.

<HEADLINE> North China Experiences Light Rainfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Since last night, north China
which suffered from serious drought, has experienced a light
rainfall in its northern part.
</P>
<P>
Precipitation in Beijing, northern Shanxi and Hebei, central
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and southwestern Shandong and
eastern Henan, was one to five mm, according to the Chinese
Central Meteorological Station (CCMS).
</P>
<P>
Precipitation in other areas of north China was no more than
0.5 mm.
</P>
<P>
Guo Jinxiu, director of the CCMS, said that the rainfall is
utterly inadequate for the serious drought in north China.
</P>
<P>
Guo told Xinhua that in the coming two days, the drought areas
in north China will enjoy another rainfall with precipitation of
no more than two mm. He added that a heavy rainfall is unlikely to
occur in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Since last winter, precipitation in the northern part of China
has been 50 to 90 percent less than in previous years. In some
areas not a single drop of rain was seen. Worse than that, the
temperature in north China in winter was quite high, thus
aggravating the drought.
</P>
<P>
At present, the drought situation is getting more and more
severe, and has seriously affected spring plowing.
</P>
<P>
Information from the Beijing Metrological Station (BMS) shows
that precipitation in most part of Beijing Municipality was three
to six mm last night, while that in the northwestern part reaching
ten mm.
</P>
<P>
An Expert from the BMS noted that though the rain will not
solve the drought problem in the municipality fully, but it
actually will be a little help for the anti-drought drive.
</P>
<P>
According to her, Beijing has in history enjoyed scanty
rainfall in spring. The serious drought this year resulted in
large part from the dry winter.
</P>
<P>
She added that there will be a rainfall in the coming two days.
</P>
<P>
Drought-stricken areas in the northern part of the country are
now taking effective measures to fight against the drought and to
ensure successful spring plowing.
</P>
<P>
At present, 21,000 water-control facilities are in operation,
and water from 980,000 wells is being pumped in drought-stricken
areas, while 48,600 hectares of farmland has been irrigated.
</P>
<P>
The anti-drought drive will be key to the summer grain
production, which accounted for 20 percent of the year's
total.

<HEADLINE> OAS to Approve Anti-Corruption Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARTAGENA, Colombia, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A meeting of foreign
ministers of the Organization of American States (OAS) will be
held in Caracas, Venezuela, March 27 to analyze and approve a
convention against corruption.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here today by OAS Secretary-general Cesar
Gaviria at the four-day meeting of trade ministers and the
business forum of the Americas which began March 18.
</P>
<P>
The OAS chief told reporters that after its approval, the
anti-corruption convention will remain open for the signing and
ratification by OAS members states.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of a legislation for the establishment of a
new ethics order against corruption on the continent emerged from
the summit of the Americas held in Miami, the United States, in
December 1994.
</P>
<P>
The preamble for the draft convention says that "it is
necessary to adopt as soon as possible an international instrument
that will promote and facilitate international cooperation to
combat corruption."
</P>
<P>
The preamble also proposes adequate measures against those who
commit acts of corruption in the exercising of public duties or
those linked with that exercise.
</P>
<P>
The OAS secretary-general said that the convention consists,
apart from the preamble, of 19 articles and provisions on
jurisdiction, internal legislation, extradition and secret bank
accounts.
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, scandals of corruption in government
administration have broken out in several American countries, most
of them originating from the boom in drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Gaviria will talk about this today before the trade ministers
and businessmen who are here to determine the bases for the
establishment of a free trade area in America by the year 2005.

<HEADLINE> Japanese FM Leaves Moscow After "Very Good" Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Japanese foreign minister Yukihiko
Ikeda left here last night after what he described as "very good"
talks with Russian leaders.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference before leaving, Ikeda said that
he hoped his talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov and First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg
Soskovets will benefit both countries.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda handed Yeltsin a message from Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto offering assistance in preparing and ensuring
the success of the nuclear security summit of the G-7 countries
and Russia to be held in Moscow in April.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin asked for Japan's support on Russia's accession to the
G-7, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also told Ikeda that cooperation between the two
countries should not be confined within the Tokyo Declaration
which should serve as the basis for further development of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He cited as a good example the establishment of a
Russian-Japanese joint commission for trade, economic and
technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with Primakov, Ikeda urged Russia to continue
security dialogues and proposed a meeting between the defense
chiefs of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister said that Russia is taking steps
to demilitarize the disputed Kurile islands which include Iturup,
Kunashir, Khabomai and Shikotan.
</P>
<P>
Russia has withdrawn all its troops from Shikotan and cut by
half its troops of 7,000 in southern Kuriles, he said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said that the Tokyo Declaration signed in 1993
reflects both countries' intention to continue talks on a peace
treaty and resolve the territorial dispute over the four
islands on the basis of international laws.
</P>
<P>
The first deputy prime minister told the press that the first
meeting of the Russian-Japanese joint commission had agreed in
principle on the use of the 500-million-U.S.-dollar loan extended
to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Part of the loan will be used in development projects in the
Russian Far East, he added.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister also disclosed that Russia wants to
get from Japan another two billion dollars in investment loans.

<HEADLINE> France to Combat School Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The French Cabinet today approved a
series of measures to stem school violence, tighten security
control and seek to restrict violence on television after a spate
of attacks on teachers and students.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, an extra 2,200 supervisors will join the 2,500
already working in schools.
</P>
<P>
The French government will also sign an accord with insurance
companies to compensate victims of school violence.
</P>
<P>
To tighten security control at schools, the new rules would
make it an offense for unauthorized individuals to enter schools,
punishable by fines and up to 120 hours of social work.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, schools will strengthen their contacts with parents
of students to jointly avoid school violence.
</P>
<P>
The government would also ask the French Broadcasting Board, a
state watchdog, to review how "to limit or better signal"
violence in films and on television, Education Minister Francois
Bayrou said.
</P>
<P>
Bayrou said the plan would be a long-term drive because "the
roots of this violence are not at the schools but in the problems
of society."
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that nearly half of 11,000 French schools are
suffering different levels of violence, including disturbing
classroom order, beating teachers, extorting money and selling
drugs in schools.
</P>
<P>
A recent series of attacks in about 20 secondary schools and
two primary schools have triggered strong anger and fear among
teachers, students and parents.
</P>
<P>
In one widely-reported case this year, two boys aged 14 and 15
allegedly stabbed to death a 15-year-old schoolmate just outside
their suburban Paris school in a row over a pair of borrowed
gloves.
</P>
<P>
A French magazine conducted a survey on school violence, the
result of which attributed the school problem to parents' loose
care of their children, television violence and serious
unemployment among young men.

foreigners as Sri Lanka has become an international port for drug
trafficking in the past decade.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- China has axed its annual logging
quota in a move to help protect the country's forest resources,
according to the "China Forestry" journal.
</P>
<P>
It will mean the limit each year between now and the year 2000
being set at just under 266 million cubic meters. This is a
reduction of eight percent or a cut of virtually 22.9 million
cubic meters a year, compared to the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
The cut is designed to protect the country's forest resources
and environment, officials have said..
</P>
<P>
Reports say that as the country's total timber resources drop,
the demand for timber will be more than the available supplies
during 1996-2000, unless more timber is imported.
</P>
<P>
China imported a total of 1.95 million cubic meters in
1995.

PRAGUE, March 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher today reassured central and east European countries of
NATO's determination and obligation to admit new members, saying
they will not be kept waiting forever.
</P>
<P>
NATO expansion process is in the second stage, during which
frequent consultations will be made between the western military
alliance and its applicants, Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
He is delivering a speech here to the foreign ministers of the
12 central and east European countries applying for NATO
membership. These countries include the Czech Republic, Slovakia,
Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Slovenia, Albania,
Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said it is not the time to take concrete steps to
enlarge the alliance, adding that the top priority for the West is
to speed up integration in Europe and to avoid isolating the East.
</P>
<P>
He said integration process in central and eastern Europe will
not be determined by Russia but stressed Russia should have a
place in Europe and should not be isolated.
</P>
<P>
He criticized Russia's State Duma, the lower house of
parliament, for abolishing an accord on the disintegration of the
Soviet Union, adding that the United States will continue to
support the independence of former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
U.S. presence in Europe and its cooperation and
confidence-building measures with Russia are the biggest guarantee
for the security of central and eastern Europe, Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
Christopher, who will visit Moscow Thursday, also discussed
with the foreign ministers NATO expansion and Russia's objection
to the process at a luncheon today. Russia has been strongly
opposed to NATO enlargement on the grounds that it will endanger
its security.
</P>
<P>
Slovenian Foreign Minister Zoran Thaller praised the meeting,
saying Christopher will go to Moscow with the latest views of the
12 countries in this respect.

<HEADLINE> Sweet Scent of Success for China Flower Growers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Flower power has given the sweet
scent of success to one of China's export industries.
</P>
<P>
The country has earned 80 million US dollars in the past year
by exporting flowers to countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
And with the industry set to blossom over the coming years,
those colorful bunches and posies of flowers will earn even more
foreign currency for China.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s the country has made big strides in flower
plantation, with flower-growing areas rising from 8,000 hectares
in 1982 to a current 75,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
China produced 800 million posies of fresh flowers in 1995,
compared with 100 million in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The sector generated four billion yuan in output value last
year, rising from 300 million yuan in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to China's vast area, and various climates, most special
flowers can grow, including peony, plum blossom, winter sweet,
sweet-scented osmanthus, Chinese rose, chrysanthemum.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Forestry has organized an association of
florists to boost the industry, and set up 53 flower-planting and
potted landscape bases, and gene banks for rare flowers and plants
in Beijing, Shanghai, as well as in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong,
Henan, Yunnan, and Guangdong provinces.
</P>
<P>
In addition to construction of the flower-growing bases, the
ministry also put more effort into scientific research.
</P>
<P>
In the coming five years, China intends to build six flower
development zones to provide fresh flowers, dried flowers, potted
landscapes, and flower show centers. Areas will also be designated
for growing wide flowers and seedlings.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Lends Support to Three Gorges Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 21 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
has pumped 62.22 million yuan (about 7.5 million US dollars) into
undertakings to aid the construction of the Three Gorges Project,
the world-largest water-control scheme.
</P>
<P>
Over 30 well-known enterprises in the province have played an
important role in helping 20 firms in the project's reservoir area
to move, merge, or upgrade technology.
</P>
<P>
The Wuahaha Group, the largest bakery and confectionery
business in Zhejiang, set up a subsidiary company in Fuling in the
reservoir area.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the company became one of the three largest firms in
Fuling to be handed over to the country.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang's Jinyi Group, Fangyuan Company have cooperated with
the Fuling city government in establishing a group company which
has merged nine money-losing firms.
</P>
<P>
The group company will help resettle 2,500 people from the
reservoir area.
</P>
<P>
The province has also offered professional and technical
training for 102 officials from Fuling and Wanxian cities, sending
them to offices in 26 developed townships in its coastal area.
</P>
<P>
Ningbo, Huzhou and some other cities in the province have set
up foundations to aid the reservoir area's economic development.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the province has also donated money and materials
worth over 1.3 million yuan to the reservoir area for the setting
up of five primary schools.
</P>
<P>
By the time the reservoir is full of water in the next century,
21 counties, and over one million people will have to be
resettled.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARTAGENA, Colombia, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of
American States (OAS) Secretary-General Cesar Gaviria Trujillo
said here today that there was no obstacle to the trade
integration of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
The most urgent and immediate task of achieving this free trade
zone was to preserve the political will of the peoples of Americas
and of its governments, he said.
</P>
<P>
It will also be necessary to maintain dynamic trade flows as
one of the most important engines of economic growth, he added.
</P>
<P>
Gaviria also pointed out that all the commitments of the 1994
Miami summit, at which the establishment of a Free Trade Area of
the Americas (FTAA) was agreed upon, must be fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
"The objective to build the FTAA is not just a trade goal; it
is, above all else, the expression of a convergence of the
fundamental economic, political and social values that orient the
Americas." he noted.
</P>
<P>
He deemed continental integration as a feasible collective
proposal because nearly all the nations of the hemisphere have
maintained a commitment with democracy and protectionist policies
no longer worked there.
</P>
<P>
The most important reason is that the liberation of trade has
produced positive, concrete and exceptionally good results, he
concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Traffic accidents in Belgium
took the highest death toll among the European Union (EU)
countries in 1994, a EU survey said today.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that Belgium had the highest traffic death rate
of 151 among every one million people, followed by France and
Spain whose death rates were 147 and 142 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The United Kingdom enjoyed the lowest rate of 66 among every

Though traffic volume in EU nearly doubled from 1980 to 1994,
the annual death toll from traffic accidents dropped from 54,000
to 44,000, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
However, Neil Kinnock, EU commissioner in charge of traffic
affairs, urged for more efforts to reduce traffic death rate by 20
percent by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai, China's Treasury Bonds Trading Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 21 (Xinhua) -- China has issued more than half
of the treasury bonds through the Shanghai Securities Exchange
(SSE) by March 18 this year, latest statistics show.
</P>
<P>
This has consolidated Shanghai as the financial center in
China and has boosted government's and underwriters' confidence
in Shanghai, the largest treasury bond market.
</P>
<P>
Since China floated the first five billion yuan in paperless
treasury bonds with SSE's trading system in January 1994, more
than 72 billion yuan in treasury bonds have been issued in SSE.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance has successfully carried out three
public biddings in issuing treasury bonds through the trading
system, which has also helped the redemption of registered bonds
for several times.
</P>
<P>
The convenient electronic trading system, a national trading
network consisting of nearly 2,000 trading spots, an efficient
registration and clearance system, and large number of financial
institutions, enterprises and individuals as participants have
enabled SSE to operate as China's bond trading center, experts
point out.
</P>
<P>
Floating treasury bonds through SSE not only reduces the
floating-period and moves up the payment dates but minimizes
floating costs, say the experts.
</P>
<P>
They cited that within 20 days, SSE issued about 25 billion
yuan in bearer bonds and more than 100 billion yuan in registered
bonds in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"It's two thirds shorter than the days the traditional issuing
method takes," says one of them.

<P>
CARTAGENA, Colombia, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Increasing trade
liberalization among members of the Organization of American
States (OAS) is making a free trade area on the continent
feasible, OAS secretary-general Cesar Gaviria Trujillo said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Gaviria was addressing businessmen and trade ministers from 34
American countries assembled in this city to determine how to
establish the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) by the year
2005.

Trade between Latin America and the Caribbean increased 20
percent in 1995, he said.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the United States and Latin America and the

growth of 12 percent over 1994 and 72 percent compared with 1990,
he added.

The FTAA would have 750 million consumers and a gross
hemispherical product of 9 billion dollars if it came into effect

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Defense Minister
Gheorghe Tinca said today that Romania will continue applying for
the NATO membership in spite of obstructions.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Tinca said Romania will not change its
political decision, because joining the NATO is in accord with
Romania's interests militarily.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Russia's opposition to NATO's expansion eastwards,
Tinca held that the Eastern European countries will not be hostile
to Russia after gaining NATO membership. For instance, he said,
Germany and France, all NATO members, still have very good
relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Tinca disclosed that Romania now has 1,375 tanks, 1,475 guns,
2,100 armored cars, 430 aircrafts and 120 attack helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said Romania's defense industry, established in
1966, started exports in the 1970s mainly to the Middle
East. But since December 1989, the industry has lagged behind the
needs of the military and foreign market, and now needs an overall
renovation, he added.

<P>
NANJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Sky-watchers in China have been
given a ringside seat to view a comet as it hurtles towards the
earth at a speed of 2,400 kilometers an hour.
</P>
<P>
The Hyakutake Comet, which is moving towards its perigee, can
currently be seen in the night sky everywhere in China, according
to the Purple Mountain Observatory.
</P>
<P>
The comet can also be observed in some Asia-European areas in
the northern hemisphere until middle April, with March 23 the best
day for observation.
</P>
<P>
Hyakutake Comet is named after a Japanese amateur astronomer,
who discovered it on January 30 this year, said Wang Sichao, an
assistant researcher at the observatory.
</P>
<P>
He said that the comet was first spotted in the country on
March 19 by one of the observatory's stations in west China's
Qingdao Province. The comet is six times brighter than Haley's
comet, which returned in 1986.
</P>
<P>
To date, the comet is returning to the earth at a speed of over
40 kilometers per second and will reach its perigee, which is
about 15 million kilometers from the earth on March 23, Wang

<HEADLINE> Hungary Absorbs Most Foreign Money in Central Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Hungary leads central European
countries in absorbing foreign investment as it had secured 12.8
billion U.S. dollars from overseas until the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The figure accounted for 43 percent of the foreign investment
influx of 30 billion dollars which also went to Poland (6.8
billion), the Czech Republic (6 billion), Romania (1.6 billion),
Slovenia (1.5 billion), Slovakia (700 million) and Bulgaria (600
million), according to the Hungarian Privatization Institute.
</P>
<P>
The institute attributed the large foreign investment to the
country's privatization program which was the earliest among
central European countries and to the country's favorable
conditions for overseas investors to develop new industrial
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Half of the foreign investment was used in the sector of
industry and more than 30 percent in telecommunications, energy
industry and trade.
</P>
<P>
Hungary got more than half of its investment money from Germany
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
As more foreign money flew into the country, the ownership of
quite a few big companies are changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors have got the control of 110 of the 200 large
Hungarian companies and 9 of the 15 large commercial banks as well
as 14 of the 15 large insurance companies in the country.

<HEADLINE> France Must Not Stand Aloof From EU, NATO Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- France must play a more important
defense role in Europe and consider increasing its role in NATO if
it is to remain a leading military power, French Prime Minister
Alain Juppe said here today.
</P>
<P>
Opening a debate in the National Assembly on defense reform,
Juppe said France's links to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) would be a key factor.
</P>
<P>
"At a time when we are learning the lessons of the end of the
Cold War, and when the principle of enlarging the EU and NATO has
been agreed, why would France remain apart from reforms in the
political and military bodies of the alliance," said the premier.
</P>
<P>
Juppe said that France's future role in NATO "will depend on
the degree of responsibility which the Europeans will have, in the
spirit of a new trans-Atlantic partnership."
</P>
<P>
France, one of NATO's 16 members, was pulled out of the
organization's integrated military command structure by President
Charles de Gaulle in 1966, and since then has insisted on its
defense autonomy.
</P>
<P>
But the country has recently taken steps to promote its
coordination with NATO, notably sending a representative to
military command meetings.
</P>
<P>
Juppe told deputies that European defense should be developed
and promoted within NATO, with the aim of improving European
political and military capabilities and increasing Europe's role
in NATO.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the prime minister suggested that the role of
the Western European Union should be further developed as part of
the EU's defense.
</P>
<P>
On changes to France's system of military conscription, Juppe
said France will hold nation-wide consultations which are
scheduled to be completed by the end of May.

MOSCOW, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Defense Minister Pavel Grachev
said Wednesday that differences still exist between Russia and

</P>
<P>
"So far we have had different approaches to NATO's expansion,"
he said after meeting visiting NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana.
</P>
<P>
Grachev and Solana also discussed European security,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Russia's military and scientific
cooperation with NATO.

After their meeting, the defence minister told reporters that
Solana was to announce a program for closer cooperation with
Russia including allowing the country to base representatives at
NATO military headquarters in Mons, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Solana, who arrived Tuesday for the first visit in four years by
a NATO chief, said that it was the first time he and Grachev had

cooperation with Russia.

<P>
Solana said that his visit showed that the West attaches
importance to relations between Russia and NATO.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Requires Foreign Banks to Register in Pudong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's financial hub,
has introduced a new requirement for foreign-funded banks to
register their new subsidiaries in the Pudong New Area.
</P>
<P>
Branches, or headquarters of foreign-funded banks, should be
transferred to Pudong, said officials with the Shanghai Branch of
the People's Bank of China, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at further opening the new area in financial
fields, said officials attending a conference on foreign-funded
financial institutions in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, Shanghai had 38 foreign-funded banks,
financial firms and insurance companies, and 119 representative
offices of foreign financial institutions. It means that around a
quarter of financial and insurance institutions in China have
bases in the area.
</P>
<P>
In what is seen as an impressive move, Citibank has relocated
its headquarters for China-related operations to Shanghai. Hong
Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the Standard Chartered
Bank, the Mitsubishi Bank of Tokyo, ABN AMRO Bank of the
Netherlands, Bank of East Asia, Credit Lyonnais, and Banque
Indosuez, all leading banks in the world, have founded their China
subsidiaries in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Assets of foreign-funded financial institutions surged by 93
percent to 9.032 billion US dollars at the end of 1995, and their
loans, deposits, both in foreign exchanges, and profits jumped by
90 percent, 74 percent, and 55 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China has unveiled a set of temporary
regulations on establishing subsidiaries of foreign-funded banks
in China.
</P>
<P>
The regulations stipulate that in Shanghai, Dalian, a port city
in northeast China's Liaoning Province, Tianjin, an industrial
center in north China, and Guangzhou, capital of south China's
Guangdong Province, qualified foreign-funded banks are allowed to
set up branches and foreign bank branches to set up sub-branches.

BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- China will consume 180 million
tons of oil during the remaining five years of the century. But
the country will still face a shortfall of 28 million tons,
according to today's Wen Hui Daily.
</P>
<P>
The China National Petroleum Corp.(CNPC) says that China's oil
resources on mainland top 69.4 billion tons.
</P>
<P>
However, only 20 percent of the country's oil resources have
been verified, leaving a huge potential to be tapped in terms of
oil exploration.
</P>
<P>
China is working all out to seek foreign funds and technology
to speed up oil exploration.
</P>
<P>
According to CNPC, China aims to attract two billion US dollars
in the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China is trying hard to enter the international
oil and gas exploration markets, and engage in international oil
management, with focus on the Middle-East area, Russia, Central
Asian areas and other areas.
</P>
<P>
The CNPC source added that by the year 2000, China will develop
an overseas oil production capacity of five to 10 million tons.

<P>
ROME, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Susanna
Agnelli said today that the forthcoming European Union's (EU)
inter-governmental conference should send a clear message that the
realization of Europe's integration is Europeans' "real wish."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of
Deputies, the minister said the summit, scheduled for March 29 in
Turin, Italy, will focus on examining EU's current political
mechanism, approving the organization's future security and
diplomatic policies as well as job creation and environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
The EU's enlargement and the challenges it faces are also on
the agenda of the summit, she said.
</P>
<P>
Agnelli pointed out that though the EU member states have
agreed on some major issues, they still differ on how to build a
future Europe.
</P>
<P>
Local reports interpreted her remarks as pointing to the
"Euroscepticism" in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Describing the EU as a "fragile entity" in respect of politics,
she suggested the organization have a secretary general in place,
who will be responsible for common security and diplomatic
policies and coordinate the work of the EU Commission and the
rotating presidency of the 15-member organization.
</P>
<P>
She added that the two-day summit in Turin, which is expected
to revise the Maastricht Treaty, marks the beginning of a series
of consultative talks of the EU in light of a deep renovation.

<HEADLINE> Germany's Global Market Share Fell in 1995, Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Germany's share of the world market was 11.4 percent in 1988,
rising to 12 percent in 1989 and 12.3 percent in 1990, but since
then it has begun shrinking.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the fall in Germany's market share to two
main factors.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the salary of German workers has risen 18 percent
since 1989, four to five times higher than that of Japanese and
U.S. workers, their two key rivals. Secondly, the German mark has
appreciated sharply against the currencies of the other
industrialized countries.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Takes Measures to Reactivate Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Argentine Economy Minister
Domingo Cavallo announced today a package of measures, including
lowering interest rates and the value added tax, to reactivate the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The measures, part of the government's economic policy for the
next two years, also include sustaining the exchange rate, said
Cavallo at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine economy registered a negative growth of 3 percent
in 1995, but the authorities are confident they can reverse
it. The government expects the growth rate to be 5 percent and
inflation 2 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that mortgage interest rates will be reduced
by 2.5 percent and the value added tax applied to bank interest
will drop from 21 percent to 10.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The value added tax on real estate sales will also be lowered
from 21 percent to 10.5 percent, especially on family housing, in
order to reactivate the construction sector, one of the pillars of
the nation's economy, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to an economic policy memorandum signed by Cavallo,
the peso-dollar exchange rate will be maintained to strengthen the
banking system.
</P>
<P>
The document said that the government will try to achieve an
economic reactivation through these measures with the
intensification of reforms.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Coffee production in
Brazil reported an unprecedented drop of 60 percent in 1995 from a
year earlier, the Association of Brazilian Coffee Growers said.
</P>
<P>
The dip in the 1995 harvest was mainly attributed to the cold
and dry weather which affected the main coffee-growing region in
Brazil. Brazil's main coffee-growing region is concentrated in
the states of Parana, Sao Paulo and South Minas Gerais.
</P>
<P>
The president of the association, Jorge Esteve, said that the
poor coffee harvest last year has led to a drop in exports during
the first two months in 1996.
</P>
<P>
During the first two months of this year, Brazil exported
1,115,391 sacks of coffee, 31 percent less than the same period in
1995, Esteve added. A sack of coffee weighs 60 kilograms.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Benefits from Hi-tech Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 21 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province is
striving to form a 60-billion yuan high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from governmental departments reveal that the
province's high-tech industries are already big earners for the
province. Last year the sector generated output value totalling 30
billion yuan (3.6 billion US dollars), and sales income of 49.6
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Experts are optimistic about their blueprint for the hi-tech
industries, which will help to internationalize local industries,
and enable the province to become a leading venue for
technological and economic cooperation on both sides of the Taiwan
Straits.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of technology-intensive enterprises have moved to the
state-run Fuzhou Hi-tech Industrial Development Zone, located in
the provincial capital, including a Taiwan-funded single-color
kinescope producing factory, gathering an investment of three
billion yuan,and with an annual output expected to reach seven
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said there is also a state-run hi-tech
industrial development zone in Xiamen, one of the five special
economic zones in China, and five province-run zones in Quanzhou,
Putian and Zhangzhou, along the economically-active southeast
coast of the province.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises in these zones are engaged mostly in computers,
photoelectron technology and new materials.
</P>
<P>
Fujian Hitachi Television Company and Xiamen Overseas Chinese
Electronic Company, and other hi-tech companies, are listed in the
Chinese top 100 hi-tech enterprises, aiming to continue producing
new hi-tech products which are the most advanced in China, or even
in the world.
</P>
<P>
Economists say that because this province is the ancestral home
to many overseas Chinese, its favorable ability to receive
information and financial aids from Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao,
will push forward the province's hi-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the provincial government made great
efforts to fuel hi-tech industries. Officials from the provincial
technological departments said that they had poured 23 million
yuan of special funds into hi-tech industries, and had undertaken
54 national hi-tech projects. The Provincial Science and
Technology Commission has also set up hazard fund for hi-tech
investment.
</P>
<P>
Despite the cautious optimism expressed by government
officials, considering the shortage of high-level technicians, and
scientific researchers in the province, they said the hi-tech
industrial development still faces great difficulties.

<HEADLINE> Qinghai Vows to Protect Its Lifeline River Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Work to protect a lifeline along
the Huangshui River Valley is underway in Qinghai province in
Northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The major clean-up project in the valley involves building
facilities to control pollution, conserve water, and planting
trees.
</P>
<P>
The river valley covers 16,000 sq.km., or 2.2 percent of the
province's total area, but accounts for 60 percent of the
province's total population, farmland, grain output and industrial
and agricultural output.
</P>
<P>
Excessive development, and rapid economic development in the
valley in recent years, has caused serious environmental problems,
including soil erosion, water pollution and a water shortage.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of liters of polluted water have been
poured into the river each day, untreated. Dozens of ferrosilicon,
iron, steel, aluminium and silicon carbide plants are releasing
thick smoke every day.
</P>
<P>
Experts say 76 percent of the 16,000 sq. km. valley suffers
soil erosion and water loss.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 19 million tons of soil is washed into the river,
a tributary of the Yellow River, each year, leaving farmland along
the river more and more impoverished.
</P>
<P>
The province has started work on a 500 million-yuan Heiquan
Reservoir on a tributary, the first-phase project to divert water
from the Datong River to the region.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the reservoir, which has a designed capacity of 178
million cubic meters of water, will greatly improve the efficiency
of water resources in the valley.
</P>
<P>
The Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau has introduced
advanced technologies from abroad to reduce and recycle gas
emissions, released by nearly 100 ferrosilicon plants.
</P>
<P>
Waste water treatment plants have been set up at the Xining
Steel Plant and the Qinghai Aluminium Plant. About 1,000 ha of
land has been afforested as part of the province's greening
effort.
</P>
<P>
Seven farming counties have speeded up work to harness small
river valleys, control soil erosion and reduce water
losses.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Two Australian students took the
clearest pictures of a newly discovered comet in the world.
</P>
<P>
Comet Hyakutake, which is larger and brighter than the
well-known Halley's comet, is flying through the skies over
Australia in its first visit to the solar system in the past
15,000 years.
</P>
<P>
The first clear picture of the comet was taken by Michael Brown
22, and Chris Fluke 23, who are physics students at Melbourne
University. They took the picture at Siding Spring in northern
New South Wales state last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The picture shows that the comet is 20 kilometers in diameter
and has a long tail. It is so bright that anyone can see it with
naked eyes in the northern skies of Australia in the past week.
It will pass the nearest spot to the Earth on March 25.
</P>
<P>
Traveling at a speed of 40 kilometers per second, the comet was
discovered by an amateur stargazer Yuji Hyakutake from Japan with
a pair of binoculars just six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
It will vanish over the horizon on Sunday and be visible again
from Australia in May after it goes around the Sun.
</P>
<P>
The comet is believed to be formed five billion years ago with
a mass of ice as its nucleus. It orbits the Sun every 15,000
years.
</P>
<P>
Next year an even larger and brighter comet called Hale-Bopp
will enter the solar system. It will be visible to the naked eye
for the most part of next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Strongman Peter May of Britain
has been banned for life for taking drugs, said Wally Holland,
secretary of the British Weightlifting Federation on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Holland said May had tested positive for an anabolic agent at
last November's world championships in China and had been banned
by the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF).
</P>
<P>
Last week, the IWF said world champion Alexei Petrov of Russia
had tested positive for anabolic steroids at the championships.
</P>
<P>
The IWF revealed the results of the A sample test on Petrov
and said he faced a life ban if the B sample also proved positive.
</P>
<P>
Holland said the British federation had no plans to appeal
against the ban on May, who tested positive in both his A and B
samples, and would meet on March 30 to discuss his case.
</P>
<P>
He said increasingly sophisticated testing at the Cologne
laboratory used by the IWF had trapped May.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Power Construction to Boost Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan Province
is set to put a total of 10 billion yuan (about 1.2 billion US
dollars) into power construction.
</P>
<P>
The province is attracting foreign funds for building small or
medium-sized power stations, and using Thai investment for the
Yuezhou and Luliang thermal power stations. It plans to attract
foreign investment for construction of the Matanglu Hydro-electric
Power Station.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, the province plans on providing electricity to another
40 counties, said Gu Hong, deputy director of the local power
bureau, who explained that more than one million households in the
province still have no electricity.
</P>
<P>
Dehong Autonomous Prefecture, home of the Dai and Jingpo
minorities, which boders Myanmar, is building a 630,000 kw power
station, to turn the prefecture into an "electrified" area.
</P>
<P>
After ten years of efforts by the government, electricity is
generally available to 28 counties, and most farmers in these
areas have begun to use electricity for cooking, reducing the
amount of wood burned, protecting forestry resources.
</P>
<P>
In the last five years, Yunnan's installed capacity has
increased by 574,000 kw, accounting for one-third of the
province's total.
</P>
<P>
With several rivers crossing it, Yunnan has the potential for
small or medium-sized power stations in 118 counties, with a total
capacity of 17.16 million kw. Thus far however, not more than
one-tenth of that has been developed.

BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The growth of the export-oriented
economy helped enliven the electronic instruments and meters
industry in Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang Province
last year, the "China Machinery and Electronics Daily" reported.

The city earned 130 million US dollars in foreign exchange from
the sector's exports in 1995, up 37 percent over 1994.

Of the total, 24.5 percent came from exports of the Hangzhou
Second TV factory, which leads China in exporting black and white
TV sets.
</P>
<P>
Black and white TV sets, color TV sets, control panels for TV
game machines and copper foil are local major export products. The
city had earned more than 6.2 billion US dollars in foreign
exchange by exporting these products by 1995.
</P>

<P>
WELLINGTON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister Jim
Bolger has expressed optimism about the revival of the single
aviation market accord between New Zealand and Australia.
</P>
<P>
He made the indication on Radio NZ this morning after meeting
with Australian Prime Minister John Howard in Canberra Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said negotiations on the matter will be held between the
transport ministers of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the first for Howard with a foreign leader
after becoming Prime Minister, Howard said "this government has
made a commitment to consult with stake-holders in the Australian
aviation industry before putting a single aviation market back
into negotiation."

<P>
A previous accord on a single aviation market was scraped by
the former Australian government days before going into effect,
souring the relations between the two trans-Tasman neighbors which
have a special relationship known as CER (closer economic
relations).

<HEADLINE> Plans for Election in Ulster Revealed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The British government revealed
tonight its plans for election to a peace forum in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
According to a BBC TV report, the plans involve a compromise
system for electing 110 members of the planned forum, from which
delegates will be selected to attend the all-party talks on the
future of the troubled province to be convened on June 10.
</P>
<P>
The existing 18 constituencies in Northern Ireland are each to
elect five members of the forum. And an extra 20 seats will be
allocated on a province-wide basis.
</P>
<P>
The detailed plans will be formally unveiled in the House of
Commons Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew was reported to
announce in parliament that the election date will be set May 30.
</P>
<P>
Mayhew held talks on the election plans with Irish Foreign
Minister Dick Spring in Belfast today.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Mayhew said that he had a "useful
conversation" with Spring.
</P>
<P>
But Spring refused to express his government's position on the
plans, saying, "I would rather wait until the proposals are
published."
</P>

The Democratic Unionist Party and the Social Democratic and

Then voters can choose as a bloc the party they prefer and each

<HEADLINE> Serb Official Asks for Guarantees for Sarajevo  Serbs' Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb Premier Rajko
Kasagic said today Serbs could be expected to return to Sarajevo
only if they were assured of peaceful life and full freedom by the
Muslim-Croat federation, which it has not done so far.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the local radio of Obrenovac, a town near Belgrade,
Kasagic said there should be no illusions that Serbs would return
soon.
</P>
<P>
According to figures of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, about 50,000 Serbs fled Sarajevo's five Serb
municipalities and only about 10,000 remained there, fearing life
under the jurisdiction of the Muslim-Croat federal authorities as
of March 19.
</P>
<P>
But Serb authorities said about 140,000 Serbs have moved out of
Sarajevo since the war began in April 1992. There were 155,000
Serbs in Sarajevo in accordance with the 1991 census.
</P>
<P>
Kasagic said his republic expected a greater engagement on the
reconstruction of the devastated country in the second phase of
the implementation of the Dayton peace accords.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the international community was asking two
conditions to be met before it approved funds for reconstruction
-- privatization and elections.
</P>
<P>
"Regarding the first, we shall very soon propose a series of
system-related laws. And regarding elections, there is no reason
not to meet the set deadline" from June until September this year,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim side would like to extend this deadline, but
Republika Srpska would like elections to take place even before
this deadline so that a chance could be given to fresh forces and
even fresh ideas, people who have not tired of all this, the Serb
official said.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed the ruling Serbian Democratic Party and the
Serb Socialist Party stood the best chances of winning the
forthcoming elections in Republika Srpska.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Testify by Videotape in Whitewater Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A federal judge in Arkansas
today ruled that U.S. President Bill Clinton can testify by
videotape at the trial of his former Whitewater partners, but he
can't have the questions in advance.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. denied a request from
James and Susan McDougal to compel Clinton to testify in person at
their conspiracy and fraud trial. He said ordering Clinton to
travel to Little Rock, Arkansas, "would be unduly burdensome to
the president in the performance of his official duties," the
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The judge will preside over the questioning by video
conferencing and will rule on objections as they come up. He will
also edit the videotape if lawyers cannot agree on what is
pertinent for the jury to hear.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting Clinton's request to see the questions in advance,
Howard said the only reason a president might deserve such special
treatment would be if national security were involved.
</P>
<P>
"They concern matters from prior to his presidency, so matters
of national security will not be concerned," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
McDougal, his ex-wife and Governor Jim Guy Tucker are accused of
arranging nearly 3 million dollars in fraudulent loans from
McDougal's Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan and David Hale's
Capital Management Services Inc.
</P>
<P>
Hale is the government's chief witness and claims Clinton
pressured him to loan Mrs. McDougal 300,000 dollars. Clinton has
called the accusation "a bunch of bull." The McDougals say only
Clinton can set the story straight.
</P>
<P>
"Our intention is to cooperate with the judge's order and
provide the court with the information that it needs," said Mark
Fabiani, a White House lawyer.
</P>
<P>
The videotape will be made in private, and the original will
not be released. Howard said he will unseal only the portion that
is played for the jury.
</P>
<P>
Howard directed lawyers for the prosecution, defense and
Clinton to agree on a date for the deposition.

<HEADLINE> Syria's Ruling Party Official Meets with Chinese Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Vice General Secretary of
Syria's ruling Socialist Arab Baath Party Abdulla al Ahmar met
here today with a visiting Chinese delegation on ways of
developing cooperation and friendship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The delegation of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) was led by Qian
Weichang, vice chairman of the committee.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two sides exchanged views on further
developing the bonds of cooperation and friendship between the
peoples of Syria and China through the activating cooperation
between the Socialist Arab Baath Party and the Progressive
National Front in Syria, on the one hand, and the Chinese
Communist Party and the CPPCC National Committee, on the other.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the Chinese delegation on the Middle East peace
process, Ahmar said that Syria adheres to the regional peace
process which was initiated at the Madrid conference in 1991.
</P>
<P>
He expressed Syria's genuine desire for establishing a just and
comprehensive peace on the basis of the relevant U.N. Security
Council resolutions. He indicated that Israel, not serious in its
approach to peace negotiations, has resorted to the policy of
procrastination and delay, thus failing to respond to the
pre-requisites for a just and comprehensive peace as spelled out
in the Madrid conference.
</P>
<P>
Ahmar added that Syria is opposed to terrorism, but it
distinguishes the right of people to resist occupation of their
territories from terrorism that harms innocent people. He said
that Syria and other countries had suffered from terrorism which
Israel was actually practicing.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Qian Weichang applauded the growing relations
between the Chinese and Syrian people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the tension in the Strait of Taiwan, he pointed out
that Taiwan was an inseparable part of the Chinese territories,
adding that China would never permit a foreign power to interfere
with its internal affairs and that China was capable of unifying
the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Registers 523 Aids Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Through 1995, a total of 523
aids cases were registered in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,
and 359 of them had died, Yugoslavia's Assistant Labor Minister
Milorad Velickovic said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the first conference on aids in Yugoslavia which
began today on Mt. Zlatibor in western Serbia, the assistant
minister of labor, health, and social policy said there were about
5,000 HIV-positive persons in the country.
</P>
<P>
Last year had the highest annual incidence in the past decade
-- there were as many as 91 newly registered aids cases in 1995
only, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Velickovic said that the Federal Commission for Aids Protection
had adopted a program for aids prevention and control in
Yugoslavia in 1996, for which necessary funds would have to be
earmarked from the budget.
</P>
<P>
Commission President Borisa Vukovic told the conference that
the epidemiological situation regarding this disease in
Yugoslavia, as in the world, was unfavorable in spite of
preventive measures which have been known and available for over
10 years.
</P>
<P>
Ten of the 523 aids cases were registered in Montenegro, seven
in Serbia's southern Kosovo and Metohija province, 39 in Serbia's
northern province of Vojvodina, and 467 in central Serbia.
</P>
<P>
The capital of Yugoslavia and Serbia, Belgrade, accounts for
74.6 percent of the total number of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The characteristic in Yugoslavia is that there is a high
percentage of drug addicts (52.8 percent) among the aids cases,
and 25 percent of these cases registered in 1995 were infected
through heterosexual contacts, according to the aids protection
commission.

<HEADLINE> ICRC Warns of New Humanitarian Crisis in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Sarajevo Serb
refugees are heading for various destinations in the Serb state
of Republika Srpska, creating a new humanitarian crisis, the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said today.
</P>
<P>
A report issued today by the ICRC Belgrade office said that
about 50,000 Serbs have fled Sarajevo's five Serb municipalities
which have come under the rule of the Muslim-Croat federation,
while about 10,000 remain in the city.
</P>
<P>
Columns of Serb refugees have reached the Serb towns of Brcko,
Bratunac, Srebrenica, Vlasenica, Visegrad, Zvornik, Srbinje and
Trebinje in eastern and northern Bosnia, but they do not have
adequate accommodation there, the ICRC said.
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic situation is in the eastern Bosnian town of
Bratunac, whose current population of 25,000 already includes
15,000 dispaced persons, and in Srebrenica, which has more than
12,000 dispaced persons, the report said.
</P>
<P>
While the transfer of power in the Sarajevo Serb municipalities
of Vogosca and Ilijas passed relatively calmly, the situation in
Hadzici, Ilidza and Grbavica has caused serious concern because
those parts of Sarajevo are in a state of total lawlessness, it
added.
</P>
<P>
It said that gangs and individual robbers from both Serb and
Muslim sides were plundering and burning houses and harassing the
local population.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC said that international and national authorities
should now secure that those who had left their homes with the
intention of coming back did not find their homes occupied later
on.
</P>
<P>
The organization said it had reacted at once by providing
humanitarian aid to the remaining Serbs in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC is delivering medicine, water supply parts and
chemicals for filtering water, organizing soup kitchens and meals
for school children and distributing parcels with food and other
essentials.

<HEADLINE> Commission for Bosnian Refugees Repatriation Set Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A nine-member international
commission aimed at facilitating the repatriation of 2 million
refugees and displaced persons from Bosnia-Herzegovina was set up
in Sarajevo today.
</P>
<P>
"The process of reconciliation and reintegration has barely
begun.... The commission will be a key element in that process,"
the international community's High Representative in Bosnia Carl
Bildt told reporters in Sarajevo today, according to the Tanjug
news agency.
</P>
<P>
The Dayton agreement gave the commission the final authority to
adjudicate claims of ownerships or tenancy and to help people
reoccupy, sell, lease or exchange their property.
</P>
<P>
The commission is made up of three international members from
Belgium and Switzerland, four representatives of the Muslim-Croat
federation, and two representatives of the Serb State Republika
Srpska.
</P>
<P>
Half of the Bosnian population was displaced in the
43-month-old war. More than 1 million people live as refugees
abroad and another 1 million live in housing not of their own
inside Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The commission for the repatriation of refugees from Bosnia was
set up one day after tens of thousands of Serbs moved out of Serb
districts of Sarajevo which came under Muslim-Croat federation
rule.

<HEADLINE> All Prisoners in Bosnia May Be Released By March  23: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 20 (Xinhua) -- All prisoners in Bosnia might be
set free before the Contact Group meeting in Moscow on March 23, a
Bosnian Serb official said today.
</P>
<P>
Dragan Bulajic, president of the State Commission of the Serb
State Republika Srpska for the Exchange of Prisoners of War, made
the statement after a meeting with High Representative for Bosnian
Civilian Affairs Carl Bildt in Pale, the Serb stronghold 15 km
east of Sarajevo
</P>
<P>
Bulajic said he discussed with Bildt about the release of the
remaining prisoners of war still held by the Muslim and Croat
sides although the Dayton agreement deadline for their release
expired on January 19.
</P>
<P>
Bulajic said Bildt's team promised to contact later today with
representatives of the Muslim-Croat Federation and try to reach an
accord Thursday on having all prisoners set free before March 23.
</P>
<P>
He said the Serb authorities did not accept a proposal by
Bildt's team to partially solve the pow problem.
</P>
<P>
The Serb state demanded that the Zagreb authorities also be
brought under obligation to set free Bosnian Serb soldiers who
were kept in jails of neighboring Croatia.
</P>
<P>
The release of prisoners was the topic also at a talk held
today between Bildt's deputy Michel Steiner on the one hand and
the representatives of local authorities in Doboj, the town in the
northeast of Republika Srpska, on the other.
</P>
<P>
Steiner promised that the international community would do its
utmost to get an immediate release of more than 2,000 Serb
soldiers and around 800 civilians, but he added that this process
would take time.
</P>
<P>
Steiner said that none of the three sides -- Muslim, Serb and
Croat -- had respected the provisions in the Dayton agreement and
set free all the detained soldiers by the deadline of January 19.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
today called on all the three sides in Bosnia to set free 160
prisoners immediately and unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC Belgrade office said that the three sides were holding
around 220 prisoners, only 60 of whom were suspected of war
crimes.

settlement to the Middle East problem, which will lead to an
Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Lebanese and Syrian
territories.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said that a solution to all violence in the region
is an Israeli withdrawal in compliance with U.N. resolutions and
an achievement of a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
"In spite all the words and in spite all the situations,
Lebanon is still upholding a peace settlement in the region
leading to an Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon, Western Beqaa
and the Golan," the Prime Minister told reporters at the end of a
cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on a recent interference by Cairo and
Washington to avert an Israeli military action in South Lebanon,
Hariri affirmed that the United States, Egypt and all other
parties concerned are eager to bolster the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Any military operation in the South definitely will affect
developments of the peace process," he told a press conference
following a regular session of the Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
Hariri attributed an existence of the resistance movement on
the Lebanese land to the continuous Israeli occupation, adding
that the resistant operations will stop as soon as the occupation
is eliminated.
</P>
<P>
"After the Israeli withdrawal, the resistance will become
unjustified," the Lebanese premier stressed.
</P>
<P>
He announced that the Lebanese army is ready to respond to any
provocation.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese Prime Minister launched a rare attack at some
non-Lebanese groups which operate in a dozen of Palestinian
refugee camps in Lebanon, which, as Hariri pointed out, have
nothing to do with the resistance against the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Without mentioning the names of those groups, Hariri said that
the statement issued by them and their unjustified behaviors are
harming the interests of both Lebanon and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"The resistance, as all the Lebanese people agree with, is
because of the occupation," the Prime Minister said, "but the
existence of any other non-Lebanese organization, having nothing to
do with the resistance, issuing statements or behaving in an
unjustified way, harms Lebanon's interests and harms the interests
of the Palestinians."
</P>
<P>
He confirmed a presence of offices of the Islamic Resistance
Movement, or Hamas, and other radical Palestinian groups in
Lebanon, but did not specify whether the Lebanese government would
take an action against them as demanded by Israel.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the statements issued by those Palestinian
groups through the Lebanese public media or foreign press agencies
in Lebanon are unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
"These statements as well as small movements give incorrect
pictures of Lebanon," the prime minister added.
</P>
<P>
He warned of any Israeli military operation against Lebanon,
stressing that the peace process in the Middle East would be the
first victim of any military action against his country.
</P>
<P>
"Any military operation against Lebanon is not against Lebanon,
but against the peace process in the region," the Prime Minister
said.

<HEADLINE> UN Sends Fact-Finding Mission to Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali, at the request of the Nigerian Government,
has decided to send a fact-finding mission to Nigeria to
investigate the trial and execution of human rights activist Ken
Saro-Wiwa and eight other persons.
</P>
<P>
The mission comprises Atsu Koffi Amega, former minister of
foreign affairs and former president of the Supreme Court of Togo
and a member of the African Commission for Human and People's
Rights; Justice V.S. Malimath, member of the National Human Rights
Commission of India; and John P. Pace, chief of the Legislation
and Prevention of Discrimination Branch, Center for Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
The mission is in fulfillment of the mandate entrusted to the
secretary-general in accordance with U.N. General Assembly
resolution 50/199.
</P>
<P>
In the resolution adopted on March 11, the General Assembly
"condemned the arbitrary execution, after a flawed judicial
process, of Ken Saro-Wiwa and his eight co-defendants and
emphasized that everyone charged with a penal offense has the
right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty."
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly expressed its deep concern about other
violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Nigeria,
and called upon the Nigerian government to ensure their
observance, in particular by restoring habeas corpus, releasing
all political prisoners, guaranteering freedom of the press and
ensuring full respect for the rights of all individuals, including
trade unionists and persons belonging to minorities, according to
the resolution.
</P>
<P>
The mission therefore will address itself to two issues of
concern of the international community: the trial and execution of
Ken Saro-Wiwa and others; and the plans of the Nigerian government
to implement its declared commitment to restore the country to
democratic rule.

<HEADLINE> Winnie Claims Unfairly Treated In Divorce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Winnie Mandela said today
it is unfair for a judicial order to approve the divorce request
by her ex-husband, South African President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
"Now it seemed that the only appropriate remedy for me to
enforce my constitutional rights to a fair trial will lie with
the constitutional court," she said in a statement issued in
Cape Town today.
</P>
<P>
It was Winnie's first public comment since her 38-year
marriage to the president was dissolved by Johanesburg's Rand
Supreme Court's Justice Frikkie Eloff on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During the second day of the divorce proceedings, requested by
President Mandela, the judge ruled that the plaintiff was
entitled to a divorce since the couple lived apart for more than
one year and Winnie had committed adultery.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Winnie and her lawyer did not show up
for a settlement hearing in court.
</P>
<P>
Before the court ruling, Winnie had launched a last-ditch
attempt to save her marriage by asking for a postponement,
claiming there was still a chance of reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
When the bid was lost, she sacked her counsel and asked for a
postponement to brief another counsel, which was also refused by
the court.
</P>
<P>
The court, meanwhile, ruled that Winnie had a choice to defend
accusations of adultery and provide reasons why she thought
reconciliation was possible, but that was declined.
</P>
<P>
Winnie said she was seeking legal advice on whether she could
take the matter to the Constitutional Court.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales in US Rebound in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales in the United
States rebounded 0.8 percent in February after blizzard in the
eastern area and severe weather elsewhere resulted in a 0.1
percent dip in January.
</P>

The U.S. Commerce Department reported today that sales totaled
a seasonally adjusted 201.1 billion dollars, up from 199.5 billion
in January when sales showed the first decline since last

The February increase generally had been expected and was the
largest since an identical gain last November. Sales rose 0.7
percent in December.
</P>
<P>
The department also said the January decrease was smaller than
the 0.3 percent originally estimated.
</P>
<P>
Automobile sales, about one-fourth of the total, shot up 2
percent after managing only an small 0.1 percent gain in January.
</P>
<P>
Sales of durable goods -- items such as autos and appliances
expected to last more than three years -- jumped 1.4 percent in
February after falling 0.6 percent a month earlier. It was the
best performance since a 1.9 percent gain last August.
</P>
<P>
Sales of nondurable goods such as food and fuel rose 0.4
percent, twice the 0.2 percent gain in January.
</P>
<P>
Department stores rang up a 2.3 percent sales gain and apparel
shops posted a 1.2 percent advance. Restaurants and bars and drug
stores each registered 0.3 percent increases.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Abolishes Tax on Foreign Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish coalition government
today scrapped the controversial levy on each Turkish citizen
going abroad.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Agah Oktay Guner announced after a
cabinet meeting that the ministers had agreed to remove the 100
U.S. dollars "mass housing fund" levies on each foreign travel.
</P>
<P>
The levy was launched in 1984, designed to raise funds to
support mass housing construction.
</P>
<P>
The rule has drawn increasing public reactions and many people
argued that the levy is against the constitutional right of
freedom of travel.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet decision will take effect as it is published in
the official Gazette.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports say Turkish policy-makers are planning to
compensate for the financial losses by other means. One
alternative is to raise airport taxes.

<HEADLINE> Moscow to Ask Christopher to Clarify His Prague  Statements: Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Moscow attaches great importance
to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's official visit to
Russia and is to ask him to explain his Prague statement on the
disputed eastward expansion of NATO, a senior Russian diplomat
said today.
</P>
<P>
Christopher arrived in Moscow earlier today from Prague,
capital of the Czech Republic, for a two-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to meet with Russian President Boris Yeltsin
this morning and hold talks with his Russian counterpart, Yevgeny
Primakov, later on the day.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will discuss bilateral relations and preparations
for the G-8 summit meeting on nuclear security scheduled for April
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"We have something to discuss with the Americans," the Russian
diplomat said. "the Russian side would like to get clarifications
from Christopher on his latest statements in Prague about the
prospects of a NATO enlargement."
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigory Karasin told a news
briefing today that the problem of NATO's expansion will be among
top priority subjects for discussion during Christopher's Moscow
trip.
</P>
<P>
"Russia's stand, which was repeatedly explained by President
Boris Yeltsin and by Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, remains
clear and unchanged -- we are against NATO's extension eastwards,"
he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Karasin stressed, "It is not the question of Russia's
obstinacy, it's a question of its national interests."
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with foreign ministers from 12 Central and Eastern
European countries Wednesday, Christopher stated the strategy of
NATO's eastward enlargement remains unchanged. A final decision on
who will be granted NATO membership and when is expected to be
made in December, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Clearly, such prospects evoke concerns from Moscow, which has
strongly voiced against NATO's eastward expansion plans, the
diplomat pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Christopher is due to meet members of the Russian
political elite, including the parliamentary opposition, at the
U.S. ambassador's official residence late Friday.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, he will attend a foreign ministers meeting of the
contact group for Bosnia-Herzegovina at Moscow's Presidential
Hotel.

<HEADLINE> Newroz Festival Celebrated in Turkey Peacefully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Newroz was celebrated in
Turkey by both Turkish and Kurdish citizens today for the
awakening of nature, spring, and, the most important, peace.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and his wife attended
the International Newroz Festival in Igdir Province, along with
guest folk dancers from other Turkic countries.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that a prime minister celebrated
the Newroz with local people despite the fact that Newroz is
not an official holiday in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Newroz celebrations have been banned in the past since the
separatist Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) used to take advantage
of the festival to stage anti-government demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Newroz has always been associated with violence but this
year no bloody incidents were reported except the detention of
some 50 people in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
A group of Kurds living in Istanbul staged a demonstration
without permission in the Zeytinburnu District. Local television
reported that the demonstrators held banners of PKK and portraits
of PKK leader Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Police detained some 50 demonstrators when they refused to
dismiss.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here said the softened official attitude
toward Newroz indicates the determination of the new coalition
government to approach the Kurdish problem through an alternative
way.

MAPUTO, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican parliament today
rejected a bill put forward by MPs of the opposition Mozambique
National Resistance (RENAMO) for a rise of workers' lowest
payment.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Liberation Front Party (FRELIMO)'s 123 MPs objected
the pay rise proposal, which was supported by 116 MPs of the
RENAMO and the Democratic Union, another opposition party.
</P>
<P>
The ruling FRELIMO accused the opposition parties of having
political plot instead of showing true concern for the welfare
of the workers.
</P>
<P>
They said the opposition was trying to force the government to
do what the economy could not afford.
</P>
<P>
In their counter charge, the opposition criticized the ruling
party for caring only about their political interest instead of
the welfare of the people.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Delegate on Realization of Self-determination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese delegate today told a UN
human rights forum in Geneva that power politics in international
relations is posing the biggest threat to the realization of the
right of peoples to self-determination.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the annual session of the UN Commission on Human
Rights, Chinese delegate Pang Sen said the UN Charter and a number
of international human rights instruments clearly stipulate that
the right to self-determination constitutes the right of a country
and its people to gain independence and liberation, to freely
decide their own political system, and to freely pursue their own
economic, social and cultural development.
</P>
<P>
However, certain countries are using every means to impose
their own political and social system as well as ideologies and
sense of values upon others, he said.
</P>
<P>
The right to self-determination has been misrepresented as
simply holding periodic and free elections. The UN is called on to
draft patterns and standards, set up mechanisms, and provide
assistance so as to intervene in the elections of other countries.
"The purpose is to introduce a certain kind of political pattern
as a model into the UN and then force other countries to
mindlessly imitate," Pang said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to note that the Vienna Declaration on human rights
adopted in 1993 spells out that the realization of the right to
self-determination shall not be construed as authorizing or
encouraging any action which would dismember or impair the
territorial integrity or political unity of a country.
</P>
<P>
"Since the absolute majority of the countries in the world
today are multiethnic, adhering to and safeguarding this principle
are in the interests of all countries," Pang said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that self-determination is being abused with
ulterior motives to incite, create and intensify ethnic conflict
and even to advocate dismembering of sovereign states and
undermine their territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Pang stressed that the realization of the right to
self-determination does not only mean the overthrow of colonial
rule and the achievement of political independence. "It is a
tough, continuous and long process. Self-determination is a right,
not a high-sounding slogan, still less a tool of certain countries
to pursue their domestic and foreign policies".
</P>
<P>
He said China is willing to co-exist peacefully with all
countries and is ready to join the international community in the
common effort for the realization of all human rights and
fundamental freedoms.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from Russia, India and Cuba also stressed at
Thursday's meetings that all countries should act under the
principles of the UN Charter to respect the right to
self-determination of other peoples instead of encouraging and
inciting dismembering of other countries and to intervene in other
countries' internal affairs.
