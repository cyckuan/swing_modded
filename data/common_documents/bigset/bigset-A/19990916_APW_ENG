<HEADLINE> BT, AT&AMP;T in Mobile Phone Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British Telecom PLC and AT&AMP;T, two of the world's  
biggest telephone companies, have formed an alliance to provide 
mobile telephone services around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies already provide wireless services in 17 countries  
with a combined customer base of 41 million, they said in today's 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you travel, you expect your BT or AT&AMP;T digital phone to  
work anywhere and everywhere with all of the advanced features you 
have -- just as if you were at home. This is not possible in many 
cases today for a whole host of reasons, including incompatible 
technology and government regulation,'' said John Zeglis, president 
of AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	``By pairing two of the leading telecommunications companies in  
the world ... we think we can make some things happen that will 
eventually give customers those `anytime, anywhere' capabilities 
from their mobile phones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BT shares were up 5.1 percent at midday following the  
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is undoubtedly good news for BT,'' said Steve Wreford,  
analyst at CCF Charterhouse in London. ``Further down the line we 
are looking at links on a much wider scale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is not the first time the two companies have announced they  
would cooperate. In July 1998, they agreed to form a $10 billion 
global communications venture to serve multinational businesses and 
carriers. Regulators have yet to approve that venture.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves New Breast Cancer Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Breast cancer patients whose tumors have  
spread to the lymph nodes won a new drug today that promises to 
improve their chances of survival over one common chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration today approved Ellence, known  
chemically as epirubicin, for treatment of node-positive, 
early-stage breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 180,000 American women are diagnosed with breast cancer  
each year. About 75,000 of them need ``adjuvant chemotherapy'' 
after surgery for a tumor that has spread to the nearby lymph nodes 
under the arm, said Ellence manufacturer Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, doctors choose between two types of chemotherapy. One  
is called AC, containing the drugs Adriamycin and cyclophosphamide. 
The other is called CMF, for cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 
fluorouracil. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study of 716 patients, Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn compared CMF with  
a combination of cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil and the new drug 
Ellence, a combination dubbed CEF. The women took either 
chemotherapy for six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years later, 62 percent of the women who received the new  
Ellence-containing chemotherapy had survived relapse-free, vs. 53 
percent of women who had received CMF. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a drawback: The Ellence-containing chemotherapy caused  
more side effects, said Dr. Vivien Bramwell, a medical oncologist 
at the University of West Ontario, Canada, who helped study the 
drug. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to experiencing somewhat more nausea, vomiting and  
hair loss, the Ellence-treated women had a higher rate of serious 
infections -- 8 percent vs. just 1 percent in CMF-treated women, 
Bramwell said. The infections were serious enough for 
hospitalization, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the drug poses a small risk of irreversible heart damage  
and later developing leukemia, a long-term consequence of certain 
chemotherapies. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn did not compare Ellence to the other common  
breast-cancer treatment, AC. Some studies suggest AC and CMF are 
equally effective, but AC requires three months of chemotherapy 
instead of six and may cause fewer side effects than CMF. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the FDA calls the improvement over CMF significant, and  
said Ellence offers patients an important alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	For patients and doctors, all this means is more choice in  
picking the chemotherapy best for each individual case. 
</P>
<P>
	The more lymph nodes where cancer has spread, the more Bramwell  
encourages trying Ellence. For women with fewer cancerous lymph 
nodes, she lays out all the differences and lets them choose. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many feel the short-term toxicity is worthwhile even if it's a  
small absolute benefit,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellence will be available in mid-October, and will cost about  
$12,000 for a six-month course, the company said.

<HEADLINE>  Floyd Floods And Weakens on Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd roared ashore today near  
Cape Fear with 110 mph wind, then quickly weakened after flooding 
the coasts of the Carolinas and Virginia with more than a foot of 
rain and chasing tens of thousands of people into shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 1.4 million utility customers from South Carolina to New  
Jersey lost power, and 125,000 still had no power today in Florida. 
Flooding and power failures combined to shut down Portsmouth, Va.'s 
water supply system, which serves 110,000 customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools were closed today for more than 2 million youngsters.  
</P>
<P>
	At least seven deaths were blamed on Floyd.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been in nothing like this before,'' said Norma  
Childers, 62, a retired Rustburg, Va., nurse who came to North 
Carolina on vacation and was in a Wilmington motel when it lost 
power this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m., the storm was centered near the coast just east of  
Chincoteague, Va., almost to the Maryland state line. It was 
traveling faster, moving toward the north-northeast at about 29 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	However, since Floyd struck the coast around 3 a.m., the top  
sustained wind around its center had slowed to about 75 mph, the 
National Hurricane Center said. The minimum wind speed for a storm 
to be called a hurricane is 74 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	After crossing land in eastern North Carolina and the  
southeastern corner of Virginia, Floyd's dash along the coast was 
expected to take it past Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey, then 
into New York's Long Island early Friday. Disaster preparations 
were under way in New York City, Massachusetts' Cape Cod and along 
the coast of Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane warnings were posted as far north as Plymouth, Mass.  
Public schools were closed in Washington, Baltimore, all of New 
Jersey, Philadelphia and New York City. New Jersey and New York 
City each have 1 million students. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton declared a major disaster today in North  
Carolina, and released $528 million to the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency to help hurricane victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The wind set a Ferris wheel spinning on its own at Ocean City,  
Md., and overturned an empty truck on the high Chesapeake Bay 
Bridge. Virginia closed the 18-mile-long Chesapeake Bay 
Bridge-Tunnel, and New York City shut down the exposed upper deck 
of the Verrazano Narrows Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities had urged more than 2.6 million people along the  
southern Atlantic coast to clear out of Floyd's path -- the biggest 
evacuation in U.S. history -- and more people were urged to evacuate 
today in parts of Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey and Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City sent nonessential municipal employees home early  
and urged businesses to do the same because of the possibility of 
widespread mass transit outages during the rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
	However, evacuation orders were lifted today for all of the  
South Carolina coast, and thousands of evacuees crowded Georgia 
highways as they headed home. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Wilmington area, a runaway sailboat jammed the drawbridge  
linking the city to Wrightsville Beach, closing the only link to 
the barrier island, and a church steeple was toppled in Beaufort. 
</P>
<P>
	On North Carolina's Outer Banks, already punished by Hurricane  
Dennis earlier this month, Floyd blew the roofs off two motels in 
Nags Head. 
</P>
<P>
	In Duplin County, a hog farm waste lagoon ruptured and spilled  
about 2 million gallons of waste, threatening to pollute a creek 
state environmental officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Six twisters damaged homes and churches in North Carolina, but  
no injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an exciting night,'' Calvin McGowan said today as he as  
he checked his 34-foot fishing boat, the Monitor. In 1996, 
Hurricane Fran threw the boat several hundred yards into a 
neighbor's yard. 
</P>
<P>
	The heavy rain appeared to have caused more problems than the  
wind. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got the worst flooding we've ever had in a storm,''  
North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Areas of the North Carolina coast and the Myrtle Beach area of  
South Carolina had gotten up to 16 inches of rain, and a foot fell 
on Virginia's Tidewater region. Wilmington got 13 inches before the 
rain stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the deaths were in North Carolina, and one storm-related  
death was reported in South Carolina and one in Virginia. In 
addition, one person was presumed dead in the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	While the storm delivered only a glancing blow to Florida on  
Wednesday, it destroyed about 100 feet of the century-old Daytona 
Beach pier and shear off the end of piers at Jacksonville Beach and 
Flagler Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Bahamas, Floyd had smashed hundreds of homes and knocked  
out utilities. One entire village was swept out to sea but all the 
residents had been evacuated before the hurricane struck. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the small Bahamian islands had extreme damage,  
officials said, and the U.S. Coast Guard sent ships and aircraft to 
survey the damage and deliver emergency supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of airline flights had been canceled along the East  
Coast. Amtrak suspended all train service south of Washington and 
didn't expected to restore service until Friday at the earliest.

<HEADLINE> Deal Reached in Steelworkers Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Union workers at a Charlotte, N.C. tire plant  
have reached a tentative contract agreement after nearly yearlong 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was announced Wednesday by the United Steelworkers  
of America, headquartered here, which represents roughly 1,450 
workers at the German-owned Continental General Tire factory. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers are to vote Sunday on the new contract, which would run  
until 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	The walkout began Sept. 20, 1998 after a three-year contract  
expired. Union members said company officials refused to compensate 
them for $90 million in wage and benefit concessions made in 1995 
when the tire industry was struggling. 
</P>
<P>
	General Tire officials had said the factory would struggle again  
if they gave in to worker demands, and used permanent replacement 
workers to keep it running. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the largest single-company strike in Charlotte in nearly  
80 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokesman Daryl Hollnagel said officials ``are happy  
with the settlement,'' and declined further comment. Union 
officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar deals were also reached by workers at Continental  
General plants in Mayfield, Ky. and Bryan, Ohio, the union said. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, the National Labor Relations Board ruled in that  
Continental General management were guilty of an unfair labor 
practice in refusing to give union negotiators needed bargaining 
information.

<HEADLINE> 3 Kosovo Pilots Receive Silver Stars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Flying 100 feet above the ground on a hazy,  
moonless night only 25 miles from downtown Belgrade, Capt. James L. 
Cardoso and his team of Air Force helicopters dodged power lines, 
telephone poles and missile launchers as Serb defenders scanned the 
skies with search lights. 
</P>
<P>
	Their destination: an American pilot who had been shot down in  
his F-117A stealth fighter by Serb air defenses. The Serbs had 
intercepted the downed airman's radio transmissions, so they knew 
his approximate position and were closing in with foot soldiers and 
search dogs. Time was running out. 
</P>
<P>
	Dogs were within 30 feet of the airman when Cardoso directed an  
MH-60G helicopter to swoop down and land, pick up the pilot, scoot 
out of the area and dash across the border to safety in eastern 
Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	For his role in commanding the rescue, Cardoso, 33, of Cherry  
Hill, N.J., was awarded the Silver Star on Wednesday. The 
prestigious award is the third highest battlefield honor behind the 
Medal of Honor and the Air Force Cross. 
</P>
<P>
	``He fearlessly led his formation at great personal risk to  
himself and his crews by penetrating an extremely formidable air 
defense'' operated by Serbs who knew a rescue attempt was under 
way, the award citation said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a ceremony at Andrews Air Force Base just outside Washington,  
Silver Stars also were awarded to two F-16 pilots, Capt. Sonny P. 
Blinkinsop, 35, of Tolland, Conn., and Capt. Adam B. Kavlick, 32, 
of Festus, Mo., for their role in the NATO campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The F-117A incident was one of the most sensational of the  
78-day air war. Serb TV pictures of the wreckage of the stealth 
fighter gave Belgrade a momentary propaganda victory, but it turned 
out to be the first of only two downings of NATO aircraft; no 
allied crews were lost during the air campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon never has identified the F-117A pilot, and it had  
not previously disclosed the name of anyone involved in the rescue. 
The official citation accompanying Cardoso's Silver Star award 
offered more details of the rescue mission than previously known -- 
including the fact that Serb soldiers and their search dogs were 30 
feet from the downed pilot before he was plucked from the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The successful rescue was a ``critical and essential victory''  
for NATO, according to the award citation, because it denied 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ``the political, military and 
media exploitation of parading a downed American `stealth fighter' 
pilot in front of news cameras.'' At stake were U.S. public support 
for the war effort, NATO's resolve to keep bombing, and aircrew 
morale, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other details of the 5 1/2-hour rescue mission not previously  
disclosed: Three Serb Army brigades of infantry, combat engineers 
and armored forces were 10 miles from where the downed F-117A pilot 
landed. Also, the downed pilot's infrared strobe light, used to 
mark his position for rescue, was not working, so he lit a flare 
that gave away his exact position to the Serbs. Fortunately, 
Cardoso's MH-53M helicopter was only a half-mile away at that 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the other Silver Star recipients also was involved in the  
rescue of a downed U.S. pilot, though in much different 
circumstances. Capt. Adam Kavlick was flying lead in a group of 
F-16CJs on a mission to destroy Serb SA-3 and SA-6 surface-to-air 
missile batteries near the city of Novi Sad on May 2 when his 
wingman was struck by an SA-3 missile, causing engine failure and 
forcing the pilot to eject. 
</P>
<P>
	Kavlick established the pilot's position, heard his survival  
beacon, made radio contact with him and marshaled the forces 
necessary for a rescue. Once during the 90-minute wait for rescue 
helicopters to arrive on the scene, Kavlick's formation of F-16s 
was shot at by surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft guns. 
Kavlick remained on station, however, to coordinate the unfolding 
rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	The third Silver Star went to Capt. Sonny Blinkinsop, an F-16CJ  
pilot cited for risking his life to ensure the safety of a large 
group of U.S. and British strike aircraft that encountered heavy 
fire from Serb air defenses near Obrva on May 2. At one point all 
three of Blinkinsop's wingmen were maneuvering to avoid SA-3 
missiles, so Blinkinsop fired a HARM missile to destroy the radar 
linked to the SA-3s. 
</P>
<P>
	``The timely and heroic engagement of the SA-3 by Capt.  
Blinkinsop, at great personal risk to himself, had forced the 
threat to shut down and allowed his wingmen to successfully evade 
its deadly missiles,'' the citation said.

<HEADLINE> Walgreens Settles Justice Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Walgreens drug store chain has agreed to  
pay the federal government and 25 states a total of $7.6 million to 
settle allegations that it submitted false prescription claims, the 
Justice Department says. 
</P>
<P>
	The case against Deerfield, Ill.-based Walgreen Co. was filed by  
the department in U.S. District Court in Tampa, Fla. It involved a 
common industry practice of billing government health insurance 
programs for the full amount of prescriptions, even when those 
prescriptions were only partially filled. 
</P>
<P>
	David Ogden, acting assistant attorney general for the civil  
division, said Wednesday this was the first Justice Department suit 
to address that practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to pursue pharmacies for billing for  
prescription drugs that are not provided to customers,'' he said. 
``This first case should serve as a warning that it won't be 
tolerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walgreens spokesman Michael Polzin said the situation occurred  
only when customers came in to fill a prescription that exceeded 
the stock on hand at the pharmacy. In those cases, the pharmacist 
would partially fill the prescription, with the understanding that 
the customer would return later to pick up the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a small number of cases, he said, the customer did not  
return. In those instances, either the pharmacist canceled the 
claim sent to the health insurer, meaning Walgreens was not paid 
even for the drugs it did dispense, or the full amount was billed. 
</P>
<P>
	Polzin said he had no estimates of how often either situation  
occurred. The insurers affected were state Medicaid programs, 
Tricare Management Activity and the Federal Employee Health 
Benefits Program. Puerto Rico also will get a share of the 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was absolutely no intent on Walgreens' part to receive  
incorrect payment,'' Polzin said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the settlement amount, Walgreens also agreed to  
modify its record-keeping operation so health insurers would be 
reimbursed when the remainder of prescriptions are not collected. 
</P>
<P>
	Walgreens, the nation's largest drug store chain, operates 2,821  
stores in 39 states and Puerto Rico. It had fiscal 1999 sales of 
$17.8 billion.

<HEADLINE> NBC Investing in Paxson Comm. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC is investing $415 million in Paxson  
Communications Corp., giving the network a 32 percent stake in the 
television station group and providing NBC with another major 
outlet for its programming. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced today will also allow Paxson to beef up its  
programming lineup for its 72 television stations as well as its 
family-friendly PAX network, the nation's newest and 
seventh-largest network. Counting an additional 51 PAX affiliates, 
Paxson reaches 76 percent of U.S. households. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the arrangement, NBC will also have the right to buy  
a controlling stake in Paxson after February 2002, if federal rules 
are changed allowing networks to own more television stations. In 
addition to the national network, NBC also owns 13 television 
stations in major markets. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC, which is a unit of General Electric Co., is paying $415  
million in cash for new preferred stock in Paxson, which can be 
converted into an ownership stake of 32 percent of Paxson's common 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The management of Paxson, which is based in West Palm Beach,  
Fla., will remain in place, including chairman Bud Paxson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's investment is another step in our effort to seek out  
new platforms for NBC programming and content,'' NBC president Bob 
Wright said. ``At a time of rapid change in the broadcast industry, 
we want to be invested as strategically as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson became an attractive partner for other television  
companies following a major rule change last month by the Federal 
Communications Commission, which allowed companies to own more than 
one station in the same market, or a duopoly, if specific 
requirements are met. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies have been eager to take advantage of the ruling since  
owning two stations in the same city could lead to significant cost 
savings by combining back office operations as well as lifting the 
profile of the weaker station by adding top-tier programming from 
its new owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Paxson owns a large number of stations around the country,  
it became a logical partner for larger companies seeking to own two 
stations in the same city. It also owns many smaller stations, 
which the FCC ruling favored as takeover targets. Paxson's stock 
has been rising in recent weeks on speculation that a deal was in 
the works. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Paxson's stock slipped 56 1/4 cents, or by 3.7 percent, to  
$14.50 in morning trading today on the American Stock Exchange. 
NBC's new preferred stock in Paxson is convertible at $13.01 per 
share. GE edged up 31 1/4 cents at $116.31 1/4 a share on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	After the FCC ruling came down last month, company chairman Bud  
Paxson made no secret of his interest in cutting a deal with 
another media company, calling his firm ``the prettiest girl at the 
duopoly dance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Talks about combining television stations were a major factor  
leading up to the blockbuster merger announced last week between 
CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc., which created a major vertically 
integrated media giant.

</P>
<P>
	TUNICA, Miss. (AP) -- Paul Gregory, who once struck out Babe Ruth  
as a member of the Chicago White Sox, died Thursday of heart 
failure. He was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregory was also a former Mississippi State baseball and  
basketball coach, and a three-sport letterman at Mississippi State. 
</P>
<P>
	After serving in the Navy during World War II, Gregory's  
coaching career began in 1947 when he was asked by his former 
Mississippi State baseball coach Dudy Noble, also the school's 
athletic director, to coach the Bulldogs basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregory led the Bulldogs baseball team to a 328-200-1 record and  
15 winning seasons from 1957-74, including four Southeastern 
Conference titles and the 1971 College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	While with the White Sox in 1932 and 1933, Gregory was just 9-14  
with a 4.72 ERA. In one game he retired Ruth five times, including 
once by strikeout.

<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Daniel Grove, a former state representative who  
was instrumental in creating Colorado's prison work-release 
program, died Monday of bone cancer. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Grove served two terms in the Colorado House.  
</P>
<P>
	While in the Legislature, Grove wrote and sponsored the law that  
allows prisoners serving misdemeanor sentences in county, city and 
municipal jails to work at daytime jobs and return to cells at 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	He served 10 years on the State Adult Parole Board before being  
fired in 1984 amid allegations of sexual harassment. He was later 
reinstated. The sexual harassment allegations were never 
substantiated.

</P>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mario Ruiz Massieu, who fell from the top  
echelon of Mexico's justice system to the pit of its fury, died 
Wednesday at his Palisades Park, N.J. home in an apparent suicide, 
authorities said. He was 48. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout his ordeal, Ruiz Massieu had asserted he was the  
innocent victim of a dangerous political persecution in Mexico 
where, he said, ``the demons are on a rampage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruiz Massieu was part of a family that rose to political  
prominence in the Pacific coast resort city of Acapulco. 
</P>
<P>
	A former ambassador to Denmark, he was the country's top  
anti-drug prosecutor in 1994 when his brother, the No. 2 man in 
Mexico's powerful Institutional Revolutionary Party, was gunned 
down shortly before he was to become congressional majority leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruiz Massieu was named to lead the probe of the killing but  
resigned a month later, accusing ruling party members of 
obstructing his effort. 
</P>
<P>
	In turn, Ruiz Massieu was accused of trying to protect the man  
ultimately convicted of masterminding the slaying -- Raul Salinas, 
the brother of former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1995, Ruiz Massieu fled to the United States and was  
arrested as he tried to fly out of Newark International Airport 
because he failed to declare all of the $46,000 in cash that he 
carried. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been under house arrest since 1996 while U.S. courts  
rejected four attempts by Mexican authorities to extradite him. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, U.S. prosecutors won court decisions allowing them to  
seize $9 million Ruiz Massieu held in a Texas bank account. U.S. 
authorities said he profited from the drug trade while in office. 
He was to be arraigned in Houston on those charges on Friday.

Tuesday at age 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose's company, Rose Associates, owns or manages 12,000

</P>
<P>

the American Museum of Natural History on a structure that houses 
the new Hayden Planetarium. He had contributed $20 million to the

Wednesday. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	White played a key role on the Philadelphia political scene for  
more than three decades and in 1968 founded the Black Political 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	He was instrumental in establishing the city's Town Watch  
program, and retired as an assistant managing director in the 
administration of former Mayor W. Wilson Goode. 
</P>
<P>
	His last public appearance came Tuesday, when his son, a former  
city councilman who finished third in the Democratic mayoral 
primary behind nominee John F. Street, announced he was endorsing 
Street's Republican opponent, Sam Katz. 
</P>
<P>
	White also served as deacon at Mount Carmel Baptist Church in  
West Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> OK To Drive at Frankfurt Auto Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- At most auto shows, people can look at  
the newest models, maybe even touch a few. Usually, only the 
journalists get to take a test drive. 
</P>
<P>
	But the longing to actually get behind the wheel of the latest  
in automotive technology will be satisfied for the throngs 
descending on the Frankfurt International Motor Show, which opened 
to the public Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost 150 cars -- including Volkswagens, Hondas, Renaults and  
Skodas -- are available for a test drive, accompanied by an 
automaker representative. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not so interesting just to see it, you have to drive  
it,'' said Norbert Hass, one of the VW representatives leading test 
drives of the new Lupo, a fuel-efficient, diesel-powered compact. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the tiny Lupo was pretty much characteristic of the  
type of vehicles available for test drives at the show. For those 
wanting to feel what it's like to put the gas pedal to the floor on 
a new Mercedes or BMW, the showroom was still the only place. 
</P>
<P>
	There even were plans in the works at this year's show to offer  
motorcycle test drives, but the manufacturer pulled out without 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	Chrysler officials said they weren't offering test drives at the  
auto show because it wasn't worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``If potential customers of Chrysler and Jeep are interested in  
our cars, they will go to the dealers and test drive them there,'' 
said Andrea Leitner, spokeswoman for Chrysler Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The show's sponsor, the Association of the German Motor  
Industry, would like to expand the test drives, which were first 
featured at the last Frankfurt event two years ago. But it's still 
up to each company to offer test drives with their vehicles, said 
spokesman Isfried Hennen. 
</P>
<P>
	The test drives were just one aspect of the mammoth show,  
expected to draw up to 900,000 visitors over 10 days. On Thursday, 
hundreds crowded around exhibits that highlighted the latest 
developments aimed at the European market. 
</P>
<P>
	At DaimlerChrysler's Mercedes and Smart pavilion -- so large that  
it requires a map to find one's way around -- Patricia Dahl of 
Frankfurt was eyeing the latest Smart convertible and diesel 
models. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's not enough,'' she said of the tiny 8-foot-long  
car that seats two. Dahl said the Smart would be more appealing if 
there were a four-seat version, something that executives have 
hinted might be introduced in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The test drives let people get out of the enormous convention  
grounds to cruise through the skyscraper-lined streets of Frankfurt 
for about 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	After his test ride in a VW New Beetle, Gunther Hanke of Munich  
said he wasn't sure if he would buy one. But he still emerged 
smiling from ear to ear after the drive. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was super,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Cancels Trains, Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	With Hurricane Floyd ashore, air and rail service were far from  
normal early today while major transportation centers in the 
Northeast prepared for the arrival of the powerful storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak said it did not expect to fully restore passenger rail  
service south of Washington until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Evacuations left a key dispatching center in Jacksonville, Fla.,  
staffed with only a skeletal crew Wednesday, prompting Amtrak to 
cancel most service along the corridor, as well as some Midwestern 
train lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a mandatory evacuation, and the majority of our  
people were not at work,'' said Rob Gould, a spokesman for CSX 
Corp., which runs the center. ``We didn't have enough qualified 
dispatchers for the passenger operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The storm came ashore near Wilmington, N.C., early today. It was  
forecast to move north by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	While flights to Miami and some other Florida cities resumed on  
Wednesday, hundreds of others were canceled today in Virginia, 
North Carolina, South Carolina and the Washington area. Delays were 
common Wednesday due to the Federal Aviation Administration's 
closure of some Southeast control centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Many canceled flights were operated by American, Continental,  
Delta Airlines and U.S. Airways, which carry the bulk of travelers 
along the eastern seaboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish all my colleagues safe travel home,'' House Majority  
Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said Wednesday as he and the other 
leaders canceled legislative business for the week so 
representatives could catch flights home in case of airport 
closures. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther north, Amtrak had positioned diesel trains along the  
line's Northeast corridor in case winds fell power lines, a 
spokesman said. Trains were running normally early today. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York City, Kennedy International Airport was reporting  
30- to 45-minute flight delays early today. Rain caused delays of 
up to an hour at nearby La Guardia Airport. The Newark, N.J., 
airport reported no weather-related trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Marleen Swinner and Jeroen Nijs spent Wednesday at Newark  
watching weather updates on television there as they waited for 
their flight to leave for Miami. The 25-year-old newlyweds from 
Belgium had been scheduled to begin a seven-day honeymoon cruise in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before we left, we knew about the hurricane,'' Nijs said,  
``but we got a very good deal on our package, so we decided to take 
the chance.''

<HEADLINE> Surging Yen Could Threaten Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The surging value of the yen against the U.S.  
dollar could threaten Japan's nascent economic recovery, but the 
country probably won't be able to convince the United States to 
help stem the yen's rise anytime soon, analysts said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen has been gaining ground against the dollar as European  
and U.S. investors bid up the Japanese currency in hopes that the 
country will continue to pull itself out of its worst recession 
since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	But gains by the yen threaten to nip any recovery in the bud,  
since the strong yen makes Japanese exports more expensive abroad 
and thus less competitive, reducing the value of earnings of 
export-oriented Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Japan's Ministry of Finance said that its top financial  
diplomat, Vice Minister for International Affairs Haruhiko Kuroda, 
will visit the United States to discuss foreign exchange issues, 
some market watchers doubt the United States will immediately take 
steps to bolster the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	``I doubt that (the United States and Japan) will be able to  
reach an agreement right away,'' said Taisuke Tanaka, foreign 
exchange strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Although analysts blame the weak dollar as a factor behind the  
drop in U.S. stock and bond prices in the last couple of sessions, 
those markets haven't weakened to an extent that would alarm U.S. 
authorities, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Top Japanese finance officials sparked a leap in the U.S. dollar  
Thursday when they announced a surprise meeting to discuss the 
yen's vexing gains. 
</P>
<P>
	When it was clear, though, that the hotel conference between  
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and Bank of Japan Governor Masaru 
Hayami produced no substantial measures to slow the yen's surge, 
the dollar plunged to an intraday low of 103.57 yen in late Asian 
trading. That was down from a high of 105.60 yen before the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	But in later trading overseas, the dollar climbed again above  
105 yen in dealings in Europe and New York. During trading 
Wednesday in Europe, the dollar sank as low as 103.20 yen, a level 
last seen in February 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Miyazawa said he will discuss Japan's foreign exchange stance at  
a meeting of Group of Seven nations later this month in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that foreign nations will understand our situation,''  
Miyazawa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Japanese officials said that the yen's  
strength threatens to derail the country's incipient economic 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	As the yen rose to the 104 level against the dollar soon after  
the start of trading Thursday, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi told 
reporters that Japan would consider intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important that foreign exchange moves in a stable  
manner,'' he said. ``There is the worry that a rapidly 
strengthening yen would have a negative impact on the economic 
recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's chief Cabinet spokesman, Hiromu Nonaka, said at a  
regular press conference that radical measures may be needed, and 
urged the market to understand that the recent stabilization of the 
economy is due to emergency policies carried out by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not just investors, but also the Japanese people will  
suffer,'' if the yen keeps rising. ``It's not welcome from the 
standpoint of improving the economy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope monetary authorities will take drastic measures'' to  
counteract the move, Nonaka said. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear if Nonaka was urging the Finance Ministry to  
intervene to weaken the yen or if he was suggesting that the 
central bank should act. 
</P>
<P>
	But the context -- the subject of future economic policy --  
suggested he might have had the Bank of Japan in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonaka's remarks came amid mounting criticism in Japan of  
financial authorities for failing to stop the yen's rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Some former Ministry of Finance officials have suggested that  
the Bank of Japan is to blame for the ineffectiveness of recent 
yen-selling interventions because the central bank continues to 
support the value of the currency in other ways.

<HEADLINE>  Carolinas Brace for Hurricane Floyd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd closed in on the North  
Carolina coast early Thursday, hitting the shore with fierce winds 
and drenching rains that flooded streets, spun off tornadoes and 
knocked out power. 
</P>
<P>
	Its howling winds reduced to a still-dangerous 110 mph, the  
Category 2 storm moved north toward Cape Fear, N.C, after 
delivering only a glancing blow to Florida and Georgia on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, authorities have urged more than 2.6 million people  
along the southern Atlantic coast to clear out of Floyd's path -- 
the biggest peacetime evacuation in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	One death was attributed to the storm in North Carolina -- a  
person died when a car hydroplaned on wet roads Wednesday afternoon 
and crashed. A second person was presumed dead after being swept 
away by floodwaters. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 a.m. Thursday, Floyd was 40 miles south of Wilmington, N.C.  
and moving north-northeast at 18 mph. The eye of the storm was 
expected to roll ashore before dawn Thursday with a storm surge 7 
to 11 feet above normal tide levels. 
</P>
<P>
	A buoy in Frying Pan Shoals, N.C., about 20 miles southeast of  
Cape Fear, showed sustained winds of 97 mph and gusts of 112 mph 
early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	By nightfall Wednesday, areas of the North Carolina coast picked  
up 13 to 16 inches of rain and winds from 70 to 90 mph winds were 
whipping north of Cape Fear early Thursday. Wilmington got 11.5 
inches of rain, which caused flooding in streets and low-lying 
areas. Some 53,000 people lost power. 
</P>
<P>
	Two twisters damaged homes and churches, but no injuries were  
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane-strength gusts of 80 mph had buffeted Charleston,  
S.C., and more than 200,000 people in the area lost power. More 
than 15 inches of rain fell on Myrtle Beach by midnight, and 
authorities said they had never seen such severe flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, in northern and central Florida, Floyd snapped power  
lines, smashed piers into driftwood and knocked out electricity to 
300,000 people. About 350 miles off the coast, the Navy and Coast 
Guard rescued eight people whose tugboat sank in 30-foot seas 
churned up by the hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	But Floyd made a northward turn that spared Florida and Georgia  
the catastrophic damage many had feared. NASA's Kennedy Space 
Center and its four shuttles were largely unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Carolinas, however, lay directly in the storm's path.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know that Florida and Georgia at this point feel like  
they've dodged a real bullet,'' said North Carolina's public safety 
secretary, Richard Moore. ``This thing is not going to miss us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Myrtle Beach, a usually bustling resort, was a virtual ghost  
town as people fled or stayed indoors, and highways were jammed 
around Wilmington. In both Carolinas, many hurricane-hardened 
people who rode out earlier storms left this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Hurley, checking into a Wilmington shelter with his wife  
and two children, said his family stayed home for Hurricanes Fran 
and Bertha in 1996, but not for Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	``They talk like this one is going to be pretty mean,'' he said.  
``It's got everybody shook up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Myrtle Beach authorities imposed a 3 p.m. curfew and turned off  
the water supply. The hospital sent its patients inland but kept a 
doctor and three nurses on emergency duty. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges banned price gouging on essential  
items, threatening fines up to $100 or 30 days in jail. ``All of us 
-- no matter what our means -- deserve the same access to lifesaving 
food and supplies,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time South Carolina took a direct hit from a major  
hurricane was almost exactly 10 years ago, when Hugo struck near 
Charleston with 135 mph winds. The storm killed 29 people and 
caused $5.9 billion in damage, the most costly hurricane to hit the 
U.S. mainland until Hurricane Andrew hit Florida in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd's winds were down from a peak of nearly 155 mph when it  
battered the Bahamas. The storm's hurricane-force winds extended 
115 miles from its center. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd's expected track would take its wind and rain up through  
the mid-Atlantic states and into New England and Canada by Saturday 
night. Forecasters said Floyd could still have winds over 50 mph 
when it hits Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	In Beaufort County, at South Carolina's southern tip, an  
estimated 90 percent of its nearly 120,000 residents heeded the 
call to evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a tomb out here now,'' said Bud Boyne, a county  
emergency spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina authorities issued evacuation orders for the  
barrier islands outside Wilmington and for the Outer Banks, the 
fragile line of islands that were battered by a lingering Hurricane 
Dennis last week. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, hurrying back from New Zealand to deal with  
the hurricane, pre-emptively declared federal disaster areas in 
South Carolina and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've done everything we know to do,'' Clinton said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of airline flights in and out of Florida and Georgia  
were canceled, and Amtrak suspended all train service south of 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Walt Disney World remained closed Wednesday, the second day of  
its first weather-related shutdown in its 28-year history. But 
SeaWorld reopened and scheduled a ``Farewell to Floyd'' fireworks 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Floyd stayed off Florida's Atlantic coast Tuesday night  
and Wednesday morning, parts of the state were raked by winds of 
more than 75 mph. A weather buoy more than 20 miles off Cape 
Canaveral measured a 54-foot wave as Floyd's eye passed over during 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
	The sea sheared off the end of the Jacksonville Pier and  
swallowed about 100 feet of the century-old Daytona Beach pier. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just kept trying to go for about 10 minutes and then a big  
wave just pulled it in,'' said Calvin Williams, 42, a dishwasher at 
a restaurant near the Daytona Beach pier. ``A lot of people clapped 
and yelled when it fell. I didn't think that was called for. The 
tears came to my eyes because this is a nice beach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd's early strength had raised fears of a repeat of Hurricane  
Andrew, which smashed into South Florida with 145 mph winds, 
killing 26 people and causing an estimated $25 billion in damage.

<HEADLINE> Roseanne in Center of TV Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If Roseanne becomes the new queen of late-night  
television this fall, it won't be by choice. Not by a long shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Her struggling daytime talk show has been assigned by several TV  
stations to start when most of the intended audience is asleep: 1 
a.m. in Phoenix, midnight in Denver, 1:05 a.m. in Minneapolis, 
after an informercial. 
</P>
<P>
	Other stations have dumped Roseanne completely.  
</P>
<P>
	Entering its second year, ``The Roseanne Show'' is not quite  
dead, but not really alive, either. Its star, the former 
blue-collar heroine of situation comedy, is enmeshed in a nasty 
corporate battle. 
</P>
<P>
	She's not talking, but her executive producer, Jeff Wald, is  
tossing a few grenades. He said the show's recent cancellation by 
11 NBC-owned stations was an attempt to strong-arm Roseanne into 
quitting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like bullies,'' Wald said, ``and I think they're  
trying to bully her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't supposed to be this way, of course. It never is. There  
was such enthusiasm when Roseanne agreed to a talk show that 
stations representing 86 percent of the country signed up, even 
though the syndicator, King World, required two-year contracts at 
stiff prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics immediately noticed the show's schizophrenic nature.  
Some days Roseanne wanted to entertain you, other days enlighten 
you. Some days she wanted to make you mad, other days she did so 
unintentionally. It was never clear what ``The Roseanne Show'' was 
really all about. 
</P>
<P>
	In a business where first impressions are crucial, initial  
ratings were lackluster, and they got worse as the year went on. 
</P>
<P>
	``The program itself is getting better,'' said Cindy Velazquez,  
general manager of the ABC affiliate KMGH-TV in Denver. ``It has 
settled into a direction that it didn't have initially. Personally, 
I felt it was all over the map when it first started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the improvement, ``The Roseanne Show'' was shunted to  
late-night when KMGH made room for its expanded evening news. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, stations don't have to worry about where to schedule  
shows that do poorly in the ratings. They simply go away, said 
Richard Kurlander, an expert on the syndication market for the 
advertising buying firm Petry Television. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time there's been a failure, and the  
syndicator is holding people to their contracts and producing the 
show,'' he said. ``This is new ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King World is guaranteed a profit no matter how many people  
watch the show, because of the two-year contract, Kurlander said. 
The decision to continue production is not necessarily obvious; 
King World must worry about alienating stations by holding them to 
a contract that hasn't work out. For now, King World is taking the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	The only way out for stations unhappy with their contracts is if  
Roseanne walks away. They would get a refund for the second year. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why Wald is convinced NBC executive Pat Wallace is trying  
to push Roseanne out. Wallace ordered ``The Roseanne Show'' taken 
off the air at the NBC-owned stations, a huge blow since it 
includes big markets like New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want to change time slots, that's one thing,'' Wald  
said. ``But their avowed interest is to get her to quit. I've never 
heard anything like that in my 35 years in the business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's more corporate intrigue. King World, after years of  
independence, was bought out by CBS earlier this year, and Wald 
believes NBC hates the idea of paying CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC denies trying to force Roseanne out. It said its stations  
were trying to find a scheduling formula that worked before cutting 
the show out of the fall schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made the decision in an attempt to improve our ratings  
performance,'' Wallace, president of the NBC television stations, 
said. ``The program had not only not lived up to expectations, the 
ratings performance was extremely disappointing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It makes no sense, Wallace said, for NBC to retaliate because of  
the CBS purchase. The network still has to do other business with 
King World, the syndicator of ``Oprah'' and ``Jeopardy.'' Kurlander 
also downplayed this theory, noting that it's CBS -- not NBC -- 
making money as the situation stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Roseanne Show'' will be seen in 60 percent of the country  
this fall, instead of 86 percent. King World won't say how many of 
the remaining stations have scheduled it for the graveyard shift; 
Kurlander estimates it's about one-third. Even Wald concedes this 
makes it more difficult to persuade stars to come on the show as 
guests. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't feel good to be taking on somebody this size,''  
Wald said. ``But, by the same token, David took on Goliath, and 
we're not afraid. We're not going to quit. We're going to stay 
there, and whatever stations are running us are going to get the 
best we have to offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's at least one clear lesson to be learned: ``We're  
advising stations to be very cautious about any two-year deals,'' 
Kurlander said.

<HEADLINE> Ohio Uranium Contamination Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Past and present employees sickened by  
radiation poisoning at a federal uranium enrichment plant in 
Kentucky would be compensated under a multimillion-dollar plan 
being proposed by the Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
	A department spokeswoman said Energy Secretary Bill Richardson  
would announce the proposal during a visit today to the Paducah 
Gaseous Diffusion Plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to hear from the Paducah community firsthand,''  
spokeswoman Natalie Wymer said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Three plant workers have alleged in a federal whistle-blower  
lawsuit that employees at the plant were unknowingly exposed to 
plutonium for 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post reported in today's editions that Richardson  
would propose spending more than $20 million in compensation for 
current and former employees who developed specific 
radiation-related cancers after working at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson also was proposing that Congress spend an additional  
$21.8 million for accelerated cleanup and medical monitoring of 
workers at the Paducah factory, as well as sister plants in Ohio 
and Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant has been producing enriched uranium since 1952. The  
uranium, once used in the manufacture of atomic weapons, now is 
used in nuclear power reactors in the United States and around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Wymer said Richardson was scheduled to hold a community meeting  
at Paducah tonight. He was to spend Friday morning meeting with 
factory employees, past and present and labor representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Department of Energy has been aggressively working to  
answer questions and concerns, and the secretary, as part of the 
community meeting will provide an update on our work to date,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson's visit comes two days after his office released  
preliminary findings for a lawsuit-prompted investigation into the 
plant's safety practices. A team of federal inspectors found no 
impending health hazards to workers or the public but criticized 
the site's contamination-control practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department owned and operated the Paducah plant until  
1993, when production was turned over to the U.S. Enrichment Corp., 
an entity created by Congress under the National Energy Policy Act 
of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The department now focuses its efforts on the environmental  
restoration of the plant site and the management of waste generated 
there.

<HEADLINE>  Carolinas Brace for Hurricane Floyd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd closed in on the North  
Carolina coast early Thursday, hitting the shore with fierce winds 
and drenching rains that flooded streets, spun off tornadoes and 
knocked out power. 
</P>
<P>
	Its howling winds reduced to a still-dangerous 110 mph, the  
Category 2 storm moved north toward Cape Fear, N.C, after 
delivering only a glancing blow to Florida and Georgia on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, authorities have urged more than 2.6 million people  
along the southern Atlantic coast to clear out of Floyd's path -- 
the biggest peacetime evacuation in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	One death was attributed to the storm in North Carolina -- a  
person died when a car hydroplaned on wet roads Wednesday afternoon 
and crashed. A second person was presumed dead after being swept 
away by floodwaters. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 a.m. Thursday, Floyd was 40 miles south of Wilmington, N.C.  
and moving north-northeast at 18 mph. The eye of the storm was 
expected to roll ashore before dawn Thursday with a storm surge 7 
to 11 feet above normal tide levels. 
</P>
<P>
	A buoy in Frying Pan Shoals, N.C., about 20 miles southeast of  
Cape Fear, showed sustained winds of 97 mph and gusts of 112 mph 
early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	By nightfall Wednesday, areas of the North Carolina coast picked  
up 13 to 16 inches of rain and winds from 70 to 90 mph winds were 
whipping north of Cape Fear early Thursday. Wilmington got 11.5 
inches of rain, which caused flooding in streets and low-lying 
areas. Some 53,000 people lost power. 
</P>
<P>
	Two twisters damaged homes and churches, but no injuries were  
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane-strength gusts of 80 mph had buffeted Charleston,  
S.C., and more than 200,000 people in the area lost power. More 
than 15 inches of rain fell on Myrtle Beach by midnight, and 
authorities said they had never seen such severe flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, in northern and central Florida, Floyd snapped power  
lines, smashed piers into driftwood and knocked out electricity to 
300,000 people. About 350 miles off the coast, the Navy and Coast 
Guard rescued eight people whose tugboat sank in 30-foot seas

<HEADLINE> EU To Investigate Austrian Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Commission has opened an  
antitrust probe into the conduct of eight Austrian banks, alleging 
that from 1994 to 1998 they conspired to fix interest rates and 
banking commissions. 
</P>
<P>
	European Union spokesman Stefan Rating said Thursday that  
investigators identified 300 formal and informal meetings at which 
officials from the eight banks discussed setting fixed rates, 
prices and commissions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is only the tip of the iceberg,' Rating said.  
</P>
<P>
	He said the banks have two months to answer the allegations in  
writing, after which they will be invited to a hearing at the EU 
headquarters in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, Rating said, the Commission will make a final ruling  
``on how valid the charges are.'' If the Commission rules the banks 
violated antitrust rules, it can impose heavy fines. 
</P>
<P>
	Rating said the eight banks under investigation are: Bank  
Austria AG, Erste Bank AG, Raiffeisenlandesbank Niederoesterreich 
Wien, Postsparkasse, Landeshypothekenbank Niederoesterreich, Bank 
fuer Arbeit und Wirtschaft AG, Oesterreichische Volksbanken AG and 
Raiffeisen Zentralbank AG. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks account for well over half of Austrian deposits and  
lending. 
</P>
<P>
	They allegedly violated EU treaty provisions on fair trade. Even  
though the alleged violations were committed in only one nation, 
they have a negative effect on fair trade rules across the 
15-nation EU, Rating said.

<HEADLINE> Needles Wash Ashore on Calif. Beach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Hundreds of surfers were ordered  
out of the ocean and 2 1/2 miles of beach were closed after more than 
800 hypodermic needles washed ashore. 
</P>
<P>
	``The syringes began coming ashore about 3:30 p.m., and since we  
don't know where they came from, we're not taking any chances,'' 
city lifeguard Lt. Mike Beuerlein said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't know how long the beach would be closed.  
</P>
<P>
	Orange County Health officials were trying to determine the  
origin of the syringes and whether they might be contaminated, 
Beuerlein said. Each syringe had a plastic cap over the needle. 
</P>
<P>
	Sections of Huntington Beach, known for its national surfing  
competitions just south of Los Angeles, have been shut down several 
times this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, health officials found high levels of bacteria known to  
cause stomach and respiratory infections, and earlier this month 
traces of fecal contamination appeared. Health officials have not 
determined the source of the bacteria.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Higher; Grains Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures prices inched higher in early  
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade in response to strong 
export sales, while grain futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean prices were pushed up by weekly export sales figures  
that were higher than expected -- 662,200 tons, well above analysts' 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains were expected to be limited, with the harvest picking up  
steam amid forecasts of continued dry weather for most of the 
soybean belt through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn export sales also were larger than expected, but potential  
gains were offset by the ongoing harvest and speculation that 
yields may be higher than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Poor weekly export figures for wheat prevented any comeback for  
that commodity after Wednesday's sharp price drop. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery was up 1/2 cent at $2.75 a bushel;  
December corn was unchanged at $2.12 1/4 a bushel; December oats fell 
3/4 cent to $1.12 a bushel; November soybeans rose 1/4 cent to $4.89 1/4 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and pork futures were lower on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange.

	October live cattle were down .05 cent to 67.62 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle were down .25 cent to 79.72 cents a pound;

<HEADLINE> U.S. Encryption Exports Allowed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House agreed Thursday to allow U.S.  
companies to sell the most powerful data-scrambling technology 
overseas with virtually no restrictions, a concession to America's 
high-tech industry over law enforcement and national security 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was a defeat for the Justice Department, which had  
forcefully argued that criminals and terrorists might use the 
technology to scramble messages about crimes or deadly plots. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as the new policy was announced, Attorney General Janet  
Reno said at the White House, ``In stopping a terrorist attack or 
seeking to recover a kidnapped child, encountering encryption might 
mean the difference between success and catastrophic failure.'' She 
said the policy ``will mean that more terrorists and criminals will 
use encryption.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To help law enforcement, the White House will urge Congress to  
give the FBI $80 million over four years to develop techniques to 
break messages scrambled by terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision should help U.S. companies in overseas competition  
-- and help consumers worldwide guarantee the privacy of their 
e-mail and online credit-card purchases. Although Reno described 
dire consequences of criminals using encryption, she readily 
acknowledged the technology ``is critically important for 
protecting our privacy and our security, and the administration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House's announcement comes as Vice President Al Gore,  
a self-described technology buff, courts the favor of the booming 
high-tech industry during his presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision by the vice president, who was really leading  
this effort, now is consistent with the views of virtually everyone 
in the technology community,'' said Robert Holleyman, executive 
director of the Business Software Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of restrictions on export sales said criminals and  
terrorists already could buy or download powerful encryption 
technology made in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who are going to misuse encryption for criminal  
purchases aren't going to limit themselves to U.S.-made encryption 
products,'' said Ed Gillespie, executive director of Americans for 
Computer Privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration will allow high-tech companies to sell even  
the most powerful encryption technology overseas to private and 
commercial customers after a one-time technical review of their 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	``A company (wanting approval) will need to come in with more  
than a brochure,'' Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said ``I'm obviously not going to tell you'' whether the  
FBI already can decode messages scrambled using the newly permitted 
encryption strengths. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to have a very significant research and  
development program in the months ahead of us,'' Hamre said. ``This 
is a complex environment, it's going to change every day and it's 
going to take us a fair amount of effort to stay ahead of the 
problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House will still require companies to seek permission  
to sell the scrambling technology to a foreign government or 
military -- a condition Hamre said the Defense Department insisted 
upon -- and it maintains bans on selling to seven nations accused of 
terrorism: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Sudan, North Korea and Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, the administration allowed companies to sell the  
most powerful scrambling technology only to specific industries 
overseas; other foreign customers were generally limited to 
so-called 56-bit encryption products, meaning those with 
72-quadrillion unlocking combinations. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a sweeping reform,'' said Dan Scheinman, senior vice  
president of legal and government affairs at Cisco Systems Inc. 
``Imagine you're banking online -- you want to make sure those 
things are safe from a hacker. You buy things, you want to make 
sure your credit card is secure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The export limits never directly affected Americans, who are  
legally free to use encryption technology of any strength. But U.S. 
companies have been reluctant to develop one version of their 
technology for domestic use and a weaker overseas version, so they 
typically sell only the most powerful type that's legal for export, 
even to Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forcing U.S. companies to do business under tight export  
controls was like asking them to use a black rotary telephone in a 
cellular, call-waiting world,'' said Harris Miller, president of 
the Information Technology Association of America, a trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics cited more than 800 products available worldwide with  
stronger scrambling technology than the United States allowed its 
companies to sell overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can pull it down over the Internet in less than 20  
minutes,'' said Gillespie. ``Having Japanese and German and Irish 
companies be at the forefront of this technology is not in our best 
interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A non-profit group of researchers demonstrated last summer it  
can unscramble a 56-bit coded message in just days using a 
custom-built computer worth less than $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House announcement follows its decision exactly one  
year ago to relax export restrictions. At the time, Gore promised 
the administration would reconsider its limits within the year.

<HEADLINE> Rizzotti To Coach Hartford Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, Conn. (AP) -- Former Connecticut star Jennifer  
Rizzotti accepted the job as women's basketball coach at the 
University of Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
	John Sudsbury, the school's sports information director,  
confirmed the appointment Thursday, and said a news conference 
would be held at 11 a.m. (EDT) Friday to make the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Rizzotti, a member of the WNBA champion Houston Comets, will  
replace Allison Jones, who resigned Aug. 30 after seven years at 
Hartford. Jones has a coaching record of 150-131. 
</P>
<P>
	Rizzotti was a two-time All-America at Connecticut and The  
Associated Press national Player of the Year and Big East Player of 
the Year in 1995-96. She was the point guard on UConn's 35-0 NCAA 
championship team in 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
	She ranks sixth in scoring at Connecticut with 1,540 points.  
Rizzotti is the Huskies' leader in assists (637) and is second 
behind Nykesha Sales in steals with 349. 
</P>
<P>
	Rizzotti, of New Fairfield, was a first-round draft choice of  
the New England Blizzard of the ABL in 1996 and was taken by the 
Comets when the ABL folded last year. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear whether Rizzotti planned to leave the WNBA, or  
rejoin the league after the Hartford basketball season.

<HEADLINE> Trucker Saw Lights Before Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The man whose steel-loaded truck was hit by an  
Amtrak train last March told federal investigators he saw warning 
lights flashing before he tried to speed through a railroad 
crossing, The Chicago Tribune reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper obtained transcripts of three interviews of John  
R. Stokes by National Transportation Safety Board investigators, 
which indicate Stokes has consistently said he saw the lights, then 
hit the accelerator. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak's ``City of New Orleans'' train slammed into Stokes'  
truck the night of March 15, killing 11 people and injuring more 
than 100. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes, who is under police investigation, refused to testify  
this week at NTSB hearings on the accident. He received a 60-day 
suspension after the crash and has since regained his driver's 
license. 
</P>
<P>
	The board isn't expected to reach a conclusion on the accident's  
cause for months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just got to the tracks and the flashers started, so I just  
floorboarded it,'' Stokes told an investigator shortly after the 
accident, the newspaper reported. ``I don't remember if I heard the 
whistle or not. ... And then I thought I had it made across there, 
and bam!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes, 58, said he didn't realize at first that the 14-car  
train had derailed and was on fire. He said he assumed his truck, 
with its load of steel, had cleared the tracks until a young man 
ran up to his cab to ask if he was all right. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes' story remained consistent through three interviews with  
investigators, the newspaper reported, although he said his memory 
was hazy on some points. The Tribune said he never asked about the 
victims or expressed sorrow beyond saying that he wished he had not 
been there.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Urged To Get Tough on Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged  
Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday to get tough on 
corruption and to cooperate with investigators ``no matter where or 
to whom the evidence leads.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freedom and free enterprise are competing with corruption and  
crime, making Russia's future uncertain, Albright said in a major 
foreign policy speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is real and must be taken seriously,'' Albright  
said while also assuring Yeltsin's government the furor over 
corruption was neither politically motivated nor an attempt to 
embarrass Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, she called for full cooperation from Yeltsin and  
other Russian leaders on investigations of money laundering and use 
of International Monetary Fund outlays. 
</P>
<P>
	But in London, Russian Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov called  
allegations of financial schemes part of a campaign to discredit 
his country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not a single fact vouching for Russian companies' involvement  
in illegal transactions has been cited,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though pledging the United States would continue to support  
democracy in Russia, and threatening no reduction in economic 
support, Albright said bluntly: ``The deadweight of corruption is 
holding Russia back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign investors now hesitate, capital has taken flight, the  
influential few have distorted Russian markets and the economy has 
sagged, she said in a speech at the Carnegie Endowment for 
International Peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign funds should be used to help the neediest Russians, not  
to enrich foreign bank accounts, Albright said. ``President 
Yeltsin's government needs -- at last -- to make fighting corruption 
a priority,'' she said. ``The Russian legal system remains no match 
for well-connected criminals, and the tentacles of Russian 
organized crime have spread far beyond the nation's borders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lecture, coming as it did from a leading figure in a  
friendly administration, reflects growing suspicions in the United 
States about how Western assistance is used in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate are planning hearings on money-laundering  
and other schemes, and in Moscow suspended prosecutor Yuri Skuratov 
said the Russian government may have mishandled a $4.8 billion 
foreign loan by sending most of it to well-connected banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Skuratov, who was suspended by Yeltsin in April, said the  
Russian government made most of the July 1998 loan available to at 
least 18 Russian banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Monetary Fund has come under criticism from  
Congress for not demanding stricter accounting by Russia of the $20 
billion it has lent since 1992. IMF officials have said previously 
that its own review of Russia, conducted by the 
PricewaterhouseCoopers accounting firm, uncovered no evidence that 
IMF funds had been improperly diverted. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior IMF official said Thursday that his agency so far has  
uncovered nothing to change the findings of the independent audit. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Viktor Ivanov, a Russian investigator who was  
visiting Washington, said Thursday that the United States had not 
provided his government with any evidence of a money laundering 
scheme at the Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Allegations of money laundering are at the heart of the  
corruption allegations. Billions of dollars have flowed through 
several suspicious accounts at the Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, meanwhile, has conferred by telephone with Foreign  
Minister Igor Ivanov and plans to meet with him in New York on 
Monday while Ivanov attends the special session of the U.N. General 
Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	The foreign minister criticized the reporting by the Western  
media and said he would present Russia's defense at the U.N. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said, ``Our message to Russian leaders has been to get  
tough on corruption and to cooperate, in full, with investigations 
into it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She declined to say whether the administration suspected any  
U.S. or other Western assistance was misused or whether the Yeltsin 
government was involved. ``We are in the process of having the 
fullest possible investigation,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright dismissed any notion of halting cooperation with Russia  
along a broad spectrum, including efforts to reduce nuclear 
arsenals and to curb the proliferation of dangerous technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``The suggestion made by some that Russia is ours to lose is  
arrogant,'' she said. ``The suggestion that Russia is lost is 
simply wrong.''

<HEADLINE> Albright Faults Kremlin Response </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright today  
called on Russian President Boris Yeltsin to make fighting 
corruption a top priority. 
</P>
<P>
	Making her appeal in friendly terms -- and dismissing any  
intention to embarrass Russia -- Albright said the Russian people 
are losing confidence in their government and suffering hardships. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is real and must be taken seriously,'' Albright  
said in a speech. ``Our message to Russian leaders has been to get 
tough on corruption and to cooperate, in full, with investigations 
into it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has sent aides here for talks as  
Congress prepares for hearings next week on whether any U.S. aid to 
Russia was improperly diverted. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Monetary Fund has come under criticism from  
Congress for not demanding stricter accounting by Russia of the $20 
billion it has lent since 1992. IMF officials have said previously 
that its own review of Russia, conducted by the 
PricewaterhouseCoopers accounting firm, uncovered no evidence that 
IMF funds had been improperly diverted. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior IMF official, briefing reporters today in Washington,  
said his agency so far has uncovered nothing to change the findings 
of the independent audit earlier in the year that the $20 billion 
in loans provided by the IMF since 1992 had not been improperly 
diverted by Russian authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The official, who spoke to reporters in the agency's executive  
dining room under rules preventing use of his name, said he 
expected the IMF would soon hand out the next loan installment once 
the Russian central bank provides extra information that IMF 
authorities have requested to account for its handling of earlier 
loans. The installment is expected to total around $640 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to be assured everything is clean after this flurry of  
accusations,'' the IMF official said. ``It is important for the 
central bank to come forward and then we will be ready to go 
forward quickly with the Russian program, given how well it is 
performing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright declined to say whether the administration suspected  
any U.S. or other Western assistance was misused or whether the 
Yeltsin government was involved. ``We are in the process of having 
the fullest possible investigation,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the speech, Albright dismissed any notion of halting  
cooperation with Russia along a wide spectrum, including efforts to 
reduce nuclear weapons arsenals and to curb the proliferation if 
dangerous technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``The suggestion made by some that Russia is ours to lose is  
arrogant,'' she said. ``The suggestion that Russia is lost is 
simply wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The task of political and economic reform in the former Soviet  
Union is herculean but not hopeless, she said. ``It is grounds for 
encouragement that the Russian people have, at every opportunity, 
made clear their rejection both of the Soviet past and a 
dictatorial future,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Money laundering is at the heart of the corruption allegations,  
Billions of dollars have flowed through several suspicious accounts 
at the Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Recalling a speech she made last year urging that foreign funds  
be used to help the neediest Russians, and not to enrich foreign 
bank accounts, Albright said: ``The response from Russian 
authorities has not been adequate. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Yeltsin's government needs -- at last -- to make  
fighting corruption a priority,'' Albright said in the speech at 
the Carnegie endowment for International Peace. ``The Russian legal 
system remains no match for well-connected criminals, and the 
tentacles of Russian organized crime have spread far beyond the 
nation's borders.''

<HEADLINE> Amnesia Victim Found in Oklahoma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- She passed from one 18-wheeler to another  
for days, wandering. When she looked in the mirror, she didn't 
recognize the face staring back, nor did she recall how she ended 
up on a dark highway, rain-soaked and bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a month after suffering a blow to the head and spending  
weeks at a women's shelter, the mystery woman given the name Angel 
found out Thursday she's a 37-year-old wife and mother of three 
teen-agers from New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Tina Martinez learned her identity when a distant relative in  
Chouteau, a small town about 50 miles northeast of Tulsa, 
recognized her picture in Thursday's edition of The Tulsa World. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew she was missing. And that picture sure looked familiar.  
Then I read the story, and it all clicked,'' said Loretta Floyd, 
whose brother is married to one of Mrs. Martinez's sisters. 
</P>
<P>
	Before her relative identified her, Mrs. Martinez described the  
feeling of being lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's scary. Indescribably scary,'' she said as she pushed back  
a lock of brown hair. ``I don't know who I am, where I've been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After seeing the newspaper article, Ms. Floyd called her sister  
in Phoenix, who called their brother in Albuquerque, where the 
family had been searching for Mrs. Martinez since she disappeared 
Aug. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford called Albuquerque police, who called officials in Ada,  
about 115 miles southwest of Tulsa, where Mrs. Martinez was staying 
at a women's shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 19 a truck driver brought her to a truck stop near  
Springer, about 80 miles south of Oklahoma City, and asked a clerk 
to call for help. When a sheriff's deputy arrived, the woman had 
only the clothes she was wearing and a $20 bill in her pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	She wore a wedding ring but knew nothing of a husband. She has  
the scars of a Caesarean section birth, but couldn't remember any 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	She could explain animals' breeding habits, diets and muscular  
structures, but when officials asked whether she perhaps could be a 
veterinarian, Mrs. Martinez didn't seem to understand what a 
veterinarian was. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs had taken over the  
investigation, partly because the woman appeared to be an American 
Indian and partly because BIA Capt. Larry Hoklotubbe has developed 
a special devotion to this case. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI had found no matches to the woman's fingerprints, nor  
did a BIA database in Carson City, Nev. She also didn't match any 
of the missing persons reports that were checked. 
</P>
<P>
	Three doctors who examined her all concluded that her amnesia  
resulted from a head trauma. 
</P>
<P>
	Under hypnosis by a psychiatrist, Angel told of crashing into a  
concrete embankment during a nighttime thunderstorm. 
</P>
<P>
	Albuquerque police Det. Ernestine Roach, who worked the case,  
said Mrs. Martinez was riding home with her husband, Jerry, when 
they stopped at a traffic light and ``something caused Ms. Martinez 
to want to leave the car.'' She apparently became upset about 
something and got out of the car, Martinez told authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it was, we would like to know,'' Ms. Roach said.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Martinez only remembers being on the side of a highway,  
soaking wet and bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members should be reunited with her at the BIA office  
early Friday, but Mrs. Martinez may stay at the shelter for a 
while. Officials say she is welcome to remain as long as she wants. 
</P>
<P>
	BIA officials asked that her husband not be among the family  
members coming to pick her up. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Martinez, a dog breeder who specializes in cocker spaniels  
and Pomeranians, wept as she learned of her past. But she still 
clings to her new name, Angel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something I feel I need to hold on to or I will lose it,  
too.''

	Floyd Bearing Down on Northeast  
</P>
<P>
	MONTAUK, N.Y. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Floyd was heading for Long  
Island and New England after rolling through the Carolinas this 
morning. By evening, its winds had fallen below hurricane force to 
65 mph. The storm created havoc even at half-strength, grounding 
hundreds of flights and closing school for 3 million students. 
While still a hurricane, Floyd drilled ashore at Cape Fear, N.C., 
knocking out power to more than 1.4 million in the Carolinas and 
dumping more than a foot of rain that flooded hundreds of North 
Carolina homes. But experts considered the overall damage to be 
modest. At least seven deaths were blamed on Floyd.

	U.S. Adds 200 to Force in E. Timor  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton gave the go-ahead today for  
limited U.S. participation in an Australian-led peacekeeping force 
for East Timor. He said about 200 U.S. troops will be involved, but 
the Pentagon said the total could increase if Australia asks for 
more help. Clinton said half the U.S. personnel will be on the 
ground in East Timor. The rest will be in Darwin on Australia's 
north coast, which is to serve as the main support base for the 
7,500-strong peacekeeping force. The American forces will play a 
supporting role, unlike in other international peacekeeping 
operations such as Kosovo and Bosnia.

	Damage Award Against Ford Overturned  
</P>
<P>
	MODESTO, Calif. (AP) -- A judge today overturned a $290 million  
damage award against Ford Motor Co. Stanislaus County Superior 
Court Judge Roger Beauchesne granted Ford a new trial on the 
punitive damages, saying jury misconduct may have influenced the 
July 12 verdict. The judge upheld the jury's unanimous finding that 
a defective roof was responsible for the deaths of a husband, wife 
and son when their Ford Bronco overturned on a freeway in June 
1993. The $290 million verdict had been the second-largest of its 
kind.

	Police Search Home of Texas Gunman  
</P>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Police picked through Larry Gene  
Ashbrook's trashed home and old journals today, but found no 
explanation for why he opened fire in a church yesterday, killing 
seven people and himself. The journals indicated that Ashbrook had 
been upset about his inability to keep a job. The 47-year-old 
Ashbrook carried two weapons, a 9mm Ruger semiautomatic handgun and 
a .380-caliber AMT handgun. The .380 was purchased legally from a 
now-closed flea market shop, acting police Chief Ralph Mendoza 
said. Officials still were researching the purchase of the 9mm.

	Congress Approves Pay-Raise Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress voted final approval today to  
legislation doubling the next president's salary to $400,000 and 
letting lawmakers themselves receive pay boosts of $4,600 or more. 
Also getting pay raises in January would be Vice President Al Gore, 
Cabinet secretaries and about 1,300 other top-level executive 
branch officials. The 3.4 percent boost -- rounded to the nearest 
$100 -- would raise most lawmakers' pay to $141,300 beginning in 
January. The Senate approved it by 54-38, a day after the House 
gave its endorsement by 292-126. President Clinton is expected to 
sign the measure.

	Bradley Supports Gays in Military  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gays should be protected by the landmark 1964  
Civil Rights Act and allowed to serve openly in the military, Bill 
Bradley said in a magazine interview released today. On the 
question of a California anti-gay-marriage ballot initiative, 
Bradley told The Advocate, a gay and lesbian newsmagazine, ``if I 
was a voter in California, I would not support the Knight 
initiative.'' The former New Jersey senator said he still opposes 
same-sex marriage because of ``the religious nature of marriage and 
respect for the diversity of views on that subject.''

	Dow Ends Down 63.96

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks ended mixed today, bouncing back from a  
broad selloff on profit warnings from several companies. With 
relatively light volume due to Hurricane Floyd, the Dow Jones 
industrial average ended down 63.96 at 10,737.46. Earlier in the 
session, the Dow had dropped as much as 174 points. On the NYSE, 
losers led gainers 2,064-916. The Nasdaq fell 7.45 to 2,806.72.

	Giants Wins Fifth Straight  
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The San Francisco Giants, who trail Arizona  
by seven games with 16 left to play, refuse to believe the race in 
the NL West is over. The Giants won their fifth straight today, 
defeating the Florida Marlins 6-5 to sweep a three-game series, and 
moved a half-game closer to the idle Diamondbacks. San Francisco 
has won 22 of its last 29. Marvin Benard homered and drove in two 
runs as the Giants sent Florida to its seventh loss in a row.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart Gets Restraining Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- An Arkansas judge ordered union  
organizers to stop distributing leaflets at Wal-Mart stores 
nationwide after the company complained they were disrupting 
workers and entering private areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart argued that the United Food and Commercial Workers  
Union handed out literature to employees while they were working 
and that organizers entered prohibited areas of stores, such as 
meat-cutting rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Benton County Chancellor Don Huffman, in an order issued  
Wednesday, told the union to stay off Wal-Mart's property 
``throughout the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman in the union, which is based in Washington, had no  
immediate comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The union and Wal-Mart have been at odds for some time. Last  
December, nearly 1,000 union protesters swarmed Bentonville's city 
square after a march from Wal-Mart's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart's court action says union representatives have  
trespassed at 160 of its more than 600 Supercenters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're usually pretty accommodating when it comes to unions  
wanting to protest or leaflet,'' said Wal-Mart spokesman Mike 
Maher. ``They've gone too far and we're not going to stand for 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the judge ordered the union off Wal-Mart property  
nationwide, legal experts questioned whether the order would stand 
in other states. 
</P>
<P>
	``The validity of this order outside Arkansas is questionable,''  
said University of Arkansas law professor Howard Brill. ``The judge 
can enforce this order if it's violated inside Arkansas by holding 
the union in contempt of court. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the court has limited power to enforce it outside  
Arkansas, and it would be up to the discretion of another state 
whether to recognize the order.''

<HEADLINE> Deal May Be Near in Diet Drug Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- American Home Products Corp. is close to  
settling many of the diet-pill lawsuits for at least $3 billion, 
published reports said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Star-Ledger of Newark said the settlement could exceed $5  
billion, and would resolve more than 4,100 lawsuits brought by 
8,000 people who said they were harmed by diet pills Pondimin and 
Redux. The Wall Street Journal today said the settlement would be 
about $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	About six million people took Redux and its chemical cousin  
Pondimin in the 1990s, a combination known as fen-phen. The drugs 
were pulled from the market in 1997 after being linked to heart 
valve problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Final details of the settlement were being worked out and the  
deal could be announced Friday, the newspapers reported, citing 
anonymous sources familiar with the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	A company spokesman declined comment Wednesday night.  
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products' offer includes payments to consumers  
harmed by the diet drugs, The Star-Ledger said. It would provide 
funding for follow-up medical examinations for millions of other 
users, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal said those who feel the agreement is inadequate  
could opt out of the settlement and pursue cases on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	The Star-Ledger said unresolved issues on Wednesday included the  
structure of the payout and the terms of a side deal with 
plaintiffs in New Jersey, where a civil trial is under way over 
whether the Madison N.J.-based drug maker should be liable for the 
cost of future medical checkups. 
</P>
<P>
	The pending settlement will cover individual lawsuits and  
class-action suits certified in eight states, the newspaper said. 
It would need a federal judge's approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Journal reported that the FBI is probing whether  
the company revealed all it knew about dangers of Redux prior to 
its approval by the government in 1996. The company denied knowing 
about any such inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, in the first diet-drug lawsuit to reach a verdict, a  
Texas jury awarded a woman $23 million in damages against American 
Home.

<HEADLINE> Zedillo Implicated in Suicide Note </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A suicide note left by Mexico's one-time top  
drug prosecutor implicated Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo and 
members of the country's ruling party in his brother's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	``Members of the PRI assassinated my brother Jose Francisco, and  
President Zedillo is well aware of this, since he had a lot to do 
with it,'' said the note from Mario Ruiz Massieu, referring to the 
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. 
</P>
<P>
	``To find my brother's murderers an investigation should be  
initiated beginning with Zedillo,'' said the one-page note 
distributed Thursday by Ruiz Massieu's U.S. lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He and I knew that he was not detached from both political  
crimes of 1994,'' Ruiz Massieu wrote, an apparent reference to the 
killings of his brother and presidential candidate Luis Donaldo 
Colosio. 
</P>
<P>
	Zedillo's office denied the allegations. Zedillo, who had been  
Colosio's campaign manager, became the PRI's presidential candidate 
after his assassination. Ruiz Massieu's brother was an important 
PRI official. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruiz Massieu, 48, was found dead of an apparent overdose of  
antidepressants Thursday at his home in Palisades Park, the New 
York suburb where he lived with his wife, Maria Eugenia, and 
10-year-old daughter, Regina. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been under house arrest in New Jersey for much of the  
last 4 1/2 years, battling efforts by the U.S. and Mexican governments 
to return him to his homeland, where he was accused of covering up 
his brother's murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am absolutely innocent of all charges against me,'' Ruiz  
Massieu's note said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he successfully rebuffed four extradition attempts and  
one deportation attempt, Ruiz Massieu was upset by the indictment 
returned last month in Houston accusing him of laundering $9.9 
million in drug payoffs while an assistant attorney general in 
Mexico. He was to be arraigned on those charges Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruiz Massieu's widow said his fate was sealed in November 1994,  
when Ruiz Massieu denounced the Mexican government. 
</P>
<P>
	``All those who knew my husband will be left with a heavy  
conscience, knowing that solely to serve President Zedillo and 
thereby preserve their positions in the Mexican government, at all 
costs, they lent themselves to the ruin of my beloved and always 
admired husband,'' Mrs. Ruiz Massieu said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar dismissed the  
claims in Ruiz Massieu's letter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is the expression of a psychopath on the point of  
taking his life,'' Madrazo said. ``This letter would have to be 
analyzed more by a psychiatrist than by a jurist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mario Ruiz Massieu lived lying and he died lying.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Approves Pay-Raise Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress voted final approval Thursday to  
legislation doubling the next president's salary to $400,000 and 
letting lawmakers themselves receive pay boosts of $4,600 or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Also getting pay raises in January would be Vice President Al  
Gore, Cabinet secretaries and about 1,300 other top-level executive 
branch officials. By law, they get the same cost-of-living 
increases members of Congress do. 
</P>
<P>
	The raises -- plus a 4.8 percent increase in federal civil  
servants' salaries -- were part of a $28 billion measure financing 
the Treasury Department and some smaller agencies for the coming 
fiscal year. The Senate approved it by 54-38, a day after the House 
gave its endorsement by 292-126. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton is expected to sign the measure.  
</P>
<P>
	Spending bills generally pass the Senate by wider margins.  
Senators from both sides attributed Thursday's 38 ``no'' votes 
largely to anxiety over boosting their own salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not want to vote for a congressional pay raise,'' said  
Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, who faces re-election next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3.4 percent boost -- rounded to the nearest $100 -- would  
raise most members' pay to $141,300 beginning in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders earn more, topped by House Speaker Dennis Hastert,  
R-Ill., who will make $181,400. Gore will also earn $181,400, while 
Cabinet secretaries will make $157,000. 
</P>
<P>
	By law, federal judges would also be entitled to the same 3.4  
percent increase, but Congress must approve that separately. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., the measure's chief  
author, said he was ``bothered'' by the amount of opposition the 
congressional pay raise engendered. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ones who demagogue it most and voted against it are the  
ones who put it in their pockets,'' he told a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said he believes lawmakers deserve higher pay, and said  
their 3.4 percent increases were less than the 4.8 percent raises 
federal employees received. Even so, he said he donates his 
congressional pay raises to charity. 
</P>
<P>
	The salary boosts were not mentioned during the Senate's brief  
debate over the Treasury bill. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the bill does not even contain language increasing  
lawmakers' pay. A 1989 law grants annual congressional 
``cost-of-living'' increases unless Congress votes to block them, 
and the Treasury measure is the traditional vehicle for doing that. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers last gave themselves increases in 1998 and 1993. This  
year, the combination of a sturdy economy and a balanced federal 
budget led many lawmakers to conclude that the political climate 
for a pay raise was safe. 
</P>
<P>
	In one indication of that, of the 28 senators seeking  
re-election next year, 14 voted ``yes,'' 13 voted ``no'' and one 
did not vote. Supporters included some senators who might face 
tough re-election fights next year, including Sens. James Jeffords, 
R-Vt., and Slade Gorton, R-Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the private Congressional Accountability Project,  
congressional pay began at $6 per day in session in 1789. As 
recently as 1965, it was $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The presidential pay raise encountered little congressional  
opposition. The increase will be the first since the salary was 
doubled in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the congressional and presidential pay increases  
have contrasted the salaries with what average Americans earn, and 
cite health insurance, travel and other perks received by elected 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say the salaries should be high enough to attract  
talented people who would otherwise enter more lucrative fields. 
</P>
<P>
	With the House having fled Washington on Wednesday in advance of  
Hurricane Floyd, the vote occurred as senators chipped away at an 
imposing stack of spending bills for fiscal 2000, which starts Oct. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	This included:  
</P>
<P>
	--The Senate voted 95-0 for a $49.5 billion transportation  
measure that boosts spending for roads, mass transit and airports. 
Facing Democratic opposition, Republicans dropped language that 
would have cut mass transit aid to New York and California. The 
Senate and House must now reconcile different versions of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Senate by 52-39 sent President Clinton a bill finalizing  
the District of Columbia's budget, including $429 million in 
federal aid. The White House has threatened a veto because of 
provisions putting limits on needle exchanges for illegal drug 
users and abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Senate Appropriations Committee voted 28-0 for a $90.9  
billion measure financing veterans, housing, science and 
environmental programs. The bill would restore House-approved cuts 
in NASA and housing and outspend Clinton on popular veterans' 
health programs. Administration officials are complaining about 
cuts of some housing and environmental programs.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Stops Thousands of Travelers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd's express ride up the East Coast  
grounded tens of thousands of airline passengers around the country 
Thursday and stopped Amtrak trains on their tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines resumed service to and from Florida, Georgia and parts  
of the Carolinas but canceled several hundred flights into and out 
of airports from Boston to Washington as the storm raced toward the 
Northeast with gusty winds and rain of up to a foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Vera O'Pry of Charlotte, N.C., could not fly from Philadelphia  
to St. Croix in the Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to have to try to find something fun to do in  
Philadelphia,'' she said. ``You make your fun where you find it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carol Richards of Willingboro, N.J., missed a women's ministry  
conference in Atlanta. ``I've been planning this trip since April. 
It's really inconveniencing to me,'' she said, ``but I'll have to 
deal with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flights into and out of Hartford, Conn., New York, Philadelphia  
and Baltimore were also canceled. Some passengers trying to make 
connnections were rebooked through other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak passenger service was suspended throughout much of the  
East. 
</P>
<P>
	The railroad said its heavily used Northeast Corridor service  
between Boston and Washington was operating normally until 
mid-afternoon, when a mudslide near Baltimore and fallen trees near 
New York brought trains to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
	Stranded trains returned to the nearest station, and Amtrak was  
arranging buses, food and shelter for the passengers near 
Baltimore. Only a few trains moved between New York and 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're basically arranging as quickly as we can a hospitality  
room so we can take those folks to feed them,'' Amtrak's John Wolf 
said. ``The problem is mostly between Baltimore and Washington, and 
we're getting those trains back into the stations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, ticket sales were brisk as grounded airline  
passengers decided to take the train. Amtrak has 35,000 daily 
passengers in the Northeast, mostly along the Boston-Washington 
route. 
</P>
<P>
	Sundeep Goel, who was in Philadelphia for a week-long software  
conference, was trying to find a way home after his flight to 
Boston was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried renting a car, taking a bus, taking a train. They all  
didn't work,'' he said. ``I even offered money to people to drive 
me to Boston. I just want to get home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Karas was stranded in Washington, unable to fly home to  
Texas after attending a convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I looked out this morning, I thought, well, I can fly in  
this, but I guess the airline is looking out for my safety,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand To Sell Stake in Airline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thailand's finance ministry is expected  
to sell a 23 percent stake in Thai Airways International to new 
investors in the middle of next year, a top-ranking ministry 
official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a privatization plan, the government's 93 percent stake in  
the company will be reduced to no less than 70 percent through the 
sale of new and existing shares currently held by the ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	Permanent Secretary Suppachai Pisitvanich said because of  
aviation law, the ministry cannot cut its stake to less than 70 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate statement from the airline said that when and if the  
law is amended, the ultimate goal is to dilute the government's 
holding to less than 50 percent -- so the airline will no longer be 
a state-owned enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Some foreign carriers, including Singapore Airlines, have shown  
interest in bidding for a stake. 
</P>
<P>
	Suppachai spoke at the signing of an agreement to appoint a  
consortium to study the sale of the airline's existing shares and 
new shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai Airways said in its statement that the study will be  
completed in six weeks. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> House Panel To Review Farm Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With lawmakers working on another  
multibillion-dollar bailout of the farm economy, the Republican 
chairman of the House Agriculture Committee says it's time to 
consider changes to the government's GOP-authored farm policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how much more we have to be hit over the head  
with a 2-by-4 until we look at this,'' said Rep. Larry Combest, 
R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Combest announced plans Thursday to hold a series of hearings  
early next year with an eye toward implementing any changes to the 
1996 ``Freedom to Farm'' law by next fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have so far resisted rewriting the law, which ended  
a Depression-era system of farm subsidies, but commodity prices 
plummeted last year because of a worldwide glut of grain and are 
expected to remain depressed through 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 law scaled back on price-supporting subsidies and ended  
restrictions on what farmers could plant. In return farmers were 
guaranteed fixed but declining annual payments through 2002, when 
the law will expire. Critics say that doesn't provide enough help 
when commodity prices are low. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress gave farmers $6 billion in additional aid last year and  
is working on a similar package that could exceed the $7.4 billion 
approved by the Senate last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have faulted the Clinton administration, saying it  
hasn't pushed hard enough to open new markets for U.S. crops. 
Washington Rep. George Nethercutt said he is ``fundamentally 
supportive'' of the 1996 law but added, ``I also think there can be 
some fine-tuning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Combest, who became chairman of the committee this year, was  
only a reluctant supporter of the law in the first place, having 
voted against an earlier version in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Combest and the American Farm Bureau Federation, the  
nation's largest farmer organization, say they are interested in a 
proposal by Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, for a new system of 
subsidies that would be tied to crop yields and commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Farm Bureau has been a strong supporter of the law and  
remains opposed to other changes sought by Democrats and 
organizations that tend to represent small-scale farm operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Combest's announcement came one day after the White House sent a  
letter to House and Senate appropriators, declaring that the 1996 
law is failing because of ``fundamental shortcomings'' and urging 
lawmakers to consider finding a new way to subsidize growers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chairman Combest should be applauded,'' said Tom Buis, a  
lobbyist for the National Farmers Union, which has long opposed the 
law. ``Something isn't working when we're not getting the price 
from the market and we keep having to come back to Congress all the 
time to make ends meet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Agriculture Committee's chairman, Richard Lugar,  
R-Ind., wants to leave the law alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, there are people who have always been uncomfortable  
with it ... but a substantial numbers of farmers are in favor of 
the Freedom to Farm program,'' said spokesman Andy Fisher.

<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Carlos Beltran hit a two-run homer to  
become the first AL rookie with 100 RBIs since Mark McGwire as the 
Kansas City Royals beat the Anaheim Angels 7-1 Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Suppan (10-9) pitched a six-hitter for his fourth complete  
game of the year, striking out five and walking one. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Spehr hit a solo home run and rookie Mark Quinn drove in two  
runs as Kansas City stopped Anaheim's five-game winning streak and 
snapped its own four-game losing skid. 
</P>
<P>
	After Ramon Ortiz (1-3) walked Rey Sanchez in the first inning,  
Beltran hit a 402-foot drive deep into the right-field bleachers to 
become the first rookie with 100 RBIs since Mike Piazza drove in 
112 for Los Angeles in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire had 118 RBIs for the Oakland A's in 1987.  
</P>
<P>
	Beltran also scored his 99th run on the homer, leaving him one  
run short of becoming the first rookie with 100 RBIs and 100 runs 
in a season since Fred Lynn did it with Boston in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Jermaine Dye walked after Beltran's homer. Mike Sweeney, who  
went 3-for-3, then drove in his 97th run with a double to put the 
Royals ahead 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Molina doubled and eventually scored on Jeff DaVanon's  
groundout in the third for Anaheim's only run. 
</P>
<P>
	The Royals extended their lead to 5-1 in the fourth. Sweeney  
singled and Joe Randa, who went 3-for-4, doubled. Quinn hit an RBI 
single and Randa scored on Molina's passed ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Spehr made it 6-1 in the sixth with his eighth home run off  
reliever Steve Mintz. Quinn added an RBI double in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortiz, making his sixth major league start, allowed five runs on  
six hits and four walks in three innings. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The Angels are 10-4 with Joe Maddon as interim manager. ...  
Molina strained his left hamstring while running to first on a 
fifth-inning hit. He was replaced by Matt Walbeck. Molina is listed 
as day-to-day. ... Angels RHP Tim Belcher, who left the first game 
of Tuesday's doubleheader with inflammation in his right elbow, 
will be re-examined this weekend by team doctor Lewis Yocum. ... 
The Royals finished 6-7 on their longest home stand of the season. 
... Suppan extended his career highs in wins.

<HEADLINE> Virginia Rapist Executed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JARRATT, Va. (AP) -- A man convicted of raping and murdering a  
10-year-old girl was executed Thursday night, despite his claim 
that he lied to police when he confessed to the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Everett Lee Mueller, 51, was executed by injection at the  
Greensville Correctional Center for the 1990 slaying of Charity 
Powers in the Richmond suburb of Chesterfield County. He was 
pronounced dead at 9:04 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Mueller shook his head when asked if he wanted to make a final  
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl's body was found in a shallow grave behind Mueller's  
home, more than four months after she disappeared from a skating 
rink. Mueller was arrested four days later. He told police he 
abducted the girl, then raped and stabbed her. 
</P>
<P>
	In a clemency petition to the governor, Mueller contended he did  
not kill Charity and that he had lied to police. 
</P>
<P>
	In his letter, Mueller said he found the girl's body while  
walking through the woods behind his home. He said he did not go to 
police for fear that he would be blamed for the crime because of 
his criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court turned down his appeal and Gov. Jim  
Gilmore refused to intervene.

<HEADLINE> Jaguars' Taylor Limited in Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Jaguars tailback Fred Taylor performed  
only limited work in practice Thursday and remained questionable 
for Sunday's game against Carolina with a sprained left foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor injured the foot in the fourth quarter of last week's  
game against the San Francisco 49ers. He continued to play and 
finished with 74 yards on 24 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, however, he complained of stiffness in the foot and  
the Jaguars trainers put him in an air cast. The cast has since 
been taken off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fred really hasn't run in the last two days,'' said coach Tom  
Coughlin. ``He feels a lot more comfortable today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Taylor can't play, five-year veteran James Stewart will  
start. Taylor took over as the Jaguars running back in the third 
week last season when Stewart went down with a season-ending knee 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first action since the injuries, Stewart rushed four  
times for 15 yards and scored a touchdown last week.

<HEADLINE> Satellite Co. To Eliminate 450 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Hughes Space and Communications said  
it will eliminate 450 jobs to offset slowing demand for satellites 
from customers in Asia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	The layoffs, which amount to about 5 percent of the company's  
work force, will take effect in mid-November, spokesman Don O'Neal 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite market has flattened in recent months, largely due  
to financial crises in Asia and South America, O'Neal said. Pink 
slips were handed out Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been very few new orders, the level of work just  
doesn't support the work force we have today,'' O'Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Asia is the largest satellite purchasing region, and satellite  
sales are down there. The fact that the Asian economy has been 
soft, I think that has had a global effect,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes also was hurt by the cancellation of a contract to build  
a new telecommunications satellite for a consortium of Asian 
nations, including China. Hughes withdrew its export application 
for the satellite and took a $450 million loss on the deal after 
the State Department raised concerns the project could benefit the 
Chinese army. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes Space is a subsidiary of Hughes Electronics Corp., which  
is owned by General Motors Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal said the Hughes jobs would be cut across most categories,  
including management, and that employees were eligible for 
severance packages based on tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	The layoffs are the latest in a series of job cuts at Southern  
California aerospace plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon Systems Co. is completing a plan to lay off about 1,700  
people in the region by December as part of a companywide 
downsizing. 
</P>
<P>
	Northrop Grumman Corp. estimates it will cut 1,500 jobs this  
year at its Hawthorne plant that builds Boeing 747 fuselages. And 
AlliedSignal Inc. cut an undisclosed number of jobs last fall and 
earlier this spring to accommodate sales shortfalls and the 
relocation of its aerospace division headquarters from Torrance, 
Calif., to Phoenix.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Makes Rare Northeast Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hurricanes do not often make it to New  
England, but as Floyd set its sights on the region, longtime 
residents may have recalled disastrous storms of the past. 
</P>
<P>
	It was about 3 p.m. on Sept. 21, 1938, when the fast-moving  
storm crashed into Long Island, where it is recalled as the ``Long 
Island Express.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An hour later, having battered the island, it crossed the sound  
and struck Milford, Conn., swept up the Connecticut River Valley 
and dissipated in Canada, earning the name the ``Great New England 
Hurricane'' along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	The powerful counterclockwise winds drove a giant storm surge  
into Narragansett Bay, raising the tide well above normal and 
demolishing structures all along New England's south coast. 
</P>
<P>
	In downtown Providence, R.I., a marker shows the height of water  
in 1938 at 13-feet-8-inches, topping the record of 11-feet-9-inches 
set by the great storm of 1815. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, more than 600 people died, 1,754 were injured and  
63,000 were forced into shelters by the storm. Damage topped $306 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a battering that historian David Ludman says ``stands  
unchallenged as the greatest single event in the meteorological 
history of the region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in 1938, Long Island was largely undeveloped -- a storm  
coming ashore today at Patchogue, N.Y., and crossing the island 
would encounted dense population -- and a region in which few have 
experienced a hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	More recently, Hurricane Bob charged north on Aug. 19, 1991,  
causing some $1.5 billion in damage and claiming 11 lives in New 
England after damaging North Carolina and brushing the eastern tip 
of Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	The first recorded hurricane in New England was on Aug. 25,  
1625, when the ``Great Colonial Hurricane'' battered Narragansett 
Bay and then traveled overland to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. John Winthrop said there was ``no storm more dismal''  
reporting thousands of trees torn up by the roots. 
</P>
<P>
	Joshua Hempstead recorded the New London, Conn., storm of Aug.  
30, 1713, in his diary, reporting that a violent wind and rain were 
followed by ``a Hurrycane wch blew down several buildings &AMP; fruit 
trees such as hath not been known.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just over a century later came the Great September Gale of Sept.  
23, 1815, which made landfall near Center Moriches, N.Y., and then 
moved nearly due north through New England. It caused extensive 
damage to buildings, flooded Providence and blew down thousands of 
trees, Ludlam recorded in his ``Country Journal New England Weather 
Book.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Storms that have battered the Northeast more recently include:  
</P>
<P>
	--Hurricane Gloria, Sept. 27, 1985, crossed the center of Long  
Island causing much tree damage and beach erosion. Damage was 
estimated at $900 million. 
</P>
<P>
	--Hurricane Donna, Sept. 12, 1960, crossed Long Island Sound and  
passed through New England from New London, Conn., to Maine. Winds 
were measured at 95 mph on Block Island; three died. 
</P>
<P>
	--Hurricane Diane, Aug. 17-19, 1955, caused severe flooding  
across southern New England, killed 82 and caused $800 million in 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	--Hurricane Hazel, Oct. 15, 1954, passed over New York state  
spreading damaging winds and flooding into western New England. 
</P>
<P>
	--Hurricane Edna, Sept. 11, 1954, struck Cape Cod and Martha's  
Vinyard, killing 21 and leaving behind $40 million in damage, 
</P>
<P>
	--Hurricane Carol, Aug. 31, 1954, charged from Westhampton, N.Y.,  
to Saybrook, Conn., and then north through New Hampshire into 
Canada. The toll: 50 dead, $438 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	--Great Atlantic Hurricane, Sept. 14-15, 1944, came ashore at  
Point Judith, R.I., and exited at South Weymouth, Mass., badly 
battering Cape Cod. There were 26 fatalities in New England and an 
estimated 300 more at sea, damage of $100 million.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Banks Said Ready for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal banking regulators sought to reassure  
the public Thursday that the nation's banking system is ready to 
deal with any problems that arise from the Year 2000 date change. 
</P>
<P>
	Comptroller of the Currency John D. Hawke Jr. said federal bank  
examiners have conducted Year 2000 computer examinations in each 
insured financial institution at least twice, with the largest 
banks receiving continuous Y2K oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K concern stems from the fact that many older computers  
and software recognize only the last two digits of the year, 
meaning they might mistakenly interpret ``00'' as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, 99.7 percent of all federally supervised financial  
institutions have finished their renovations and tests of their 
systems,'' Hawke told reporters at a joint news conference with 
other banking supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
	And the small number still making checks, Hawke said, ``are  
receiving intensive, on-site supervision to ensure that they, too, 
will experience no disruptions of the systems their customers 
depend upon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Kelley Jr., a member of the Federal Reserve who is  
overseeing that agency's Y2K preparations, said the Fed had ordered 
up extra currency to meet demands from Americans worried about 
getting access to their deposits in the new year. But he said the 
Fed hoped that precaution would be unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have stressed that we see no need for the public to hold  
extra cash,'' Kelley said. ``We feel strongly that the most 
sensible thing to do with your money is to leave it where it is, 
but our responsibility is to make sure the public knows that 
currency will be readily available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ellen Seidman, director of the Office of Thrift Supervision,  
advised consumers to keep copies of their financial records and 
balance their checkbooks regularly and also be wary of possible Y2K 
scams as the new year approaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``Be skeptical and tell friends to be skeptical if someone asks  
for account information, credit card numbers, Social Security 
numbers or your mother's maiden name,'' she said. ``Be wary if ... 
told that your personal information is needed to make Y2K 
adjustments. Simply put, it isn't.''

<HEADLINE> Penn State's Offense in Jeopardy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Penn State is all mixed up.  
</P>
<P>
	The Nittany Lions have proven they can throw. Strangely, they  
have not gotten much production from their usually reliable ground 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	As much as coach Joe Paterno might love to return to a  
traditional Big Ten-style game, No. 3 Penn State (3-0) might not 
get the chance against No. 8 Miami on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions' rushing attack -- so far inconsistent -- meets a  
Hurricanes run defense that held Ohio State to 116 yards. Their 
linebackers, who have combined for 44 tackles in two games, are 
sure to crowd the line. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's defensive backs, meanwhile, are mostly untested. Last  
year, Miami was 85th in the country in pass defense. This year, 
Ohio State tried two new quarterbacks against them, and the 
Hurricanes' next opponent was Division I-AA Florida A&AMP;M. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may have to throw the ball, we don't know,'' quarterback  
Kevin Thompson said. ``It's just a matter of how Miami plays us. If 
they put eight guys in the box, who knows? Maybe we can break one 
loose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That, anyway, is what Miami coach Butch Davis expects.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes they are vanilla in the sense that they just try to  
beat you with athletes and in performance and in technique,'' he 
said. ``I think they will be a lot more imaginative, because they 
were against Arizona. They were creative -- multiple shifts, 
multiple formations and multiple position groups.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Paterno isn't one to spend a whole season relying on big  
plays, reverses and bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	He was especially concerned after the Lions scraped together  
just 65 yards in a 20-17 victory over Pittsburgh last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we'll have to run the ball better than that at  
times during the year,'' Paterno said. ``I said prior to the Pitt 
game that was one of my concerns, that we had really fooled people 
with big plays, and that one of these days we weren't going to be 
able to fool people. We were going to have to go in there and earn 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State has been known to throw a lot from time to time --  
despite its reputation as a running team. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1982, the Lions became the first team to win a national title  
by piling up more passing yards than rushing yards. In 1994, Kerry 
Collins led Penn State to a 12-0 season by throwing for a 
school-record 2,679 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	But both teams had great backs, too: In 1982, Curt Warner rushed  
for 5.3 yards every time he carried. Ki-Jana Carter ran for 1,539 
yards in 1994 with a 7.8 average. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, sophomore Eric McCoo has only 103 yards on 28  
carries. Aaron Harris, Paterno's most experienced back, has 91 
yards on 17 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	Paterno does not blame his experienced offensive line, only his  
new schemes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're playing the game a little different than we've done,''  
he said. ``We're spread out a little more, different combinations, 
we're trying to do a lot of different things. If you want to spread 
out a little bit, then you don't run the ball quite as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not played with two tight ends. We have not done  
things we've done in other years to make sure we can run the 
football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's a problem when teams crowd eight or nine players in the  
box, as Pittsburgh did. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to have a successful running day when they do  
that,'' Mike Cerimele said. ``But we're going to have to work to 
get better because that's what we're going to see the rest of the 
year.''

<HEADLINE> UEFA Cup Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Defending champion Parma had a scare before  
defeating Kryvbas of Ukraine 3-2 in one of more than three dozen 
first-round, first-leg UEFA Cup matches Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Former European Champion Cup winner Ajax had an easy 6-1 victory  
over Dukla Banska of Slovakia and Italian power Juventus won 5-2 
over Omonia of Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
	At Parma, Italy, newly-signed striker Marco Di Vaio scored twice  
in seven minutes and Dino Baggio added another in the second half 
to give Parma the 3-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italians fought back after striker Oleksandr Palyanytsia  
gave the visitors a surprise lead in the 5th minute. Kryvbas got 
its other goal from Roman Monavov in the 74th. 
</P>
<P>
	At Sofia, Bulgaria, Nolberto Solano and Temuri Ketsbaia scored  
as England's Newcastle defeated CSKA Sofia 2-0, the English side's 
first victory since April 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Newcastle has yet to win this season in England's Premier League  
and is now being managed by Bobby Robson, who replaced Ruud Gullit 
after the Magpies got off to a poor start. 
</P>
<P>
	At Nicosia, Cyprus, Italian giant Juventus defeated Omonia of  
Cyprus 5-2 behind two goals from Filippo Inzaghi. Juventus has 
reached three of the last four Champions Cup finals and won 
Europe's top prize in '96. 
</P>
<P>
	At Trondheim, Norway, Werder Bremen of Germany trounced  
Bodo/Glimt 5-0, all but assuring the Germans a place in the second 
round. Claudio Pizzaro and Rade Bogdanovic scored twice with the

<HEADLINE>  De La Hoya-Trinidad Fight a Monster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Oscar De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad are a  
couple of welterweights doing heavyweight numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	At a time when boxing was supposed to be on the ropes, De La  
Hoya and Trinidad may generate some $80 million in revenue when 
they step into the ring Saturday night in a welterweight title 
fight so intriguing even this city's oddsmakers can't figure out a 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
	From the gambling houses on the Las Vegas Strip to the prisons  
of Puerto Rico, the rare matchup of unbeaten champions is the most 
anticipated non-heavyweight fight since Sugar Ray Leonard met the 
likes of Marvelous Marvin Hagler and Thomas Hearns in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight is so big that the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino didn't  
even bother to sell tickets to the general public. All 11,610 seats 
were quickly taken by hotels offering them to their biggest 
gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This thing is a monster,'' promoter Bob Arum said. ``The  
Hispanic community is at a fever pitch over this, and it's selling 
well everywhere else too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya is a slight 6-5 favorite over ``Tito'' Trinidad, but  
both fighters will come out winners with some of the biggest purses 
ever paid outside a Mike Tyson fight. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya is guaranteed at least $21 million -- even more if the  
pay-per-view sales are as good as expected -- while Trinidad will 
get at least $10.5 million for the scheduled 12-round fight that 
will unify the IBF and WBC versions of the 147-pound title. 
</P>
<P>
	The casinos figure to make even more, with high-rollers flocking  
to town on a Mexican independence day weekend to watch a 
Mexican-American champion facing Puerto Rico's biggest sports hero. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sports crowds in general gamble more money and fight crowds in  
particular are known to gamble even more,'' said Rob Powers, 
spokesman for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. ``In 
addition to that, the media exposure Las Vegas gets is invaluable. 
You can't even calculate it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Promoters are hoping more than 1 million homes spent $49.95 to  
get the pay-per-view telecast of the fight, and demand is so great 
in Las Vegas alone that it will be shown on closed-circuit TV at 
various hotels to another 30,000 people paying $50 a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	In Puerto Rico, which has only 220,000 homes capable of ordering  
pay-per-view, a quarter of them had already bought it by the 
beginning of the week and more than half were expected to watch it 
by fight time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Puerto Rican government said it would foot the bill to have  
the fight on 16 TV sets at the capital building for 8,000 poor 
residents to watch the match. Four prisons are also showing it as a 
reward for good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Local radio stations have dubbed it ``Tito fever'' and the fight  
has become a matter of national pride to the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to celebrate in Puerto Rico Saturday night,''  
Trinidad promised this week. ``It will be the biggest party ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Trinidad is huge in the Puerto Rican market, De La Hoya is  
a proven pay-per-view fighter whose movie-star looks and flashy 
smile draw screaming Mexican-American girls to his appearances. The 
1992 Olympic gold medalist was born and raised in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oscar's fights have primarily attracted the Mexican market,  
but Trinidad brings tremendous buys among people of Puerto Rican 
heritage,'' Arum said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though not matching the 1.9 million pay-per-view buys of the  
second Mike Tyson-Evander Holyfield heavyweight fight, De La Hoya's 
1997 fight with Pernell Whitaker was bought by 800,000 households. 
He has generated $150 million in revenue in seven pay-per-view 
fights, according to TVKO, the HBO arm that does the pay-per-view. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Oscar wins this fight, he'll be the biggest thing in boxing  
in decades,'' said HBO executive Lou DiBella, who helped arrange 
the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	In an era where few champions ever meet each other and the major  
titles are so fragmented that only the most ardent boxing fans know 
who holds titles, the fact two undefeated fighters in their prime 
are fighting makes the bout even more unusual. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad is 35-0 with 30 knockouts, while De La Hoya is 31-0  
with 25 knockouts. Both are 26, and both are big punchers. But both 
also have suspect chins, and have gone down in their careers. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the reason the fight is almost even at sports books,  
where millions of dollars are expected to be bet on both fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting more and more by the hour,'' said Vinny  
Magliulo, who runs the Caesars Palace sports book. ``This fight 
will be one of the highest, if not the highest, bet non-heavyweight 
fights ever.''

	UAW, DaimlerChrysler OK Deal  
</P>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- The United Auto Workers won a 3  
percent wage increase plus a bonus for all 75,000 union workers at 
DaimlerChrysler as well as more support for efforts to organize 
nonunion plants in the South, local union officials said today. 
With the tentative four-year contract agreement awaiting a 
ratification vote, the UAW now has a roadmap for bargainers as it 
turned its attention to General Motors Corp., with Ford Motor Co. 
on deck. GM and Ford will likely be asked to match 
DaimlerChrysler's terms, which analysts said appeared likely to be 
approved by the UAW's membership. DaimlerChrysler shares fell, 
slipping 75 cents to $71.31 1/4 a share on the New York Stock 
Exchange, while GM rose $1.37 1/2 to $65.18 3/4 and Ford gained 18 3/4 cents 
to $49.93 3/4.

	Industrial Production Rises Again  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American industry continues to pick up speed  
as overseas markets revive, with output at factories, mines and 
utility plants up 0.3 percent in August. The increase in industrial 
production reported by the Federal Reserve is the seventh in a 
string of monthly rises that began in February after output had 
declined in 1998 to the slowest pace in five years. In July, 
industrial output rose 0.7 percent. ``The booming domestic economy 
is supporting activity and more recently, manufacturers are getting 
a boost from improved exports to a rebounding global economy,'' 
said economist Mark Zandi of Regional Financial Associates in West 
Chester, Pa. ``There's a clear, improving trend.'' Production last 
month was 2.5 percent above August 1998.

	Stocks Fall; Dow Ends Down 63.96

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks ended mixed today, bouncing back from a  
broad selloff on profit warnings from several companies. The Dow 
Jones industrial average ended down 63.96 at 10,737.46. Earlier in 
the session, the Dow had dropped as much as 174 points. Broader 
stock indicators ended mixed. On the New York Stock Exchange, 
losers led gainers 2,064-916. Volume was relatively light as 
Hurricane Floyd kept many New York traders out of work. The threat 
of worse weather tomorrow kept others on the trading floor to clear 
portfolios. Tomorrow also marks a ``triple witching'' session, when 
contracts on stock options, index options, and index futures all 
expire, and many traders chose to settle their accounts today. The 
Nasdaq composite index fell 7.45 to 2,806.72.

link their wireless telephone operations with roaming agreements 
and other seamless services. The new alliance, named Advance, comes 
as wireless rival Vodafone AirTouch of Britain works to forge an 
alliance with Bell Atlantic Corp. with an eye toward joining their 
U.S. mobile phone businesses. AT&AMP;T and British Telecom provide 
wireless services in 17 countries with a combined customer base of

warned of possible weakness in the current quarter. The package 
delivery company earned $159 million, or 52 cents a share, during 
the company's first quarter ended Aug. 31. In the same three-month 
period last year, FDX earned $149 million, or 50 cents a share. 
Revenues rose to $4.3 billion in the latest quarter, improving from 
$4.1 billion a year earlier, while operating income remained level

closely investigating several day-trading firms, with regulators 
finding violations at a number of the companies, SEC Chairman 
Arthur Levitt said today in congressional testimony. The statements 
by Levitt, the government's top securities regulator, came as 
Congress took its first look at the risky popular practice of 
electronic day-trading. The hearing by the Senate Governmental 
Affairs subcommittee on investigations occurred six weeks after 
exasperated trader Mark Barton shot and killed nine people at two 
day-trading firms in Atlanta before killing himself. ``Our 
preliminary findings indicate that many of these firms have 
extremely lax'' compliance with securities laws, Levitt testified.

future that we draw from the full range of talent and ability to 
develop the next generation of leaders,'' Gates said in a statement 
issued moments before a news conference. The gift -- being made

hundreds of community development corporations around the country. 
Rubin, who spent 26 years on Wall Street, rising to become chairman

	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Commission has opened an  
antitrust probe into the conduct of eight Austrian banks, alleging 
that from 1994 to 1998 they conspired to fix interest rates and 
banking commissions. European Union spokesman Stefan Rating said 
today that investigators identified 300 formal and informal 
meetings at which officials from the eight banks discussed setting 
fixed rates, prices and commissions. He called the cases ``only the 
tip of the iceberg.'' Rating said the banks have two months to 
answer the allegations in writing, after which they will be invited 
to a hearing at the EU headquarters in Brussels.

<HEADLINE> Interbrew Takes Over Bosnia Brewery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Interbrew SA, the fourth-largest brewer  
in the world, has acquired control of the Uniline Brewery of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina for an undisclosed price. 
</P>
<P>
	Leuven-based Interbrew said Thursday the purchase will  
strengthen its presence in Central Europe, where it already has 
subsidiaries and joint ventures in Bulgaria, Croatia, Montenegro 
and Romania. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Christian Plingers said Interbrew wanted to reinforce  
its position now that the political problems have decreased and 
reconstruction is beginning to attract foreign investors -- 
including other foreign brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Interbrew bought a 51 percent stake in Uniline from the Emona Z  
company. The remaining shares are held by local investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Uniline, based in Grude, is the only brewer in the south of  
Bosnia-Herzegovina. It will produce Interbrew's Ozujsko lager and 
will also introduce the Stella Artois label into the local market. 
</P>
<P>
	Interbrew has a major presence in Europe, North America, Africa  
and Asia. It is best known in North America for Labatt Ice and 
Rolling Rock. The company also owns the Toronto Blue Jays baseball 
team.

as the starter Sunday when Cleveland, coming off an embarrassing 
opening loss to Pittsburgh, travels to Nashville to play the 
Tennessee Titans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know when this would happen, if it would be this year  
or not,'' Couch said Wednesday. ``I'm grateful for the opportunity. 
Hopefully, I'll go out and do what I'm capable of doing, go out 
there and put some points up on the board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Browns coach Chris Palmer announced he was making the switch  
because he thinks Couch is ready to start and because Detmer would 
be better at coming off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very confident in the move,'' Palmer said. ``I feel very  
upbeat, positive. I think it's the best thing for the team. I know 
there's steps along the way. Some of those steps look like 
mountains, but you have to take them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked what would precipitate starting Detmer again, Palmer  
said: ``I don't know that will happen this year. It could. I've 
said all along I know what Ty Detmer is. Couch obviously has 
upside, and he has to grow. I just think Tim has more upside than 
Ty at this particular time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer hinted at a quarterback change Monday. After consulting  
with his staff, he decided on Tuesday night to start Couch. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns had planned to bring Couch along slowly, grooming him  
as Detmer's understudy while the rookie from Kentucky learned the 
complexities of the pro game. But Palmer scrapped the plan, partly 
after seeing Detmer struggle in the opener and because of Couch's 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking for guys to make plays,'' Palmer said. ``I'm not  
disappointed in Ty. I think Ty would be able to do a better job in 
this situation as a reliever compared to Tim as a reliever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch, who signed a $48 million contract before the Browns even  
selected him, threw an interception on his first pro attempt 
against the Steelers. He finished 0-for-3 and also fumbled. 
</P>
<P>
	That's hardly a performance worthy of taking away someone's  
starting job. But Detmer knew his days were numbered. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot sooner than I expected,'' Detmer said. ``The way  
things had gone, and things that had been said, but that's the NFL. 
A lot of things happen during the course of a season and during the 
course of a week. It's a decision that's been made and you move on. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a No. 1 pick, there's always going to be plans for him to  
play, and the plan is for him to play now. I don't think it's a 
panic move, I think it's a move to try and get him ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback isn't the only position where Palmer is making a  
change by replacing a veteran with a rookie. Daylon McCutcheon, who 
had three interceptions in the preseason, will start at right 
cornerback over Antonio Langham, and Steve Zahursky will start at 
right offensive guard in place of Scott Rehberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch looked like he was ready to take Detmer's job in the  
exhibition opener last month, rallying the Browns past the Dallas 
Cowboys in the Hall of Fame game. 
</P>
<P>
	He started the home opener in the new Cleveland Browns Stadium.  
Against Minnesota's first unit, he made some rookie mistakes on his 
reads and in picking up blitzes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely feel more comfortable having one start under my  
belt in the preseason,'' Couch said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the regular season is entirely different, as Couch learned  
when the Steelers came right at him. He's expecting no different 
from the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to test me,'' he said. ``Anytime you play a guy  
making his first start in the league, they're going to come after 
me. If I show them I can handle the blitz, then maybe they'll back 
off a little bit. But I'm sure early on they'll come after me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch said he received assurances from Palmer that he won't be  
pulled for a bad decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are going to give me plenty of time to make something  
happen,'' he said. ``But if the game gets in the third and fourth 
quarter, and I'm not doing too well, we've definitely got a guy in 
Ty who can come in and move the football team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive tackle Orlando Brown thinks Couch is up for the  
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd better be ready,'' Brown said. ``He's got that  
confidence. He was a first-round pick. He carries himself like a 
successful player. He's got the fire.''

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies Sign Forward Grant Long </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The Vancouver Grizzlies  
signed free agent forward Grant Long to a three-year contract, the 
club announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Long, an 11-year veteran, averaged 9.8 points and 5.9 rebounds  
while appearing in all 50 games for the Atlanta Hawks last season. 
The 33-year-old is expected to add to the team's frontcourt depth, 
which was already bolstered last month when the Grizzlies acquired 
Othella Harrington and Antoine Carr in an 11-player deal that sent 
Steve Francis to the Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Long, who broke into the NBA with the Miami Heat and also played  
for Detroit, is the second free agent signed by the team this 
summer. Vancouver picked up veteran Dennis Scott last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Grant is an experienced player who is able to contribute as a  
leader on the court and in the locker room,'' Grizzlies president 
and general manager Stu Jackson said.

<HEADLINE> Zedillo Implicated in Suicide Note </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A suicide note left by Mexico's former  
deputy attorney general implicated President Ernesto Zedillo and 
members of the country's ruling party in the slaying of the onetime 
prosecutor's brother. 
</P>
<P>
	``To find my brother's murderers an investigation should be  
initiated beginning with Zedillo,'' Mario Ruiz Massieu said in the 
note left distributed today by his U.S. lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He and I knew that he was not detached from both political  
crimes of 1994,'' Ruiz Massieu wrote, an apparent reference to the 
killings of his brother and presidential candidate Luis Donaldo 
Colosio. 
</P>
<P>
	Zedillo's office denied the allegations.  
</P>
<P>
	Ruiz Massieu, Mexico's former top drug prosecutor, was found  
dead Wednesday in an apparent suicide two days before he was to be 
arraigned in Houston on U.S. charges of laundering $9.9 million in 
suspected drug payoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruiz Massieu, 48, had been under house arrest in New Jersey for  
much of the past 4 1/2 years, battling efforts by the U.S. and Mexican 
government to return him to his homeland, where he was accused of 
covering up the 1994 murder of his brother, an important party 
official in the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as 
PRI. 
</P>
<P>
	He died of an apparent overdose of antidepressants at the home  
in Palisades Park where he lived with his wife, Maria Eugenia, and 
10-year-old daughter, Regina. 
</P>
<P>
	In his suicide note, Ruiz Massieu urged Zedillo to ``leave my  
family in peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Members of the PRI assassinated my brother Jose Francisco, and  
President Zedillo is well aware of this, since he had a lot to do 
with it,'' said his one-page note dated only 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am absolutely innocent of all charges against me,'' the note  
said. ``The government illegally and unjustly accused me, having 
fabricated evidence and having bought witnesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors in Bergen County, N.J., said police were called to  
the house by Ruiz Massieu's wife, who said she found him on the 
bedroom floor. He was still wearing his electronic monitoring 
anklet. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruiz Massieu had argued he faced political persecution if he  
were returned to Mexico, and had fended off four extradition 
requests in New Jersey courts. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer in Mexico said the money-laundering charges may have  
been too much for him to bear. Javier Olea Pelaez told the Formato 
21 radio station Ruiz Massieu feared winding up in prison without 
enough money to defend himself. 
</P>
<P>
	His sister, Marisela Ruiz Massieu, said the suicide ``was due to  
the fact that he was cornered by pressure both from the United 
States and Mexico.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she believes the same people who masterminded their  
brother Jose Francisco's murder were responsible for driving Ruiz 
Massieu to kill himself. She didn't specify who those people were, 
saying she feared retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruiz Massieu was arrested in 1995 at Newark International  
Airport for failing to declare all of $46,000 in cash he was 
carrying while attempting to flee to Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	As the assistant attorney general for drug crimes in 1994, he  
had been charged with investigating the murder of his brother, a 
leader of the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. 
</P>
<P>
	But authorities accused him of intimidating and torturing  
witnesses to hide the identity of the mastermind behind that murder 
-- the brother of then-President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican authorities charged him with abuse of authority,  
embezzlement, drug smuggling, and money laundering but did not 
produce enough evidence to persuade U.S. courts to extradite him. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a Houston court charged him with 25 counts of money  
laundering and conspiracy, accusing him of using an unidentified 
intermediary to move $9.9 million in cash from Mexico to a Houston 
bank between 1993 and 1995. He was taken into custody but released 
on a $500,000 bond.

<HEADLINE> Report: Barclays Examines Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Barclays Bank plans to close the accounts of some  
of its Russian offshore customers following allegations that 
Russian gangsters laundered billions of dollars through a U.S. 
bank, the Financial Times reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank is examining all the Russian offshore accounts and if  
it cannot receive satisfactory assurances on ownership and use of 
any of the accounts, it will close them, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A meaningful percentage'' of the accounts so far faced  
closure, Barclays group risk director Alan Brown was quoted as 
saying. ``It is now very hard to be certain who owns these accounts 
or what the transactions are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged money-laundering scheme involves as much as $10  
billion purportedly laundered through the Bank of New York, the 
15th-largest bank in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	French investigators have opened a related inquiry into a French  
bank for its management of funds from Russia's Central Bank, 
including money loaned by the International Monetary Fund. Austrian 
police reportedly are also looking into possible links between an 
Austrian bank and alleged money laundering by Russian organized 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the head of a Russian delegation looking into the  
Bank of New York case said Thursday in Washington that U.S. 
officials have not provided any evidence of the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many newspapers make references to reliable sources at the  
FBI, the Department of the Treasury or other institutions. I feel 
obliged to say that the information obtained from those `sources' 
has not been confirmed in any way,'' Viktor Ivanov, deputy director 
of the Federal Security Service, told the ITAR-Tass news agency in 
Washington. He was there with a delegation investigating the case. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin's government has been on the defensive  
following media reports about the alleged scheme. The reports have 
also said that the Russian government may have mishandled money 
loaned by the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, who was in London,  
said Thursday that the allegations were part of a campaign to 
discredit Russia. Russia has been making progress in the fight 
against capital flight, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	James Harmon, the visiting chairman of the U.S. Export Import  
Bank, told a news conference in Moscow that he agreed with 
Kasyanov's view. ``I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't largely 
capital flight,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> City, County Try To Save A's Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- City and county officials, trying to  
rescue the proposed $122.4 million sale of the Oakland Athletics, 
planned to ask the team owners to extend Monday's deadline for 
closing the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Alameda County Supervisor Mary King, a member of the Joint  
Powers Authority overseeing the Oakland Coliseum complex, also said 
public officials were meeting Thursday with their lawyers to 
discuss major league baseball's decision to delay action on the 
team's sale. 
</P>
<P>
	That decision has left the deal all but dead. King said the  
meeting with lawyers was to ``strategize'' and wouldn't say whether 
legal action was contemplated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just getting ready to meet with our lawyers to see if  
there's some place we can be, something we can do between now and 
the drop-dead date,'' King said. 
</P>
<P>
	Club president Michael Crowley, meanwhile, said current team  
owners Steve Schott and Ken Hofmann would consider granting an 
extension to the prospective buyers, a group led by Modesto 
supermarket magnate Robert Piccinini and former A's executive Andy 
Dolich. 
</P>
<P>
	But Crowley said there were no promises.  
</P>
<P>
	``At that time, when they receive it, Steve and Ken would  
certainly look at that and make the decision they felt was in the 
best interest of the franchise,'' Crowley said. ``They would 
consider granting an extension on its merits. And if there was was 
another opportunity, another group that would purchase the team and 
keep it in Oakland, they would certainly look at that as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball owners shelved the sale Wednesday, voting 28-2 to put  
off action until a task force studying baseball's economic and 
competitive problems in smaller market areas completes its report 
at the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	King criticized baseball's non-action as insulting.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like we've been ripped off,'' she said. ``It was an  
arbitrary decision. I feel angry and frustrated on behalf of the 
community. They changed the rules in the middle of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The non-action essentially killed the proposed sale to the  
Piccinini group, which was worked out over the past six months 
under an agreement between the current team owners and the city and 
county officials. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for putting the club up for sale at a discounted  
price, a deadline was imposed for closing the deal and if it didn't 
go through, Schott and Hofmann would then be free to leave the 
Oakland Coliseum after the 2001 season. There also would be no 
legal entanglements to selling the team to a group that would move 
it elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown spoke with both Hofmann and Schott and  
asked them to grant the extension but both declined to give an 
immediate answer, according to Stacey Wells, the mayor's 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't say yes and they didn't say no,'' Wells said.  
``But the mayor is committed to doing everything he can possibly do 
to make sure the A's stay in Oakland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the unsettled atmosphere over the team's ownership and  
sale, Crowley said he and other employees were committed to a 
``business-as-usual'' approach in running the team, a surprise 
wild-card contender this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``From day one, we've been running the organization as if it and  
us are going to be here in Oakland for a very long time,'' Crowley 
said. ``What Ken and Steve ultimately decide is up to them. 
</P>
<P>
	``But for us, it's business as usual. I think that's only fair,  
for ourselves and for our fans because if you stopped doing what 
you're supposed to be doing, you're doing everybody a disservice.''

<HEADLINE> Widow of Redskins Owner Convicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Marlene Kent Cooke, widow of Washington  
Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke, has been convicted a second time of 
driving under the influence of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	A District of Columbia jury returned the verdict Wednesday after  
two days of deliberations. Mrs. Cooke was released pending 
sentencing Nov. 4; she could face a year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Cooke was pulled over in November when a U.S. Park Police  
officer said he spotted her driving without her lights on. Officer 
Jerry Muller testified that Mrs. Cooke's perfume scent was so 
strong that ``my suspicion was aroused'' that she might be trying 
to hide evidence of drinking. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers testified that she could not walk a straight line or  
balance on one leg. Her lawyers blamed her 4-inch heels. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense argued that she had had just a little wine and was a  
victim of her own celebrity. Seven police cars turned out for what 
Mrs. Cooke's lawyer said was a routine traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
	She was convicted of driving under the influence in 1994 after  
her car hit a motorcycle outside a night club. A few months earlier 
she was stopped for driving through Georgetown with a man sprawled 
across the hood of her Jaguar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Immigration and Naturalization Service is trying to deport  
Mrs. Cooke to her native Bolivia because of a 1986 conviction on a 
cocaine conspiracy charge.

<HEADLINE> CDC: Food Poisoning Sickens Millions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- In the country considered to have the world's  
safest food supply, 76 million people are sickened, 325,000 are 
hospitalized and 5,000 die each year from food poisoning, according 
to new federal figures. 
</P>
<P>
	``These numbers confirm that the number of illnesses and deaths  
from contaminated food in the U.S. is unacceptably high,'' said 
Caroline Smith Dewaal of the Consumer Advocacy Center for Science 
in the Public Interest. ``Consumers play a lottery every day when 
they eat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Past reports estimated that foodborne diseases kill 9,000  
Americans and sicken 33 million each year. The latest figures were 
released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the difference between these estimates are due to the  
fact that we have better information for which to base the 
estimates. They do not reflect change,'' said Dr. Paul Mead, a CDC 
medical epidemiologist. 
</P>
<P>
	The more accurate estimates will help guide prevention efforts  
and assess the effectiveness of food safety regulations, the CDC 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation is facing new challenges in fighting contamination as  
the number of food imports increase, Americans eat out more and eat 
more processed food involving more people and more preparation, the 
CDC said. All increase the chance for disease-producing, 
food-handling errors. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the number of people most vulnerable to foodborne  
disease, such as the elderly and people with weakened immune 
systems, is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton is pushing a $72 million food safety  
initiative that would increase the number of inspectors and checks 
of high-risk food products in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Food Processors Association said the more reliable  
data will help the industry determine where food safety risks lie. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deficiencies with factual statistics related to food safety  
and foodborne illness have been a persistent problem that has 
impeded research and made it difficult to conduct accurate risk 
assessments,'' the association said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. DeWaal's group and other consumer advocates say what's  
needed is a single food-safety agency. Today, 12 agencies oversee 
food-safety questions. Most are handled by the Agriculture 
Department, which is in charge of meat and poultry and certain 
fresh produce issues, and the Food and Drug Administration, which 
oversees most other foods. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a single-food safety agency with a farm-to-table  
mission to reduce foodborne illness and death,'' Ms. DeWaal said. 
``The improvements that have been made so far aren't enough.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Barclays Closes Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Barclays Bank plans to close the accounts of some  
of its Russian offshore customers following allegations that 
Russian gangsters laundered billions of dollars through a U.S. 
bank, according to published reports on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank is examining all the Russian offshore accounts and if  
it cannot receive satisfactory assurances on ownership and use of 
any of the accounts, it will close them, according to reports in 
the Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	``A meaningful percentage'' of the accounts so far faced  
closure, Barclays group risk director Alan Brown was quoted as 
saying. ``It is now very hard to be certain who owns these accounts 
or what the transactions are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged money-laundering scheme involves as much as $10  
billion purportedly laundered through the Bank of New York, the 
15th-largest bank in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	French investigators have opened a related inquiry into a French  
bank for its management of funds from Russia's Central Bank, 
including money loaned by the International Monetary Fund. Austrian 
police reportedly are also looking into possible links between an 
Austrian bank and alleged money laundering by Russian organized 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the head of a Russian delegation looking into the  
Bank of New York case said Thursday in Washington that U.S. 
officials have not provided any evidence of the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many newspapers make references to reliable sources at the  
FBI, the Department of the Treasury or other institutions. I feel 
obliged to say that the information obtained from those `sources' 
has not been confirmed in any way,'' Viktor Ivanov, deputy director 
of the Federal Security Service, told the ITAR-Tass news agency in 
Washington. He was there with a delegation investigating the case. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin's government has been on the defensive  
following media reports about the alleged scheme. The reports have 
also said that the Russian government may have mishandled money 
loaned by the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, who was in London,  
said Thursday that the allegations were part of a campaign to 
discredit Russia. Russia has been making progress in the fight 
against capital flight, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	James Harmon, the visiting chairman of the U.S. Export Import  
Bank, told a news conference in Moscow that he agreed with 
Kasyanov's view. ``I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't largely 
capital flight,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies Sign Forward Grant Long </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The Vancouver Grizzlies  
continued to bolster their roster this offseason, signing free 
agent forward Grant Long to a three-year, $6.6 million contract 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver previously signed swingman Dennis Scott and acquired  
four players in the trade for rookie Steve Francis, the No. 2 
overall pick in this year's NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be nice to see that seed blossom. I want to be  
there when it happens because I think the potential is there,'' 
Long said. ``It's going to be nice, if you will, to be able to be 
some of the water that helps that seed grow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long, entering his 12th season, chose to sign with the Grizzlies  
over a number of other teams, including the Wizards, who also made 
him a similar offer under the NBA free agent exemption. In the end, 
Long turned down Washington because he saw more potential in the 
Grizzlies, who have yet to win more than 19 games in a season over 
their four-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a number of offers that I had,'' Long said. ``I was  
either looking at a championship situation or a situation where I 
think I would be best utilized and possibly bringing a young team 
on, getting them to a point where they are ready to take the next 
step. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw that as a challenge to me in coming to Vancouver.''  
</P>
<P>
	Long, an 11-year NBA veteran, averaged 9.8 points and 5.9  
rebounds while playing in all 50 regular-season games for the 
Atlanta Hawks last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old will bolster the Grizzlies' frontcourt, along  
with recent acquisitions Othella Harrington and Antoine Carr, who 
came over from the Houston Rockets in the trade for Francis. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing alongside second-year point guard Mike Bibby and forward  
Shareef Abdur-Rahim, with whom he works out in a Marietta, Ga., 
health club during the offseason, Long saw only an upside in moving 
to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a very good young nucleus,'' Long said. ``They have  
the ability and the talent. It just has to be harnessed in the 
right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long was chosen 33rd overall in the 1988 NBA draft by the  
expansion Miami Heat, where he spent eight seasons. He also played 
for the Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Miami, we lost so consistently that it left a bad taste in  
our mouth,'' he said. ``I think they (the Grizzlies) are at that 
point where they are ready to take the next step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies were excited about adding a veteran and depth to  
their roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that it finishes off our ballclub very nicely,''  
Grizzlies president and general manager Stu Jackson said. ``It 
wasn't something that was an easy decision for him, simply because 
there were other teams that wanted him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he felt that at the end of the day, this was the team  
that was going in a positive direction and a team that he could add 
a great deal to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-9, 250-pound forward has appeared in 788 NBA  
regular-season games and 34 playoff games.

<HEADLINE> Peter Paying Dividends for Giants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Giving Christian Peter a second  
chance is starting to pay big dividends for the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only have the Giants found a usable defensive lineman, Peter  
is pushing Robert Harris for his starting left tackle spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter had an outstanding game filling in for an injured Harris  
last week. The play everybody noticed was his 38-yard fumble return 
for a touchdown, a play on which he bear-hugged the ball all the 
way to the end zone. But his play against the run was even better 
as New York limited the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to 77 yards in a 17-13 
win. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter laughs a lot about the touchdown. He has taken a lot of  
grief about it from teammates and even his brother, Jason, who 
plays for the Carolina Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	After Jason saw Christian rumble down the field with both arms  
wrapped around the ball on a highlight film, he didn't hesitate to 
call him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just told me I looked slower than I did when I returned the  
one at Nebraska 95 yards,'' Christian Peter said. ``It was just a 
very fortunate play. Jessie (Armstead) made an unbelievable play 
and it bounced into my hands. Anybody could have done it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peter's road to the end zone was a lot longer than 38 yards,  
though. 
</P>
<P>
	It started more than 2 1/2 years ago when the Giants made a  
controversial decision to sign Peter as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	A New Jersey native, he had been drafted in the fifth round by  
New England in April 1996. He was released a few days later when 
the team took some flak because of his off-the-field problems. 
</P>
<P>
	During his college years, Peter was arrested for a variety of  
offenses, including a third-degree sexual assault. He also was the 
defendant in a civil suit in which a former Nebraska coed alleged 
Peter twice raped her. 
</P>
<P>
	Since joining the Giants in January 1997, Peter participated in  
a rehabilitation program that included substance abuse and 
psychological counseling, treatment for attention deficit disorder 
and a program to complete his undergraduate degree. 
</P>
<P>
	Entering his third season, Peter's game is improving. After  
making only two tackles in 1997, he had 32 last year along with a 
sack and forced fumble. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not easy, sitting out a year. Talk to anyone who did  
that,'' Peter said Thursday after the Giants finished practice for 
Sunday's game against the Washington Redskins. ``Just getting back 
into the swing of things is never easy. I think I am doing all 
right, but there is so much room for improvement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive line coach Denny Marcin said Peter played very well  
against the Bucs. He had two tackles in addition to the touchdown 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was real stout against the run,'' Marcin said, adding that  
Peter is creating more competition for playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the coach noted no starter loses his job because of  
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going out there and doing my thing,'' Peter said.  
``Robert is an unbelievable football player. When he is healthy, he 
is pretty unstoppable. I have to be ready when the time comes to 
step in and play again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The way the Giants rotate their defensive linemen, Peter is  
going to get some more chances against the Redskins.

<HEADLINE> Rubin To Chair Community Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said  
Thursday that he will head a New York-based group that fights 
poverty and is also actively considering a return to Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, who left the Clinton administration in July, will become  
chairman of the Local Initiatives Support Corp., a group that 
arranges financial backing for hundreds of community development 
corporations around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	As a member of the Clinton administration, Rubin often  
championed economic development initiatives for depressed areas, 
and he said he was excited about his new job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Long before I joined government, I believed it was crucial to  
our success as a nation and critical to our ability to succeed in 
the global economy, to bring residents of distressed urban and 
rural areas into the economic mainstream,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, President Clinton praised his former Treasury  
secretary, saying his new position was ``consistent with his 
longstanding commitment to bring economic opportunities to 
America's most underserved communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, one of the wealthiest members of Clinton's Cabinet, spent  
26 years on Wall Street, rising to become chairman of Goldman 
Sachs. 
</P>
<P>
	He said while he had been talking to a number of people, he had  
not made a decision yet on just what job he might take upon his 
return to Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``I probably will like to get re-involved in the financial world  
in a serious way, but who and what, I haven't made a decision 
yet,'' Rubin told reporters during a telephone conference call. He 
said one of the reasons he wants to do so is to remain engaged in 
global financial issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be usefully involved in the debate on international  
financial issues, I need to be engaged'' in the private sector, 
Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rubin, who was widely viewed on Wall Street as one of the  
most effective Treasury secretaries in the nation's history, 
refused to answer any questions about world economic developments 
since he left office, including the recent sharp decline in the 
value of the dollar against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Local Initiatives Support Corp. is headquartered in New York  
and has 41 offices around the nation. Since its founding in 1979, 
it has raised $3 billion to support the work of local community 
development corporations, non-profit groups that promote economic 
development in distressed areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, it channeled $605 million to help the local groups  
build affordable housing and provide such services as child care, 
education and health care. 
</P>
<P>
	As board chairman, Rubin will succeed John P. Mascotte, the  
organization's chairman for the past 11 years.

<HEADLINE> Agency Wins Anti-Smoking Account </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A group led by the Boston advertising agency  
Arnold Communications has been chosen to create a nationwide 
anti-smoking campaign, using money from last year's huge settlement 
with the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The account is worth between $150 million and $225 million a  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The money for the account comes from the American Legacy  
Foundation, which was set up from the money won by 46 states in a 
$206 billion settlement with the tobacco industry in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation's goal is to find advertising agencies to create  
advertising campaigns and educational programs to discourage 
Americans from smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	American Legacy spokesman Bill Furmanski said Arnold won the  
account because of its experience with anti-smoking advertising, 
and its creative approach. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold had created anti-smoking ads that went up on thousands of  
billboards in Massachusetts and 17 other states as part of the 
tobacco settlement. Under that agreement, states took over 
billboard leases earlier this year that had been held by tobacco 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold also set up a Web site, www.getoutraged.com, that allowed  
people to vent frustrations and share personal stories about the 
damage caused by smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold received widespread notice for its 1995 ``Drivers  
Wanted'' campaign for Volkswagen, which was valued at $110 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The company was notified Wednesday afternoon that it had beaten  
out two other finalists, The Richards Group of Dallas and Messner 
Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer/Euro RSCG of New York.

puffed up with news that Dick Van Dyke will be attending its ``Cold 
Turkey'' reunion. 
</P>

	The movie, starring Van Dyke, Tom Poston and Jean Stapleton, was  
filmed largely in Greenfield, a town of about 2,000 people 50 miles 
southwest of Des Moines. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Dick Van Dyke coming, it's going to be fantastic,'' said  
Jennifer Van Nostrand, an organizer of the celebration.

<HEADLINE> Rodham Brothers Asked To Scrap Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House has urged President Clinton's  
brothers-in-law to abandon a business deal in the former Soviet 
republic of Georgia, after an opponent of Georgian President Eduard 
Shevardnadze tried to use that deal for his own political 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, told Hugh and  
Tony Rodham earlier this month that their efforts to establish 
walnut and tea processing businesses in western Georgia were 
``being misrepresented as somehow reflecting a change in U.S. 
policy,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Berger ... suggested that, all things considered, that  
they should withdraw from this,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rodhams, brothers of first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton,  
spent eight days in Georgia in late August, looking into 
investments in Batumi, capital of the Ajaria region. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ajaria area's local political boss, Aslan Abashidze, issued  
a statement a few days after the visit suggesting that the Rodhams' 
presence in the region represented ``political support rendered to 
him by U.S. President Bill Clinton,'' the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shevardnadze's government informed the Clinton administration  
about the visit only a few days beforehand. Once in Georgia, the 
Rodhams visited Shevardnadze in the nation's capital, Tbilisi, 
before heading to Batumi. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, declined to comment,  
deferring to Lockhart's remarks.

<HEADLINE>  Jets Not Giving Up Despite Injuries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Already stunned by their early-season  
misfortune, the New York Jets would be absolutely shocked if it 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
	They fully expect to win, even with five starters and a super  
sub out of Sunday's game at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	Where does such faith come from?  
</P>
<P>
	``Bill has won with less in the past than he has now,'' Wayne  
Chrebet said Wednesday, referring to coach Bill Parcells. ``He 
might not have the greatest talent in the league, and he still 
might take it to the Super Bowl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After losing in the AFC championship game in January, the Jets  
set their sights on the Super Bowl this year. But with Chrebet 
(broken foot), Vinny Testaverde (torn Achilles' tendon), Otis Smith 
(collarbone), Eric Green (pinched nerve in the neck), Jason 
Ferguson (knee and ankle) and Leon Johnson (knee) all sidelined, 
such a goal seems absurd. 
</P>
<P>
	Not to the Jets, who lost their opener to New England.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the injuries knocked us out by any means,''  
Chrebet said as he balanced himself on crutches. ``The people who 
say that, they're wrong. We have a lot of talent on this team. We 
lost our leader, Vinny, and Leon for the season, but the other guys 
will be back. I'll be back. And there are a lot of guys here who 
can do the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big man upstairs won't let it happen,'' he added, again  
talking about Parcells, who has stressed to his team this week just 
how early it is in the season. ``If there is anyone with that look 
on his face ... he'll put an end to it. In his speeches, he makes 
sure guys know we did not come here to fold our tent after one 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Jets don't get going quickly, however, all the speeches  
and all the brave talk won't matter. They play at Buffalo, are home 
against Washington, journey to Denver and then are home for 
Jacksonville in the next four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll get back Chrebet in five or six weeks. Smith should  
return by the Denver game, while Ferguson also should be back that 
soon. Green believes he will play this weekend, but Parcells listed 
him as out. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless, the Jets refuse to count themselves out.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can't believe that,'' Smith said, ``and I don't believe  
Bill has to express that to us. As a competitive person, you always 
try to find a way to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not feel sorry for this team and what happened in Week  
1. You can't dwell on it, or our season will be really long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With such a long injury list, particularly on offense, the  
defense knows it might have to take on an extra burden. Safety 
Victor Green believes his unit will respond this week -- then keep 
on responding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've got to play better, first and foremost,'' he  
said. ``But nothing is over. Are they saying that every team that 
lost a game last week, that their season is over? I'm sure those 
teams don't think anything is over. Neither do we.''

<HEADLINE> Fen-Phen Case Settled for $23M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANTON, Texas (AP) -- A Texas woman who blamed the diet drug  
combination fen-phen for her heart damage has agreed to settle a 
lawsuit against the manufacturer for a fraction of the $23.3 
million a jury awarded her. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the settlement Thursday came on the same day as reports  
that the company -- American Home Products Corp. -- is close to 
settling most of the thousands of diet pill lawsuits filed against 
it for at least $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home made fenfluramine, the ``fen'' in the fen-phen  
combination and gave the drug a brand name of Pondimin. It also 
made Pondimin's chemical cousin Redux. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Texas case, Debbie Lovett, 36, of Grand Saline, blamed  
American Home and subsidiary Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories for damage 
she suffered after taking fen-phen for more than three months 
starting in October 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lovett's attorney Kip Petroff would not disclose the amount  
of the settlement, but said the deal was reached after considering 
state law that caps monetary awards in civil suits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The amount of the settlement was significantly less than the  
amount of the verdict, but the amount of the settlement is more 
than 90 percent of what we thought would be awarded after all of 
the evidence was considered and after the statutory cap on punitive 
damages was applied as required by law,'' Petroff said. 
</P>
<P>
	AHP spokesman Doug Petkus went a bit further in discussing the  
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the amount is confidential, American Home Products can  
confirm it totaled less than 10 percent of the amount returned by 
the jury,'' Petkus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of fen-phen cases have been filed across the nation,  
but Ms. Lovett's lawsuit was the first to reach a jury. Jurors last 
month found the company was fully liable for Ms. Lovett's ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products marketed Pondimin and Redux until  
September 1997. That was when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
pushed for their withdrawal after a Mayo Clinic study linked the 
drugs to potentially fatal heart valve damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Fenfluramine had been sold since the 1970s but became widely  
used in the 1990s when doctors prescribed it in combination with 
another drug, phentermine. When taken alone, phentermine never was 
associated with health problems. It remains on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the larger settlement, two newspapers reported Thursday  
that final details were being worked out and the deal could be 
announced as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Star-Ledger of Newark said the settlement could exceed $5  
billion, and would resolve more than 4,100 lawsuits brought by 
8,000 people. The Wall Street Journal said the settlement would be 
about $3 billion. Both reports cited anonymous sources. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home officials refused to comment on the possibility of  
a wide-ranging settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Star-Ledger reported that the company's offer includes  
payments to patients harmed by the diet drugs, along with follow-up 
medical examinations for millions of other users. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal said those who feel the agreement is inadequate  
could opt out and pursue cases on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	The Star-Ledger said unresolved issues on Wednesday included the  
structure of the payout and the terms of a side deal with 
plaintiffs in New Jersey, where a civil trial is under way over 
whether the Madison N.J.-based drug maker should be liable for the 
cost of future medical checkups. 
</P>
<P>
	The pending settlement would cover individual lawsuits and  
class-action suits certified in eight states, the newspaper said. 
It would need a federal judge's approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Journal reported that the FBI is probing whether  
the American Home revealed all it knew about dangers of Redux prior 
to its approval by the government in 1996. The company denied 
knowing about any such inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home's stock has languished in recent months largely  
due to uncertainty about how much it will have to pay to resolve 
the diet drug lawsuits.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Flattens B.C. Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ENDICOTT, N.Y. (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd's fury was just  
far-reaching enough today to force postponement of the first round 
of the B.C. Open at mid-morning. 
</P>
<P>
	A steady rain began pelting the course shortly before 9 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we didn't have a chance to play today,'' said Arvin  
Ginn, tournament director for the PGA. ``Our meteorologists let us 
know that we're going to have what we have now the rest of the 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ginn said, weather permitting, play would resume at 8 a.m.  
Friday and an attempt will be made to play the full 72 holes 
through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is our ultimate goal,'' Ginn said. ``It's very realistic.  
The only thing that would hinder that are things we're not in 
control of -- what happens tonight. Then, none of it will work. If 
these scenarios don't work, Monday is in an option.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The forecast for Friday was for showers and breezy conditions in  
the morning, and sunshine breaking through in the afternoon. Sunny 
days were expected on the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Sauers, who hasn't won on tour in a decade, was alone atop  
the leader board at 3-under-par. He had played five holes when play 
was halted. 
</P>
<P>
	The rain turned into a blessing for local favorite Mike Hulbert,  
who was born in nearby Elmira and won the B.C. Open a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	When Hulbert called the B.C. Open office to find out his tee  
time on Thursday morning, he learned he was not registered for the 
tournament. That was quickly rectified. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Lehman, a member of the U.S. Ryder Cup team, was simply  
disappointed. With the all-important competition just a week away, 
rain was not what he wanted to see. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to play,'' said Lehman, who was at even par after  
four holes. ``The reason I'm here is I want to compete. I just hope 
we don't have one of those bizarre weeks.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Ozone Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Citing evidence that the hole in the ozone  
layer is shrinking, President Clinton on Thursday offered the 
Senate an amendment to a 1989 treaty on reducing ozone-damaging 
chemicals. He urged Congress to fund initiatives to continue that 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton offered an amendment to the Montreal Protocol on  
Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, a 165-nation pact reached 
in 1989. Two weeks ago, scientists credited the Montreal Protocol 
with shrinking the ozone hole, currently estimated at 3.09 million 
square miles, about the size of the European continent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozone is the protective layer that blocks damaging ultraviolet  
rays. Reductions in ozone lets the rays in, and too much exposure 
to ultraviolet radiation can cause skin cancer and destroy the 
tiniest plants in the food chain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scientists report that the ozone layer is on its way to  
recovery,'' Clinton said in a statement. ``The amendment I transmit 
today builds on this progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton urged Congress to approve funding for the Montreal  
Protocol Fund, saying it is critical that the United States support 
efforts in developing nations to phase out use of ozone-depleting 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regrettably, appropriations measures now before Congress would  
deny funds I have requested for the Montreal Protocol Fund,'' 
Clinton said. ``I call on Congress to approve the funds needed to 
help preserve the Earth's protective ozone layer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The World Meteorological Organization estimates ozone levels  
would be noticeably higher in about 20 years, with full recovery 
expected around the year 2050.

<HEADLINE> Production Rises Again in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American industry continues to pick up speed  
as overseas markets revive, with output at factories, mines and 
utility plants up 0.3 percent in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in industrial production reported Thursday by the  
Federal Reserve is the seventh in a string of monthly rises that 
began in February after output had declined in 1998 to the slowest 
pace in five years. In July, industrial output rose 0.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The booming domestic economy is supporting activity and more  
recently, manufacturers are getting a boost from improved exports 
to a rebounding global economy,'' said economist Mark Zandi of 
Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. ``There's a 
clear, improving trend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Production last month was 2.5 percent above August 1998.  
</P>
<P>
	At factories alone, output increased 0.4 percent last month,  
after a 0.6 percent increase in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers led that advance, as production of motor vehicles and  
parts surged by 8.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Factories making other products, including computers and  
chemicals, also increased their output, offsetting declines in a 
few sectors, among them household appliances, construction supplies 
and industrial equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Output by utilities fell by 1.6 percent in August, but that  
decline was expected as summer began to wane and use of electricity 
for air conditioners dropped. During a hot dry July, utility 
production had risen 2.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Mining output in August rose 0.6 percent, after a 0.9 percent  
increase in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month's increase in production meant American industry was  
operating at 80.8 percent of total capacity, up slightly from 80.7 
percent in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists say that's further evidence that markets for U.S.  
exports are strengthening as other countries recover from a 
widespread economic crisis that began in Asia in mid-1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say U.S. industrial activity remains well below levels  
that can cause worries about production bottlenecks that can lead 
to inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Federal Reserve has been concerned that as global  
demand for American products recovers, it could overheat a U.S. 
economy already warmed up by domestic consumers. Encouraged by low 
unemployment and a booming stock market, Americans are on a buying 
spree. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately on Thursday, the Labor Department said new claims for  
unemployment benefits remain very low. In the week that ended 
Saturday, 288,000 Americans filed first-time claims for 
unemployment benefits, down by 4,000 from the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	A four-week moving average of jobless claims, which analysts  
watch more closely, changed little, falling by just 250 to 288,750. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists consider jobless claims levels below 300,000 an  
indication of an extremely tight labor market. Claims have hovered 
below that mark for eight consecutive weeks, and have not strayed 
far above it all year. 
</P>
<P>
	That's good for workers, but economists worry that employers may  
feel pressure to raise wages and benefits, which could drive up 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates twice this year as  
pre-emptive strikes against possible inflation, although consumer 
prices have remained tame. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the government said the core inflation rate of 1.9  
percent for the 12 months ended in August is the lowest in 33 
years. That rate doesn't include volatile food and energy prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's unemployment rate in August was at a 29-year low of  
4.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Feds Probe GM Wipers, Air Bags </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal safety agency is investigating  
hundreds of consumer complaints that windshield wipers are prone to 
failure on nearly 1.5 million cars built by General Motors Corp. 
and Ford Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also said, in  
a report released Thursday, that it is upgrading an investigation 
into 61 complaints of air bags deploying inadvertently in some GM 
cars to study the engineering of the air bag systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorists claimed to have 38 injuries from the air bags suddenly  
bursting open on Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, Buick Regal and 
Pontiac Grand Prix cars from the 1995 and 1996 model years. Nearly 
600,000 of the cars are on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 300 consumers complained that windshield wipers failed  
on Pontiac Grand Prix, Buick Century, Buick Regal or Oldsmobile 
Intrigue cars from the 1997 and 1998 model years, the report said. 
There are about 900,000 of those cars on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	The windshield wipers especially seemed to fail during cold  
weather, the report said. One crash was reported. Motorists have 
more than 17,000 warranty claims on the GM windshield wiper 
systems, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 470 motorists claim the windshield wipers failed  
intermittently or completely on their 1993 Ford Taurus or Mercury 
Sable cars. There are about 555,000 cars from the 1993 model year 
on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some cases, the (car) owner alleges having to leave the  
roadway or roll down the window and manually restart the sweeping 
motion of the wiper arms,'' the report said. Other motorists said 
the wipers sweep too slowly. The agency offered no information on 
warranty claims on the Ford wipers. 
</P>
<P>
	No crashes were reported.  
</P>
<P>
	The agency already has an ongoing investigation into complaints  
of windshield wiper failures on some 1997 through 1999 model Ford 
Explorer and Mercury Mountaineer sport utility vehicles. There are 
nearly 1.5 million of those vehicles on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	In the investigation into GM air bags, motorists claimed the  
driver-side air bag or both front-seat air bags inflated without 
the car crashing or hitting any object. All but six complaints 
involved just the driver's air bag. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, GM recalled nearly 1 million cars with air bags that  
could burst open without an accident. About 863,000 GM Chevrolet 
Cavaliers and Pontiac Sunfires from the 1996 and 1997 model years 
were recalled, along with 103,000 Cadillac DeVille, Concours, 
Eldorado and Seville cars from model year 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	NHTSA opens any safety investigation with a preliminary inquiry  
in which the government and manufacturer exchange paperwork 
including any complaints. The investigation then could be upgraded 
to an engineering analysis, during which engineers study parts to 
see if they are defective, as in the GM and Ford cases. An 
investigation can lead to a recall.

<HEADLINE> Payback Sought for Nuclear Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration will ask Congress  
to compensate thousands of workers who became ill from radiation 
during the Cold War years at a federal uranium plant in Kentucky, 
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson announced the proposal before flying to Paducah, Ky.,  
to talk with plant workers and community leaders. The plan 
eventually might cover employees at two uranium-processing plants 
in Ohio and Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	The payout to current and past workers at the Paducah Gaseous  
Diffusion Plant could cost as much as $20 million, depending on the 
number of workers covered, said a government official familiar with 
the plan. The amount to be sought from Congress has not been 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson also will ask Congress for $21.8 million for expanded  
medical monitoring, exposure assessments and accelerated cleanup at 
the plants in Paducah, Piketon, Ohio, and Oak Ridge, Tenn. Each 
processes, or enriches, uranium for use in reactors or when highly 
enriched, for nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson apologized to current and former workers at the  
Paducah plant Thursday, saying the government was not forthcoming 
about the possibility of exposure to toxic plutonium there. 
</P>
<P>
	``On behalf of the United States government, I am here to say  
I'm sorry,'' he said during a town hall meeting with about 300 
people. ``I'm apologizing to the workers at Paducah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For years, Paducah employees have complained about an increased  
number of cancers linked, they believe, to radiation exposure 
suffered while working with uranium they did not know was laced 
with plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
	The exposure occurred over more than two decades beginning in  
the 1950s. Some excessive radiation exposures may have occurred 
into the 1990s, according to one lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Plutonium is found in used reactor fuel and is a key ingredient  
in nuclear bombs. It is highly radioactive and can cause cancer if 
ingested, even in minute amounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department now acknowledges that some plutonium was  
in the uranium dust to which the Paducah workers routinely were 
exposed from the mid-1950s to the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	The compensation plan and additional funds for monitoring and  
faster cleanup reflects ``my commitment to address concerns about 
environmental, safety and health issues at the gaseous diffusion 
plants,'' Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	If approved by Congress, the plan would provide money to current  
and former Paducah plant employees for lost wages and health 
benefits if the workers can show they developed certain cancers 
related to exposure to plutonium-laced uranium. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials described it as a ``pilot program'' that may be  
expanded to the Ohio and Tennessee plants if further investigations 
show workers became ill from such exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	By March, the government is expected to complete an  
investigation into whether exposure to plutonium at those plants 
was as extensive as at Paducah, and whether workers in Ohio and 
Tennessee should be compensated. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the department said an investigation at the  
Paducah plant found ``no imminent hazard'' to current workers. But 
the review said there were still ``weaknesses'' and shortcomings in 
programs that are supposed to monitor and shield workers from harm. 
</P>
<P>
	The review recommended that Paducah plant managers pay more  
attention to potential radiation exposure and that radiation 
controls be tightened. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paducah compensation plan is similar to one announced in  
July for nuclear weapons plant workers exposed to beryllium, a 
chemical used as a strengthening alloy in atomic weapons. That plan 
was estimated to cost $13 million over 10 years; it awaits 
congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department until recently refused to acknowledge that  
workers' health problems, including increased incidents of cancer, 
were linked to work at the weapons plants. Richardson said he was 
committed to addressing the health and environmental concerns 
involving both the gaseous diffusion plants and worker exposure to 
beryllium. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Rep. Ted Strickland, D-Ohio, said refusing to expand the  
compensation plan to cover the plant in his district was 
``unjustified.''

<HEADLINE> Bahamaian Homes Flattened in Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARSH HARBOUR, Bahamas (AP) -- At ground zero of Hurricane  
Floyd's assault on the Bahamas, residents reeling from the fury 
negotiated an obstacle course of downed power lines, twisted 
utility poles and flooded streets to reach what remains of their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	As international and Bahamian relief workers organized aid,  
locals in Abaco pondered the miserable prospect of weeks without 
power, phones, or water. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything's ruined. Everything!'' lamented Elisabeth Jean  
Nasse, about to wade through an ankle-deep, hurricane-produced moat 
surrounding her now roofless home. A water line showed her house 
had been 10 feet under water. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, a flash of perspective: ``At least no one died.''  
</P>
<P>
	It was a refrain repeated by residents Thursday as they balanced  
soaked mattresses on car roofs to dry. Clothes washed of mud 
littered every free space, laid out on the flattened ruins of some 
houses, fluttering from uprooted trees and car windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The 700-island archipelago did report one presumed death: that  
of a Freeport man swept out to sea from Grand Bahama Island as he 
tried to beat the storm home. There were no reports of critical 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Bahamians had heeded storm warnings and stayed out of harm's way  
inside churches and government buildings turned into shelters. 
Hundreds remained in them Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of wooden homes were flattened or otherwise damaged in  
Abaco, Eleuthera and Cat islands, which took direct hits in the 
storm's rampage with 145 mph winds through here Tuesday. Sand 
blanketed places where coastal villages once stood, boats were 
smashed, sunken and beached. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our boat lived up to its name,'' Ellie De Weese said of her  
38-foot Warrior II. ``It stayed afloat in all that mess,'' she said 
pointing to one of a dozen torn up docks and sunken sailboats in 
Marsh Harbour, capital of Great Abaco. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Abaco residents reported seeing tornadoes. Two houses in  
the southern settlement of Casuarina looked like they had been 
bombed, reduced to piles of lumber and a jumble of broken 
furniture. Strangely, china left out to dry on a dishwashing rack 
remained intact. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Russell, commander of the Bahamas National Disaster  
Organization, said two Royal Bahamas Defense Force boats began 
ferrying donated supplies to Abaco and Eleuthera on Thursday. The 
American Red Cross and other private groups were standing by to 
ship emergency supplies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourists stranded by Floyd sat at airports in hopes of getting  
out. Many chartered flights from Florida to pick them up. In Grand 
Bahama, Freeport's international airport was closed because of 
flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nassau, Michael Dean and his wife, Jean, holding their  
3-month-old son, sat on Long Wharf in view of two barges chucked up 
onto the beach by storm surges and watched the sun go down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank God, we are all right. Thank God, no one died. And thank  
God, Gert is not coming,'' he said, putting his arm around his wife 
and referring to the next hurricane blowing in from the Atlantic.

<HEADLINE> Student's Electoral Victory Tainted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- A Yale University junior majoring in  
ethics and politics is getting a real-life lesson in both -- his win 
in a city Democratic primary has been tainted by allegations of 
voter fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Asit Gosar, who also is majoring in economics, beat four-term  
incumbent Esther Armmand for the 7th Ward aldermanic seat Tuesday 
by a 298-269 vote. A win in the primary in this heavily Democratic 
city usually guarantees the winner a seat on the Board of Aldermen. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gosar didn't have long to savor his victory. On Wednesday,  
the campus newspaper, the Yale Daily News, reported that 20 
students who do not live in the 7th Ward voted in the primary after 
being recruited by Gosar's campaign workers. The ward encompasses 
downtown and two of Yale's residential colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosar, 21, did not return telephone messages left at his  
dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not unusual for a Yale student to be elected to New  
Haven's Board of Alderman. Several have been elected in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon Ferrucci, the Democratic Registrar of Voters in New Haven  
for the past 10 years, said that as far as she knows, the issue of 
student residency had never been raised before. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people register, no one is sworn, but they're signing  
their name that everything on their voter card is true,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Armmand, 54, the director of prevention  
services and community relations at Alcohol Services Organization 
of South Central Connecticut Inc., successfully contested the 
voting rights of four Yale graduates who had registered to vote in 
absentia in the ward, though they no longer lived there. 
</P>
<P>
	Contacted Wednesday, Armmand said she had not decided whether to  
challenge the election. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I'm doing today is evaluating the information and based  
upon that, I'll determine the proper course to take in the next 
couple of days,'' she said. ``You expect people to do the right 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armmand has 14 days to challenge the race in court. If a judge  
finds voter fraud, the election results could be set aside, and 
another election ordered. 
</P>
<P>
	Another option for Armmand would be to file a complaint with the  
state Elections Enforcement Commission, which can investigate any 
irregularities and enforce fines if wrongdoing is discovered. 
However, the results would stand. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Yale students who voted for Gosar said they are disturbed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel sort of used. It was my first voting experience. I  
didn't know it was wrong for me to voting in Ward 7, even though my 
freshman dorm's in Ward 2,'' said Melissa Merritt, an 18-year-old 
freshman from Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	However, 20-year-old junior Christine Bonanno of New Haven, who  
worked on Gosar's campaign, said he won a hard-fought election. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there are any complaints, it's up to the Registrar of  
Voters to determine what to do,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> LAPD Investigated Over Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES -- A policeman's conviction for stealing cocaine from  
an evidence locker has exploded into a wide investigation of a 
frame-up, drug dealing and other crimes allegedly covered up by a 
code of silence in the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten officers and a police supervisor have been suspended in two  
internal investigations into corruption within the department. 
</P>
<P>
	And federal authorities announced Thursday they would conduct  
their own investigation into what is believed to be one of the 
biggest corruption scandals in LAPD history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not like to label the LAPD as corruption-prone,''  
Chief Bernard Parks said Wednesday. ``I think we have a small 
number of officers that have chose to in some instances tarnish 
their badge'' 
</P>
<P>
	The police department declined to detail the allegations against  
the suspended officers, but unidentified sources quoted by the Los 
Angeles Times said they are suspected of a variety of crimes, from 
active participation in drug deals to code-of-silence violations 
that allowed delinquent behavior to go unpunished. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, former Officer Rafael A. Perez pleaded guilty to  
stealing eight pounds of cocaine from an evidence locker. As part 
of the plea bargain, he is spilling details and naming names in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez reportedly told investigators that he and former partner  
Nino Durden planted a .22-caliber rifle on the an unarmed illegal 
immigrant after shooting him in October 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old immigrant, Javier Francisco Ovando, was released  
from prison on Thursday, three years after he was shot by police 
officers who authorities believe fabricated evidence used to 
convict him. It was unclear whether he would face a federal 
deportation hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of shakes everything that you believe about in  
everything,'' Ovando's public defender Tamar Toister said. ``The 
system is not supposed to work like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another former partner of Perez's, Officer David Mack, was  
convicted earlier this year of robbing a Bank of America of 
$722,000 in November 1997 and sentenced Monday to more than 14 
years in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Mack went on a spending spree after the bank  
robbery, including a Las Vegas trip with Perez and another officer. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the investigations have targeted the department's Rampart  
Station, which covers an eight-square-mile area just west of 
downtown Los Angeles that is home to many recent immigrants from 
Latin America and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of the community hung a banner Thursday in support of  
officers: ``The community love the men and women of Rampart 
Station.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tomas Domingo, a 70-year-old Filipino-American, said he was  
surprised by the reports of corruption. ``It still doesn't change 
my faith in policemen. Some are good and some are rotten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem throughout law enforcement is a culture that is  
closed and self-protective,'' said Terry L. Cooper, a professor and 
expert on ethics and law enforcement at the University of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	He believes Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard Parks is trying to  
change that but says the chief is bucking tradition that has been 
``sustained and compounded'' for years.

<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Cancer survivor Marie Morris has an  
advantage over other Medicare recipients when it comes to paying 
for prescription drugs. She doesn't have to. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, 84, is a patient at the Church Health Center, a medical  
clinic founded on the simple belief that working people who cannot 
afford insurance deserve affordable health care. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're the people who shine your shoes, cook your food and  
will one day dig your grave,'' said Scott Morris, a physician and 
Methodist minister who founded the center. ``Our attitude is if 
you're willing to clean out our latrines, then when you get sick 
we're going to put you at the front of the line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The center, a nonprofit, nondenominational ministry, relies  
primarily on donations from church congregations, plus work by 
doctors, nurses and other medical professionals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government cannot do the work of the church,'' Morris  
said. ``Our mission is to reclaim the church's biblical and 
historical commitment to care for the poor who are sick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The clinic, which opened in 1987 with a budget of $300,000, now  
sees 30,000 patients a year and has a $5 million budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every major city has something like us, but we're definitely  
the largest clinic like this anywhere,'' Morris said. ``We 
regularly have groups coming in trying to find out how they can 
reproduce the Church Health Center themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regular clinic visits cost $10 to $15, depending on how much  
patients can pay. For that, the clinic provides lab work, X-rays, 
drugs and other support services. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency visits cost $20, and volunteer physicians often  
provide free surgery or other specialty services at their offices 
or area hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Business manager Ann Langston said most of the center's income  
is from donations from more than 175 area churches and their 
members. The center also draws grants from private foundations and 
help from businesses in various medical fields. 
</P>
<P>
	A walk-in, emergency clinic is for working people who cannot  
afford standard medical care, but still are ineligible for public 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	To qualify for care, male patients must be working at least 30  
hours a week and females must work 20 hours a week, unless they 
have small children. There are no work requirements for children or 
the low-income elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're sick today, you don't have any medical insurance and  
you're going to miss work for a week if you have to wait around to 
see a doctor, come to the walk-in clinic,'' said Langston, a lawyer 
who quit private practice to work at the center. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients with no cash are given until their next payday to come  
up with the clinic fee. 
</P>
<P>
	The clinic's five full-time physicians are assisted by six  
full-time nurses. In addition, more than 400 volunteer doctors, 
along with 100 volunteer nurses, each work four or five shifts a 
year, primarily at nights and on the weekends. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have people in every medical subspecialty who volunteer  
their time to care for our patients,'' Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom White, an 81-year-old retired physician, has worked at the  
clinic full-time for seven years without pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got into medicine for this kind of work, and I think, `What  
would I be doing if I didn't come here?''' White said during a 
break from seeing patients. 
</P>
<P>
	He plans to keep working as long as he's in good health, an idea  
his wife Sarah is less than wild about. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes, she'd like to do what other people are doing, going  
to England or seeing the world or things like that,'' White said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, an Atlanta native, said he got the idea for such a  
clinic while studying to become a preacher. 
</P>
<P>
	He wanted to serve the church but not simply from the pulpit.  
After seminary, he went to medical school and then moved to Memphis 
because of its large number of low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the clinic's patients have no medical insurance. But  
others, like Mrs. Morris, have Medicare or private policies that 
cover major diseases or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once they have a stroke some of them have some coverage, but  
nobody is doing anything to keep them from having a stroke,'' 
Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinic physicians discovered that Mrs. Morris, who is unrelated  
to Dr. Morris, had breast cancer in 1993. They arranged her surgery 
for what Medicare pays, then provided low-cost follow-up care and 
free anti-cancer drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	She still comes to the clinic for regular visits and for  
treatment of high blood pressure and an irregular heart beat. On a 
recent visit, she carried a plastic bag in her purse filled with 
medicines provided by the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	The center collects free drug samples from doctors offices  
across the city and accepts donations from pharmaceutical companies 
and The Regional Medical Center, Memphis' main public hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you walk in here, you feel joy,'' Mrs. Morris said. ``You  
can just feel it.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Urges Online Stalking Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore said today that online  
stalking is a serious new problem and state and federal laws must 
be stiffened to ``to give us tools to deal with this crime 
appropriately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A new Justice Department report says state and federal laws need  
to be updated to outlaw online stalking because the practice is on 
the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore requested the federal report on the problem in February and  
released it today. He met with students, police and campus 
officials at San Diego State University to discuss the report's 
findings and said more states should follow the lead of California, 
which recently amended its stalking statute to cover cyberstalking. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Gore, one in 12 women will be victims of some form  
of stalking during their lives, as will one in 45 men. ``And 
increasing numbers of them will be victims of cyberstalking,'' Gore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting tougher sentences is part of the whole education  
process, so everybody takes this crime as seriously as it should be 
taken,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two women who declined to identify themselves at the session  
said electronic harassment had left them unnerved. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can find out things about you that your friends don't  
even know, and that's a hard thing to deal with,'' one of the women 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of states have no laws on the books that explicitly  
cover stalking on the Internet or through other electronic 
communications means, the report found. 
</P>
<P>
	And federal law contains gaps that in some cases hinder  
investigators from tracking cyberstalkers who repeatedly harass and 
threaten others on the Internet, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report surveyed steps that law enforcement, online  
industries, victims groups and others are taking to crack down on 
cyberstalking, and explored whether existing laws are adequate to 
combat a problem it contends is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet service providers, which link users to e-mail and the  
World Wide Web, report a growing number of complaints about 
harassing and threatening behavior online, it said. The head of the 
sex crimes unit in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office 
reported that about 20 percent of the unit's cases involve 
cyberstalking. 
</P>
<P>
	The report cited several chilling examples from other parts of  
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In one case, a Los Angeles security guard terrorized a woman who  
rejected his romantic advances by posting online messages that she 
fantasized about being raped, and listed her phone number and 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	On at least six occasions, sometimes in the middle of the night,  
men knocked on her door saying they wanted to rape her. 
</P>
<P>
	A San Diego man sent more than 100 e-mail messages to five  
female students at area colleges last year. They included death 
threats, graphic sexual descriptions and references to the women's 
daily activities, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor in that case, San Diego Deputy District Attorney  
Kerry Wells, sat in Gore's audience today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just to read one of the emails he sent, out of the hundreds,  
was terrifying,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law enforcement officials have reported many cases in  
which pedophiles have made advances to children through online chat 
rooms and later made contact with the children, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology allows some stalkers to harass victims anonymously,  
it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report recommends that all states review their laws to  
ensure they prohibit and provide ``appropriate'' punishment for 
stalking through the Internet and other means of electronic 
communication, including pagers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year President Clinton signed a bill into law that protects  
children against online stalking. But the report said the law 
should be expanded to outlaw interstate or international 
communication made with the intent to threaten or harass any other 
person. 
</P>
<P>
	Such new laws should include stiffer penalties when victims are  
minors, the report said. And federal law should make it easier for 
law enforcement to track down cyberstalkers. 
</P>
<P>
	The report cited as a hindrance the Cable Communications Policy  
Act, which bars investigators from obtaining cable subscriber 
records without a court order and advance notice to the subscriber. 
</P>
<P>
	The law hampers investigations, the report said, noting that  
high-speed cable links to the Internet are growing in popularity.

<HEADLINE> Russians: No Bank Evidence Produced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian investigators visiting the United States  
and Britain say those countries have not produced any evidence of 
an alleged Russian money laundering scheme at a U.S. bank, 
according to reports today. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin's government has been on the defensive  
following media reports that Russians were allegedly involved in 
laundering up to $10 billion through the Bank of New York. The 
reports have also said that the Russian government may have 
mishandled money loaned by the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports have described it as potentially one of the biggest  
money laundering cases ever uncovered in the United States. 
However, no one has been charged, and U.S. and British authorities 
have refused to discuss their investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	A Russian delegation, led by Viktor Ivanov, deputy director of  
the Federal Security Service, the country's main security agency, 
has been meeting with U.S. officials this week in Washington to 
study the case, but they have received little information, 
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``U.S. law enforcement agencies did not show any documents that  
could confirm reports on the Bank of New York case,'' Ivanov was 
quoted as saying in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came to the United States hoping to see the documents which  
are cited by the mass media,'' he added. ``Many newspapers make 
references to reliable sources at the FBI, the Department of the 
Treasury or other institutions. I feel obliged to say that the 
information obtained from those `sources' has not been confirmed in 
any way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is riddled with corruption, and capital flight from the  
country, both legal and illegal, has contributed to the economy's 
abysmal performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian authorities have agreed to cooperate with the United  
States, Britain and other countries, but have shown no real 
enthusiasm for conducting their own investigation. The Russians 
have mostly called on the Western countries to provide proof of any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Russian Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said in  
London that the allegations were part of a campaign to discredit 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are ourselves deeply interested in exposing the facts of  
illegal capital outflow of Russia or bringing to light the business 
activities which violate world financial legislation,'' the finance 
minister told ITAR-Tass. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added, ``not a single fact vouching for Russian  
companies' involvement in illegal transactions has been cited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kasyanov was in London for talks on restructuring Soviet-era  
foreign debt that Russia cannot afford to repay. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov criticized reporting by  
the Western media today and said he would defend Russia at the 
upcoming U.N. General Assembly session. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. House of Representatives' Banking Committee plans  
hearings next week on the alleged money-laundering scheme. The U.S. 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee also plans to hold hearings 
soon, with topics to include corruption in Russia.

<HEADLINE> McCain Says Gun Laws Not Enforced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YORBA LINDA, Calif. (AP) -- GOP presidential hopeful John McCain  
criticized the Clinton administration's record on prosecuting gun 
violations Thursday but said neither major party has the full 
answer to violence like the Texas church massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a broad-based problem,'' McCain said. ``The Democrats  
blame it on (lack of) gun control. The Republicans blame it on 
Hollywood. Neither is totally right. Every time we see one of these 
tragedies we are shocked and horrified at our inability to stop 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona senator was asked about the killings of eight people  
in a Forth Worth Baptist church during a question-and-answer 
session at the Richard Nixon Library &AMP; Birthplace, where he signed 
copies of his book, ``Faith of Our Fathers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An audience member asked when the Republican Congress ``will  
stop being bought by the NRA?'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain took the opportunity to fault President Clinton's  
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had less gun violation prosecutions than at any time  
in history,'' he said. ``I believe there are not sufficient staff 
and resources devoted to it. If you don't enforce existing laws it 
gives less validity to the legislative process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This week, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, released a Judiciary  
Committee staff report showing such prosecutions fell from 7,048 in 
1992 to 3,807 last year. Administration officials say the numbers 
do not reflect all cases filed by federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said that simply getting rid of guns would not stop  
violence. He cited Web sites where children can go to learn how to 
build pipe bombs and computer games in which the object is to kill 
police officers. He noted that he has been in favor of legislation 
to put limits on gun shows and waiting periods for gun purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain also spoke about campaign finance reform and a  
streamlined bill that he and others presented on Wednesday in hopes 
of getting Senate passage. The bill would ban so-called soft money 
and limit the ability of unions to use dues for political 
campaigns. The House passed a version of the legislation earlier 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an undoubted opportunity to pick up votes with this  
new bill,'' he said. ``But it depends on the dynamics of the 
process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he hopes the ability of Congress to vote on individual  
amendments will keep the process from getting sidetracked. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain criticized his own party on the issue.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Republican Party now has a new category called the  
million-dollar club,'' he said. ``My friends, if you contribute a 
million dollars you buy access.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said passing campaign reform legislation is an uphill  
battle, but he was encouraged by a vote in the House in which a 
quarter of the membership went against leadership recommendations 
to vote against the measure.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Would Promote Gay Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lining up more closely with the homosexual  
community's agenda than Vice President Al Gore, Democratic 
presidential hopeful Bill Bradley called for expanding the 1964 
Civil Rights Act to protect gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley also rejected the Clinton administration's ``don't ask,  
don't tell'' policy for the armed services and said, ``We ought to 
get to a time when gays can serve openly in the military.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former New Jersey senator, in a gay and lesbian newsmagazine  
interview due on newsstands Sept. 28, went on to criticize a 
California anti-gay-marriage ballot initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I was a voter in California, I would not support the Knight  
initiative,'' Bradley told The Advocate. ``I think it's divisive 
and ... I don't think a referendum is the place for this kind of an 
initiative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said he still opposes same-sex marriage because of ``the  
religious nature of marriage and respect for the diversity of views 
on that subject.'' Both he and Gore, who also opposes same-sex 
marriage, favor legal protections for ``domestic partners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley and Gore, rivals for next year's Democratic presidential  
nomination, are dueling for the gay and lesbian vote. 
</P>
<P>
	On several issues dear to that community, Bradley, in his  
interview, came out ahead of positions that Gore laid out in a 
separate Advocate interview, published last month. 
</P>
<P>
	On the so-called Knight initiative on California's March 2000  
ballot, a bellwether for the gay community because it would define 
marriage as between a man and woman only, Gore told The Advocate: 
``I'm going to have to educate myself on that measure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Late Thursday, after Bradley's interview was released, Gore  
campaign spokeswoman Kikki Moore said the vice president had 
decided he would, if he was a California resident, also vote ``no'' 
on Knight. ``Consider him educated,'' Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Going further than Gore's push for a pending  
anti-job-discrimination bill, Bradley said he would add sexual 
orientation to the historic 1964 act outlawing racial, religious 
and sex discrimination in employment, housing, lending and public 
accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would clearly indicate that discrimination against gays  
is in the same category as discrimination against other protected 
groups,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such an expansion was first championed by New York liberal Rep.  
Bella Abzug in 1973. But in 1993, the gay community considered 
public-opinion polls, pared back its hopes and pursued the more 
widely politically palatable Employment Non-Discrimination Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore said Gore is focusing on the act as ``the most practical  
way to move forward on an agenda of non-discrimination'' because 
``it can actually pass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Civil Rights Commission chairwoman Mary Frances Berry, who  
was appointed by President Clinton, called Bradley's approach 
``naive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it doesn't go anywhere. We have avoided opening up the  
Civil Rights Act for fear that (conservative) amendments would be 
added to gut it,'' Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the military, Bradley said, homosexuals should be allowed to  
serve openly, but he admitted that he has not determined ``the 
timing and method'' of such a change to military policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley voted in 1993 for a Senate amendment to lift outright  
the military's ban on gays. But Congress passed -- and Clinton 
signed into law -- the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy allowing 
gays to serve as long as their sexuality remained a secret. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, in this campaign season, has said only that the current  
policy has led to too many unfair gay discharges and should be 
implemented with ``more compassion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's position ``clearly represents a different, more  
positive thinking than the vice president's,'' said David Smith, 
spokesman for Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay 
right's group. 
</P>
<P>
	On the full menu of gay issues, Bradley and Gore have virtually  
identical records, but Gore has trumped Bradley in ``energy and 
commitment,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senator Bradley comes off as ambivalent at best. But these  
statements in this article certainly send the right message and I'm 
sure it will cause several potential voters to perhaps look more 
closely at his candidacy,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996 exit polls, self-identified gay voters accounted for 5  
percent of the total voting public, and 7 percent of Clinton's 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley campaign spokesman Eric Hauser said Bradley gave the  
interview because the magazine requested it and not to court gay 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``He spoke from his heart,'' Hauser said.  
</P>
<P>
	Telling the magazine that he has gay friends but no gay family,  
Bradley said homosexuality ``happens to be an attribute about as 
meaningful as having blond hair.''

<HEADLINE>  Thrasher Future on Stefan Shoulders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Patrik Stefan was admittedly nervous the first  
time he stepped on the ice for the Atlanta Thrashers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, there's pressure when everybody is looking at  
you,'' the 19-year-old center said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the strapping native of the Czech Republic has grown  
more comfortable in the spotlight, providing a tantalizing glimpse 
of the skills that made him the No. 1 pick in the NHL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``The top four or five guys in this year's draft are going to be  
outstanding players,'' said general manager Don Waddell, who 
engineered a draft-day deal to land Stefan. ``But I couldn't get 
that feeling about anybody else that I got with Patrik.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Thrashers have gone to great lengths to ensure that  
Stefan's development is unimpeded by the growing pains of an 
expansion franchise. Waddell said he's not concerned about this 
season or next -- when the losses figure to be frequent -- but looks 
forward to seeing Stefan at the ripe old age of 22 or 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got to earn his playing time,'' Waddell said. ``If he's  
ready now, we'll bring him on quicker. If not, we'll bring him 
along slower and be prepared to stand back and take all the 
questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To ease the transition, coach Curt Fraser put Stefan on a line  
with 32-year-old Kelly Buchberger, who played on three Stanley 
Cup-winning teams in Edmonton with players like Wayne Gretzky, Mark 
Messier and Grant Fuhr. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the back of his mind, Patrik has got to know every person  
in the building is watching him,'' Fraser said. ``He's got to 
forget that. Just go out, play the game and have fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchberger has noticed in Stefan some of the same traits that  
were prevalent in those great Edmonton teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of young guys are not open to suggestions,'' Buchberger  
said. ``But Patrik is very polite and he wants to learn. He wants 
to be the best he can be. He's an easy guy to take to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only question is whether the Thrashers have the next Eric  
Lindros (superstar) or the next Brett Lindros (a career cut shot by 
concussions). Stefan suffered two concussions last season with the 
Long Beach Ice Dogs, playing his final game in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel fine,'' insisted Stefan, who turned 19 Thursday.  
``That's all behind me. I don't even think about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, doubts persist because of the way Stefan's agent handled  
the situation prior to the draft. Rich Winter refused to release 
his client's medical records, prompting Tampa Bay to give up its 
chance to land Stefan with the No. 1 pick. The Thrashers relied on 
their own medical research to reach a different conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no more risk of injury with Patrik than there is with  
any other player,'' Waddell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Stefan jumped at the chance to leave the Czech  
Republic when an offer came from the International Hockey League, a 
step below the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to play in the NHL, and the IHL helped me,'' he said.  
``It's a good league. I got to play against men and I learned a 
lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking little English, Stefan moved in with a family in  
Southern California. His mother and father took turns visiting him 
to make the adjustment easier. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was hard the first couple of weeks and months,'' he  
recalled. ``I learned a lot -- not only about hockey, but about 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Stefan was one of the better players in the IHL  
until the concussions took their toll. In 33 games, he scored 11 
goals and added 24 assists, earning a spot in the league's All-Star 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Stefan's skating is deceptively quick and elusive. Like many  
Europeans, he has soft hands and extraordinary passing skills, but 
he's also big enough (6-foot-2, 205 pounds) to take an NHL-style 
beating. He does his best work behind the net and in the corners, 
drawing comparisons to Ron Francis. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very mature for his age,'' Buchberger said. ``Hopefully,  
that will make his adjustment to the NHL a lot easier. A lot of 
junior players have problems the first couple of years. But you can 
already tell he's one of the best players on the ice.''

<HEADLINE> French Co. Charged for Rigging Bids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The federal government has charged a French  
construction company with conspiring to rig bids on bridge projects 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said Wednesday the charge was the first  
from an ongoing investigation of the specialty construction 
industry by the department's Antitrust Division in San Francisco. 
Neither the department's statement nor the charging document 
identified the projects or any local connection. 
</P>
<P>
	After charges were filed, a lawyer for the company, Freyssinet  
and Co., said it was cooperating with the Justice Department 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Steve Hammond said the company expects to resolve its  
criminal case shortly. He gave no details of the projects in 
question or the scope of the alleged conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Hammond said Freyssinet, a construction and engineering company  
based in France and operating worldwide, was not doing business in 
California during the period covered by the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-count charge, filed in U.S. District Court, accuses the  
company of conspiring with unidentified companies to rig bids and 
allocate contracts for the sale of materials, installations and 
supplies used to build cable-stayed bridges. Those bridges have 
roadways suspended from towers by cables. 
</P>
<P>
	The conspirators agreed to allocate several bridge projects  
among them and submit ``artificially high, non-competitive bids,'' 
the charging document said. It said the conspiracy started in 
September 1996 and lasted a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The charge is punishable by a fine of $10 million or twice the  
gain or loss caused by the crime, whichever is greater, the 
department said.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Forces School Closings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Parents called baby sitters, called  
neighbors and called in favors Thursday, scrambling to find someone 
to watch the kids after Hurricane Floyd forced schools to close in 
a region more accustomed to snow days than hurricane holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than 2.9 million students in the Northeast, it was  
hours of television, lots of computer games or a chance to sleep 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can sleep late and we don't have to worry about tests or  
anything,'' said Amy Stollery, 13, of Piscataway, N.J. ``We're just 
flopping around, watching television. I hope we don't have school 
tomorrow, too, then I wouldn't have to take my Spanish test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Public schools closed for the day throughout New Jersey,  
Washington, New York City and Baltimore, along with most of the 
rest of Maryland. Schools in Philadelphia closed at 12:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time anyone could remember the entire school  
system in New York City or New Jersey -- with 1 million students 
each -- being closed by a hurricane. When Hurricane Gloria hit New 
York City in 1985, only those schools closest to the water were 
shut down, school system spokeswoman Marjie Feinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moms and dads were confronted with the kind of hassle they  
expect in January, not September. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife and I heard at about 6:50 that schools were closed. We  
looked at each other and said `OK. Plan B.' Then we realized, 
`Oops, there is no plan B,''' said Chris Meyer, a father of 
daughters aged 6 and 9 who works in Manhattan for a public advocacy 
group. ``We had to rearrange our lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his wife left for work early so she could return to  
their Brooklyn home by 11 a.m. and look after the kids while he 
raced to get to his own job by noon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mother Nature just doesn't understand the late 20th century  
economy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others simply took the day off.  
</P>
<P>
	``With the late notice of the school closing, there was no time  
to make alternative arrangements,'' said Debbie McDonald, who works 
for Dow Jones in the Princeton, N.J., area. ``I really should be in 
work today. I'm very busy, but what are you going to do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many employers made things easier for parents by closing  
altogether or allowing employees to leave early. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a lot of people who decided to stay home or who brought  
kids to work, and we decided releasing nonessential people early 
was the best thing to do under the circumstances,'' said Gary 
Morgenstern, a spokesman for AT&AMP;T in New York who was working from 
home so he could care for his two children. 
</P>
<P>
	In Philadelphia, Valerie Weary waited outside the Franklin  
Learning Center to pick up her 10th-grade daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bringing the students to school for half a day was a waste of  
time this morning,'' she said. ``I had a really bad time getting 
her to school this morning and now I'm back a few hours later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Students also ran into trouble in Chichester Township, Pa.,  
outside Philadelphia, where one housing development was so flooded 
during the afternoon that school buses could not drop off about 150 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the youngsters were picked up by parents or relatives by  
midday.

<HEADLINE> Prayers Turn To Screams in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Kim Herron was in the back of Wedgwood  
Baptist Church when the shooting began. In the care of the 
children's minister were 100 young children -- but her own 
17-year-old daughter was out front, where bullets were killing 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	She stayed with her charges.  
</P>
<P>
	``You know our God's in control, but at the same time, you're a  
mom and it's so, so scary,'' Ms. Herron said after Wednesday 
night's rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	Emptying clip after clip, a man wielding a semiautomatic handgun  
fatally shot three adults and three teen-agers during a worship 
service. He wounded at least eight more before killing himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The also assailant rolled a pipe bomb down one of the church  
aisles as congregation members scrambled for cover. 
</P>
<P>
	Margaret Gonzales, who lives near the church, said victims were  
on her yard following the attack, some evaluating their bloody 
wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our relatives are calling us and telling us to be careful  
because of bombs,'' said Ms. Gonzales, who locked her 10-year-old 
daughter in her bedroom for protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Front yards became triage centers while Bruce Shulkey Elementary  
School became a waiting area for frantic parents wondering whether 
their children were alive. It was an awful, time-consuming wait as 
officers searched the sprawling brick church for explosives -- and 
for coroners to identify the dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Some relatives bowed their heads and wept at cafeteria tables.  
Others, with jaws clenched, watched the second hand crawl across a 
wall clock. 
</P>
<P>
	Pages of a list fluttered through the group as it was passed  
from hand to hand. It was a sign-on sheet -- a list penned by those 
who lived through the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's there,'' one mother said, bursting into tears of relief.  
``Oh, God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She had found her daughter, but would not talk to reporters.  
</P>
<P>
	Other sounds of despair and reunion filled the school's halls as  
families clamored for word of missing kin. Some asked, ``Where's 
that list?'' and ``Did you hear if he's OK?'' 
</P>
<P>
	As night settled over the neighborhood in southwestern Fort  
Worth, helicopters flew above and brilliant television lights threw 
shadows in the grass. Law officers drifted through the church lobby 
with files, flashlights and walkie-talkies. 
</P>
<P>
	A block away, Marvin Wood, 43, watched the action from his front  
yard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes you really sick,'' he said. ``You see this happen on  
TV all the time and you say, `It's far enough away from me.' Now 
it's going to be Wedgwood.''

<HEADLINE> Germany: U.S. Violated Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Germany filed a complaint with the World Court on  
Thursday accusing the United States of human rights violations for 
the executions of two German citizens last winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite appeals by German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and other  
German officials, Arizona executed Karl and Walter LaGrand for a 
1992 murder. 
</P>
<P>
	In the complaint, Germany said the execution violated the Vienna  
Convention because the brothers were not informed of their right to 
assistance from the German consulate after their arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany also said Arizona proceeded with the execution of Walter  
LaGrand on March 3, a week after his brother was put to death, 
despite the World Court's request for a delay. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has until March 27 to respond.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're seeking a guarantee that the United States will abide by  
the decisions of the World Court in future human rights cases,'' 
Justice Minister Herta Daeubler-Gmelin was quoted as saying by the 
Leipziger Volkszeitung.

<HEADLINE> McConnell Attacks Campaign Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate's most prominent critic of campaign  
finance legislation attacked a new, pared-down measure Thursday as 
a ``dagger at the heart of the Republican Party,'' signaling a 
struggle when the issue reaches the Senate floor next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised bill ``drops all pretense of being bipartisan in its  
impact,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican who also 
heads the party's Senate campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell made his comments one day after Sens. John McCain,  
R-Ariz., and Russell Feingold, D-Wis., announced plans to trim 
their bill, hoping they could break a deadlock on the issue that 
has gripped the Senate in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	The new bill would ban so-called soft money -- unlimited  
donations that corporations, labor unions and some individuals give 
to political parties. It also would limit the ability of unions to 
use compulsory dues taken from nonunion members to further 
political efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	But it contains no provision to regulate the attack ads that  
have become prevalent in campaigns, or other provisions that McCain 
and Feingold included in past versions of the bill brought to the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men said they still support the broader restrictions, but  
dropped them in hopes that amendments could be added during floor 
debate, and the final result would somehow gain 60 votes, the 
number needed to overcome a filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Feingold indicated limited flexibility on one  
contentious issue. He said he is ``unconvinced'' that the law 
should be changed to allow individuals to donate more than $1,000 
to any candidate in so-called hard money -- donations for specific 
candidates' campaigns. At the same time, he said, ``I recognize 
that this is a process of compromise where I listen to'' the views 
of others. Many Republicans, he noted, favor such an increase. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain could not be reached for comment on the subject.  
</P>
<P>
	But the issue of raising the limits in effect since the 1970s  
risks causing fissures among the bill's supporters. Democratic 
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said some party 
officials fear that raising the limits would put them at a greater 
fund-raising disadvantage than they already face. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans outraise Democrats in both hard money and soft  
money. But the difference is narrower in the soft money race, 
meaning Democrats can use it to close the gap. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell, on the other hand, complained that the revised bill  
contained nothing to prevent unions from making political use of 
compulsory union dues assessed their own members. 
</P>
<P>
	By proposing a ban on soft money, he said, the legislation was  
``targeted at the one area where Republicans have an advantage 
without doing anything about union funding.''

<P>
	GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate  
George W. Bush said Thursday that ``a wave of evil'' -- not a lack 
of gun control laws -- is the cause of rampant gun violence in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	Scrapping two fund-raisers to rush home to Texas and the scene  
of a deadly shooting spree, the GOP front-runner said the tragedy 
had not softened his pro-gun views. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know of a law -- a governmental law -- that will put  
love in people's hearts,'' the Texas governor told reporters at a 
news conference. He toured a local elementary school and met 
privately with former President Gerald Ford before leaving for 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	His eyes red and moist, Bush said: ``It's hard to explain how  
hatred lurks in somebody's heart to the point where he walks into a 
church where children and adults were seeking God's guidance and 
shoots them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven people were fatally shot Wednesday night at a Fort Worth,  
Texas, Baptist church before the gunman killed himself in a pew. 
Authorities did not know the man's motive. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting posed a potential political problem for the  
two-term governor who signed a 1995 law allowing Texans to carry 
concealed weapons with a permit. Democrats have questioned his 
commitment to federal and state efforts to require background 
checks at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who spoke to police in Texas shortly before the news  
conference, said he was told the suspect did not have a 
concealed-weapons permit. ``I don't know his background, but it 
sounds to me like he's mentally deranged,'' Bush said. ``You bet, 
I'd like to make sure people like him don't have guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he didn't budge from his belief that new anti-gun laws are  
not the answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There seems to be a wave of evil passing through America now  
and we as a society can pass laws and hold people accountable for 
the decisions they make, but our hopes and prayers have got to be 
that there is more love in society,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This man obviously was acting as a result of evil in his  
heart,'' Bush said. ``I would hope that Americans would 
collectively pray for love in people's heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like most Republicans generally in line with the National Rifle  
Association, Bush said current laws need to be enforced. Punish 
people who illegally sell guns or who commit crimes with a gun; 
keep weapons out of the hands of felons and mentally ill people; 
ban certain assault weapons and require background checks at gun 
shows, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he embraced a GOP-backed bill in the House this year  
which the White House and gun-control advocates said would weaken 
existing laws governing gun shows. Democrats in Texas criticize 
Bush for failing to back a state gun show bill, though the governor 
said federal law made the measure unworkable. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said that ``most Americans want somebody reasonable who has  
a rational view'' of the topic. 
</P>
<P>
	He canceled the remainder of his Michigan trip, including a  
gathering of state Republicans on Mackinac Island, a weekend trip 
to Kennebunkport, Maine and a Sunday event in New Hampshire so he 
could attend memorials for the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, Bush met privately with some hospitalized survivors at  
John Peter Smith Hospital and later called for a higher authority 
to heal the hatred. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is now a time in our state and this great city to  
remember that Fort Worth is full of decent and caring people,'' 
Bush said outside the hospital. ``I wish I knew the law to make 
people love one another. We'd pass it in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a time for us to recognize that it requires a higher  
authority to heal the hate that exists in some people's hearts.''

<HEADLINE> Florida Schools Set for Showdowns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	By the time Sunday afternoon rolls around, the state of Florida  
may be the talk of college football. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, it's No. 20 North Carolina State at No. 1 Florida  
State, No. 2 Tennessee at No. 4 Florida and No. 3 Penn State at No. 
8 Miami. The results could produce a first -- and a second and 
third, for that matter -- in the next Associated Press' Top 25 poll. 
</P>
<P>
	As in:  
</P>
<P>
	No. 1 Florida State.  
</P>
<P>
	No. 2 Florida.  
</P>
<P>
	No. 3 Miami.  
</P>
<P>
	Never in the poll's 63-year history have the three major Florida  
teams been ranked 1-2-3, but they have come close. Early in 1992, 
there was a No. 1 Miami, No. 3 Florida State and No. 4 Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, the Seminoles, Gators and Hurricanes have been good, great  
in fact, for most of the past 15 years. And hardly a season goes by 
without one, two or even all three, playing a leading role in the 
national championship picture. 
</P>
<P>
	But rarely have all three played host to big games on the same  
day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't remember one,'' Florida State coach Bobby Bowden said.  
``Miami and Penn State is mighty big; Florida and Tennessee is 
mighty big and of course, us and NC State is big, too. I would bet 
you there's never been a day like this one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a chance at a Sunshine State 1-2-3 sweep in the poll, all  
three would obviously need to win, with the Hurricanes needing a 
big boost from the voters. While the Vols and Nittany Lions would 
drop in the poll, Miami would also have to move ahead of co-No. 4 
Nebraska, No. 6 Michigan and No. 7 Texas A&AMP;M. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounds good, but it won't be easy.  
</P>
<P>
	The Wolfpack (3-0) upset the Seminoles 24-7 last season as Chris  
Weinke threw six interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're a hungry football team,'' Bowden said. ``It's an  
undefeated team that has dominated us the last six quarters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee ended a five-game losing streak against the Gators  
with a 20-17 overtime win at Knoxville in 1998. But the Vols have 
not won in The Swamp since 1971, and the Gators have major-college 
best 29-game home winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our Gator fans get extremely pumped for Tennessee and Florida  
State,'' Florida coach Steve Spurrier said. ``Those are the two 
teams that bring out the extra passion, extra noise level. Our fans 
have been waiting for this one since the FSU game in 1997. That was 
the last time it's really been loud here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The past four Penn State-Miami games were decided by six points  
or less, the most memorable being the Lions' 14-10 win in the 1987 
Fiesta Bowl that gave coach Joe Paterno the second of his two 
national titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's typical of all three programs over the past 10-12  
years that we've had successful teams,'' Miami coach Butch Davis 
said. ``With big games, you're going to get a big amount of 
exposure. This is a big game for us, and I'm sure Steve feels the 
same way with Tennessee coming in and Bobby Bowden with NC State.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State, Florida and Miami have been so good for so long,  
each has been designated as a ``Famous Major College Dynasty'' by 
the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined, the teams have won 279 games in the 1990s, six  
national titles since 1983 -- Miami has four, Florida State and 
Florida one each -- and produced four Heisman Trophy winners. During 
three seasons, 1990-92, the schools were in their ``dynasty'' stage 
simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
                          	Florida State 	
</P>
<P>
	Under Bowden, in Seminoles have won 10 or more games in each of  
the last 12 seasons, never finished lower than No. 4 in the final 
AP poll and have gone 10-2 in bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
	There's been one national title, in 1993, and Bowden is still  
searching for his first perfect season. The NCAA says the Seminoles 
dynasty years were 1987-95, but it sure looks like college sport's 
ruling body ended the run too soon. 
</P>
<P>
                             	Florida 	
</P>
<P>
	From the time Spurrier took over in 1990, the Gators have  
usually been in the title chase. With the Fun 'N Gun offense, 
Florida is 93-18-1 this decade, with four straight SEC titles from 
1993-96, 10 wins in each of the past six seasons and a national 
championship in '96. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 season is an example of how dominant these sunshine  
teams can be. Florida State beat Florida in the final 
regular-season game, and then the Gators defeated the Seminoles in 
a rematch at the '97 Sugar Bowl to claim their one and only 
national crown. 
</P>
<P>
                              	Miami 	
</P>
<P>
	Florida State and Florida have dominated under one coach; Miami  
had three in its dynasty years of 1983-92. The Hurricanes won their 
first title under Howard Schnellenberger in 1983; the second under 
Jimmy Johnson in '87 and the next two under Dennis Erickson in '89 
and '91. 
</P>
<P>
	During that span, the 'Canes were an incredible 107-13, set an  
NCAA record with a 58-game home winning streak from 1985-94 and 
produced Heisman winners Vinny Testaverde ('86) and Gino Torretta 
('92). 
</P>
<P>
	For the past few years, Davis has steadily rebuilt the  
Hurricanes following three years of NCAA probation that severely 
restricted recruiting. Last season, Miami was 9-3 after closing out 
with big wins over UCLA and NC State. 
</P>
<P>
	A 23-12 win over Ohio State in the Kickoff Classic last month  
gave fans a clear indication the Hurricanes are once again a team 
to be reckoned with. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest reason the Hurricanes are back, and Florida football  
has been thriving for years? 
</P>
<P>
	Recruiting. Now that Miami is able to sign a full complement of  
recruits, the Hurricanes are able to keep pace with the Seminoles 
and Gators for the state's cream of the crop high school stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``You go to the three schools and there are plenty of (high  
school) players down here,'' Bowden said. ``If we get the best 
ones, then we're all going to have a good chance at having good 
ballclubs.''

<HEADLINE> Banks Hit Hard by Global Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Banks and wealthy investors lost $350 billion  
during the 1997-98 global economic crises, a group representing 300 
private financial institutions around the world reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Institute for Economics also said its members  
should not be forced to participate in resolving these crises but 
should act voluntarily on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
	When the United States and the International Monetary Fund  
bailed out Mexico in 1995, some members of Congress charged that 
the infusion of money saved many investors from huge losses. The 
charges were repeated when South Korea received a similar package 
in December 1997 and Brazil got financial aid in January of this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reality is that no matter what prism you look through to  
view the relative roles of the private and public sector in Mexico, 
Korea or Brazil, there is no bailing out of the private sector by 
the official sector,'' said Charles Dallara, the institute's 
managing director. ``You can't find it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallara said Russia was the only country where investors put  
money in with any confidence they might recover their capital if 
anything went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	They believed ``the IMF would continue for political and global  
security concerns, if not for economic reasons, to support 
(Russia's) reform program. That calculation was wrong,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallara presented the institute's findings in a letter to  
finance ministers and central bank governors in advance of annual 
meetings of the IMF and the World Bank next week. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the issues to be discussed is burden-sharing, in which  
private investors pay a larger share of the official bailouts of 
nations on the verge of collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallara said involving the private sector in these crises is a  
valid objective but burden-sharing is a flawed concept. 
</P>
<P>
	He advocated voluntary consultations between the banks and the  
IMF and other international financial institutions to see if 
market-based solutions can be found.

<HEADLINE> Web Site Claims Rival Copied It </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- An Internet startup is being sued by a  
far larger rival for allegedly copying its technology and even the 
wording of its Web page, which lets surfers compare prices on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	MySimon Inc., a Santa Clara, Calif.-based Internet hub that  
claims to be the Web's largest comparison shopping site, filed a 
complaint Wednesday in U.S. District Court in San Jose against 
Priceman.com, based in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint says Priceman.com is an illegal copy of  
MySimon.com, and that the entrepreneurs behind it have been tapping 
into MySimon's search engine to find bargains for consumers on the 
Web. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the complaint says, Priceman had pages of text that  
mirror pages on the MySimon site. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an absolute clear case of copyright infringement, as  
well as unfair competition, and unfair business practice since they 
are using our service and representing the results as their own,'' 
said MySimon chief executive Josh Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
	Priceman.com chief executive Neal Verma said he had no knowledge  
that Priceman had pulled any Web site text off the MySimon site. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said that other search engines such as webcrawler.com  
and dogpile.com use a variety of other search engines that 
incorporate information from the top search engines on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm surprised MySimon even noticed us, let alone took us to  
court,'' Verma, who is 23, said Wednesday. ``Obviously we don't 
have any money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Priceman.com, which claims to be ``Earth's BIGGEST shopping  
comparison engine,'' is run by eight young entrepreneurs in Houston 
who have yet to make any money. Verma said they only get about 20 
hits, or visits, a day. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not exactly seasoned veterans, '' said Verma. ``We all  
have real jobs on the side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Priceman tried to auction nearly half of its equity  
on Internet auction site eBay for at least $10 million. EBay, which 
had questions about the legality of online stock auctions, stopped 
the sale.

<HEADLINE> Stewart Eyes Winston Cup Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUDON, N.H. (AP) -- Rookie Tony Stewart can set a Winston Cup  
record if another swift run at New Hampshire International Speedway 
lasts long enough to carry him to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	No first-year driver has won consecutively in NASCAR's top  
division. But Stewart, coming off his first career victory, 
certainly has a great chance Sunday in the Dura Lube 300. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months ago, he dominated the Jiffy Lube 300 on the same  
1.058-mile oval. But a bad estimate of fuel mileage left him dry 
less than three laps from the end. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing is for sure, we aren't going to run out of gas  
again,'' said Stewart, a winner last Saturday night at Richmond 
International Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
	He led 118 of 300 laps at NHIS in July before falling victim to  
a needless gamble by his crew. A substantial lead would have held 
up even with a quick pit stop in the waning laps, but Stewart 
stayed on the track until his sleek Pontiac ran out of gas. 
</P>
<P>
	He has put that midsummer nightmare behind him -- along with an  
embarrassing post-race disappearing act -- and is concentrating on 
finding the same combination that made him so dominant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We brought back the same car to Loudon, and we're confident  
about our chances,'' said Stewart, who wound up 10th in the Jiffy 
Lube 300. 
</P>
<P>
	Should the same kind of dominance be expected Sunday?  
</P>
<P>
	Two-time defending race champion Jeff Gordon isn't so sure.  
</P>
<P>
	``When people beat us the way those guys did, all the teams go  
back and really go to work,'' he said. ``Everybody tries to make 
their car better while the guy that was the best won't do much 
because they had the right combination to begin with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The right stuff has been with Stewart for most of his  
much-celebrated debut season. He has finished out of the top 10 
just four times in the last 21 races, and became only the third 
rookie to win in 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite such history, Stewart's first victory seemed like more  
of a ``when'' than an ``if'' almost from the outset. But its 
arrival in his 25th career start has left the 28-year-old Hoosier 
somewhat surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	``You dream about something like this your entire life, and when  
it finally happens it's like you're still dreaming,'' said the 
former USAC and Indy Racing League champion. ``I keep waiting for 
someone to wake me up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was stunned. We all were. It was the best moment of my life  
so far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, a 47-time winner with three Winston Cup championships in  
seven years on the circuit, believes Stewart should get used to the 
feeling. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the kind of talent he has and the cars the Joe Gibbs team  
is putting under him, they're a tough combination to beat,'' Gordon 
said. ``Once you start winning, there's no telling where it's going 
to stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, Jeff Burton, who won the July race for the third year in  
a row, and Mark Martin would seem to be the most likely spoilers of 
Stewart's dream. 
</P>
<P>
	Reigning series champion Gordon figures he might have something  
for Stewart, who also could tie the late Davey Allison's 1987 mark 
of two rookie victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon usually feels comfortable at NHIS, where he and Burton  
have three career victories apiece. But Gordon seems to be a little 
more confident in the second of New England's two annual races. 
</P>
<P>
	``There must be something about running at New Hampshire at this  
time of year,'' he said. ``We've been able to hit on the setup for 
both fall races.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His chances, and those of the other top contenders, could be  
further enhanced by the remnants of Hurricane Floyd. The storm 
threatens to play havoc with the Friday schedule, meaning reduced 
practice time is likely and postponement of qualifying is possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are teams like ours who usually have a good setup for  
the track and would probably fare even better with less practice 
time,'' Gordon said. ``The others just wouldn't have much 
opportunity to make many changes.''

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Pop singer George Michael brushed off questions  
Thursday about a $10 million lawsuit filed against him this week by 
a police officer in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael appeared at a news conference to promote a fund-raiser

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall; Dow Down 51.93 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened lower in quiet trading today as  
investors continued to focus on fears of higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was down 51.93 at 10,749.49. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was down 4.14 at 1,313.83, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was down 28.16 at 2,786.01. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume was light as effects of Hurricane Floyd kept many New  
York traders out of work. Early volume on the New York Stock 
Exchange came to 94.2 million shares, well behind Wednesday's pace. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-5 margin. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond market set an early closing time of 1 p.m. EDT.  
</P>
<P>
	With little fresh economic news, investors continued to bid  
stocks lower on the fear that the Federal Reserve will raise 
interest rates for a third time this year. The Fed's policy-making 
committee will hold its next meeting Oct. 5, and many analysts say 
the market is unlikely to rally until then. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar revived slightly in New York currency trading, rising  
to 104.90 yen from a 3 1/2-year low of 103.20 yen during trading 
Wednesday. Japanese leaders issued strong warnings today that a 
continued strengthening of the yen against the U.S. dollar could 
jeopardize the nation's budding economic recovery, and Prime 
Minister Keizo Obuchi told reporters that Japan would consider 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Nikkei stock average plunged 2.7 percent as investors  
feared the end of the recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett Packard was the biggest drain on the Dow today, falling  
3 5/16 to 105 3/16. IBM was down 1 1/16 at 130 7//8. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index fell 2.13 to 434.20.  
</P>
<P>
	In afternoon trading in Europe, Germany's DAX index was down 0.8  
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.1 percent, and France's 
CAC-40 was up 0.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Nike First-Quarter Profits Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- After a year of cost-cutting in 1999,  
Nike reported Thursday its earnings were up 22 percent for its 
first quarter in fiscal 2000, but revenue remained flat for the 
world's largest maker of athletic shoes and clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Beaverton-based company posted a profit of $200 million, or  
70 cents a share, compared with $164 million, or 56 cents a share, 
in the year-ago quarter. Sales were stuck at $2.5 billion, the same 
level as the first quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Nike's results were well above the 66 cents a share  
predicted by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us, it was a near-great quarter,'' said Nike Chairman Phil  
Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	He said domestic shoe sales showed a 3 percent increase while  
global sales advanced 4 percent. But Nike clothing sales declined 6 
percent overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Future orders for delivery between September 1999 and January  
2000 were up 2 percent to $3.2 billion from the first quarter of 
1999, but domestic orders were down 7 percent. Orders in Europe, a 
traditionally strong sales area for Nike, were up 15 percent while 
Asia jumped 37 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said they were impressed by the strength of the  
recovery in Asia, but they were concerned about the eighth straight 
quarter of weak clothing sales in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got to get that corrected,'' said John Shanley of  
First Security Van Kasper. 
</P>
<P>
	``We estimate they'll have close to 47 percent of the U.S.  
footwear business in dollar terms this year, so for them to grow 
their business they have to do it outside footwear,'' Shanley said. 
``Apparel would be the natural avenue but that's where they're 
having trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knight said orders were affected by a decision to move from a  
four-season selling cycle to three seasons, shortening the spring 
season by a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike also continued an aggressive $1 billion stock repurchasing  
effort launched in February 1998, buying back $142 million worth of 
shares during the first quarter of fiscal 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike shares closed up 56 1/4 cents, at $54.75, on the New York  
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Washington Braces for Blustery day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's capital braced for heavy rain and  
generally blustery weather from Hurricane Floyd today, but the 
federal government was remaining open for business. 
</P>
<P>
	However, federal employees, as well as those of most local  
governments were extended ``liberal leave'' -- meaning they could 
feel free to take a vacation day without having to call in for 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
	District of Columbia schools were closed, along with a number of  
suburban districts in Maryland and Virginia in a bow to the 
possibility of some localized street flooding during downpours. 
</P>
<P>
	But the heaviest weather was to pass well east of Washington,  
with the capital expecting two or three inches of additional rain 
during the day and just enough wind to warrant keeping a wary eye 
on trees with root systems weakened by months of drought. 
</P>
<P>
	The most visible bow to the nasty weather was a decision House  
of Representative leaders to give members a one-day early start on 
their traditional long weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish all my colleagues safe travel home,'' House Majority  
Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said Wednesday as he and the other 
leaders canceled legislative business for the rest of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	No changes were announced in the Senate schedule.

<HEADLINE> Idaho Playing `Home' at Wash. St. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PULLMAN, Wash. (AP) -- Trying to qualify for permanent Division  
I-A football status, Idaho is playing its home games this season in 
its own private Idaho -- Washington State's 37,000-seat Martin 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Idaho's first ``home game'' is Saturday, and ironically, the  
visiting team is Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
	``To hear I-D-A-H-O ring loud and clear in that stadium will be  
important to our coaches and kids,'' Idaho athletic director Mike 
Bohn said. ``This is the first game that counts in our Division 1-A 
attendance goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For this game, the numbers in the stands may be more important  
than the numbers on the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Idaho, based in nearby Moscow, must average at least 17,000 fans  
for its four home games this season to stay in Division 1-A. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Kibbie Dome seats just 16,000, Idaho officials made a  
deal with their neighbor to play home games eight miles west. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vandals gave away 2,500 free tickets to students this week  
to pump up attendance. Bohn said anything less than a sellout on 
Saturday would be a disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make the Battle of the Palouse into something we  
can take a lot of pride in and be excited about,'' Bohn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Idaho is paying $7,500 per game rent to use Martin Stadium. The  
Cougars will retain parking and concession revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't expect Martin Stadium to be decked out in Idaho colors  
this weekend. The only sign fans will have that this is an Idaho 
home game is that the Vandals will wear their black uniforms, and 
the Cougars their white road uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Cougars will stand along their normal sideline, the  
field logos will remain Cougar crimson, and Washington State 
students and season ticket holders will sit in their regular seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Idaho fans will be relegated to the end zone seats that visiting  
fans always receive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not considering any of these games home games,'' said  
Idaho defensive tackle Mao Tosi. ``Until we get the game back in 
the Kibbie Dome, it's Wazzu's home game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington State and Idaho are both land-grant institutions  
located far from their states' population centers and from the 
national spotlight. They are oases surrounded by hundreds of square 
miles of near-empty farm fields known as the Palouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports is a major campus recreation for students at both  
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, the Battle of the Palouse has been one-sided. Idaho  
and Washington State have met 80 times on the football field, with 
WSU winning 63. The Vandals have not defeated WSU since 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	Although they were long a power in the Division 1-AA Big Sky  
Conference, the Vandals in 1996 moved up to the Big West 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, the Vandals finished a surprising 9-3 and beat  
Southern Mississippi in the Humanitarian Bowl in Boise. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, they lost at Auburn by a score of just 30-23. The  
pain was soothed by a $325,000 check. 
</P>
<P>
	That has fueled hopes that the Vandals (1-1) might beat  
stumbling WSU (0-2) for the first time since the Johnson 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're showing they can compete,'' Price said. ``They are a  
competititve, worthy opponent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Idaho hopes to play in Martin Stadium for only this one season.  
In the future, they'll be able to retain Division 1-A status simply 
by averaging 20,000-attendance for road games, said sports 
spokesman Andrew Longeteig. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're playing at Washington and Oregon and West Virginia next  
season,'' he said. ``That will help us easily attain the 20,000 
goal.''

<HEADLINE> Police Search Home of Texas Gunman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Police today searched the trashed home  
of a man who spewed anti-Baptist rhetoric as he fired on a church 
service, finding concrete-laden toilets and tattered family photos, 
but no clues to what drove him to his deadly rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven people were fatally shot Wednesday night before  
47-year-old Larry Gene Ashbrook killed himself in a pew at the 
Wedgwood Baptist Church. Seven others were wounded, three 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashbrook was carrying a 9mm semiautomatic handgun and a  
.380-caliber handgun, pausing during Wednesday night's attack to 
reload, police Chief Ralph Mendoza said. He used three clips in 
all, and investigators found six loaded 9mm clips in his jacket 
pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashbrook also rolled a pipe bomb down an aisle, but it exploded  
without injuring anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like a skit, it looked like something out of a  
movie,'' said Bethany Williams, 16, her eyes red with tears and her 
green crocheted purse splattered with blood. ``And I thought it was 
a fake gun making fake noises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashbrook had no known police record. He acted alone, and there  
was no indication that he knew anyone at the Southern Baptist 
church, Mendoza said. 
</P>
<P>
	No note explaining the shooting was found on Ashbrook or at his  
home about a 10-minute drive from the church. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor were any clues found in several years-old journals  
discovered in the house, which Ashbrook had shared with his father 
until the older man's death in July, said the FBI's Robert Garrity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that we'll ever know the answer to the question  
of why it happened,'' Garrity said. ``It may just be an enigma for 
a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashbrook apparently wrecked the house before heading to the  
church. Investigators this morning found overturned furniture, 
holes in walls, concrete poured down toilets and family photos 
hacked to pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	``He virtually destroyed the interior of his house,'' Garrity  
said. ``This has the appearance of being a very troubled man, who, 
for whatever reason in his own mind, sought to quiet whatever 
demons that bothered him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings happened during a service for teen-agers at the  
large, red brick church on the southwest side of the city. More 
than 150 people were in the building. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said the teens were in the sanctuary when the gunman,  
wearing a black jacket, jeans and a white T-shirt, arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hits the door real hard to make his presence known and he  
just immediately started firing,'' said Dan Hughes, the church's 
college minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses told police Ashbrook cursed and made derogatory  
comments about the Baptist religion as he walked around. 
</P>
<P>
	City spokesman Pat Svacina said shortly after the shooting  
began, Ashbrook rolled a pipe bomb down an aisle toward the front 
of the sanctuary. The bomb exploded but caused no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that point, the kids and the adults that were in there  
apparently began realizing that this was not the normal 
situation,'' Svacina said. ``The kids began hiding. We've been told 
that as the kids were scrambling for cover and moving around, that 
shots were being fired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Witness Christy Martin told KDFW-TV: ``He was very calm and  
looked normal and was smoking a cigarette.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the gunfire was over, Hughes said, the gunman ``sat in the  
back pew and put a gun (to his head) and shot himself and fell 
over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities, fearing Ashbrook may have wired himself with  
explosives, sent in a robot to search his body, but found nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Three adults and three teen-agers died inside the church. A  
14-year-old girl died early today. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastor Al Meredith said the victims ``were Sunday school  
teachers and one of the favored soloists in the church, the 
children's choir director, kids, youth members, some active, some 
just getting active, some just beginning to find God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashbrook apparently had lived alone since the death of his  
85-year-old father, Jack, who was described in his obituary as a 
charter member of Pleasant Ridge Church of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda McConn, who has lived in Ashbrook's neighborhood since  
1961 and was a high school classmate of his sister, viewed Ashbrook 
as a harmless eccentric. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always saw him driving around in his father's old Chevy,''  
Ms. McConn said. ``We always just kind of thought he was kind of 
useless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's latest shooting rampage also prompted Clinton  
administration officials to renew calls for tighter curbs on 
handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1999 alone,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said, ``we have  
watched as innocent people were gunned down while attending school, 
while walking home from a church or synagogue, while playing at a 
summer camp, while working in their offices, while delivering mail 
and now while worshiping in their church.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. George W. Bush cut short a presidential campaign trip in  
Michigan to return to Texas and ``add some comfort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to explain how somebody would have enough hatred in  
their heart to walk into a church where people are seeking God's 
guidance and shoot them,'' he said with tears in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Meredith said he hoped to have the church cleared for use by the  
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my heart's desire that if the investigation gets cleared  
up, somehow, some way we can worship God in this facility Sunday 
morning,'' he said. ``Our heart's desire is that the king of 
darkness will not prevail over the kingdom of light.''

<HEADLINE> 8 Dead in Texas Church Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Police today searched the trashed home  
of a man who burst into a church service for teen-agers and spewed 
anti-Baptist rhetoric as he opened fire and rolled a pipe bomb down 
an aisle.

	Seven people were fatally shot Wednesday night before the gunman  
-- identified today as 47-year-old Larry Gene Ashbrook -- killed 
himself in a pew at the Wedgwood Baptist Church. Seven others were

</P>
<P>
	Authorities this morning still had no idea what motivated the  
shooting. Ashbrook carried no note, and none was found during a 
search this morning of his home about 10 minutes from the church. 
</P>
<P>
	Several years-old journals found in the home yielded no clues,

<P>
	The shootings happened during a service for teen-agers at the  
large, red brick church on the southwest side of the city. More 
than 150 people were inside the building, and the Christian rock 
group Forty Days was performing after the annual ``See You at the 
Pole'' gathering at local schools, where students affirm their 
faith and concern for the problems of society by holding prayer 
time around school flagpoles. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said the teens were in the sanctuary when the shooter,  
wearing a black jacket, jeans and a white T-shirt, arrived.

<HEADLINE> Rizzotti Reportedly in at Hartford </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, Conn. (AP) -- Former Connecticut star Jennifer  
Rizzotti will be appointed interim women's head basketball coach at 
the University of Hartford, the Journal Inquirer reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The university's sports information department would neither  
confirm nor deny the report but said it might have a statement 
later Thursday. The newspaper said the announcement would be made 
at a news conference Friday in Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
	Rizzotti, a member of the WNBA champion Houston Comets, would  
replace Allison Jones, who resigned Aug. 30 after seven years. 
Jones had a coaching record of 150-131. 
</P>
<P>
	Rizzotti was a two-time All-American at Connecticut and The  
Associated Press national Player of the Year and Big East Player of 
the Year in 1995-96. She was the point guard on UConn's 35-0 NCAA 
championship team in 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
	She ranks sixth in scoring at Connecticut with 1,540 points. She  
is the Huskies' career leader in assists (637) and is second behind 
Nykesha Sales in steals with 349. 
</P>
<P>
	Rizzotti, of New Fairfield, was a first-round draft choice of  
the New England Blizzard of the ABL in 1996 and was taken by the 
Houston Comets when the ABL folded last year.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Newspaper To Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- After more than a century of publication, The  
Honolulu Star-Bulletin will shut down next month because of 
declining circulation and a suffering bottom line, its publisher 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rupert Phillips, chief executive officer of Liberty Newspapers  
Limited Partnership, the afternoon paper's publisher, told the 
newsroom he is terminating the joint operating agreement with The 
Honolulu Advertiser, a Gannett Co. Inc. morning paper. 
</P>
<P>
	The papers have shared some business and production departments  
since 1962, although their editorial departments have operated 
separately. 
</P>
<P>
	``My career has been spent buying troubled newspapers and  
turning them around,'' Phillips said. ``But it was just something 
we couldn't do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The papers' joint operating agreement was scheduled to end in  
December 2012. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for shutting down the paper, Liberty will receive a  
termination payment from Gannett based on the savings Gannett could 
expect from being relieved of its joint operating obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips refused to discuss the details of that payment except  
to say that investors would recoup at least their initial 
investment. He said the deal does not need Justice Department 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said Liberty initiated the idea of shutting down the  
paper because ``there wouldn't be a buyer for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The paper's last edition is scheduled for the afternoon of Oct.  
30. 
</P>
<P>
	``The staff produced a very good newspaper, but the market no  
longer supports an afternoon newspaper,'' Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Star-Bulletin's circulation is down to 67,533, according to  
the 1999 Editor &AMP; Publisher International Year Book. 
</P>
<P>
	The Advertiser has a circulation of 102,358 for its Monday  
through Saturday editions and 187,887 for its Sunday edition, 
according to the yearbook. 
</P>
<P>
	Both newspapers were started by Henry Whitney, the son of New  
England missionaries who came to the islands in the early 19th 
century when Hawaii was an independent kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitney founded the Pacific Commercial Advertiser, precursor to  
The Honolulu Advertiser, in 1856 and then the Daily Bulletin, the 
forerunner of the Star-Bulletin, in 1882. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Bulletin merged with the Hawaiian Star in 1912.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1961, the Star-Bulletin was purchased by an investor group  
headed by Honolulu financier Chinn Ho. 
</P>
<P>
	The two newspapers entered their joint operating agreement in  
1962, when the Star-Bulletin was Hawaii's dominant newspaper and 
the family-owned Advertiser was on the verge of bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	Gannett, the nation's largest newspaper group, then bought the  
Star-Bulletin in 1971. In early 1993, it sold the newspaper to buy 
the Advertiser in an effort to position itself in the more 
promising morning newspaper market. 
</P>
<P>
	Afternoon newspapers have suffered declining circulation for  
years, hurt by the evening television news and transportation 
problems in delivering newspapers during the afternoon rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
	The Star-Bulletin newsroom has about 85 employees. They will be  
offered a severance package that includes one week's pay for every 
year of service up to 40 years, health benefits until Nov. 30 and 
help in locating jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Star-Bulletin publisher John Flanagan said the Advertiser will  
hire 20 to 30 Star-Bulletin employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hawaii deserves the talents of the people in this room,''  
Flanagan said. ``You have a lot to be proud of. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a hell of a ride.''

<HEADLINE> Sioux Falls Hires Brovelli As Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) -- Jim Brovelli, a former college and NBA  
coach, was hired Thursday as coach of the CBA's Sioux Falls 
Skyforce. 
</P>
<P>
	Brovelli, who coached the University of San Diego and San  
Francisco, came to the NBA in 1995 as director of player

<HEADLINE> Exports Buoy Soybean, Grain Prices / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean and grain prices nudged higher Thursday  
on the Chicago Board of Trade based on a strong showing for U.S. 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans led the way after the release of weekly export sales  
figures that, at 662,200 tons, exceeded expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Also pushing prices higher were long-range forecasts for rain in  
the soybean belt next week, which could stall the harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar export results buoyed corn prices, although that  
commodity was pressured by the short-term prognosis for excellent 
harvesting weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat bounced back slightly after a sharp decline on Wednesday,  
helped by Pakistan's tender for 500,000 tons of U.S. wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 1 3/4 cents to $2.76 1/4 a bushel;  
December corn rose 1/2 cent to $2.12 3/4 a bushel; December oats were 
unchanged at $1.12 3/4 a bushel; November soybeans rose 4 cents to 
$4.93 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures fell on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while pork  
futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle fell .30 cent to 67.37 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle fell .80 cent to 79.17 cents a pound; October 
lean hogs fell .25 cent to 42.52 cents a pound; February frozen 
pork bellies rose .25 cent to 54.27 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Senate Eyes White House FALN Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Judiciary Committee will issue  
subpoenas demanding documents and testimony from administration 
witnesses in the Puerto Rico clemency case, the panel's Republican 
chairman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This committee is a bipartisan committee that's not going to  
be stiffed. Frankly we're just sick and tired of it,'' Sen. Orrin 
Hatch, of Utah, said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Government Reform Committee has already issued  
subpoenas for the clemency documents but has received no response. 
The House committee raised the stakes this week, subpoenaing 
officials at the White House, the Justice Department, FBI and 
Bureau of Prisons to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee spokesman Mark Corallo said if the government  
witnesses failed to appear at the House hearing contempt charges 
would be pursued. 
</P>
<P>
	White House counsel's office spokesman Jim Kennedy said the  
subpoenas were being evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope to have a response as soon as possible,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	At Hatch's hearing Wednesday Democratic Sen. Robert Torricelli,  
of New Jersey, who was instrumental in pushing forward Hillary 
Rodham Clinton's Senate bid in New York, leveled his harshest 
criticism yet at the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I regret greatly the actions of President Clinton,''  
Torricelli said. ``I hope the committee will learn more about his 
motivations and the process so that it's never repeated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have accused Clinton of making the clemency offer to  
imprisoned Puerto Rican separatists as a way to help his wife's 
Senate campaign in New York, home to 1.3 million Puerto Ricans. 
Mrs. Clinton has since come out against the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	At Hatch's hearing, two retired FBI agents, who investigated the  
organization the prisoners belonged to, said that it had a cache of 
bombmaking materials and that assertions that those released from 
prison were not involved in violent activities were misleading. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people are in fact violent and are in fact terrorists,''  
retired Special Agent Richard Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the Rev. C. Nozomi Ikuta of Cleveland, of the United Church  
of Christ, spoke on the freed prisoners' behalf. Ms. Ikuta's church 
had been among groups lobbying for their release and she said none 
of those released had been charged with wounding or killing anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It concerns me greatly to have this body advocate a policy of  
guilt by association,'' Ms. Ikuta told the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	She was questioned extensively, especially when it was learned  
that her group had been able to secure a meetings with Clinton 
administration officials to lobby on behalf of the clemency. 
Victims of FALN bombings said they have also been fighting to get 
such a meeting to make their views against the clemency known but 
never received a response. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has criticized since offering last month to commute the  
sentences of 16 Puerto Rican militants, most of them connected with 
the FALN -- the Spanish initials for Armed Forces of National 
Liberation. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen of the Puerto Ricans accepted the president's offer,  
which required that they renounce violence, and 11 were released 
from prison last week.

<HEADLINE> AOL and Kodak Team Up Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- With digital cameras too pricey for many  
amateur photographers, Eastman Kodak Co. and America Online Inc. 
have teamed up to offer the digital experience at a glossier price. 
</P>
<P>
	A new service will allow people dropping their film off at the  
photofinishers the option of having electronic copies of their 
pictures e-mailed to their AOL account. 
</P>
<P>
	From those accounts, consumers can arrange photos in online  
albums, send them as e-mail to friends and family, or order 
reprints and enlargements. 
</P>
<P>
	The e-picture service -- You've Got Pictures -- will cost AOL  
subscribers $5.95 per roll of film. It is being tested in Rochester 
and a few other cities this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Subscribers need only to check the ``You've Got Pictures'' box  
on the traditional photofinishing order envelopes, enter their AOL 
screen names and let Kodak and AOL do the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The service represents a crucial building block in Kodak's quest  
for a winning business model in the era of digital photography. 
Digital cameras cost roughly twice as much as conventional cameras 
producing photos of comparable quality. 
</P>
<P>
	By aligning with AOL, Kodak gets access to a potential audience  
of 20 million online consumers. AOL is seeking to broaden its 
service with offerings that keep subscribers online longer and 
buying more. 
</P>
<P>
	If testing goes smoothly, national rollout is set for fall.

<HEADLINE> Northwestern QB, NCAA Settle Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Northwestern quarterback Zachary Kustok, who sued  
the NCAA to regain his eligibility, reached a settlement Thursday 
that allows him to play after Sept. 28., according to his lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement makes Kustok eligible for the Wildcats' remaining  
seven games, beginning on Oct. 2 against Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Kustok, 20, sued after the NCAA ruled he could not play in  
Northwestern's first seven games. He spent one season at Notre Dame 
but never got into a game and decided to attend a two-year junior 
college. 
</P>
<P>
	Kustok claims the NCAA compliance officer at the University of  
Kansas told him last fall that he would still have three seasons of 
football eligibility at another Division I-A school if he 
successfully completed one year at a junior college. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA spokesman Jim Marchiony did not immediately return a phone  
call seeking comment on the settlement early Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Kustok's lawyers said details of the settlement were  
confidential. They were unsure why the NCAA decided to settle but 
said the decision came quickly after Kustok's lead lawyer, Peter 
Rush, arranged for a deposition of officials at the University of 
Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Kustok, Zachary's father, said Thursday that his son was  
``excited and happy'' about the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt like this was a very fair offer, and we accepted it,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kustok has been practicing with the team as a backup to  
Wildcats' starting quarterback Nick Kreinbrink and was at practice 
when the announcement was made.

<HEADLINE> Operators Criticize NYC's 911 System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The city's 911 emergency system is a poorly run  
mess, with some callers left waiting on the line for help, 
operators testified Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite official claims that the system is the best in the  
nation, it has been under scrutiny since January, when a man died 
of a heart attack while his girlfriend dialed 911 three times but 
got only busy signals. 
</P>
<P>
	Operators complained to a City Council committee about working  
up to 16 hours a day, high absentee and job turnover rates, 
antiquated equipment, a shortage of Spanish-speaking operators and 
generally low morale. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system goes down 10 to 15 times a day,'' said Barbara  
Terrelonge, a 911 system technician. ``This is happening every 
single day on every single shift.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Operator Diane Mickowski told the committee that because there  
are so few Spanish-speaking operators, Spanish-speaking callers 
must be routed to an AT&AMP;T translating service in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Commissioner Howard Safir said the system, which handles  
10 million calls a year, has failed only twice since January. He 
also insisted that 95 percent of the calls are answered within 30 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're the best. I don't think there's another public  
answering service in the country that works as well as we do,'' he 
told the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Council members were perplexed.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is such a contradiction,'' said council member Stanley  
Michaels.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Tugboat Crew Rescued by Navy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Four hours after abandoning his  
sinking tugboat in 35-foot waves churned up by Hurricane Floyd, 
Gerald Keeth was close to giving up hope. Then, out of the gray 
sky, he spotted a Navy helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	The chopper from the aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy came  
in low and a rescue swimmer jumped in and helped hoist Keeth and 
two of his shipmates from the roller-coaster waves where they were 
bobbing in their life jackets, clinging to a broom handle. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, a second Navy helicopter saved the five other  
tugboat crew members who had been able to make it into a lifeboat 
before the 150-foot vessel sank in the Atlantic Ocean, 350 miles 
off Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a number of times when I doubted they would find  
us,'' Keeth said Thursday from the Kennedy, where the tug crew was 
recuperating from their ordeal. ``I was trying to keep my spirits 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tug, the Gulf Majesty, was on a regular run from  
Jacksonville to Puerto Rico with a 750-foot barge loaded with cargo 
containers when it began talking on water early Wednesday. The crew 
radioed a distress call to the Coast Guard and abandoned the 
sinking ship at 7:35 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	But only five crew members made it into the life raft before the  
rope connecting it to the tug snapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Two SH-60 Seahawk helicopters left the aircraft carrier at 11  
a.m. Keeth and his shipmates set off smoke and signal flares to 
catch their attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were just three orange dots,'' said Petty Officer 3rd  
Class Shad Hernandez, a Navy rescue swimmer. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old sailor from Stanfield, Ore., jumped into the  
angry ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first went in, I didn't know how big the waves were. I  
didn't realize how big they were until we were on the way back,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the helicopter pilot struggled to keep the aircraft steady in  
the 65 mph winds, Hernandez attached rescue straps to two men to be 
hoisted aboard. He rode up with the third. 
</P>
<P>
	``It went real quick. I was in the water only 11 minutes,''  
Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did everything by the numbers,'' Keeth said. ``And they  
did it extremely well. He jumped in the water without any 
hestitation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The five in the life raft were saved about four hours later.  
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez said he has been training as a rescue swimmer for two  
years, but this was the first time he had saved anyone. ``It came 
down to remembering what I learned, '' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kennedy was one of several Navy ships that had been ordered  
to leave port on Monday to ride the storm out at sea.

<HEADLINE> NBC Buys 32 Percent Stake in Paxson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Adding another important outlet for its  
programming, NBC is paying $415 million for a 32 percent stake in 
Paxson Communications Corp., one of the nation's biggest owners of 
television stations. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Thursday after days of speculation also may  
help revive Paxson's year-old PAX network, adding highly rated NBC 
shows to a lineup dominated by reruns of family-friendly shows like 
``Touched by an Angel'' and ``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Details are still being worked out on which NBC shows PAX would  
use. But with the PAX network committed to keeping to its diet of 
low-sex, low-violence programs, racy NBC shows such as ``Saturday 
Night Live'' and ``Late Night with Conan O'Brien'' are unlikely 
candidates for the crossover. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll work through the programming issues slowly,'' NBC  
president and CEO Bob Wright said on a conference call. 
</P>
<P>
	For NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., the deal's main  
attraction is access to Paxson's 72 broadcast stations located 
around the country. Many of them are relatively small, low-powered 
stations, but they reach some 30 percent of U.S. households. 
</P>
<P>
	The additional broadcast outlets could boost awareness for NBC  
shows, possibly helping them run at least four seasons -- the 
minimum time needed to produce enough episodes for a profitable run 
in rerun syndication. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal won't displace Paxson's top management, including  
chairman Bud Paxson, who co-founded the Home Shopping Network in 
1982 before creating Paxson Communications as a radio company. 
Paxson expanded into small TV stations in the early 1990s and went 
public in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement also grants NBC the right to acquire a controlling  
interest in Paxson after February 2002, but even the recently 
relaxed federal rules on station ownership would still prevent that 
sort of arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current rules, no company can own stations that reach more  
than 35 percent of all U.S. households. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC is already near that cap, with its own 13 powerful broadcast  
outlets reaching about 27 percent of the nation's homes. 
NBC-affiliated stations reach far more, but most of those are owned 
by other companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Large media companies have been lobbying to get the cap lifted.  
The new company to be formed from the blockbuster merger announced 
last week between CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc. would reach 41 percent 
of households, but executives at those companies said they would 
sell off or swap stations if needed to comply with federal rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller owners of TV stations oppose any increase in the cap.  
They fear greater concentration of station ownership, especially by 
networks that distribute programming, would put smaller players in 
a weak position when negotiating to get shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Another attraction of the deal with Paxson would be eventually  
allowing NBC to own more than one station in the same market, which 
could greatly increase profitability for both stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Having two stations in the same city, or a ``duopoly,'' became  
permissible under a ruling just last month by the Federal 
Communications Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, it's not clear that Paxson would be willing sell off  
individual stations to NBC, and with current rules barring NBC's 
outright takeover of Paxson, it's not clear that either company 
would be able to fully take advantage of the duopoly ruling any 
time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the FCC's ruling last month appears to have been a  
major catalyst behind the CBS-Viacom merger, and speculation has 
been rife that other deals could be in the works as station owners 
swap or sell stations to form duopolies. 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson chairman Bud Paxson said talks between his company and  
NBC had been ongoing for several months but picked up steam after 
the FCC's ruling last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson's stock has been rising in recent weeks amid speculation  
that a deal was in the works. But on Thursday, Paxson's stock 
slipped $1.06 1/4, or 7 percent, to $14 on the American Stock 
Exchange. The preferred Paxson stock that NBC is getting in the 
deal is convertible at $13.01 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	GE's shared rose $1.25 to $117.25 on the New York Stock  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Paxson deal allows NBC access to more distribution  
outlets, the CBS-Viacom merger last week led to some speculation 
that NBC, now the only network not affiliated with a major 
production studio, would be forced to fill that gap. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there are serious doubts about how crucial such an  
alliance would be. Disney has had trouble integrating its own 
studio with the ABC network, acquired in 1996, and analysts note 
that NBC has managed to remain the most profitable network for 
years despite going it alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure that every banker on Wall Street is going to pitch  
them to buy a studio, but I would argue that they certainly don't 
need to given that they are already the most profitable network in 
the country,'' said Lazard Freres &AMP; Co. broadcast analyst Chris 
Ensley.

<HEADLINE> FCC Ruling Allows Cheaper Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a move that could bring down international  
calling rates, federal regulators decided Wednesday to give U.S. 
companies direct access to the global satellite consortium 
Intelsat. 
</P>
<P>
	The unanimous ruling by the Federal Communications Commission  
will allow companies -- mostly large telephone carriers and TV 
networks -- to bypass Comsat Corp. in getting services from 
Intelsat. The FCC predicted companies will save 10 to 71 percent by 
being able to go around Comsat, the U.S. signatory to the 
consortium. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman Bill Kennard said the decision reflects the  
commission's commitment to helping reduce international calling 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are working to deliver to U.S. consumers lower prices for  
international satellite services,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers could see the greatest benefits in international calls  
to developing countries, FCC officials said. While about 20 percent 
of overall international voice traffic is delivered via satellite, 
60 percent of calls to developing nations are carried by satellite 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Carriers will probably pass savings to consumers, the commission  
believes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly expect that consumers will benefit,'' concurred  
MCI spokesman Peter Lucht. But when and to what extent were 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	But Comsat already has reduced rates to major telecommunications  
carriers by more than 55 percent in the past six years, said 
spokesman Jay Ziegler. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our question is where have consumers received the benefits of  
those savings?'' Ziegler said. He said Comsat is forced to price 
competitively because its customers have other choices in the 
marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators said the move will enable U.S companies to operate on  
a level playing field with businesses in 94 other countries that 
are allowed to go directly to Intelsat. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. customers accessing Intelsat directly still will have to  
pay a surcharge of 5.58 percent to Comsat for certain expenses it 
incurs as a signatory. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC also voted Wednesday to allow defense contractor  
Lockheed Martin Corp. to purchase up to 49 percent of Comsat, as 
the two companies seek to merge. 
</P>
<P>
	But for Lockheed to acquire all of Comsat, Congress would have  
to lift current Comsat ownership limits written into a 1962 law. 
Then, the companies could submit an application to the FCC for a 
full merger review, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Comsat, based in Bethesda, Md., was chartered by Congress in  
1962 to keep then-telephone monopoly AT&AMP;T from extending its 
control to international satellite communications.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Forces Postponements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Oakland Athletics, with two games in Baltimore postponed by  
Hurricane Floyd, have to worry about getting away from the East 
Coast, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain forced postponement of Wednesday's game between the  
Athletics and Orioles, and the expected full-force arrival of the 
hurricane also caused today's game to be called off. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also concern the Athletics might have a tough time  
getting out of Baltimore. They were due to fly home tonight to open 
a weekend series against Kansas City on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The games between the Athletics and Orioles probably will be  
made up as part of a doubleheader Sept. 23, an off day for both 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Athletics-Orioles series wasn't the only sports event  
affected by the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	The first round of the BC Open in Endicott, N.Y., was postponed,  
with organizers still hoping to get in the full four rounds through 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight's NHL preseason game between the Detroit Red Wings and  
New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden was called off. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in New York, inclement weather wiped out the racing  
schedule at Belmont Park. Across the Hudson River in New Jersey, 
the cards at Monmouth Park and The Meadowlands were washed away. 
</P>
<P>
	In Greenville, S.C., the storm forced postponement of  
Wednesday's NHL exhibition game between the Carolina Hurricanes and 
Atlanta Thrashers. The game will be played Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Fort Mill, S.C., the Charlotte Knights postponed Game 3 of  
their Triple-A baseball championship series against Durham. It was 
rescheduled for tonight at 7:15 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Floyd also forced Jacksonville Jaguars coach Tom  
Coughlin to cancel practice Wednesday in preparation for Sunday's 
game against the Carolina Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	Severe weather at the northwest end of the hurricane moved into  
Charlotte by midday, but the Panthers held practice anyway, working 
out for nearly two hours at their three-field complex adjacent to 
the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina State practiced inside Wednesday in preparation  
for Saturday's game at No. 1 Florida State. Coach Mike O'Cain hopes 
conditions today would allow at least a team meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Savannah State's football team moved inland to escape Hurricane  
Floyd. The NCAA Division II Tigers boarded two buses Tuesday for a 
road trip to Tennessee-Chattanooga, leaving three days early. 
</P>
<P>
	For some teams, the storm turned out to be a positive thing.  
</P>
<P>
	Although classes were canceled at the University of Florida on  
Wednesday, the teaching effort was intensified in the football 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA rules say that on days when classes aren't in session,  
coaches don't have to adhere to the four-hour time limit with 
players. So the No. 4 Gators got extra preparation time for 
Saturday's game against No. 2 Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gators met twice, once more than usual. Later, the practice  
scheduled for indoors was moved back outside because severe weather 
never materialized in Gainesville, which is located about 75 miles 
inland from the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got a lot of meeting time in,'' coach Steve Spurrier said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Gators planned to return to a normal schedule today.

<HEADLINE> Man Drops Out of Coed Boxing Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BREMERTON, Wash. (AP) -- The man slated to fight a woman in a  
coed boxing match has pulled out, the fight's promoter said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the fight will go on with a different male boxer, said Bob  
Jarvis of Tom O'Malley Promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	Hector Morales of Vancouver, British Columbia, was to fight  
Margaret McGregor of Bremerton on Oct. 9. But Morales pulled out, 
after becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the idea, Jarvis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He kept talking about all the publicity the fight has  
received,'' Jarvis said. ``He kept saying he couldn't believe how 
many phone calls he has received, how many newspaper stories have 
been written and how many broadcast stories have been aired. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, I can't blame him. ``For a guy making his pro debut,  
the world spotlight would be a hard thing to deal with, especially 
from the male point of view.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morales' trainer, Loi Chow, also a lightweight boxer, signed a  
contract agreeing to take Morales' place should he withdraw, Jarvis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new matchup needs approval from the Washington State Boxing  
Commission, which gave the go-ahead to the Morales-McGregor bout 
after considering it for three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``She wants this to happen,'' said McGregor's trainer, Vern  
Miller, who said he's optimistic the second fight will be approved. 
Miller said Chow is an equal match for McGregor, who has a 3-0 
professional record against women.

<HEADLINE> Quayle: I'm a Reformer at Heart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEDFORD, N.H. (AP) -- Former Vice President Dan Quayle said  
Thursday that the key to reforming America is to reform the 
Republican party -- and that he's the candidate to do both. 
</P>
<P>
	``The party needs to have a wake-up call as to what is really  
going on at the grassroots level,'' he told business people and 
professionals at a political breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am a reformer at heart,'' he said. ``The best thing for  
America is to change and to be progressive and to look to the 
future to decide what you need to do to make America's future 
proud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In part, the wake-up call already has sounded with New Hampshire  
Sen. Bob Smith's defection from the party and continue his run for 
president as an independent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I identify with (Smith's) frustration,'' Quayle said. ``I  
disagree profoundly with his decision to leave the party. But it 
was a tough decision. He gave up a lot. And now we read about Pat 
Buchanan ... saying that he too may leave the party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan has said he will announce soon whether he will leave  
the GOP and run as the Reform Party's presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the media and the pundits and the pollsters and those  
folks will dismiss all this as a bunch of malcontents,'' Quayle 
said. But the problem is much bigger, he said: ``There is something 
very fundamental going on in our party and in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle said he could unite the diverse factions in the party and  
bring independents and so-called ``Reagan Democrats'' on board by 
emphasizing key issues such as term limits, tax cuts, school 
vouchers and a firm foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hierarchy in our party is more interested in just winning  
than having a serious discussion of ideas that provide for 
winning,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a genuine frustration among rank-and-file  
Republicans, who see little difference between the Republican 
establishment and the Democratic establishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle appeared unfazed by his poor showing in state polls -- 3  
percent of likely New Hampshire GOP primary voters said they'd vote 
for Quayle in a WMUR-TV-CNN poll released this week. He said his 
message would win out over money. 
</P>
<P>
	``The person who has the idea, the person who has the energy to  
communicate that idea, who has the dedication to the reform agenda 
which I just articulated is going to be the one that will be the 
nominee of out party,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle has said he has enough money to get through the New  
Hampshire primary and will evaluate his support after that.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls, Japanese Stocks Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar continued its slide against the yen  
today, sending Japanese stocks to close sharply lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 104.99 yen in late afternoon trading, down  
1.57 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo but above its late New York 
level of 104.23 yen on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average plunged 485.63  
points, or 2.73 percent, to close at 17,291.59. On Tuesday, the 
average closed down 132.07 points, or 0.74 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets in Tokyo were closed Wednesday for a national  
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, a surprise announcement out of Tokyo about  
a meeting between Japan's top two monetary officials led to a 
nearly 1-yen spike in the dollar, as Asian traders' bid the U.S. 
currency up on expectations that Japan was ready to get serious 
about slowing the yen's rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong yen makes Japanese exports more expensive abroad and  
thus less competitive, reducing the value of earnings of 
export-oriented Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, after the dollar plunged to a 44-month low of 103.20 yen  
in London on Wednesday, the market remained extremely jittery 
during much of trading today as it awaited possible dollar-buying 
moves from the Bank of Japan, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said today that the yen's sharp rise  
against the dollar will damage Japan's emergence from a long 
economic downturn. 
</P>
<P>
	The government will consider such steps as foreign exchange  
intervention, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Zembei Mizoguchi, head of the international  
bureau at Japan's Ministry of Finance, said that the recent yen 
strengthening was ``too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The national Yomiuri newspaper reported today that the Bank of  
Japan is consulting U.S. and European finance authorities about 
possible joint dollar-buying intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen has been gaining ground against the greenback as  
European and U.S. investors bid up the Japanese currency in hopes 
of an early recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 109.47 yen, down  
from 110.24 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices fell from the start of the session  
with investors wary over steep drops in U.S. stocks and the 
dollar's continued fall against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pace of recent yen rise is too fast and foreign investors  
are locking in profits,'' said Hiroichi Nishi, deputy general 
manager at Nikko Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 108.91, or 1  
percent, to 10,801.42 at Wednesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section closed down 29.01 points, or 1.90 percent, to 
1,495.78. The TOPIX closed down 10.44 points, or 0.68 percent, on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell  
to 1.6950 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.7050 percent. Its 
price rose 0.09 points to 101.75.

<HEADLINE> NYC Opera Performs Rare Rossini </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A rare Rossini opera featuring 18 solo voices  
made its debut at the New York City Opera. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Journey to Rheims,'' a comic opera Rossini wrote to  
celebrate the 1825 coronation of Charles X of France, bowed Tuesday 
night at the New York State Theater. During intermission, Beverly 
Sills, general director of City Opera for 10 years, was honored. 
</P>
<P>
	Though City Opera's production of the Rossini opera was  
exceedingly silly, the work is filled with gorgeous music. It was 
written for three times the usual number of singers for opera 
buffa. Rossini was trying to impress the opera world, hoping to be 
asked to move from the Theatre Italien to the Paris Opera. It 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
	The opera gives singers a succession of arias, with a few duets.  
Because it was written for a specific occasion, Rossini withdrew 
the work and then used some of the music three years later in 
``Count Ory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	City Opera put 18 excellent singers on stage, from coloratura  
Sally Wolf who organized hotel servants in Scene 1 to Swedish 
soprano Camilla Tilling, who made her debut and sang the final 
aria. 
</P>
<P>
	The zany romp, staged by James Robinson on Allen Moyer's set,  
moves from hotel hallway to a big room with a pool. Anna Oliver's 
costumes are lavish, using white for servants' starched garb and as 
well as for aristocrats' more luxurious outfits. 
</P>
<P>
	The plot is simple. Elegant people from several European nations  
meet at a spa in Plombieres, France, on their way to Rheims for 
Charles X's coronation. European unity was in Rossini's mind but, 
in this staging, individual eccentricities, rivalries and romance 
are emphasized. 
</P>
<P>
	As one singer comments, ``I guess you could call the world a big  
cage of loony birds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After intermission, Paul Kellogg, general and artistic director  
of the company, read from a New York Times review of Sills' debut 
Nov. 3, 1955, as Rosalinda in ``Die Fledermaus,'' which praised her 
singing, acting and the glint in her eye. 
</P>
<P>
	A film clip showed Sills singing ``Care Nome'' on television  
when she was 10, guesting on recent talk shows and singing at her 
farewell concert in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Sills spoke briefly and graciously, saying her favorite spot in  
the New York State Theater was a foot from center front. After 
their last ``Julius Caesar'' together, bass-baritone Norman Treigle 
marked the spot with her initials and told her, ``Six square inches 
of this theater will always be yours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, this is the greatest opera company in the world,''  
Sills said.

<HEADLINE>  Boxer Vargas Sues His Accuser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTEBELLO, Calif. (AP) -- Unbeaten IBF junior middleweight  
champion Fernando Vargas claims he's the victim, not the 
perpetrator. 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, he's gone to court.  
</P>
<P>
	Vargas, one of his cousins and three others have pleaded  
innocent to assault charges stemming from a July 25 fight in an 
apartment in Summerland, Calif., just outside of Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas also is named in a civil suit filed by Doug Rossi, who  
claims he was beaten after breaking up a fight between Vargas and 
another man. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnoldo Casillas, one of Vargas' lawyers, said his client filed  
a countersuit Wednesday in Santa Barbara, alleging the boxer was 
struck with a pipe. The suit seeks $5 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously I was the victim; I have the scars and I had the  
contusions to prove it,'' Vargas said at his lawyers' offices, 
displaying photographs showing a large welt across his back. ``I 
feel I've been treated unfairly because of who I am. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. At no time  
did I commit a crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another of his lawyers, Gregory Moreno, held a photograph of  
Vargas' injured back as the boxer spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas, 21, of Oxnard, Calif., has alleged that Rossi and  
Anthony Arria beat him on July 25. Neither was charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas and the other defendants are charged with assault with a  
deadly weapon and conspiracy to commit a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``A review of the police reports prepared by the Santa Barbara  
sheriff's department clearly established a reason to charge 
Fernando Vargas, and the others he was with, with assault on Doug 
Rossi,'' deputy district attorney Hilary Dozer said. ``There was no 
basis for the reverse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vargas is charged with assault with a deadly weapon, he's  
charged with conspiracy. The injuries to Doug Rossi were of such 
severity that the law allows for increased punishment for that 
behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Rossi received bruises and a broken finger.  
</P>
<P>
	Rossi's lawyers in the civil suit, which seeks unspecified  
damages, didn't return calls from The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``I only blame myself for putting myself in that position,''  
Vargas said. ``I am not repentant for anything else. Why should I 
be?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A preliminary hearing is to be scheduled.  
</P>
<P>
	Conviction on the assault charges could carry a prison term of  
almost eight years, Dozer said. Charged along with Vargas are his 
cousin, Ernesto Vargas, 27; Carlos Lopez, 28; Freddie Flores, 21, 
and Vincent Arenas, 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas is 17-0 and has stopped all of his opponents. Earlier in  
July, he successfully defended his title by knocking out Raul 
Marquez.

<HEADLINE> Auto Rally To Tackle China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- World championship rally drivers are in China for  
a run over some of the most treacherous terrain they have ever 
raced on. 
</P>
<P>
	The China Rally begins Friday at the foot of the Great Wall.  
</P>
<P>
	Tommi Makinen and Juha Kankkunen of Finland are among  
competitors in the 71-team field for the Friday-Sunday event which 
begins in Huairou, north of Beijing, and covers 890-miles of rural, 
often mountainous roads. 
</P>
<P>
	Rural roads in China resemble obstacle courses, with massive  
coal trucks wheezing up hills and barreling across valleys, often 
against oncoming traffic, while ox carts, bicyclists and others 
struggle for space. The roads just outside Beijing tend to be as 
rough as anywhere. Part of the race route had to be changed because 
of flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally's web site urged drivers to exercise ``extreme  
caution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Much of the local traffic is slow moving and in many cases  
villagers are unused to faster traffic. Do not assume traffic or 
pedestrians will give way,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drivers face speed limits as low as 30 mph when they're not  
racing in active stages. Three breaches of local traffic rules and 
you're out. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-time defending world champion Makinen, who dropped out of  
last month's Finland Rally with transmission trouble, leads the 
drivers' standings with 48 points for Mitsubishi. 
</P>
<P>
	The mostly gravel route in China may well suit Kankkunen, who  
performed well under similar conditions in the Greek Rally in June.

	UAW, DaimlerChrysler Reach Deal  
</P>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- The United Auto Workers and  
DaimlerChrysler AG reached a tentative agreement today on a new 
national contract for 75,000 workers. Terms of the agreement were 
not immediately announced. A UAW spokesman, Frank Joyce, declined 
to provide details and said a ratification vote has yet to be 
scheduled. The deal came after a marathon round of negotiations 
between the UAW and the company formed by the merger of Chrysler 
Corp. and Germany's Daimler-Benz AG. The UAW's negotiating team was 
headed by President Stephen P. Yokich after the death of vice 
president Jack Laskowski in August.

	BT, AT&AMP;T in Mobile Phone Alliance  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British Telecom PLC and AT&AMP;T, two of the world's  
biggest telephone companies, have formed an alliance to provide 
mobile telephone services around the world. The companies already 
provide wireless services in 17 countries with a combined customer 
base of 41 million, they said in today's announcement. ``If you 
travel, you expect your BT or AT&AMP;T digital phone to work anywhere 
and everywhere with all of the advanced features you have -- just as 
if you were at home. This is not possible in many cases today for a 
whole host of reasons, including incompatible technology and 
government regulation,'' said John Zeglis, president of AT&AMP;T. 

</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T Wants To Cut Jobs  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's tricky business, AT&AMP;T has found, to shrink  
and expand at the same time. Confronted with a revenue-draining 
price war in long distance, yet determined to press ahead with its 
expensive bet on using cable TV wires for Internet and telephone 
service, AT&AMP;T is looking to cut more jobs on top of the 20,000 
eliminated last year. The nation's largest long-distance telephone 
and cable company said yesterday it froze hiring about a month ago 
to help meet those challenges, which come on top of a pledge made 
in April to cut $2 billion in expenses by the end of next year. 
Company officials said certain units, especially long-distance and 
administrative, will have to shrink so that rapid-growers such as 
the wireless and Internet divisions can flourish. 

</P>

	Jobless Claims Fall by 4,000  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lines at the nation's unemployment offices  
were slightly shorter last week. The Labor Department reported 
today that 288,000 Americans filed first-time claims for 
unemployment benefits the week ended Sept. 11, down by 4,000 from 
the previous week. A four week moving average of jobless claims, 
which analysts watch more closely, changed little, falling by just 
250 to 288,750. Economists consider jobless claims levels below 
300,000 an indication of an extremely tight labor market. Claims 
have hovered below that mark for eight consecutive weeks now, and 
have not strayed far above it all year.

	Industrial Production Report Due  
</P>
<P>

	Congress Studies Day Trading  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is taking its first look today at the  
risky but popular practice of electronic day-trading, six weeks 
after exasperated trader Mark Barton shot and killed nine people at 
two day-trading firms in Atlanta before killing himself. A hearing 
is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. EDT today by the Governmental Affairs 
subcommittee on investigations, chaired by Sen. Susan Collins, 
R-Maine. 

</P>
<P>
	Federal Panel Studies Internet Taxes  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Before a federal panel can decide whether  
Congress should permit state sales taxes on Internet commerce, it 
must determine whether there's any practical way to do that. 
``We've got to figure out if there is a workable solution,'' said 
Gov. Mike Leavitt, R-Utah. ``We're not presupposing what should be 
done.'' The Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce, while 
sharply divided on the cyberspace tax question, voted unanimously 
yesterday to invite submission of detailed proposals on whether the 
multiple state systems can be modified to collect sales taxes from 
out-of-state Internet, catalog or telephone sales.

	Insurers Cut Back on Hurricane Coverage  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd's anticipated wake of costly  
damages is expected to shine a spotlight on changes to the 
insurance industry in the seven years since Hurricane Andrew tore 
across southern Florida. While companies have taken steps to ensure 
they can pay claims, they've also cut back on coverage, leaving 
some to fear that policyholders could be forced to foot more of the 
bill if their property is destroyed. The $15 billion in damages 
caused by Andrew after it swept across the southern tip of Florida 
in 1992 forced about 10 regional insurance companies out of 
business.

	Asian Stock Markets Close Lower  
</P>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets ended lower today on a  
combination of Wall Street's overnight slide, the weakening U.S. 
dollar and interest rate worries. Japanese stocks fell sharply as 
investor sentiment worsened amid the U.S. dollar's slide against 
the yen. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average plunged 485.63 points, 
or 2.73 percent, to close at 17,291.59. In Seoul, prices on the 
Korea Stock Exchange plunged 3.8 percent on fears that local 
interest rates might rise further. The Kospi index shed 36.53 
points to 916.16. Singapore prices fell on the weakness throughout 
the region. The benchmark Straits Times Index fell 30.74 points, or 
1.5 percent, to 2,089.84.

	Stocks Tumble Despite Good CPI News  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors brushed off a government report that  
showed little evidence of rising inflation and drove stocks lower 
yesterday. The dollar's weakness against the Japanese yen continued 
to undercut stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 108.91 
points, or by 1 percent, to close at 10,801.42. The index had 
tumbled from an early gain of 103 points, with the selloff gaining 
momentum in the final hour of trading. Broader stock indicators 
also closed lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 18.32 to 
1,317.97. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 54.12 to 
2,814.17, more than reversing Tuesday's gains.

<HEADLINE> California Governor To Endorse Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis is making official today what  
the political world has known for months: He supports Al Gore's 
presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
	As the vice president and Davis hopscotch California today,  
Davis plans to announce at each stop his endorsement of Gore, aides 
to the governor and other Democrats said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Al Gore understands California,'' said a Davis aide who spoke  
on the condition of anonymity. ``He has championed the issues close 
to Californians, like education, public safety, the environment, 
choice and sensible gun control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	California's rank as the most populous state makes it  
particularly important in presidential politics. The state controls 
54 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis's endorsement will formally cement a personal and  
political relationship between the two Democrats that has grown 
increasingly close in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, just weeks before Davis was inaugurated, a deep  
freeze ruined much of California's citrus crop. Davis called Gore, 
who helped $9.3 million in federal aid move quickly to farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Davis aide said that type of action will make a difference  
in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is competing against former Sen. Bill Bradley for the  
Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The aide said Davis would campaign extensively with Gore to help  
win over California voters. 
</P>
<P>
	It remains to be seen whether Davis's endorsement will prove  
beneficial to Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Davis won the governor's office by 20 percentage points  
in November, polls indicate many Californians cannot identify Davis 
as the governor. A poll in August gave Davis a 61 percent approval 
rating. 
</P>
<P>
	Support for Davis remains strong in one key voter bloc: labor  
union members. 
</P>
<P>
	``Governor Davis has clearly shown he is one of the greatest  
Democratic vote-getters in the recent history of this state,'' 
Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Gore, said Thursday. ``He's got a 
tremendous organization that reaches to all corners of the state. 
... Obviously we would love to get the support of Governor Davis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and Davis were scheduled to appear in Santa Monica, Fresno  
and San Francisco today. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, California's two Democratic senators, Barbara  
Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, and 17 other members of the state's 
congressional delegation endorsed Gore.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Digs Out From Typhoon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- The skies over Hong Kong were gray but calm  
early Friday in the wake of Typhoon York, the most powerful storm 
to hit the territory in 16 years. York knocked windows out of 
skyscrapers and yanked trees from the ground as the normally 
bustling city collapsed into chaos. 
</P>
<P>
	One man died after being struck by flying debris, another person  
was still missing and at least 493 people were injured -- 11 
seriously -- as York pounded Hong Kong with hurricane-force winds 
for nearly 11 hours Thursday. Most of the victims were hit by 
flying glass or other objects. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's early morning buzz was subdued Friday, as drivers  
moved cautiously through roads still littered by fallen trees. Some 
streets were covered by shards of glass that plunged from 
skyscrapers as the storm blew out windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferry services resumed, some kids headed back to school and  
businesses and financial markets were reopening. 
</P>
<P>
	But chaos reigned at Chek Lap Kok airport, where some 465  
flights were canceled or delayed Thursday. The backlog persisted 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Peak Tram, which moves people up and down the steep Victoria  
Peak that dominates Hong Kong Island, was closed because of fallen 
trees on the track. 
</P>
<P>
	Typhoon York forced the Hong Kong Observatory to post a No. 10  
hurricane warning, the highest level advisory it issues during 
tropical storms; it indicates a direct hit on the territory. Hong 
Kong had not taken a direct hit since Typhoon Ellen struck in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	By early Friday, meteorologists had taken down all storm  
warnings and Hong Kong was experiencing mainly light, scattered 
rains. 
</P>
<P>
	It was too soon to estimate the monetary value of the damage,  
but it was sure to come into the millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Some windows blew out of downtown buildings more than 40 stories  
up. Small businesses and homes were battered, with scaffolding 
ripped off buildings and signs thrown to the ground or left barely 
dangling in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 700 people sought refuge in emergency shelters, while  
authorities ordered some residents out of dwellings that appeared 
unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
	The typhoon triggered flooding across the territory and raised  
fears of landslides, though those reported were minor. Remote 
villages lost power and firefighters said around 400 people were 
trapped in elevators as the electricity went out in some of the 
high-rise apartment houses that make up the Kowloon skyline across 
the harbor from Hong Kong Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners of small businesses were out washing windows early Friday  
and cleaning up the littered sidewalks in front of their shops. 
</P>
<P>
	One man was still missing: A rescue canoeist who had been out  
searching for two surfers who went out in the big waves on a nearby 
island but were found alive. Two meteorological workers reported 
missing in a remote mountainous area were found safe early Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Typhoon York moved west across Hong Kong before hitting the  
Portuguese enclave of Macau then making landfall in the southern 
mainland Chinese city of Zhuhai late Thursday night.

<HEADLINE> Milk Flap Pits Northeast Vs Midwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The political battle over milk is heating up  
as Congress nears consideration of whether to toss out the 
Agriculture Department's overhaul of milk-pricing policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan will take effect Oct. 1 unless Congress blocks it. It  
is intended to smooth regional disparities in the prices farmers 
get for their milk, but it would benefit the upper Midwest to the 
detriment of producers in the South and East. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last six years alone, Wisconsin has lost over 7,000  
dairy farmers,'' said one lawmaker who backs the Agriculture 
Department plan, GOP Rep. Mark Green of Wisconsin. ``Without 
reforms, we will continue to see the wholesale departure of these 
family farms throughout our state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Englanders -- with support from parts of the Northeast and  
the South -- have regrouped in wake of the Senate's refusal last 
month to extend their region's dairy compact, which expires Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	They are fighting the new plan but also working, through a  
separate agriculture spending bill, to renew and expand the 
Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers heard from about 250 farmers, from Mississippi to  
Maine, who pressed their case Wednesday on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know the clock is ticking,'' said Sen. Jim Jeffords,  
R-Vt., a leader of the pro-compact coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's proposal won overwhelming supported from dairy  
farmers in a referendum last month. Critics say farmers only 
supported it because the alternative -- deregulation of milk prices 
-- was worse. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would scrap the federal government's Depression-era  
system for setting minimum prices for fluid milk based on a farm's 
distance from Eau Claire, Wis. Farmers who lived the farthest away 
could charge the most. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, the government wanted to encourage milk production  
in areas of scarcity. But today, many say the system is outdated. 
</P>
<P>
	The department wants to consolidate the 31 regions for setting  
milk prices into 11 and scrap the Eau Claire method of pricing. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation by Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., would block that plan and  
implement an alternative closer to the current pricing system. A 
vote on the bill, which has drawn many cosponsors, must come in the 
next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., has proposed an amendment  
to extend and expand the Northeast compact. New Englanders hope it 
will be included in a House-Senate bill to fund agriculture 
programs in fiscal 2000, which starts Oct. 1.

<HEADLINE> Beetle Prompts Pine Quarantine / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Vermont forest officials plan to impose a  
quarantine on pine from Essex County after a non-native beetle was 
trapped there this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The small black pine shoot beetle, which has damaged trees in  
Scandinavia, has already prompted quarantines in several other 
states. Brent Teillon, the chief of forest protection for the 
Vermont Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation, decided to 
institute a quarantine in Vermont only because federal law requires 
it. If Vermont doesn't quarantine a specific area, the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture will quarantine pine from the whole 
state, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it's caused serious damage in Finland and Norway, the  
beetle hasn't caused very much damage in infested areas in the 
United States or southern Canada, Teillon said. Officials aren't 
sure why. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarantine will take effect Dec. 1.  
</P>
<P>
	``My personal feeling is this is, to date, not a quarantinable  
pest, but from the background and what it does in Europe, we can't 
take that chance,'' Teillon said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The beetles were first found at a Christmas tree farm in Ohio in  
1992. Now Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, New York, 
Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Wisconsin have counties under 
quarantine, the U.S. Forest Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Vermont officials knew the beetles were in nearby  
Quebec, they set traps in pine plantations last spring. They caught 
several beetles in the Essex County towns of Island Pond and 
Canaan. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarantine won't stop shipment of all pine from Essex  
County, but it will regulate the shipment of articles that might 
contain the beetle, including some pine Christmas trees and logs 
that have bark, which is where the beetles live. Wreaths and 
wreath-making materials won't be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarantine doesn't apply to spruce and balsam fir, which are  
the trees most favored by Christmas tree growers. But it does apply 
to red and white pine, so plantations and log shippers will be hit 
hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Essex County depends on logging -- that's a big item,'' Teillon  
said. ``White pine is the species that's going to be impacted the 
most, as far as the trade goes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The quarantine will require that mills outside of Essex County  
remove the bark from Essex County logs and compost it for a 
specific period of time, said Scott Pfister, the plant pathologist 
at the Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarantine will be felt most by officials who have to  
inspect trees in person for damage from the beetles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to require some extra paperwork and steps for a lot  
of industries; it's going to require a lot of extra work for us in 
the state because we're going to be running around inspecting 
trees,'' Pfister said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, loggers in Essex County, Vermont's least populous  
county, harvested about 3 1/2 million feet of white pine worth about a 
million dollars, said Jack Dwyer, marketing utilization and 
development director for Forests and Parks.

<HEADLINE> Celebrity Slot Machines Take Vegas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Stuff a quarter in a slot machine these days  
and a lot more happens than it used to. Along with the bells and 
symbols now comes a stereo sound system, dancing figures and Dick 
Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrities like Clark who usually grace the television screen  
are now popping up on slot machines, shouting encouragement to 
gamblers and helping casinos take in big money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, yes, yes! Congratulations,'' Barbara Eden shouts to  
players on the new ``I Dream of Jeannie'' slot machine displayed 
this week at the World Gaming Congress &AMP; Expo 1999. When gamblers 
don't hit a winning combination, Eden consoles them: ``I'm sorry, 
master.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about giving them a more entertaining experience,''  
said Ed Rogich, spokesman for Reno-based International Game 
Technology, the world's leading producer of slot machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The days of the one-armed bandit aren't over, they're just  
changing with the times. Most of the new interactive slot machines 
don't even come with a handle -- all the playing is done by pushing 
buttons. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrity slot machines are just another example of how gambling  
and entertainment are coming together, Rogich said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's new wave of slot machines began several years ago  
with the ``Wheel of Fortune'' machine. Players don't get to solve 
puzzles, but they do get to spin the wheel after lining up symbols. 
</P>
<P>
	The machine turned out to be IGT's most successful slot machine  
ever. Now with help from Eden, Clark, NASCAR legend Richard Petty 
and even Pink Panther, IGT hopes it has hit the jackpot again. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark's game is centered around New Year's Eve. Play for a few  
minutes and Clark will begin the countdown, ``10, 9, 8 ...'' and 
the champagne starts popping. After racking up coins on the Petty 
machine, players get to drive the car with Petty yelling, ``Pass to 
the right.'' Play an Elvis slot machine, which are already in 
casinos, and you can select a gold album to listen to while you 
spin the reels. 
</P>
<P>
	The new celebrity slots should be in casinos by the first of the  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``They sure keep coming up with new ones,'' Maggie McGehee, 55,  
of Coffeyville, Kan., said as she stuffed quarters into a ``Wheel 
of Fortune'' slot machines at the Las Vegas Hilton. ``I love 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even ``The Addams Family'' and ``The Munsters'' are making an  
appearance on slot machines. Want to ``fry'' Uncle Fester or have 
``Thing'' pretend to hand you money? 
</P>
<P>
	``It's wild,'' concluded Brian Southwood, an assistant general  
manager at Dubuque, Iowa, Greyhound Park-Casino, who tried out 
``The Addams Family'' slots. 
</P>
<P>
	But going beyond the usual bells and whistles can make the games  
downright confusing to players. Which button to push, why did I 
win? 
</P>
<P>
	Rogich said most of the machines have help buttons to help the  
perplexed figure out how to play the game. 
</P>
<P>
	These slot machines are more like video games for adults -- more  
ways to win, extra loud music for winners and pats on the back from 
celebrity voices. IGT believes that's what players want, Rogich 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They kind of come to expect a little more entertainment than  
just a bell sound.''

<HEADLINE> Saints' Williams Still Questionable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Rookie running back Ricky Williams practiced  
with the New Orleans Saints on Thursday, but remained questionable 
for Sunday's game against the San Francisco 49ers because of a left 
ankle sprain sustained last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who sat out almost all of the preseason after he  
sprained the same ankle in the first exhibition game, said he is 
anxious to return to the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel fine running, but I'm not sure, you know, if I can take  
a hit,'' said Williams, who was injured early in the Saints' 
opening victory over the Carolina Panthers. ``Hopefully I'll get 
out there and play and get a chance to see what I can go through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints traded eight draft picks for the right to choose  
Williams in this year's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 13, Williams asked to go back into the Saints'  
exhibition opener after an injury early in the game against the 
Miami Dolphins. Coach Mike Ditka held him out, and he stayed on the 
sidelines for 23 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams also wanted to return after Sunday's injury. He had  
carried 10 times for 40 yards in his first NFL regular season game. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka heeded the advice of the team's medical staff and kept  
Williams out. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Saints may be without Williams on Sunday, they still  
have backup Lamar Smith, who averaged 5.1 yards on 13 carries 
against the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans will face a 49ers team that lost 41-3 at  
Jacksonville on Sunday. But the Saints will be playing at San 
Francisco, where the 49ers are on a 17-game home-winning streak -- 
including 16-0 under coach Steve Mariucci.

<HEADLINE> City, County Try To Save A's Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- City and county officials, trying to  
rescue the proposed $122.4 million sale of the Oakland Athletics, 
planned to ask the team owners to extend Monday's deadline for 
closing the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Alameda County Supervisor Mary King, a member of the Joint  
Powers Authority overseeing the Oakland Coliseum complex, also said 
public officials were meeting Thursday with their lawyers to 
discuss major league baseball's decision to delay action on the 
team's sale. 
</P>
<P>
	That decision has left the deal all but dead. King said the  
meeting with lawyers was to ``strategize'' and wouldn't say whether 
legal action was contemplated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just getting ready to meet with our lawyers to see if  
there's some place we can be, something we can do between now and 
the drop-dead date,'' King said. 
</P>
<P>
	Club president Michael Crowley, meanwhile, said current team  
owners Steve Schott and Ken Hofmann would consider granting an 
extension to the prospective buyers, a group led by Modesto 
supermarket magnate Robert Piccinini and former A's executive Andy 
Dolich. 
</P>
<P>
	But Crowley said there were no promises.  
</P>
<P>
	``At that time, when they receive it, Steve and Ken would  
certainly look at that and make the decision they felt was in the 
best interest of the franchise,'' Crowley said. ``They would 
consider granting an extension on its merits. And if there was was 
another opportunity, another group that would purchase the team and 
keep it in Oakland, they would certainly look at that as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball owners shelved the sale Wednesday, voting 28-2 to put  
off action until a task force studying baseball's economic and 
competitive problems in smaller market areas completes its report 
at the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	King criticized baseball's non-action as insulting.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like we've been ripped off,'' she said. ``It was an  
arbitrary decision. I feel angry and frustrated on behalf of the 
community. They changed the rules in the middle of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The non-action essentially killed the proposed sale to the  
Piccinini group, which was worked out over the past six months 
under an agreement between the current team owners and the city and 
county officials. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for putting the club up for sale at a discounted  
price, a deadline was imposed for closing the deal and if it didn't 
go through, Schott and Hofmann would then be free to leave the 
Oakland Coliseum after the 2001 season. There also would be no 
legal entanglements to selling the team to a group that would move 
it elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown spoke with both Hofmann and Schott and  
asked them to grant the extension but both declined to give an 
immediate answer, according to Stacey Wells, the mayor's 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't say yes and they didn't say no,'' Wells said.  
``But the mayor is committed to doing everything he can possibly do 
to make sure the A's stay in Oakland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the unsettled atmosphere over the team's ownership and  
sale, Crowley said he and other employees were committed to a 
``business-as-usual'' approach in running the team, a surprise 
wild-card contender this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``From day one, we've been running the organization as if it and  
us are going to be here in Oakland for a very long time,'' Crowley 
said. ``What Ken and Steve ultimately decide is up to them. 
</P>
<P>
	``But for us, it's business as usual. I think that's only fair,  
for ourselves and for our fans because if you stopped doing what 
you're supposed to be doing, you're doing everybody a disservice.''

	Floyd Downgraded After Creating Havoc  
</P>
<P>
	MONTAUK, N.Y. (AP) -- Creating havoc even at half-strength,  
Tropical Storm Floyd raced into the Northeast with gusty winds and 
drenching rain today, grounding hundreds of flights and closing 
school for 3 million students. Its winds falling below hurricane 
force to 65 mph by evening, Floyd headed for Long Island and New 
England after rolling through the Carolinas in the morning. At 
least seven deaths have been blamed on Floyd. While still a 
hurricane, Floyd drilled ashore at Cape Fear, N.C., knocking out 
power to more than 1.4 million in the Carolinas. From there, 
Floyd's winds weakened steadily to less than half its fearsome peak 
of 155 mph.

	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Police picked through Larry Gene  
Ashbrook's trashed home and old journals today, but found no 
explanation for why he opened fire in a church yesterday, killing 
seven people and himself. The journals indicated that Ashbrook had 
been upset about his inability to keep a job. The 47-year-old 
Ashbrook carried two weapons, a 9mm Ruger semiautomatic handgun and 
a .380-caliber AMT handgun. The .380 was purchased legally from a 
now-closed flea market shop, acting police Chief Ralph Mendoza 
said. Officials still were researching the purchase of the 9mm.

question of a California anti-gay-marriage ballot initiative, 
Bradley told The Advocate, a gay and lesbian newsmagazine, ``if I 
was a voter in California, I would not support the Knight 
initiative.'' The former New Jersey senator said he still opposes 
same-sex marriage because of ``the religious nature of marriage and 
respect for the diversity of views on that subject.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rebuffing a congressional inquiry, President  
Clinton invoked executive privilege today and refused to turn over 
documents on his decision to offer clemency to members of a Puerto 
Rican separatist group. It was the fourth time the Clinton White 
House has used executive privilege to refuse a request from 
Congress. Critics have accused Clinton of making the clemency offer 
to help first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's budding Senate 
campaign. Mrs. Clinton opposed the deal after it began to draw 
criticism and then was herself criticized by some prominent Puerto 
Ricans in New York.

	Encryption Technology Limits Eased

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House agreed today to allow U.S.  
companies to sell the most powerful data-scrambling technology 
overseas with virtually no restrictions, a concession to America's 
high-tech industry over law enforcement and national security 
objections. The move was a defeat for the Justice Department, which 
had forcefully argued that criminals and terrorists might use the 
technology to scramble messages about crimes or deadly plots. The 
decision should help U.S. companies in overseas competition -- and 
help consumers worldwide guarantee the privacy of their e-mail and 
online credit-card purchases.

	Cancer-Fighting Protein Found

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers have found that a protein that

that starves tumors. The discovery adds to a growing list of 
proteins known to block cancer by preventing blood vessel 
formation. Researchers found that antithrombin, a protein that 
controls the formation of blood clots, changes in molecular shape 
to become a cancer fighter. The transformation occurs when it is 
cut by an enzyme that, ironically, can originate from cancer 
tumors.

rose 0.51 to 1,318.48, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 7.45 
to 2,806.72. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume was relatively light as Hurricane Floyd headed up the  
Atlantic coast, producing heavy rains that kept many New York 
traders out of work. On the New York Stock Exchange, 872.41 million 
shares changed hands, compared with 929.15 million on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of worse weather on Friday kept many others on the  
trading floor to clear their portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday also marks a ``triple witching'' session, a  
once-a-quarter event when contracts on stock options, index 
options, and index futures all expire. Many traders chose to settle 
their accounts Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond market closed early, at 1 p.m. EDT, but stock markets  
kept normal hours. Several brokerages allowed employees to leave 
early to avoid the worst of the storm, although Floyd was later 
downgraded to a tropical storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Weather aside, stocks tumbled as a diverse group of companies  
issued bad news about their profits. FDX Corp., the parent of 
Federal Express, fell 5 11/16 to 38 after reporting that it earned 
52 cents per share in its fiscal first quarter. Analysts had 
expected the company to earn 54 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon fell 7 5/16 to 53 5/8 after the defense contractor  
announced that its earnings would miss analysts' projections for 
the third quarter and for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Quintiles Transnational Corp. plunged 14 3/4 to 20 after saying its  
third-quarter earnings will be about 9 cents below analysts' 
expectations. Quintiles is a marketing and research company that 
focuses on the health care industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Streed, senior investment counselor at Northern Trust in  
Chicago, said he expects only isolated reports of weak profits as 
the third-quarter reporting season nears. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most companies still have very good prospects for earnings,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also bid stocks lower on the fear that the Federal  
Reserve will raise interest rates for a third time this year in its 
quest to contain inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors are human beings, given to extremes of emotion,''  
said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; 
Sons in St. Louis. ``Right now, many people are at an extreme of 
fear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed said Thursday that production at the nation's factories,  
mines and utilities rose for the seventh straight month in August. 
That report added to evidence that the economy is still growing 
robustly, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's policy-making committee will hold its next meeting  
Oct. 5, and many analysts say the market is unlikely to rally until 
then. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar revived slightly in New York currency trading, rising  
to 105.19 yen from a 3 1/2-year low of 103.20 yen in Europe on 
Wednesday. Japanese leaders issued strong warnings that a continued 
strengthening of the yen against the U.S. dollar could jeopardize 
the nation's budding economic recovery, and Prime Minister Keizo 
Obuchi told reporters that Japan would consider intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Nikkei stock average plunged 2.7 percent as investors  
feared the end of the nation's economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett Packard was the biggest drain on the Dow today, falling  
4 9/16 to 103 15/16. AT&AMP;T rose 1 to 45 1/2 after the company announced 
a mobile telephone alliance with British Telecom PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products Corp. rose 3 1/2 to 46 3/4 amid reports that  
the company is nearing a settlement of lawsuits over a diet drug 
linked to health problems. While the settlement would be massive 
--$3 billion to $5 billion, according to published reports -- it 
would also allow the company to put an end to an issue that has cut 
into its stock price this year.

<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Religious Leaders Call For Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A prominent Southern Baptist called the killings in a Fort Worth  
sanctuary a harsh reminder of the need for prayer. Other religious 
leaders said: Preach the gospel, but get guns off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	The messages crossed Thursday, a day after Larry Gene Ashbrook  
opened fire at the Wedgwood Baptist Church, killing seven people at 
a teen prayer service, and then himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. William Merrell, of the Southern Baptist Convention's  
executive committee in Nashville, Tenn., endorsed prayer, not gun 
control, as a response. 
</P>
<P>
	Violence, he said, is an expression of the heart's inner  
alienation. The solution to that alienation, he added, ``is the 
transforming power of Jesus Christ.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, general secretary of the National  
Council of Churches in Christ USA, favors gun control. ``When you 
put a gun in the hands of people with problems, it becomes 
murder,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop Joseph A. Fiorenza, head of the National Conference of  
Catholic Bishops, agreed. ``God expects us to use both prayer and 
common sense. It seems to me common sense dictates that gun control 
would go a long way to keep lethal weapons out of the hands of 
those who have them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The church shooting, he said, ``is another clear indication that  
unless we seriously address the culture of violence it is just 
going to get worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Merrell, of the Southern Baptists, believes that calling for gun  
control is politicizing a tragedy. ``This is not a political 
football,'' he said. ``It's a human tragedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1975, the nation's Catholic bishops have opposed the wide  
availability of handguns. The General Assembly of the Presbyterian 
Church, the executive council of the Episcopal Church and Jewish 
organizations are among religious groups that have renewed calls 
for comprehensive gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrell said he does not believe that the Texas shootings will  
``cause a sea change in attitude on the question of gun control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Campbell predicts that repetitive incidents of violence will  
rally church leaders. ``It can't be seen anymore as an isolated 
incident,'' she said. ``The common factor in each of these 
incidents is semiautomatic weapons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the moment, Baptists are looking to prayer. ``We are already  
hearing that across the country Southern Baptists are gathering in 
large groups and small ones,'' said Merrell. ``This is a great 
tragedy made more ironic by the fact that it came to a house 
dedicated to the proclamation of the good news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Campbell says many of those churches are now locking their  
doors. ``There's been an assumption over the years that churches 
are always open to people to pray. Churches aren't willing to take 
that risk anymore.''

<HEADLINE>  Hurricane Floyd Hits N.C. Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd roared ashore today near  
Cape Fear with 110 mph wind, flooding the Carolina coasts with more 
than a foot of rain as tens of thousands of people huddled in 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	At least seven deaths were blamed on Floyd.  
</P>
<P>
	The eye of the huge storm hit the mainland at about 3 a.m.,  
preceded by hours of violent weather that included several 
tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 480,000 utility customers in the Carolinas and  
Virginia lost power. Flooding and power failures combined to shut 
down Portsmouth, Va.'s water supply system, which serves 110,000 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been in nothing like this before,'' said Norma  
Childers, 62, a retired Rustburg, Va., nurse who came to North 
Carolina on vacation and was in a Wilmington motel when it lost 
power this morning. ``I'm getting too much fuss from my children. 
They're at home. They think that's where I'm supposed to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 9 a.m., the storm was centered 70 miles south-southwest of  
Norfolk, Va., and moving north-northeast at about 25 mph. After 
making its landfall, the top sustained wind around the center of 
storm had slowed to near 90 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane was expected to churn across southeastern  
Virginia, then zigzag out to sea along the coasts of Maryland, 
Delaware and New Jersey before nearing New York's Long Island early 
Friday. Disaster preparations were under way in New York City, 
Massachusetts' Cape Cod and along the coast of Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane warnings were posted as far north as Plymouth, Mass.  
Public schools were closed for the day across New Jersey and in New 
York City and Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia ordered schools 
closed early. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, the heavy rain caused more problems than the wind.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've got the worst flooding we've ever had in a storm. We're  
going to have terrible damage,'' North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there appeared to be no major damage on the mainland in  
the Wilmington area, aside from some road flooding, buckled piers 
and boats thrown onto land. By midmorning, the rain stopped near 
Wilmington. There were still brisk gusts, and black clouds floated 
quickly overhead, but the sun already was poking through. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities had urged more than 2.6 million people along the  
southern Atlantic coast to clear out of Floyd's path -- the biggest 
evacuation in U.S. history -- and more people were urged to evacuate 
today in parts of Virginia and Maryland and along the shore of New 
York's Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in Atlantic City, N.J., feared the storm would cancel  
Friday's Miss America parade, which attracts 100,000 people a year. 
</P>
<P>
	While the storm delivered only a glancing blow to Florida and  
Georgia on Tuesday and Wednesday, it still forced the cancellation 
of hundreds of airline flights. Amtrak suspended all train service 
south of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	When Floyd hit the coast near Cape Fear -- about 25 miles south  
of Wilmington -- the Category 2 storm was moving north-northeast at 
20 mph. Floyd's wind was down from the peak of nearly 155 mph it 
had when it battered the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	By today, areas of the North Carolina coast and the Myrtle Beach  
area of South Carolina had gotten up to 16 inches of rain, and a 
foot had fallen on Virginia's Tidewater region. Wilmington got 13 
inches of rain, flooding streets and low-lying areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Six twisters damaged homes and churches, but no injuries were  
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the deaths were in North Carolina, and one storm-related  
death was reported in South Carolina and in Virginia. In addition, 
one person was presumed dead in the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	As the storm passed, there were a few trees down and limbs on  
roadways in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
	Calvin McGowan smoked a fat cigar as he checked to see how his  
34-foot fishing boat, the Monitor, weathered the storm. In 1996, 
during Hurricane Fran, the boat was thrown several hundred yards 
and wound up upside down in a neighbor's yard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an exciting night. The sun's coming up now, so it'll be  
an exciting day,'' he said. ``Today's the day. Well, yesterday was 
the day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane-strength gusts of 80 mph earlier buffeted Charleston,  
S.C., and more than 200,000 people in the area lost power. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, in northern and central Florida, Floyd snapped power  
lines, smashed piers into driftwood and knocked out electricity to 
300,000 people. About 350 miles off the coast, the Navy and Coast 
Guard rescued eight people whose tugboat sank in 30-foot seas. 
</P>
<P>
	But Floyd made a northward turn that spared Florida and Georgia  
the catastrophic damage many had feared. NASA's Kennedy Space 
Center and its four shuttles were largely unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Hurley, checking into a Wilmington shelter with his wife  
and two children, said his family stayed home for Hurricanes Fran 
and Bertha in 1996, but not for Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	``They talk like this one is going to be pretty mean,'' he said.  
``It's got everybody shook up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges banned price gouging on essential  
items, threatening fines up to $100 or 30 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time South Carolina took a direct hit from a major  
hurricane was almost exactly 10 years ago, when Hugo struck near 
Charleston with 135 mph winds. The storm killed 29 people and 
caused $5.9 billion in damage, the most costly hurricane to hit the 
U.S. mainland until Hurricane Andrew hit Florida in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Wilmington Marriott, Lynn and Gail Wilmer of Lynchburg,  
Va., sat with Ms. Childers as the storm roared outside. The three 
friends had arrived for a vacation on the beach, only to be forced 
into Wilmington on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilmer, 54, in his stocking feet, was recharging an oxygen  
concentrator on the generator lighting the lobby -- the hotel's only 
power. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as this is over with, I'm heading back up to Raleigh  
to spend some time with some friends,'' the retired restaurant 
manager said as he gasped for air. ``I've had enough of the 
beach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Wally Jones, a security guard for the hotel: ``We like  
F's. Fran ruined us, so Floyd had to come.''

<HEADLINE> Cubs 7, Reds 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Sammy Sosa got something nearly as elusive as  
his 60th homer -- a Chicago Cubs win. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa doubled off the base of the wall in right-center field in  
his final at-bat Thursday night, driving in two runs in the ninth 
inning for a 7-6 victory over the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Sosa just missed a record-setting homer -- he even gave  
a little hop after it left the bat -- he gave the Cubs a 
break-through win and handed the Reds a heartbreak. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs took two of three from the Reds, their first series win  
since July 21-22. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a costly blown save by Danny Graves (8-7). With the rest  
of the NL contenders off, the Reds could have gained a half-game. 
Instead, they slipped to 3 1/2 behind Houston in the NL Central and 
three behind the New York Mets for the wild card. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds gave up Sosa's 59th homer one week ago in Chicago,  
leaving him one sweet swing away from becoming the first to hit 60 
twice. They gave him little to hit throughout the series, but had 
no choice but to pitch to him with the game on the line in the 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa was 0-for-4 when he came up against Graves with runners on  
first and second and one out. His drive off the base of the wall 
scored both runners to put the Cubs up 6-5 and give him a little 
solace. 
</P>
<P>
	Since hitting No. 59, Sosa has gone 5-for-28 (.214). He has gone  
30 plate appearances and six games without a homer, his longest 
power outage since a six-game streak from July 17-22. 
</P>
<P>
	His last seven-game stretch without a homer was July 5-11.  
</P>
<P>
	Flashbulbs went off in the small crowd every time Sosa came to  
bat. He missed perhaps his best chance in the seventh, when he 
faced Dennys Reyes -- the same pitcher who served up Mark McGwire's 
60th homer last year. Sosa flied out. 
</P>
<P>
	After Sosa's double put the Cubs ahead in the ninth, Mark Grace  
followed with a double to make it 7-5. Terry Adams (6-3) pitched 
the last two innings, preserving only the Cubs' 10th victory in 45 
games since Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Aguilera got two outs for his fifth save. The Reds scored  
in the ninth on a passed ball by Jose Molina. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds went ahead 5-1 after four innings with the help of some  
sloppy defense by the Cubs, but Cincinnati let Chicago get back in 
it with a lapse of its own. 
</P>
<P>
	Center fielder Mike Cameron misplayed Grace's liner for a  
run-scoring error in the fifth and Henry Rodriguez hit a two-run 
homer off Juan Guzman, cutting it to 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The crowd of 23,176 gave the Cubs a franchise record for  
road attendance with 2,599,905 in 75 games, breaking the 1993 mark. 
It's ironic that it came in Cincinnati, one of the few places where 
the Cubs failed to boost attendance this season. Overall, the Cubs 
are the second-biggest road draw in the majors, surpassed only by 
McGwire and the St. Louis Cardinals. ... Grace scored his 97th run 
of the season, matching his career high of 1995. ... Reds second 
baseman Pokey Reese missed his fourth consecutive game with a sore 
back. ... Two fans ran on the field in the top of the ninth. They 
were apprehended and handcuffed in left field. ... Chicago's Gary 
Gaetti was ejected in the ninth inning for arguing a called third 
strike.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Strands U.S. Travelers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd scuttled travel plans  
Wednesday for thousands of people all along the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Flights were canceled from central Florida up into Virginia, the  
Federal Aviation Administration said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the flight schedule at Miami International Airport, where  
air travel ground to a halt Monday, had returned to normal by 
Wednesday afternoon, FAA spokesman Eliot Brenner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday, he said, could be a bust in the mid-Atlantic and  
Northeast, adding that there could be some cancellations in the 
Washington area and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA shut down control tower operations Wednesday at airports  
in Wilmington, N.C., Charleston, S.C., Myrtle Beach, S.C, West Palm 
Beach, Fla., Daytona Beach, Fla. and Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the canceled flights were operated by Delta Airlines,  
U.S. Airways, American Airlines and Continental Airlines, which 
carry the bulk of travelers along the eastern seaboard. 
</P>
<P>
	American canceled flights in Washington; Richmond and Norfolk,  
Va.; Charlotte, N.C.; and Orlando and Jacksonville, Fla. Trans 
World Airlines canceled more than 30 flights to and from several 
East Coast states. Continental Airlines grounded all flights at 
Myrtle Beach and Charleston, S.C.; Sarasota, Daytona Beach and 
Jacksonville, Fla.; and Savannah, Ga. Continental canceled flights 
at other airports for part of the day, and airlines announced 
several cancelations for Thursday as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Rail passengers did not fare much better.  
</P>
<P>
	A large CSX dispatch center in Jacksonville, Fla., virtually  
shut down Wednesday, because it did not have enough staff on hand. 
</P>
<P>
	CSX operates Amtrak trains south of Washington, which meant that  
nearly all of Amtrak's passenger service between Washington and 
Florida came to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
	The only southbound route in operation was between New York and  
New Orleans. But that will be canceled Thursday, Amtrak spokesman 
Steve Taub said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak service between Washington and Chicago also was stopped  
Wednesday, Taub said. 
</P>
<P>
	And all but one commuter train line between Washington's Union  
Station and points in Maryland and Virginia were scrubbed because 
of the shutdown at the dispatch center in Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	``That dispatching center makes sure trains are controlled, are  
switched on the right tracks, and it controls the mix of freight 
and passenger trains,'' said Frank Fulton, a spokesman for the 
Maryland Rail Commuter Service. 
</P>
<P>
	CSX spokesman Robert Gould said some commuter service in the  
Washington region would resume Thursday, but Amtrak passengers in 
the Southeast would have to wait for Floyd to pass before making 
their journeys. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our concern is we don't want to put passengers in harms way,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> Principal Sends back Religion Books </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELRIDGE, Calif. (AP) -- Following pressure from the ACLU, a  
public elementary school has decided not to use Christian textbooks 
that describe other religions as cults and say God helped Columbus 
discover America. 
</P>
<P>
	Belridge Elementary Principal Steven Wentland, who also serves  
as superintendent of the 60-student, one-school district, said 
Wednesday that ``every last flashcard'' would be delivered back to 
A Beka Books Inc., a Pensacola, Fla.-based Christian publishing 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll pull them out. It's OK,'' he said, adding that he  
doesn't want to get into a courtroom battle or generate negative 
publicity. ``We don't hold any grudges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legal dispute began last month in this community in the oil  
fields northwest of Bakersfield, where the few housing tracts are 
virtually invisible among the hundreds of oil pumps. 
</P>
<P>
	Wentland approved the use of the A Beka curriculum after holding  
public meetings about the contents over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The school board also approved them, and all of the parents  
signed consent forms after they were shown samples and reassured 
that some material would be edited to avoid problems. An anonymous 
donor offered to pay for the books, so approval by state education 
officials was not mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
	A Beka describes itself as ``unashamedly Christian and  
traditional in its approach'' and weaves fundamental Christian 
ideologies into daily exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	One grammar book asks students to place the correct punctuation  
at the end of the following sentence: ``The Hebrew people often 
grumbled and complained.'' 
</P>
<P>
	History books tell students that although American Indians  
``attained a degree of civilization,'' they ``had no knowledge of 
the true God, and without this knowledge all other attainments are 
worthless.'' Another book warns that non-Christians will be denied 
a place in heaven, and that Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses and 
Christian Scientists belong to cults. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit Aug. 24, a  
day after students were welcomed back from summer vacation with a 
banner in the cafeteria that read: ``This is the day the Lord has 
made. Let us rejoice and be glad in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed on behalf of a retired Methodist minister  
and Veronica Van Ry, who felt compelled to pull her 13-year-old 
daughter out of the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Small, chief counsel for the ACLU's Southern California  
office, said while the Constitution allows schools to integrate the 
Bible and religion in an objective manner, Belridge was crossing 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has embarked on a frightening crusade in which it seeks to  
indoctrinate behind the schoolhouse gates impressionable students -- 
as young as 5-years-old -- into accepting a prescribed religious 
orthodoxy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wentland maintained Wednesday that he believes that A Beka  
offers the most superior academic curriculum he has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why we chose them,'' he said. ``The state of California  
would be hard-pressed to find books as good.''

<HEADLINE> World Bank Aims at Living Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The ranks of poor people around the globe will  
increase in the next century, the World Bank said in an annual 
report that proposes new thinking to help governments improve 
living standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Development Report also says that whether a country  
succeeds in the 21st century will depend on how well it manages the 
twin forces of globalization and localization -- the growing 
economic and political power of cities, provinces and other 
entities. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Stiglitz, the bank's chief economist, told a news  
conference in Washington on Wednesday, that while there has been 
progress in eliminating poverty in some areas, particularly East 
Asia, there have been setbacks in other regions, such as Russia and 
other parts of the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	He said 50 percent of Russia's population was living in poverty  
compared with a little more than 2 percent in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``We aren't winning the battle,'' Stiglitz said. ``Poverty is  
increasing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that at the start of 2000, an estimated 1.5  
billion people will subsist on the equivalent of a dollar a day, up 
from 1.2 billion in 1997. By 2015, the number below this 
international poverty line could reach 1.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Stiglitz said the rising numbers should not cause despair but  
challenge governments and international organizations to come up 
with new solutions. 
</P>
<P>
	He said one of the main lessons of the past 50 years is that  
economic ``growth does not trickle down. There is no magic cookie 
cutter solution that can be imposed from the top. Development must 
address human needs directly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the rising number of people living in poverty  
can be reversed ``by harnessing the forces of globalization and 
localization in the 21st century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's client countries, which are home to the world's  
poorest people, are likely to have the most difficulty managing 
these forces, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Globalization can be thought of as a giant wave that can  
either capsize countries or carry them forward on its crest,'' 
Stiglitz said. ``Successful localization creates a situation where 
local groups in society -- the crew of the boat -- are free to 
exercise individual autonomy but also have incentives to work 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report envisions developing countries entering the global  
marketplace with their economies strengthened by more-efficient and 
empowered local governments.

<HEADLINE> Bob Barker Suffering From Fatigue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- ``The Price is Right'' host Bob Barker was  
admitted to a hospital Thursday, suffering from fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker, 75, went to the emergency room at the George Washington  
University Hospital when he ``didn't feel quite right'' before a 
meeting with some members of Congress, his spokesman, Henry 
Bollinger, said in a telephone interview from California. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker was in good condition and expected to leave the hospital  
Friday, hospital spokeswoman Lisa Saisselin said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was lobbying lawmakers on behalf of a bill that would protect  
animals such as elephants that are part of entertainment acts, 
Bollinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bob has a heavy work schedule. He tapes five shows every  
week,'' Bollinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Barker was given a lifetime achievement award at the  
26th annual Daytime Emmy Awards. Barker, who has taped more than 
5,000 shows in his career, has been on ``The Price is Right'' since 
1972, and was host of ``Truth or Consequences'' for 18 years before 
that. He has been named best game show host a record 10 times.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A new market for technology companies will be  
launched in November, the London Stock Exchange said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new market, called techMARK, will include more than 170  
companies already listed on the exchange. Those companies will 
retain their existing FTSE index and industry classifications. 
</P>
<P>
	``London is a major center for the listing and trading of all  
types of companies including leading technology stocks,'' said 
Gavin Casey, chief executive of the stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``The launch of techMARK builds on this success and is part of  
our long-term drive to support innovative growth companies, 
including smaller businesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said it will increase the profile and visibility of  
technology shares, and enable private and professional investors to 
target technology stocks more easily. 
</P>
<P>
	When the market begins operations in November, FTSE  
International will calculate continually updated indices for 
techMARK. FTSE also provides the Exchange's blue-chip barometer, 
the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new techMARK indices will enable investors to invest  
directly in this exciting new market. I am confident that you will 
see retail funds based on the FTSE techMARK indices before the year

<HEADLINE> English-Only Tests Said Unfair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As more Hispanic children enter the nation's  
schools, educators debate whether they could be hard hit by 
high-stakes English-only tests. 
</P>
<P>
	A presidential panel on Hispanic education says such tests,  
often used to move children ahead or graduate them, may violate the 
rights of millions of Hispanic children. Others still say any 
accommodations could cheat them out of a fair assessment of their 
abilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``State education leaders have compromised the future of  
Hispanic students by making high stakes decisions based on 
inaccurate and inadequate information,'' said the report by the 
President's Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for 
Hispanic Americans, released on Wednesday. It urged the Education 
Department to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Education Department is currently investigating two cases  
related to testing and language ability, said Rodger Murphey, a 
spokesman for the civil rights branch. Murphey said he could not 
discuss the cases, in Nevada and in Texas, or disclose the filing 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 percent of the 5,000 cases filed each year specifically  
relate to laws that prohibit racial discrimination against 
students, he said. A 1974 Supreme Court ruling in essence includes 
language ability in that ban by requiring schools to provide help 
for students with limited English. 
</P>
<P>
	However, opponents of bilingual education argue that  
accommodating children on high-stakes tests will hurt them in the 
long run. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to make sure kids don't graduate with a degree that  
they can't even read,'' said Jorge Amselle, the vice president for 
education of the Center for Equal Opportunity, a Washington group 
that opposes bilingual education and affirmative action. ``The 
purpose of education in the United States is to prepare students to 
survive and succeed in this society and that requires mastery in 
English. 
</P>
<P>
	``To say that a student should be able to do math and science  
and read and write in English is simply a matter of accountability, 
not a matter of discrimination,'' Amselle added. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no one national measure of how well a schoolchild is  
learning. Nearly every state has developed its own achievement 
tests to gauge progress in core subjects such as math and reading -- 
and the tests vary. 
</P>
<P>
	The presidential panel said current state approaches to students  
who are not native English speakers are too vague for tests that 
are often tied to a child's promotion or graduation. Currently, 19 
states require students to pass tests before they receive high 
school diplomas; seven more plan to follow suit by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hispanic education panel, which was created in 1990 by  
President Bush, issued its first report in 1992. The group is 
charged with bolstering Hispanics' participation in federal 
education programs and targeting ways to eliminate educational 
gaps. 
</P>
<P>
	Educating the nation's 3.4 million Hispanic children properly is  
more important than ever, the group says, as such students' 
enrollment grows but their achievement does not. 
</P>
<P>
	In 10 states, the number of children who are not native English  
speakers more than doubled from the 1992-93 to 1996-97 school 
years. And 70 percent of those children are Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
	But in learning, Hispanic children are slipping behind. Young  
Hispanic children perform half as well as their 
native-English-speaking peers. Hispanic high school students drop 
out at double the rate of non-Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	Even well-to-do families will produce dropouts if English is not  
learned, the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel praised states such as Oregon, which offers its 4,000  
Hispanic students tests in English and Spanish; the tests are 
matched carefully and questions that cannot be matched in both 
languages are dropped.

<HEADLINE>  Presumed German Terrorist Is Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- A woman traveling with a suspected German  
terrorist killed by police is also suspected of being a member of 
the former Red Army Faction, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Sika, Austria's director for public security, told the  
Austria Press Agency that Horst Ludwig Meyer's female companion had 
been identified as Andrea Martina Klump, 43. 
</P>
<P>
	Meyer was killed Wednesday and his identity was established with  
the help of fingerprints, the Austria Press Agency reported. Meyer 
was believed to have been involved in assassinations and other 
attacks in the 1980s carried out by the since-disbanded Red Army 
Faction. 
</P>
<P>
	The German federal prosecutor's office, in a statement, said it  
would seek Klump's transfer on ``suspicion of membership in a 
terrorist organization,'' and at least one attempted terrorist 
attack on a discotheque in Rota, Spain, on July 17, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	An Austrian policewoman asked Meyer and a female companion for  
identification Wednesday after a resident said they appeared 
suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
	Meyer and Klump disarmed the policewoman and tried to escape on  
foot. Anti-terrorist police caught up with the couple, killing 
Meyer in a shootout. One policeman was shot in the knee and upper 
thigh. 
</P>
<P>
	Klump was apparently unarmed.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Band Coming To Miami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A popular Cuban dance band will play in Miami next  
month despite the protests of anti-Castro immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	The band Los Van Van was to end its U.S. tour on Oct. 9 at the  
city-owned James L. Knight Center. But announcement of the concert 
enraged Cuban exiles, and the arena managers canceled the concert. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Howard Simon, executive director of the ACLU's  
Florida branch, said a deal had been struck with the arena to hold 
the concert Oct. 11. The ACLU and the band's promoters had earlier 
accused Miami officials of pressuring arena managers into canceling 
the band's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Oscar Sanchez, who helped negotiate the deal, said the  
arena wanted extra insurance from the promoters. 
</P>
<P>
	Promoter Debbie Ohanian said Thursday she was thrilled the  
concert would go on. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is music that's popular all over the country now. And we  
are part of the United States of America, and we should not be 
denied the right to go see this group or any other group,'' she 
said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Trade Deals Helping Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Israel has been able to grow economically by  
making free trade agreements with Europe, North America and Jordan, 
according to a report released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign trade plays a vital role in Israel's economy, with  
imports and exports of merchandise accounting for half of the gross 
domestic product of $98.4 billion, says the 159-page review by the 
World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel is the only country in the world to have free trade  
agreements with both the United States and the European Union, and 
also trades substantially with Canada and Eastern European 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	A trade deal with Jordan has further helped weaken the impact of  
an Arab boycott against both Israeli trade and investment, the 
report says. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arab boycott predated the creation of the state of Israel.  
It was in effect from the day the state was founded in 1948. It was 
binding on all members of the Arab League, but it was never totally 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 1993 Israeli-Palestinian accords, the boycott was no  
longer enforced. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although the Arab boycott has never been repealed and still  
affects, to a certain extent, the development of economic relations 
of Israeli companies,'' the report says, ``an increasing number of 
foreign companies have recognized the importance of the Israeli 
market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report says Israel is attractive to investors because of  
open policies on foreign investment and because of the country's 
well-educated workforce, bolstered by a wave of immigration which 
has increased the population by 19.5 percent since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The report notes, however, that Israel still plays a large role  
in many areas of the economy, including banking, and has a complex 
and costly state aid system of tax exemptions and grants. 
</P>
<P>
	It also points to investor uncertainty because Israel has given  
itself the power to raise its import tariffs unilaterally. The 
report concludes that Israel should make its economy more flexible. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the Israeli government said trade liberalization  
will continue to be a major part of its approach to easing tensions 
in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	``Israel believes that only through open trade and economic  
cooperation will it be possible to achieve economic and political 
stability and sustainable growth,'' the government said.

<HEADLINE> Sotomayor, Ottay Suspensions Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The world governing body of track and field asked  
the Cuban and Jamaican federations Thursday to provisionally 
suspend Javier Sotomayor and Merlene Ottey for positive drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor, the world record holder in the high jump, tested  
positive for cocaine at the Pan American Games in Canada. Ottey, 
the Jamaican sprint star, tested positive for the steroid 
nandrolone at meet in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Both athletes have denied taking drugs.  
</P>
<P>
	The International Amateur Athletic Federation said the athletes  
must be suspended by their national federations pending a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor was stripped of his Pan Am Games gold medal after the  
positive test on July 30. Cuban officials have disputed the finding 
and claimed Sotomayor was the victim of a political conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF received a 200-page document Wednesday from the Cuban  
federation defending Sotomayor. IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said 
the document was a summary of Cuban leader Fidel Castro's 
pronouncements on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent live television appearance in Cuba, Castro said he  
believed Sotomayor did not knowingly ingest cocaine and suggested 
the drug was introduced into something the athlete drank shortly 
before taking the test. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was all a colossal lie, an infamous and shameful lie, a  
criminal plundering of merits won through denial, tenacity, 
consecration and sacrifice,'' Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reineri said the IAAF did not consider the Cuban response a  
``valid scientific document'' and would continue to press for 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	``We asked the Cuban federation in mid-August to confirm the  
suspension of Sotomayor pending a hearing,'' he said in a telephone 
interview from IAAF headquarters in Monaco. ``We didn't receive an 
answer. We will send them another reminder today, telling them to 
follow the rules and suspend the athlete pending a hearing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Cubans continue to refuse, the IAAF can impose its own  
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor has not competed since the Pan Am Games. He pulled out  
of last month's World Championships in Seville, Spain, saying he 
needed surgery on a herniated disc in his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottey, meanwhile, tested positive for nandrolone at a meet in  
Lucerne, Switzerland, on July 5. The result was disclosed on Aug. 
18, prompting the 39-year-old sprinter to withdraw from the Seville 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
	The testing of Ottey's backup ``B'' sample was postponed until  
after the championships. The IAAF confirmed Thursday that the 
sample was tested on Sept. 2 and also turned up positive. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IAAF has now asked the Jamaican federation to confirm the  
provisional suspension of Merlene Ottey pending the hearing,'' 
Reineri said. ``If the federation doesn't do so, then the IAAF can 
suspend her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Kingston, the Jamaican federation said it would hold a  
hearing on Ottey's case by the end of November. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottey, winner of a career record 14 medals at the world  
championships, has vowed to clear her name. 
</P>
<P>
	Once national federations issue their rulings on drug cases, the  
IAAF still has the final say. If the IAAF does not accept the 
finding, it can refer the case to its arbitration panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottey is one of several athletes who have tested positive this  
year for nandrolone, a muscle-building steroid which has been 
around for decades. The spate of nandrolone cases has surprised 
experts, who have raised the possibility that food supplements 
spiked with the drug could be responsible.

<HEADLINE>  De La Hoya-Trinidad Fight a Monster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Oscar De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad are a  
couple of welterweights doing heavyweight numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	At a time when boxing was supposed to be on the ropes, De La  
Hoya and Trinidad may generate some $80 million in revenue when 
they step into the ring Saturday night in a welterweight title 
fight so intriguing even this city's oddsmakers can't figure out a 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
	From the gambling houses on the Las Vegas Strip to the prisons  
of Puerto Rico, the rare matchup of unbeaten champions is the most 
anticipated non-heavyweight fight since Sugar Ray Leonard met the 
likes of Marvelous Marvin Hagler and Thomas Hearns in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight is so big that the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino didn't  
even bother to sell tickets to the general public. All 11,610 seats 
were quickly taken by hotels offering them to their biggest 
gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This thing is a monster,'' promoter Bob Arum said. ``The  
Hispanic community is at a fever pitch over this, and it's selling 
well everywhere else too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya is a slight 6-5 favorite over ``Tito'' Trinidad, but  
both fighters will come out winners with some of the biggest purses 
ever paid outside a Mike Tyson fight. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya is guaranteed at least $21 million -- even more if the  
pay-per-view sales are as good as expected -- while Trinidad will 
get at least $10.5 million for the scheduled 12-round fight that 
will unify the IBF and WBC versions of the 147-pound title. 
</P>
<P>
	The casinos figure to make even more, with high-rollers flocking  
to town on a Mexican independence day weekend to watch a 
Mexican-American champion facing Puerto Rico's biggest sports hero. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sports crowds in general gamble more money and fight crowds in  
particular are known to gamble even more,'' said Rob Powers, 
spokesman for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. ``In 
addition to that, the media exposure Las Vegas gets is invaluable. 
You can't even calculate it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Promoters are hoping more than 1 million homes spent $49.95 to  
get the pay-per-view telecast of the fight, and demand is so great 
in Las Vegas alone that it will be shown on closed-circuit TV at 
various hotels to another 30,000 people paying $50 a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	In Puerto Rico, which has only 220,000 homes capable of ordering  
pay-per-view, a quarter of them had already bought it by the 
beginning of the week and more than half were expected to watch it 
by fight time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Puerto Rican government said it would foot the bill to have  
the fight on 16 TV sets at the capital building for 8,000 poor 
residents to watch the match. Four prisons are also showing it as a 
reward for good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Local radio stations have dubbed it ``Tito fever'' and the fight  
has become a matter of national pride to the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to celebrate in Puerto Rico Saturday night,''  
Trinidad promised this week. ``It will be the biggest party ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Trinidad is huge in the Puerto Rican market, De La Hoya is  
a proven pay-per-view fighter whose movie-star looks and flashy 
smile draw screaming Mexican-American girls to his appearances. The 
1992 Olympic gold medalist was born and raised in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oscar's fights have primarily attracted the Mexican market,  
but Trinidad brings tremendous buys among people of Puerto Rican 
heritage,'' Arum said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though not matching the 1.9 million pay-per-view buys of the  
second Mike Tyson-Evander Holyfield heavyweight fight, De La Hoya's 
1997 fight with Pernell Whitaker was bought by 800,000 households. 
He has generated $150 million in revenue in seven pay-per-view 
fights, according to TVKO, the HBO arm that does the pay-per-view. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Oscar wins this fight, he'll be the biggest thing in boxing  
in decades,'' said HBO executive Lou DiBella, who helped arrange 
the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	In an era where few champions ever meet each other and the major  
titles are so fragmented that only the most ardent boxing fans know 
who holds titles, the fact two undefeated fighters in their prime 
are fighting makes the bout even more unusual. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad is 35-0 with 30 knockouts, while De La Hoya is 31-0  
with 25 knockouts. Both are 26, and both are big punchers. But both 
also have suspect chins, and have gone down in their careers. 
</P>

	``We're getting more and more by the hour,'' said Vinny

<HEADLINE>  De La Hoya-Trinidad Fight a Monster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Oscar De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad are a  
couple of welterweights doing heavyweight numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	At a time when boxing was supposed to be on the ropes, De La  
Hoya and Trinidad may generate some $80 million in revenue when 
they step into the ring Saturday night in a welterweight title 
fight so intriguing even this city's oddsmakers can't figure out a 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
	From the gambling houses on the Las Vegas Strip to the prisons  
of Puerto Rico, the rare matchup of unbeaten champions is the most 
anticipated non-heavyweight fight since Sugar Ray Leonard met the 
likes of Marvelous Marvin Hagler and Thomas Hearns in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight is so big that the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino didn't  
even bother to sell tickets to the general public. All 11,610 seats 
were quickly taken by hotels offering them to their biggest 
gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This thing is a monster,'' promoter Bob Arum said. ``The  
Hispanic community is at a fever pitch over this, and it's selling 
well everywhere else too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya is a slight 6-5 favorite over ``Tito'' Trinidad, but  
both fighters will come out winners with some of the biggest purses 
ever paid outside a Mike Tyson fight. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya is guaranteed at least $21 million -- even more if the  
pay-per-view sales are as good as expected -- while Trinidad will 
get at least $10.5 million for the scheduled 12-round fight that 
will unify the IBF and WBC versions of the 147-pound title. 
</P>
<P>
	The casinos figure to make even more, with high-rollers flocking  
to town on a Mexican independence day weekend to watch a 
Mexican-American champion facing Puerto Rico's biggest sports hero. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sports crowds in general gamble more money and fight crowds in  
particular are known to gamble even more,'' said Rob Powers, 
spokesman for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. ``In 
addition to that, the media exposure Las Vegas gets is invaluable. 
You can't even calculate it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Promoters are hoping more than 1 million homes spent $49.95 to  
get the pay-per-view telecast of the fight, and demand is so great 
in Las Vegas alone that it will be shown on closed-circuit TV at 
various hotels to another 30,000 people paying $50 a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	In Puerto Rico, which has only 220,000 homes capable of ordering  
pay-per-view, a quarter of them had already bought it by the 
beginning of the week and more than half were expected to watch it 
by fight time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Puerto Rican government said it would foot the bill to have  
the fight on 16 TV sets at the capital building for 8,000 poor 
residents to watch the match. Four prisons are also showing it as a 
reward for good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Local radio stations have dubbed it ``Tito fever'' and the fight  
has become a matter of national pride to the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to celebrate in Puerto Rico Saturday night,''  
Trinidad promised this week. ``It will be the biggest party ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Trinidad is huge in the Puerto Rican market, De La Hoya is  
a proven pay-per-view fighter whose movie-star looks and flashy 
smile draw screaming Mexican-American girls to his appearances. The 
1992 Olympic gold medalist was born and raised in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oscar's fights have primarily attracted the Mexican market,  
but Trinidad brings tremendous buys among people of Puerto Rican 
heritage,'' Arum said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though not matching the 1.9 million pay-per-view buys of the  
second Mike Tyson-Evander Holyfield heavyweight fight, De La Hoya's 
1997 fight with Pernell Whitaker was bought by 800,000 households. 
He has generated $150 million in revenue in seven pay-per-view 
fights, according to TVKO, the HBO arm that does the pay-per-view. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Oscar wins this fight, he'll be the biggest thing in boxing  
in decades,'' said HBO executive Lou DiBella, who helped arrange 
the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	In an era where few champions ever meet each other and the major  
titles are so fragmented that only the most ardent boxing fans know 
who holds titles, the fact two undefeated fighters in their prime 
are fighting makes the bout even more unusual. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad is 35-0 with 30 knockouts, while De La Hoya is 31-0  
with 25 knockouts. Both are 26, and both are big punchers. But both 
also have suspect chins, and have gone down in their careers. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the reason the fight is almost even at sports books,  
where millions of dollars are expected to be bet on both fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting more and more by the hour,'' said Vinny  
Magliulo, who runs the Caesars Palace sports book. ``This fight 
will be one of the highest, if not the highest, bet non-heavyweight 
fights ever.''

<HEADLINE>  Some of Hurricane Floyd's Effects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Floyd, the sixth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season,  
formed Sept. 8 in the Atlantic east of the Leeward Islands. It was 
upgraded to a hurricane Friday, when wind reached 74 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	At its peak Monday, its maximum sustained wind reached 155 mph,  
making it nearly a Category 5 storm. Even with wind speeds down 
from that peak, forecasters said Floyd was a major danger, in part 
because it was unusually big. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane made landfall early today at Cape Fear, N.C., and  
began a march up the coast. Across the southeastern United States, 
air travel was disrupted and Amtrak service was suspended south of 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	A rundown of other effects:

<HEADLINE> Ex-Congressmen's Kin Die in Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PIONEER, Calif. (AP) -- Three grandchildren of former U.S. Reps.  
Bob Mathias of California and Bill Alexander of Arkansas have been 
killed in a house fire along with their father. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were investigating whether the father set the fire,  
which had engulfed the two-story house and its attached garage by 
the time firefighters arrived, sheriff's Commander Mark Anderson 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of Timothy Halstead, 33, Haven Halstead, 8, Jordan  
Halstead, 5, and Elijah Halstead, 4, were found in the rubble, 
Mathias said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are my sweet grandchildren and I love them very much,''  
Mathias said in a telephone interview from his Fresno home. 
</P>
<P>
	The children's mother, Alyse Alexander, 31, said she had dropped  
off the children at the home 120 miles east of San Francisco in the 
Sierra foothills a few hours before the fire Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson said identities have not been confirmed, but that he  
believed the bodies were those of Halstead and the children. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathias is married to Alyse Halstead's mother, Gwen, and is the  
children's stepgrandfather. Gwen Mathias was previously married to 
Alexander, Alyse Halstead's father and the children's grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathias, 68, was a two-time Olympic decathlon winner who  
represented a Central Valley district as a Republican from 
1966-1974. Alexander, a longtime Arkansas Democrat, was defeated in 
1992.

<HEADLINE> Nowhere To Go in Myrtle Beach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (AP) -- On the morning after Floyd, there were  
no open gas stations, supermarkets, schools or banks, and the 
two-lane highways and country roads around town were either covered 
in waist-high water or impassable because of uprooted trees and 
dangling power lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't go anywhere. There's water blocking all the roads,''  
said Idella Brown, who lives in Longs, a nearby rural neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter, Mrs. Brown said, standing on her screened porch: ``We  
got a deep freezer sitting right here and it's full.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, Hurricane Floyd spread more fear than destruction  
along this resort coast. The worst damage was flooding, which made 
residents prisoners in their own homes and brought daily life to a 
virtual standstill. 
</P>
<P>
	Elijah Brown, Mrs. Brown's 15-year-old son, was itching to get  
out of the house. ``It's boring,'' he mumbled, staring at his 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	His mother laughed. ``He just wants to ride with his friends,''  
she said. ``He doesn't care where.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few miles away on Route 905, Henry Ford Jr. complained he had  
stayed up all night Wednesday. He had waded through thigh-high 
water to rescue his sister, aunt and cousin, who were trapped in a 
flooding house. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to take a church bus in there to get them out,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A curfew enacted Wednesday afternoon in Myrtle Beach and  
surrounding areas was lifted late Thursday morning after 
authorities surveyed local streets. 
</P>
<P>
	On coastal highway 17, snapped traffic signals hung at eye  
level. Police blocked some segments of the beachfront thoroughfare. 
Getting out of Myrtle Beach became a frustrating search for roads 
clear of floodwaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, many felt thoroughly blessed to have missed Floyd's fury.  
</P>
<P>
	``I said `Thank you, Jesus,''' said Mrs. Brown, standing on the  
steps of her white clapboard house. ``I'd rather be inconvenienced 
than to lose a life.''

<HEADLINE> Spielman Hired by Fox Sports Net </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chris Spielman, who retired from the NFL last  
month because of injuries that left him temporarily paralyzed, has 
been hired as a studio analyst for Fox Sports Net's NFL pregame 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman signed a two-year contract and made a guest appearance  
Sunday, when ``NFL This Morning'' made its debut at 11 a.m. on the 
cable channel's lead-in to the Fox's network pre-game show. He 
joined his former coach in Buffalo, Marv Levy, along with Chris 
Myers and Jackie Slater. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not many players can step off the field and right into a  
studio analyst's chair, but Chris was so solid in his debut that we 
want him to be part of our team,'' said Arthur Smith, executive 
producer of the show. ``With the same determination that Chris 
showed on the field, there's no doubt in our minds that he'll get 
even better with experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old linebacker called it a career last month after  
trying to return from neck surgery with his hometown expansion 
Cleveland Browns. He isn't certain what his future holds, but knows 
it will involve football. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to stay around the game and I didn't expect this  
opportunity so soon,'' Spielman said. ``Obviously, one day I'd like 
to get into coaching. ... and I wouldn't mind eventually getting 
into the analyst part of television. I think that's where I would 
excel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman underwent neck fusion surgery in 1997, and took last  
season off to care for his wife, Stefanie, who was diagnosed with 
breast cancer. He took a hit in an exhibition game last month 
against Chicago that left him temporarily paralyzed, but the injury 
was unrelated to the one in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've learned with everything that has happened you literally  
take things one day at a time,'' Spielman said. ``Hopefully, Fox 
will be pleased with me at the end of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Spielman is already having difficulty with his new  
profession. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always look for perfection and I stumbled over a few words  
last week when I was talking about Mike Ditka,'' Spielman said. ``I 
want to do well and be credible. I have strong opinions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman said he's already received a commitment from Seattle  
wide receiver Joey Galloway, holding out in a contract dispute, to 
appear on this week's show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to take credit for that,'' Spielman said. ``I want him  
to have a chance to give his side of the story publicly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman made the Pro Bowl in three consecutive seasons for the  
Lions (1989-91), and again in 1994. Following the 1995 season, he 
signed as a free agent with the Bills. In 1996, he led the team 
with 206 tackles.

<HEADLINE> De La Hoya, Trinidad Proud Fathers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Even if Oscar De La Hoya beats Felix Trinidad  
on Saturday night, he's not counting on being complimented by his 
father, Joel De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a Mexican father and has a big ego, and he won't tell  
me,'' said the 26-year-old De La Hoya, who was born and raised in 
East Los Angeles. His father and grandfather also were fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	Another proud father is Felix Trinidad Sr., who manages and  
trains the IBF welterweight champion from Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	Father-son combinations in boxing often hurt the fighter, but  
not in this case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to give credit to Felix Sr.'' said Gil Clancy, a boxing  
adviser to De La Hoya. ``He's done a marvelous job. In this case, 
it works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elder De La Hoya does not manage or train his son, yet makes  
his presence felt to the point that he has been accused of 
interfering with Oscar's career -- but not by Oscar or trainer 
Robert Alcazar. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to say Joel De La Hoya has never interfered with  
Oscar's training in any area,'' said Alcazar, who knows pleasing 
Joel is not easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two weeks ago for the first time he came to me and said, `I  
like what I see,''' Alcazar said. 
</P>
<P>
	The father, however, did not tell the son.  
</P>
<P>
	``I read it in the paper,'' the WBC welterweight champion said.  
``It would have been nice to hear it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya did hear from his father after his split decision  
victory over Ike Quartey on Feb. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said I didn't put enough pressure on him,'' De La Hoya  
said. ``He said, `You gave him too much respect.' He was right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Trinidad also fought professionally. In 1979, he  
fought the late Salvador Sanchez, a Hall of Fame featherweight 
champion, and was knocked out in the fifth round. 
</P>
<P>
	A knockout is what Felix Sr. says his 26-year-old son is going  
to do before a sellout crowd in a 12,000-seat arena at Mandalay Bay 
and a big pay-per-view audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fight will end by a knockout,'' said the younger Trinidad.  
``I really don't like to predict a round. My father has told me it 
will not go past six rounds. He knows a lot about boxing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya wouldn't be surprised to win by a knockout, but he  
added, ``If I box well and win a decision, I'll make myself 
happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A knockout could happen since both champions are power punchers.  
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya has 25 knockouts on his 31-0 record. Trinidad (35-0)  
has 30 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	What might decide the outcome, however, is how hard of a punch  
each can fighter take. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya suffered a flash knockdown by Narciso Valenzuela in  
the first round of his 11th pro fight, Oct. 30, 1993. He also was 
knocked down and hurt in the first round by Giorgio Campanella on 
May 25, 1994, and was knocked down and hurt in the sixth round by 
Quartey. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad was knocked down twice in the second round by Alberto  
Cortes in his 16th fight, Oct. 3, 1992. He also suffered 
second-round knockdowns in four other fights, the last time by 
Kevin Lueshing on Jan. 11, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya and Trinidad have had two common opponents -- Oba Carr  
and Pernell Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad got up to stop Carr in the eighth round of a title  
defense on Dec. 10, 1994. De La Hoya knocked Carr down in the first 
round, but didn't stop him until the 11th round of his last fight 
May 22. De La Hoya said he bruised his left hand in the first round 
-- the left hook is his money punch -- but the hand is fine now. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men won decisions in title defenses against Whitaker -- De  
La Hoya on April 12, 1997, and Trinidad last Feb. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe Whitaker won that fight (against De La Hoya),''  
Trinidad said. ``A lot of people say the same thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's pay-per-view telecast will begin at 9 p.m. EDT.  
</P>
<P>
	The main event will be preceded by a four-round women's  
featherweight fight between Mia St. John of Canoga Park, Calif., 
and Kelly Downey of Merriam, Kan.; a 10-round super flyweight match 
between Miguel Angel Granados of Mexico and Eric Morel of Madison, 
Wis.; a four-round heavyweight bout between Butterbean of Jasper, 
Ala., and Ken Craven of Ellisville, Miss., and an IBF cruiserweight 
title fight between champion Vassiliy Jirov of Kazakhstan, now 
living in Phoenix, and Dale Brown of Canada.

<HEADLINE>  Some of Hurricane Floyd's Effects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Floyd, the sixth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season,  
formed Sept. 8 in the Atlantic east of the Leeward Islands. It was 
upgraded to a hurricane Friday, when wind reached 74 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	At its peak Monday, its maximum sustained wind reached 155 mph,  
making it nearly a Category 5 storm. Even with wind speeds down 
from that peak, forecasters said Floyd was a major danger, in part 
because it was unusually big. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane made landfall early today at Cape Fear, N.C., and  
began a march up the coast. Across the southeastern United States, 
air travel was disrupted and Amtrak service was suspended south of 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	A rundown of other effects:  

</P>
<P>
 *BAHAMAS:   	
</P>
<P>
	STORM FACTS: Floyd churned through the Bahamas, a 600-mile  
cluster of islands to the east of Florida, Tuesday, when wind at 
the storm's core still topped 150 mph. Wind on the islands of at 
least 110 mph; heavy rain; flooding and 6-foot storm surges. 
</P>
<P>
	CASUALTIES: One man missing, presumed dead. Several minor  
injuries reported. 
</P>

<P>
 *FLORIDA:   	
</P>
<P>
	STORM FACTS: Floyd skirted state's eastern coast, bringing gusts  
of more than 75 mph and up to 4 inches of rain. Officials expressed

<P>
	EVACUATIONS: About 1.3 million urged to evacuate but allowed to

hit with 41 mph winds and rain. 
</P>
<P>

	CASUALTIES: No deaths or injuries reported.  
</P>
<P>
	GOVERNMENT ACTION: Gov. Roy Barnes declared a state of emergency  
for the coastal counties. Federal state of emergency declared. 
</P>
<P>
	OTHER EFFECTS: Highways jammed most of Tuesday. Red Cross opened  
71 shelters in the state, housing 18,000 people Wednesday night. 
Savannah State University's football team headed to Tennessee, 
leaving three days early for Saturday's game against 
Tennessee-Chattanooga.

<HEADLINE> Miss America Faces Triple Whammy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- The Miss America Pageant has been  
through plenty in 78 years. But it has never faced a triple whammy 
like this. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane, a bitter strike by hotel workers and a major flap  
over plans to let divorcees or women who've had abortions compete 
have conspired to create a bad-news trifecta ahead of Saturday's 
pageant. 
</P>
<P>
	It's more than enough to make a beauty queen cry.  
</P>
<P>
	``There isn't a worse scenario,'' said former pageant CEO  
Leonard Horn. 
</P>
<P>
	Established in 1921 as a bathing beauty contest to lure visitors  
after the summer season ended, the Miss America Pageant has endured 
criticism from feminists, survived scandals big and small (remember 
Vanessa Williams?) and battled TV viewers' indifference. 
</P>
<P>
	But it has never faced so much trouble at once.  
</P>
<P>
	The problems began Monday, when The Associated Press reported  
that the Miss America Organization board had quietly voted to drop 
a 50-year-old rule banning women who have been married or pregnant 
from competing. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionalists were furious. Contestants, former winners and  
many fans lined up against the changes, saying they would destroy 
the one thing Miss America had to hang her crown on -- an image. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to uphold the integrity of the pageant itself.  
Allowing those kinds of women, you're lowering the integrity of 
it,'' said Jim Jadwin, 73, of Zanesville, Ohio, shaking the rain 
off his jacket on Atlantic City's famed Boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby, work crews nailed up plywood sheets to protect the Trump  
Plaza casino's glass doors from wind and flying debris as Hurricane 
Floyd approached. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules changes were quickly put on hold because of the  
uproar. But the problems had only just begun. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, a union representing 14,000 casino hotel workers  
went on strike in nine of the city's 12 casino hotels. 
</P>
<P>
	That triggered raucous rallies by strikers shouting ``No  
contract, no peace!'' on the Boardwalk and along Pacific Avenue, 
the city's main casino strip. Picketing strikers tried to block 
busloads of gamblers from entering casinos, prompting city 
officials to declare a state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	With only executives and nonunion workers left, the casino  
hotels had to curtail even the most basic services -- everything 
except gambling. Dealers here are not unionized. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought I'd eat in a Donald Trump hotel with paper  
plates and plastic forks,'' said Wendi Patrick, 26, of Savannah, 
Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	Room service? A thing of the past. Valet parking? Do it  
yourself. Restaurants and bars inside the casinos were closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to go to Oshkosh to get something to eat,'' grumbled  
Jimmy Exum, 58, of Jackson, Tenn., who runs the state pageant 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	A white stretch limousine was seen entering the drive-thru at  
McDonald's on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The last straw was Hurricane Floyd, which drenched Boardwalk  
pedestrians with rain, ruined travel plans and threatened to cancel 
the Miss America Pageant Parade on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The parade, which features the lavishly costumed contestants  
riding down the Boardwalk in convertibles while more than 100,000 
people look on, has never been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's be practical about this,'' said parade chairman James  
Lees. ``If the hurricane comes this way, we'll have to put the 
whole thing in the Dumpster. But right now, whatever I have left of 
the parade is going to go down that Boardwalk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 79th annual pageant, set for 8 p.m. EDT Saturday, is  
expected to go off as scheduled, even despite the hurricane and 
Atlantic City's location on a thin, low-lying barrier island. 
</P>
<P>
	Pageant CEO Robert L. Beck, in his first year at the helm, was  
taking it all in stride. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd heard about the storms and the strikes and the  
controversies,'' he said, ``But I didn't think we'd get them all at 
once.''

<HEADLINE> Titans' McNair Sits Out Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Steve McNair, with some mild stiffness  
and spasms in his lower back, watched practice Thursday, but is 
expected to play Sunday against the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a precautionary thing based on what happened last  
month,'' said coach Jeff Fisher. ``We felt if a day's rest is going 
to help him to better prepare himself for this weekend, then it 
made sense to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNair missed two weeks of practice during training camp with  
spasms and stiffness in his back. He has been wearing a brace 
around his lower back. He threw for a career-high 341 yards in the 
Titans' season opener and led them to a 36-35 victory over the 
Cincinnati Bengals.

of three other riders at the top of a Pyrenees peak Thursday and 
won the 11th stage of the Tour of Spain cycling race.

<HEADLINE> LSU Player Faces Legal Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- LSU co-captain Larry Foster, arrested  
earlier this week for purse snatching, has other legal problems 
awaiting him. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1997, Foster has had two outstanding warrants for his  
arrest stemming from two counts of issuing worthless checks in 
Baton Rouge. The warrants said the checks were in the amount of 
$222.01 to a grocery store and $102.23 to a Wal-Mart store. 
</P>
<P>
	The warrants said both checks were drawn on a closed bank  
account and attempts to gain restitution were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	LSU coach Gerry DiNardo said he had no knowledge of Foster's  
arrest warrants and declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Moore, an attorney representing Foster, said he had  
learned of the warrants but would not discuss them. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore said Foster is ``very anxious to tell his side of the  
story'' but has been advised not to comment publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior wide receiver from Gretna, La., Foster was booked  
Tuesday after being questioned by LSU police about a purse 
snatching in the LSU quadrangle Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses and the female student who owned the purse identified  
Foster in a photo lineup, LSU police said. The victim said about 
$20 was missing from her purse. 
</P>
<P>
	Purse snatching is a felony carrying a possible prison term of 2  
to 20 years. Foster is out on bond. 
</P>
<P>
	DiNardo has suspended Foster for LSU's game Saturday against  
Auburn. His status with the team beyond that has not been 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster led the Tigers in receiving last year with 56 catches and  
in 1998 with 43.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up From 3 1/2-Year Low Vs. Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose from its 3 1/2-year low against the  
Japanese yen as traders worried that the Japanese government might 
intervene to weaken its currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar, which broke a four-day slump against the yen, was  
mixed against other major currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 105.19 yen in New York late Thursday,  
up from late Wednesday's 104.23 yen, which was its lowest closing 
level since Feb. 27, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar had been falling against the yen after the U.S.  
government posted a record current-account trade deficit of $80.7 
billion in the second quarter of this year, including a $6.3 
billion deficit with Japan for the month of June alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo has directed the Bank of Japan to sell about $35 billion  
of yen since June 10, fearful that the currency's strength might 
make Japanese exports too expensive in other markets and smother 
Japan's recovery from a nasty recession. Yet despite those sales, 
the yen has gained 13 percent against the dollar since the 
beginning of June. 
</P>
<P>
	A much-watched meeting Thursday between Japanese Finance  
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami 
ended with the two men refusing to rule out more yen selling. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Floyd's arrival in the Northeast was also having an  
effect on foreign exchange trading, with some traders reversing 
earlier bets against the dollar in anticipation that financial 
markets would close earlier than normal. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted late Thursday at $1.0399, down from $1.0396  
Wednesday. The British pound was quoted at $1.6242, up from 
$1.6147. 
</P>
<P>
	Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday,  
included 1.5415 Swiss francs, down from 1.5434; and 1.4765 Canadian 
dollars, up from 1.4757. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Cowboys' Johnston Out for Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Two years after neck surgery, Dallas  
Cowboys fullback Daryl Johnston is again facing an athlete's 
toughest decision: Is it worth risking permanent injury to continue 
playing the game he loves? 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston said Thursday he has a bulging disc in his neck, just  
above the two vetebrae that were fused in October 1997. He may be 
able to avoid another operation, but his season is over, and 
possibly his career, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the same as two years ago, but it has the  
potential to be,'' Johnston said. ``That's why there's the 
necessity to sit down this year and try to prevent that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston, 33, will go through a rehabilitation similar to his  
last one, then be re-evaluated after the season. Another fusion 
procedure is a last resort, because it could substantially reduce 
his range of motion. 
</P>
<P>
	If Johnston was willing to retire now, he could skip the long  
hours of rehab and live a normal life without the neck bothering 
him. But, he said, it's not that easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just gets in your blood, I guess,'' Johnston said. ``I  
started playing organized football when I was 8. That's 25 years of 
my life. I can look at the things I've accomplished in my life and 
a lot of them are related to the game of football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston acknowledged the circumstances are different this time.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's some new things to consider this time,'' said  
Johnston, whose wife is expecting their first child in January. 
``It's going to be a tough decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Chris Spielman gave up his comeback from a neck  
injury after a hit left him temporarily paralyzed. Johnston was 
lucky his problem was revealed before anything that drastic 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	A hit by Washington defensive lineman Marco Coleman early in the  
fourth quarter of Dallas' 41-35 overtime victory left Johnston with 
a burning sensation in his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it was the first ``burner'' he'd felt since the  
previous injury, he only missed a few plays. Shortly after 
returning, he recovered a fumble that kept alive the Cowboys' 
comeback from a 21-point deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	To be safe, Johnston underwent an MRI on Wednesday. Doctors  
compared it to an MRI taken last October and discovered a change in 
the space between the discs above the fusion. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could test any player in the NFL and they're going to have  
changes to their spine,'' Johnston said. ``But because of my 
history, I think the doctors are taking a little more caution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston said he was surprised by the diagnosis, because he  
doesn't have any pain. The last time, he was extremely 
uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	What's bothering him most is the frustration of not being able  
to improve on what he considered a disappointing 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been getting my strength back and my weight up,'' he  
said. ``I was looking forward to the type of year I expect myself 
to have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston came to the Cowboys as a second-round pick in the 1989  
draft, the same year Dallas took Aikman first overall. Also rookies 
that year were Jimmy Johnson and Jerry Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Emmitt Smith came along the next year and Johnston paved the way  
to his success. Known as ``Moose,'' Johnston was essentially a 
sixth offensive lineman charging out of the backfield to pry open 
holes for Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston was durable despite the pounding, playing in 149  
straight games until the neck injury sidelined him six weeks into 
the 1997 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to Johnston, the fullback position was added to the Pro  
Bowl roster for the 1993 season. He made it that year and the 
following one. Dallas also won Super Bowls following the '92, '93 
and '95 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been blessed up to this point in my career,'' Johnston  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys placed Johnston on injured reserve and signed  
fullback Tim Lester off waivers. He was released by Jacksonville 
after starting the last three seasons in Pittsburgh as Jerome 
Bettis' lead blocker. 
</P>
<P>
	Lester practiced Thursday afternoon and is expected to start  
Monday night against Atlanta. The only other fullback on the 
roster, Robert Thomas, had been a linebacker until the last week of 
training camp.

<HEADLINE> Lott: Congress Surpasses Limits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott on Thursday  
acknowledged what has been apparent for months but not stated 
publicly by Republican leaders: Congress will surpass legally 
required spending limits this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had emergencies we've had to deal with. In fact, the  
caps are exceeded,'' Lott, R-Miss., told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing is be honest, get our work done,  
don't raid Social Security and don't raise taxes,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	For months, many Republican leaders said the spending limits  
would not be broken and made that pledge a central theme of their 
party's budget and political strategy. Lott's comments underline 
how the GOP leadership has veered from its initial position as the 
party struggles to find enough money for fiscal 2000 spending 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of promising to live within the spending limits,  
Republican leaders are now emphasizing the protection of Social 
Security surpluses and combatting President Clinton's demands for 
higher spending. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the prospect of breaking the limits has caused few  
problems among Republicans, many of whom -- along with Democrats -- 
have long seen it as an inevitable response to spending pressures. 
Moreover, lawmakers also say that few voters have heard of the 
spending limits or care about them. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers of both parties say their goal now is to avoid  
spending any of next year's projected $147 billion Social Security 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	But some Republicans, including House Budget Committee Chairman  
John Kasich, R-Ohio, have expressed concerns that some of that 
money will be spent as well. They say that would deal a major blow 
to the party's core conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's 2000 budget proposed breaking the limits by $30  
billion, according to congressional analysts, and Republicans 
criticized him for it. But he argued he had not broken them because 
he proposed cigarette tax increases and other savings to pay for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans plan to use $14 billion in expected non-Social  
Security surpluses to help pay for spending bills, a small tax cut 
for some businesses and to erase cuts in Medicare reimbursements to 
nursing homes enacted two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending any of the $14 billion would exceed the limits, which  
were imposed by the 1997 budget-balancing accord between lawmakers 
and Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott and others have said Republicans would declare much of that  
money to be ``emergency'' spending, a technical budget term that 
means the expenditure is not counted against the limits. Even so, 
the $14 billion would be spent. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can make the argument we have not broken the caps in the  
tradition sense'' because of the emergency spending, Lott said.

	Floyd Charges Carolina Shore  
</P>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd roared ashore today near  
Cape Fear with 110 mph wind. Floyd has dumped more than a foot of 
rain and caused at least seven deaths along the Carolina coasts. 
More than 480,000 utility customers in the Carolinas and Virginia 
have lost power. Flooding and power failures combined to shut down 
Portsmouth, Va.'s water supply system, which serves 110,000 
customers. As of 11 a.m. EDT, the storm was at the coast near 
Virginia Beach, Va., and moving north-northeast at about 24 mph. 
After Floyd hit land, the top sustained wind around its center 
slowed to near 80 mph. 

</P>
<P>
	Weather Shuts Some Stock Markets  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Large stock markets battened down and refused to  
close early today as Hurricane Floyd approached, but many small 
financial exchanges planned to shut before the normal closing time. 
The New York Mercantile Exchange, where metals from silver to 
aluminum are traded, closed most trading at noon today, two to 
three hours earlier than normal. The New York Board of Trade 
followed suit, calling a 1:05 p.m. halt to trading on some 
contracts. The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq stock markets are 
remaining open until the normal closing time of 4 p.m. EDT.

	Encryption Technology Limits Eased

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is relaxing exports  
on computer encryption technology in a decision seen as a victory 
for the high-technology industry. Administration officials, 
particularly Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis 
Freeh, have warned that easing controls on data- and 
voice-scrambling technology would hamper efforts to track down 
terrorists and other criminals. But the high-tech industry has long 
argued that U.S. rules were binding their hands in a competitive 
market.

	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Police today searched the trashed home  
of a man who burst into a church service for teen-agers and spewed 
anti-Baptist rhetoric as he opened fire and rolled a pipe bomb down 
an aisle. Seven people were fatally shot last night before the 
gunman -- identified today as 47-year-old Larry Gene Ashbrook -- 
killed himself in a pew at the Wedgwood Baptist Church. Seven 
others were wounded, three of them seriously. Authorities have no 
idea what motivated the shooting.

	NATO Revises Kosovo Damage Figures  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO's supreme commander for Europe  
today said that Alliance planes had inflicted less damage on Serb 
military equipment than initially thought at the end of the Kosovo 
conflict. Gen. Wesley Clark insisted, however, that what mattered 
was that NATO achieved what it set out to do -- end Serb repression 
of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian population. A total 389 artillery and 
mortar pieces had been struck, not 450 as was initially estimated. 
NATO launched its air campaign against Belgrade on March 24. The 
bombing lasted 79 days.

	United Auto Workers Win Pay Increase

	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- The United Auto Workers won a 3  
percent wage increase and a clearer path toward organizing nonunion 
plants at DaimlerChrysler AG in a tentative agreement today on a 
new national contract for 75,000 workers, local union officials 
said. The four-year proposed contract also provided a $1,350 
signing bonus for each union member, they said. A UAW spokesman 
said a ratification vote has yet to be scheduled, but one local 
leader said it was planned for the end of next week.

	Lawmakers Look At Day Trading  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Securities and Exchange Commission is  
closely investigating several day-trading firms, with regulators 
finding violations at a number of the companies, SEC Chairman 
Arthur Levitt said today in congressional testimony. The hearing by 
the Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee on investigations 
occurred six weeks after a day-trader shot and killed nine people 
at two day-trading firms in Atlanta before killing himself. The 
SEC's preliminary findings indicate several firms have ``extremely 
lax'' compliance with securities laws, Levitt said.

	No Evidence of Scholarships to IOC  
</P>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Attorney General Griffin Bell told  
Congress today that his review of Atlanta's efforts to land the 
1996 Olympics turned up no evidence of direct payments of money or 
scholarships to International Olympic Committee members or their 
relatives. However, Bell said Atlanta volunteers gave many gifts 
and were ``excessive in some respects'' in accommodating IOC 
members. The organizers of the Atlanta Games said they believe they 
conducted their bid appropriately.

	Fallout From Floyd in Northeast  
</P>
<P>
	MONTAUK, N.Y. (AP) -- It strength may be cut in half, but  
Tropical Storm Floyd was still blustery enough to cancel airline 
flights and close schools throughout the northeastern United States 
Thursday. Drenching much of the East Coast, Floyd raced across Long 
Island and into New England after rolling through the Carolinas in 
the morning. By 11 p.m., its winds had fallen below hurricane force 
to 60 mph. At least 12 deaths were blamed on Floyd. Two girls in 
Delaware drowned after a storm-swollen creek swept them into a

	CDC: Food Poisoning Sickens Millions

<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- In the country considered to have the world's  
safest food supply, 76 million people are sickened, 325,000 are 
hospitalized and 5,000 die each year from food poisoning, according 
to new federal figures. ``These numbers confirm that the number of 
illnesses and deaths from contaminated food in the U.S. is 
unacceptably high,'' said Caroline Smith Dewaal of the Consumer 
Advocacy Center for Science in the Public Interest. ``Consumers 
play a lottery everyday when they eat.'' Past reports estimated 
that foodborne diseases kill 9,000 Americans and sicken 33 million 
each year. The latest figures were released yesterday by the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

	Indonesian Troops Prepare for Pullout  
</P>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Preparing to end a bitter occupation,  
Indonesian troops on East Timor loaded equipment onto navy ships 
Friday ahead of the arrival of a multinational peacekeeping force. 
The preparations got under way a day after Indonesia's military 
commander on the island promised he would begin withdrawing his 
troops next week. Meanwhile, an Australian air force plane left 
Darwin carrying food to starving East Timorese, officials said. The 
food on Friday's lone flight was enough to feed 15,000 people for 
just one day. The U.N. estimates 150,000 people are in desperate 
need of food.

	Israeli Army Chief Wary of Deadline  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- It is doubtful Israel and the Palestinians will  
be able to negotiate a permanent peace accord within their 
self-imposed deadline of one year, Israel's army chief said in 
comments published Thursday. ``I don't think a conflict of 30 or 50 
years can be resolved in a month or two, nor in a year or two,'' 
Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz told the Haaretz daily. The army will play an 
important advisory role in the negotiations since most of the 
issues on the table will affect Israel's security. By September 
2000, the two sides want to reach agreement on the final borders 
between Israel and the Palestinians, the fate of Palestinian 
refugees, the future of Jewish settlements and the status of 
Jerusalem.

	Gore Urges Online Stalking Laws

	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore said Thursday that  
online stalking is a serious new problem and state and federal laws 
must be stiffened to ``to give us tools to deal with this crime 
appropriately.'' A new Justice Department report says state and 
federal laws need to be updated to outlaw online stalking because 
the practice is on the rise. According to Gore, one in 12 women 
will be victims of some form of stalking during their lives, as 
will one in 45 men. ``And increasing numbers of them will be 
victims of cyberstalking,'' Gore said.

Russian gangsters laundered billions of dollars through a U.S. 
bank, according to published reports on Thursday. The bank is 
examining all the Russian offshore accounts and if it cannot 
receive satisfactory assurances on ownership and use of any of the 
accounts, it will close them, according to reports in the Financial 
Times and The Wall Street Journal. The alleged money-laundering 
scheme involves as much as $10 billion purportedly laundered 
through the Bank of New York, the 15th-largest bank in the United 
States.

<HEADLINE> Coaches Differ on Baseball QBs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -- For nearly two years, Florida coach  
Steve Spurrier belittled Doug Johnson's two-sport aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
	The only way his strong-armed quarterback could manage the  
nuances of the Fun 'n' Gun offense, Spurrier said, was for Johnson 
to turn his back on baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an approach that wouldn't have gone over well with Miami  
quarterback Kenny Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
	``That wasn't fair on Steve Spurrier's part,'' said Kelly, who  
like Johnson spends his summers playing in the Tampa Bay Devil 
Rays' organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing baseball in the summer is my job,'' Kelly continued.  
``If a coach told me that he doesn't think it's good to go back and 
do my job, stay here full-time, I'd ask, `How would it feel for you 
not to go to your job?' That's how I take care of my daughters and 
nobody can stop me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deion Sanders and Bo Jackson showed it's possible to play both  
sports at high levels. But neither played quarterback, the most 
demanding position on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	With Florida State's Chris Weinke, each of Florida's major  
powers have quarterbacks with baseball on their minds. It's part of 
a growing trend that also includes Michigan's Drew Henson 
(Yankees), LSU's Josh Booty (Marlins) and Georgia's Quincy Carter 
(Cubs). 
</P>
<P>
	Weinke and Booty returned to football after exhausting their  
baseball careers. Carter gave up baseball once he became Georgia's 
starter. Johnson hasn't played baseball in two years, though the 
option remains. Kelly and Henson, meanwhile, continue to work at 
both sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to deal with each individual kid,'' said Miami coach  
Butch Davis, who has kept relatively quiet about Kelly's baseball 
breaks. ``It might turn out to be better than do only one thing all 
summer long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spurrier wasn't happy in 1997 when Johnson, Heisman Trophy  
winner Danny Wuerffel's heir apparent, left to honor his summer 
commitment to the Devil Rays, who took him in the second round of 
the 1996 draft. And the displeasure grew when Johnson threw six 
interceptions and no touchdowns in two losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson wound up being benched, then alternated with Noah  
Brindise and Jesse Palmer. Elbow surgery, leading some to wonder 
about overuse, caused Johnson to sit idle in summer 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The relationship didn't really warm until after last January's  
Orange Bowl. Johnson dedicated himself to his senior season, and 
Spurrier handed him the starting job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doug's got one year left of college football,'' Spurrier said  
earlier this year. ``If baseball's his best sport, he's got the 
rest of his life to do it. He's only got one more year to see if 
football's his best sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson played well in Florida's 2-0 start, throwing for 553  
yards and eight TDs, and said he understands what his coach was 
preaching. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell it helps as far as conditioning, strength and the  
way I'm throwing the ball,'' Johnson said. ``I'm not coming from 
baseball trying to catch up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly spent three months playing center field at Class-A St.  
Petersburg, where he hit .277 in 51 games with three home runs and 
14 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's coaches asked only that Kelly work harder at maintaining  
his playing weight. Last summer, baseball's daily grind caused him 
to lose 16 pounds. This year, he came back just four pounds 
lighter. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly has shown no signs of fatigue through Miami's first two  
games, throwing for three TDs and rushing for another in wins over 
Ohio State and Florida A&AMP;M. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision is never easy. Weinke spent six years in the  
Toronto Blue Jays' organization before finishing at Triple-A. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got the chance to play baseball, I felt I had to take  
it,'' said Weinke, a 27-year-old junior. ``I thought that was my 
best sport. I don't think that way anymore, but I guess we'll have 
to find out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite some rough spots early last year, Weinke didn't lose his  
football skills. He was 9-1 as a starter, throwing for 2,487 yards 
and 19 TDs, and has 510 yards and five TDs in two wins this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly said he isn't ready to choose his career destination at  
this point. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to see myself giving up football right now and  
four years from now deciding that was a big mistake,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Seeks Votes at N.H. Stop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Pat Buchanan had an answer Thursday when  
asked what it would take to keep him in the Republican Party rather 
than running as the Reform Party candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if George Bush came to me and said, `Pat, I've seen  
the light and you've got to be our nominee,''' he said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan -- flanked by two elephant displays -- signed a copy of  
his latest book for the chairman of the New Hampshire Republican 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
	But the chairman of the state's Reform Party also was waiting in  
line. 
</P>
<P>
	The elephants were part of the children's section at a Barnes &AMP;  
Noble store where Buchanan autographed more than 200 copies of his 
new book ``A Republic, Not An Empire'' Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed several for the party chairmen, but it will be another  
month before he will say which party he's running with. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, who complains Republicans have forsaken their  
conservative roots, said he doesn't expect winning the Reform Party 
nomination would be easy, though he says he is confident he could 
do it and then go on to win the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	And he dismissed arguments that he would only end up helping a  
Democrat win the presidency because he'd siphon votes from the 
Republican nominee. 
</P>

	``The assumption behind that question is that all the votes in  
2000 belong to Republicans and Democrats -- they own them. The 
assumption is I'm stealing some of those votes,'' he said. ``I 
don't agree with that premise. Votes belong to individual citizens, 
none of whom have cast them yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State GOP Chairman Steve Duprey chatted pleasantly with Buchanan  
after toting half a dozen copies of his book to the table for the 
candidate's signature. 
</P>
<P>
	Duprey said he wasn't worried that Buchanan would affect the  
election's outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Republicans have such great unity, are so excited  
about the prospect of winning and don't want to elect Al Gore or 
Bill Bradley enough that we will have a great nominee regardless of 
whether Pat leaves,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daron Libby, chairman of the state's Reform Party, wouldn't  
comment on his brief conversation with Buchanan. But Buchanan said 
Libby seemed ``very receptive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some in the crowd were more than receptive.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you go, I'm going with you,'' one man said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am for him making that switch. He'll get nowhere with the  
Republican Party,'' said Karen Johnson of Hollis. ``They're just 
using him to hold on to the conservative faction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a radio interview Thursday morning, several supporters  
called to tell Buchanan they disagreed with his third-party 
leanings. 
</P>
<P>
	``You gotta realize a lot of people who are telling you (to  
leave) are not your true supporters,'' said a caller named Carmen 
from Goffstown. ``They're actually, in my opinion, Democrats and 
liberals who are just licking their chops at the hopes that you'll 
leave, because they know that you'll fracture the party. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm asking you,'' she said, ``please don't do that.''

<HEADLINE> Falcons' Graziani Expected To Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Chris Chandler's sore right hamstring makes  
the Atlanta Falcons quarterback doubtful for Monday night's matchup 
with the Dallas Cowboys. Even coach Dan Reeves doesn't expect the 
two-time Pro Bowler to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say that it would be a miracle if he's ready,'' Reeves  
said after Thursday's practice, which Chandler watched as backup 
Tony Graziani took most of the snaps with the first team. 
Third-stringer Danny Kanell got the rest of the work. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't ruled him out, but he's got a long, long, long ways  
to go,'' said Reeves, confirming Graziani will start if Chandler is 
out. ``It (Chandler playing) certainly gives us our best chance of 
winning, but I also know that I'm not going to jeopardize the next 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler aggravated his hamstring in the waning moments of  
Sunday's 17-14 opening game loss to Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler, who because of injuries has never played a full  
season, was still hobbling Thursday, although he did ride a 
stationary bike, stretched and jogged for about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's better than it was yesterday, and hopefully by Friday  
I'll be able to practice real light,'' said Chandler, who held out 
hope he would be available against the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm not sure that's the feelings of the coaches. At this  
point in time, I really can't run. The hamstring is not letting me 
do much. 
</P>
<P>
	``Meanwhile Graz is going to get a lot of snaps and be ready to  
go,'' said Chandler, who is being treated with ``magnets and all 
kinds of rub things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Chandler can't play, Graziani will make the third start of  
his three-year career. So far, the 25-year-old lefty hasn't shown 
much. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, he started against Carolina when Chandler was hurt,  
only to get pulled after going 4-for-18 in the first half. Last 
season, Graziani filled in for the injured Chandler at St. Louis, 
again playing only the first half, being replaced after going 
8-for-18 with an interception. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited. I'm ready to go and I'm preparing all week like  
I'm the starter,'' said Graziani, tossing off the past due to a 
lack of experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think the fact that I have more experience, plus the  
experience of some preseason games and another training camp under 
my belt, has allowed me to see things out there a lot faster and 
quicker,'' said the former seventh-round draft pick from Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler's 12-year career has been marred by injuries.  
</P>
<P>
	Last season, he missed two full games and parts of two others  
with various ailments. During a preseason practice, he injured the 
same hamstring that's bothering him now and sat out an exhibition 
game.

<HEADLINE> Tides May Explain Europa's Shape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The corrugated shape of the surface of  
Jupiter's moon Europa may be caused by tidal forces pulling against 
the frozen cap of a deep ocean of water, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	A computer model created by astronomers at the University of  
Arizona at Tucson suggests that the fissures and ridges that run 
for hundreds of miles across the surface near Europa's south pole 
are caused by the gravity tug of Jupiter as the moon circles the 
giant planet. 
</P>
<P>
	The fractured surface features have puzzled astronomers since  
they were first discovered in pictures taken by the Voyager 
spacecraft in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Other studies have suggested that Europa, one of Jupiter's four  
moons, has a 100-mile deep ocean with a frozen surface. But the 
research didn't explain the formation of a strange pattern of 
cracks and fractures, called cycloidal features, distributed over 
the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study appearing Friday in the journal Science, Gregory V.  
Hoppa, B. Randall Tufts, Richard Greenberg and Paul E. Geissler of 
the University of Arizona say they now have the answer. 
</P>
<P>
	A computer program that models the effect of Jupiter's gravity  
on the surface of Europa shows that as the small moon orbits its 
giant planet, the frozen surface would repeatedly crack and 
refreeze. 
</P>
<P>
	The cracks form in cycles consistent with the 3 1/2-day,  
oval-shaped orbit of Europa around Jupiter, the researchers say. 
Tidal forces on Europa, caused by the gravitational tug of Jupiter, 
are highest when the moon is closest to the planet. The effects 
diminish as the moon moves farther away. 
</P>
<P>
	Tides on Europa rise and fall by more than 90 feet, compared  
with an average tidal effect on Earth of 4 feet to 6 feet. The 
extreme Europa tides cause the ice to flex, crack, reform, and then 
crack again, an endless cycle that leaves a frozen pattern in the 
surface ice, the researchers say.

<HEADLINE> Cope Gets UAW-GM Quality 500 Ride </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPARTANBURG, S.C. (AP) -- Derrike Cope, who won the 1990 Daytona  
500, has signed with Bud Moore-Fenley Motorsports to drive its No. 
15 car at the UAW-GM Quality 500 in Charlotte next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Fenley, president of Fenley Motorsports, said the deal  
runs through the 2000 season with options for 2001 and 2002. Cope 
will also race in Atlanta, the last race of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Cope remains under contract to Bahari Racing until Dec. 1 and  
will draw his salary through that team. Moore-Fenley will share 
profits from the Charlotte and Atlanta races with Bahari. 
</P>
<P>
	Fenley recently bought the team from Bud Moore Engineering.  
Owner Bud Moore has won 63 Winston Cup races in the No. 15 car with 
such drivers as David Pearson, Buddy Baker, Cale Yarborough, Dale 
Earnhardt and Ricky Rudd. 
</P>
<P>
	Cope told The (Spartanburg) Herald-Journal that he tested at  
Charlotte with the Spartanburg team this week and was pleased with 
the results. Cope won the pole for Charlotte's fall race last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, who has stayed on as team consultant, was glad to land  
Cope. ``We almost got him before (in 1991),'' he said. ``He's a 
terrific driver and a great guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fenley said the team will go without a sponsor for the Charlotte  
and Atlanta races. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our idea is to get things started this year,'' Fenley said.  
``Gel as a team and catch some attention from sponsors.''

<HEADLINE> Religion Today  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- As the new president of the nation's largest  
black church group laid plans to move beyond the scandal and 
corruption of his predecessor, his first act was telling: He called 
for 40 days of fasting and prayer for ``healing and redirection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. William J. Shaw of Philadelphia was elected last week  
to the top post in the National Baptist Convention U.S.A., then 
went to work on a detailed reorganization plan, which he aims to 
present to the board in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw succeeds the Rev. Henry Lyons, who was convicted on charges  
of using the group's status to bilk or steal more than $4 million 
from businesses and organizations. Lyons' trial detailed a lavish 
lifestyle of mistresses, expensive jewelry and waterfront property. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of his first acts, Shaw promised an immediate independent  
audit of the convention's finances, which would recur annually, and 
a freeze on nonessential spending, reforms that observers inside 
the church and out found encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think, at least I hope, the scandal will produce more  
safeguards,'' said Lawrence Mamiya, director of African studies at 
Vassar College and co-author of ``The Black Church in the African 
American Experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of Lyons, including many of the 11 candidates who ran to  
succeed him, argued it was the presidency's unlimited control of 
the group's purse strings and a lack of oversight that led to his 
downfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, a St. Petersburg preacher, was convicted on state charges  
of grand theft and racketeering and pleaded guilty to federal tax 
evasion and fraud charges. He was sentenced in March to 5 1/2 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw,chosen during the group's annual meeting in Tampa, said he  
has been calling for executive branch checks and balances for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The events around Dr. Lyons simply surfaced what was evident  
to us prior,'' said Shaw, pastor of Philadelphia's White Rock 
Baptist Church for 43 years. The fallout from the scandal was that 
more people rallied behind reform, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even convention members who felt Lyons' downfall illustrated  
more about human frailty than about their organization supported 
change. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem was not with the presidency, it was with the  
president,'' said the Rev. Miles Crawford, a pastor from 
Springfield, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he said, ``I think our structure needs some work. We need  
a full-time executive ... who needs to be accountable to the 
general board. The general board needs to be elected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than two-thirds of the board are appointed by the  
president, according to the Rev. W. Franklyn Richardson, a Mount 
Vernon, N.Y., minister who placed second to Shaw this year and 
second to Lyons in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	He was among several candidates who advocated limiting the power  
of the president and modifying the board, including implementing 
term limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The leadership is becoming more aware of the need to organize  
itself more in administrative terms, rather than depending on one 
charismatic personality,'' said Mamiya, the Vassar professor. 
</P>
<P>
	That sort of reform, which should include making the group's  
Nashville, Tenn., headquarters more than a ``shadow'' with a 
skeleton staff, also should be coupled with greater financial 
scrutiny, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to campaign material, Shaw's plan includes hiring  
directors of finance and operations to be stationed at the group's 
Baptist World Center. Some member churches withheld contributions 
to the convention during Lyons' investigation and trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw also planned to hire a statistician to conduct an accurate  
membership count of the group. Although some convention officials 
stand behind a figure of 8.5 million, prosecutors during Lyons' 
trial said the number was inflated to defraud businesses, and 
estimated membership at closer to 1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	While many religious groups, black and white, have been losing  
membership, the latent power of the National Baptist Convention 
lingers, Mamiya said. The group traces its roots to 1880. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is that Baptists are the most numerous religious  
group in the black community, and when you can organize collective 
power then ... you can begin making changes in society ... in local 
communities,'' Mamiya said. 
</P>
<P>
	Convention members echoed the sentiment.  
</P>
<P>
	``The mission is too great for the mess we've been entangled  
with,'' Crawford said.

<HEADLINE> AA Approves Centrica Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Members of the Automobile Association have  
approved a $1.8 billion takeover by Centrica PLC, owner of British 
Gas. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan won overwhelming approval Thursday from AA members, who  
each will each receive $386 as part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of the AA's 4.4 million members participated in the  
vote, and 96 percent of them voted for it, the AA said. 
</P>
<P>
	The AA is the country's leading motoring organization and  
provides breakdown services for 9.5 million drivers. It earned a 
pretax profit in 1998 of $31.5 million on sales of $1.0 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Centrica sells gas and electricity to homes and businesses. It  
posted an operating profit last year of $333 million on sales of 
$11.97 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is expected to be completed next week.  
</P>
<P>
	The AA's main competitor, RAC, was acquired by Lex Service in  
April in a $703 million deal.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani-Clinton Race Looks Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A statewide poll out today has Republican  
Rudolph Giuliani leading Hillary Rodham Clinton in the run-up to 
next year's possible Senate race while a second survey has them in 
a statistical dead heat. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll from Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion has  
the New York City mayor favored by 49 percent of voters questioned 
with the first lady favored by 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But a poll from the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute has  
Mrs. Clinton favored by 45 percent of voters surveyed with the 
mayor the choice of 44 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	There were also somewhat mixed results when it came to the  
fallout from President Clinton's offer of clemency to 16 Puerto 
Rican nationalists. 
</P>
<P>
	By a 52 percent to 12 percent margin, New York voters questioned  
by the Hamden, Conn.-based Quinnipiac pollsters disapproved of the 
president's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks after the president's offer of clemency, Mrs.  
Clinton angered some leaders of New York's Puerto Rican community 
when she came out against the prisoners' release. A few days later, 
14 of the 16 nationalists accepted the president's clemency offer 
and 11 were released from prison last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Quinnipiac pollsters said Mrs. Clinton's opposition to  
clemency left 15 percent of New York voters more likely to vote for 
her while 10 percent said they were less likely to do so. 
Seventy-one percent said it would make no difference in how they 
voted. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Poughkeepsie-based Marist pollsters found that 18  
percent of the voters they talked to had a less favorable opinion 
of Mrs. Clinton because of how she handled the issue while just 6 
percent said their opinion of her was more favorable because of 
that. Three-quarters of the voters said their opinion of her hadn't 
really changed. 
</P>
<P>
	Marist's telephone poll of 717 registered voters was conducted  
Tuesday and Wednesday of this week and has a margin of error of 
plus or minus 4 percentage points. Quinnipiac's telephone poll of 
911 registered voters was conducted from Sept. 7-13 and has a 
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> AMA Cutting Costs To Avoid Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Even trade associations sometimes have to tighten  
their belts. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Medical Association said Wednesday it has decided  
to impose austerity measures, including a hiring freeze, to try to 
avoid a $16 million budget shortage. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to promote the Patients' Bill of Rights and form a  
doctors' union have taken a financial toll on the nation's largest 
doctors' group, chief operating officer Lynn Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA has spent $1 million to $2 million so far on the  
unionization effort and will spend much more, he said. He would not 
give other details. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its austerity moves, the AMA also has canceled  
nonessential travel, will delay some projects and curb the use of 
outside consultants, Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that core activities -- such as the AMA's publications  
and physician and patient advocacy -- will not be affected. And he 
said there will be no layoffs of the group's 1,200 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA has an annual budget of about $250 million.

<HEADLINE>  Storm Stops Flights, Closes Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTAUK, N.Y. (AP) -- Creating havoc even at half-strength,  
Tropical Storm Floyd raced into the Northeast with gusty winds and 
torrential rain Thursday, grounding hundreds of flights, closing 
school for 3 million students, even postponing a U.N. meeting on 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	Drenching much of the East Coast, Floyd raced across Long Island  
and into New England after rolling through the Carolinas in the 
morning. By 11 p.m., its winds had fallen below hurricane force to 
60 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 12 deaths were blamed on Floyd, eight from traffic  
accidents in the Carolinas and Virginia. Two girls in Delaware 
drowned after a storm-swollen creek swept them into a sewage pipe, 
a woman was killed in Virginia when a tree fell on her mobile home, 
and one man was presumed drowned in the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm swept away portions of a bridge in North East, Md.,  
forcing 100 families downstream to abandon their homes. Four oil 
tanks holding 80,000 gallons collapsed, though officials were 
unsure if the oil contaminated nearby Chesapeake Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	While still a hurricane, Floyd drilled ashore at Cape Fear,  
N.C., knocking out power to more than 1.4 million in the Carolinas 
and dumping more than a foot of rain that flooded hundreds of North 
Carolina homes. But the overall damage was considered modest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're most fortunate,'' said George Lemons, a National Weather  
Service forecaster in Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	From there, Floyd's winds weakened steadily to less than half  
its fearsome peak of 155 mph. The minimum wind speed for a 
hurricane is 74 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 p.m. EDT, the storm's center was 25 miles east of  
Hartford, Conn., and moving quickly northeast at 35 mph. 
Forecasters said it would continue to weaken on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the gentler Floyd was threat enough for New York and New  
Jersey authorities, who declared states of emergency. Public 
schools were closed in Washington, Baltimore, all of New Jersey, 
Philadelphia and New York City -- a part of the country more 
accustomed to snow days. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time anyone could recall all schools in New  
Jersey and New York City closing because of a hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	By evening the storm had dropped up to 12 inches of rain in  
Philadelphia, where a sold-out Bruce Springsteen concert was 
postponed, and 11 inches in Annapolis, Md. Up to 8 inches were 
expected in Connecticut. Southeastern Virginia got up to 17 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	The wind set a Ferris wheel spinning on its own at Ocean City,  
Md., and overturned an empty truck on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. 
New York City sent its municipal employees home early, urged 
business to close and shut down the upper deck of the Verrazano 
Narrows Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of airline flights were canceled along the East Coast,  
grounding tens of thousands of passengers. Amtrak suspended all 
train service south of Washington, and service farther north was 
disrupted by a mudslide and fallen trees. Ferry service was 
canceled from Cape Cod to Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message is, don't fool with Mother Nature,'' said New York  
City Council Speaker Peter Vallone. ``Stay home if you can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York's mass transit system proved vulnerable to rain just  
three weeks ago. A freak storm during the morning rush hour dumped 
3 inches of rain, halting subway trains and disrupting commuter 
rail service. Hundreds of thousands of workers got to work late or 
not at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm shut commuter rail service north of Manhattan,  
temporarily trapping roughly 15,000 commuters who hadn't joined the 
early rush out of the city. Limited service was restored a few 
hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Stock Exchange stuck to regular hours, but the U.N.  
Security Council postponed a meeting on protecting civilians in war 
zones. U.N. officials said it was the first time in recent history 
that a formal, open meeting of the Security Council was derailed by 
bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The eastern end of Long Island, residents made last-minute runs  
for flashlights and emergency supplies and hammered plywood over 
windows. But the storm didn't follow its projected path, and by 9 
p.m. many who had fled to shelters began returning home. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a joke,'' said Morgan Paul Neff, a bartender at  
O'Murphy's in Montauk, where vacationers and locals took shelter 
through the evening. ``We get weather like this nine or 10 times a 
winter. I didn't even take in my furniture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters had worried it would be Long Island's harshest storm  
since September 1985, when Hurricane Gloria caused an estimated 
$130 million in damage and knocked out power to 750,000 homes and 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Floyd knocked out power for 47,000 customers on Long  
Island, and across the Long Island Sound 48,000 in Connecticut lost 
power later in the night. Winds were clocked at 60 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities ordered the evacuation of Fire Island, off the south  
coast of Long Island, but not all its 2,000 residents obeyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Feraro, armed with candles, flashlights, batteries and a  
cell phone, hunkered down with his wife in their Fire Island home a 
mere 150 feet from the white-capped Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to ride this one out,'' said Feraro, who risked a  
ticket for ignoring the order. ``We're going to spend our time 
watching the storm. We have a perfect view.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Atlantic City, N.J., the Miss America Pageant had no  
immediate plans to curtail Saturday's indoor pageant, but city 
officials feared the storm might force them to cancel Friday's

	The Pentagon said 8,000 members of the National Guard in  
Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia were 
mobilized to help communities recover from Hurricane Floyd. 
National Guardsmen in Delaware, New Jersey and New York were put on 
alert. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1.3 million people ordered from their homes in the Carolinas  
were given the OK to return, though heavy traffic, flooded roads 
and fallen trees remained obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in the South have yet to tally the damage, but  
insurance experts estimated South Carolina's losses at $25 million, 
with the figure certain to be higher in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowhere along the Atlantic coast did Floyd strike as hard as it  
did in the Bahamas. Authorities there finally got to assess the 
damage Thursday and said hundreds of homes were flattened and 
roofless on several islands. Thousands of people faced the prospect 
of weeks without telephone, electricity or reliable water service. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trees were skinned like bananas,'' said Michelle Rolle, a  
resident of Abaco, an island in the Bahamas. ``This hurricane was 
by far the worst we've seen.''

<HEADLINE> Many Sent to Summer School in Error </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Imagine spending your summer in school and then  
finding out you didn't have to. That's what happened to 8,686 New 
York City elementary school students. 
</P>
<P>
	The third- and sixth-grade students were sent to summer school  
or held back at the end of the last school year because they were 
told they had failing grades. It turns out the testing company was 
the one that failed. 
</P>
<P>
	CTBMcGraw-Hill, a Monterey, Calif.-based company which has  
tested millions of students across the nation in its 72 years, 
notified the Board of Education about the mistake this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to sincerely apologize to everyone affected,'' the  
company's president, David Taggart, told board members Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of the tests, given last spring to 300,000 public  
school students in grades three, five, six and seven, weighed 
heavily in determining that 35,000 students needed to attend summer 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those students incorrectly ordered to summer school, 5,176  
students took another test at the end of summer school and passed, 
and will be moving on to the next grade. Another 1,168 failed the 
summer test. Their parents will meet with teachers to discuss 
whether the students can be promoted. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2,324 students who never took the second test for various  
reasons will still be promoted. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, who oversees the 1.1  
million-student system, called for an independent audit of the 
testing company, which received more than $2 million from the 
school board in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you how angry I am,'' board president William C.  
Thompson Jr. told Taggart. ``Why would I use your company after 
this?''

<HEADLINE> 2 Hospitals Settle Fraud Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two university hospitals agreed Wednesday to  
pay $8.3 million to settle allegations that they defrauded the 
government by submitting claims for treatments that were not 
covered under federal insurance programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The University of California San Diego Medical Center agreed to  
pay $4.7 million and the University of Washington Medical Center 
agreed to pay $3.6 million for improperly billing the government 
for ``investigational'' devices, the Justice Department said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The treatments, at the time performed, were not approved by the  
Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare and TRICARE, formerly CHAMPUS, which is medical  
insurance for the military, paid for hundreds of procedures at the 
two facilities between November 1989 and May 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement stems from a suit filed by a former medical  
device salesman. As a government ``whistleblower,'' he or she will 
receive an undetermined amount from the settlement.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets ended lower Thursday  
on a combination of Wall Street's overnight slide, the weakening 
U.S. dollar and interest rate worries. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese stocks fell sharply as investor sentiment worsened amid  
the U.S. dollar's slide against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average plunged 485.63  
points, or 2.73 percent, to close at 17,291.59. On Tuesday, the 
average closed down 132.07 points, or 0.74 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets in Tokyo were closed Wednesday for a national  
holiday, while a severe typhoon forced the closure of Hong Kong 
markets Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Seoul, prices on the Korea Stock Exchange plunged 3.8 percent  
on fears that local interest rates might rise further. The Kospi 
index shed 36.53 points to 916.16. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore prices fell on the weakness throughout the region. The  
benchmark Straits Times Index fell 30.74 points, or 1.5 percent, to 
2,089.84. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar bought 104.99 yen in late  
afternoon trading, down 1.57 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo but 
above its late New York level of 104.23 yen on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Blue chips dropped 2 percent as the Thai baht fell to a  
12-month low against the U.S. dollar. The index of the Stock 
Exchange of Thailand fell 8.70 points to 429.89. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares ended mixed, with last-minute bargain  
hunting on select blue chips barely pulling the key index out of 
negative territory. The JSX Composite Index edged up 0.14 point to 
end at 548.756. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed slightly lower. The

percent. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine stocks fell, with many blue chips knocked  
lower by Wall Street's losses. The Philippine Stock Exchange Index 
closed down 3.87 points, or 0.2 percent, at 2,070.21. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: The Australian share market closed broadly lower, led by  
industrial stocks that fell in response to losses in New York and 
Tokyo. The All Ordinaries finished at 2,904.8, down 33.3 points, or 
1.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Taiwan shares ended marginally down after the  
typhoon-forced closure of Hong Kong markets kept foreign investors 
away from Taipei too. The Weighted Price Index of the Taiwan Stock 
Exchange shed 2.14 points, or 0.02 percent, to close at 7,968.90. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower, pulled down  
for the second straight session by a dive in the share price of 
market heavyweight Telecom Corp. of New Zealand Ltd. The benchmark 
NZSE-40 Capital Index closed 12.09 points, or 0.6 percent, lower at 
2,083.62.

<HEADLINE> 3 Chinese Swimmers Fail Blood Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Three Chinese swimmers, including a leading woman  
freestyler, failed blood tests and were disqualified from a 
domestic competition, a Chinese newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Tan Caini, China's top women's 200 meters freestyler last year,  
and two men, 400-meter freestyler Liu Gang and 100-meter 
breastroker Xia Shichao, were disqualfied from the City Games at 
Xi'an in north China, the Beijing Youth Daily reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The three had red blood cell concentrations that were over the  
limit, the report said. They had been training at high altitude, a 
possible reason for the high count, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Another possible explanation was the use of the banned drug  
erythropoietin (EPO), but the blood test alone is no proof that an 
athlete used the stimulant, the China Sports Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
	The disqualification of the three applied only to the games in  
Xi'an.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Civilian Protections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan has issued a  
radical set of recommendations to protect civilians in war, urging 
the Security Council Thursday to be more decisive on intervention 
and to respond quickly when conflicts threaten innocent people. 
</P>
<P>
	The measures are urgently needed, Annan told the council,  
because civilians are more and more often the intended targets of 
warring groups -- not just the victims of their crossfires. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent conflicts in Angola, Kosovo, Sierra Leone and East  
Timor show the utter disregard for international law in today's 
conflicts and the need for the United Nations to respond more 
effectively to them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan said existing international humanitarian and human rights  
law should be ratified and implemented -- particularly the treaty 
which would establish an International Criminal Court to prosecute 
alleged war criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested the council consider authorizing more preventative  
peacekeeping missions, such as the force sent to Macedonia in 1992 
to prevent the Bosnian conflict from spreading. 
</P>
<P>
	Once wars break out, Annan recommended the creation of temporary  
safe corridors in war zones so aid agencies can reach refugees and 
people in need. 
</P>
<P>
	And he suggested the council make greater use of targeted  
sanctions, such as arms embargoes, early on to contain those who 
commit ``egregious'' violations of international law. 
</P>
<P>
	But most significantly, the secretary-general urged the council  
not to be afraid to intervene in conflicts -- provided there is 
evidence of massive and ongoing abuses and that previous peaceful 
efforts had been exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
	The Security Council often finds itself unwilling or unable to  
stop wars from spiraling because the conflicts are more and more 
often internal. The U.N. Charter specifically says the council's 
primary responsibility is to protect international peace and 
security -- not necessarily internal peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, recent council action authorizing forces to  
intervene in Kosovo and East Timor show a growing trend that the 
council may be more willing to consider humanitarian intervention 
in internal conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	Council members welcomed Annan's report and pledged to consider  
implementing at least some of the recommendations.

	MIAMI (AP) -- Rex Walters, who saw spot duty for the Miami Heat  
last year, will return for another season after signing a contract 
with the club. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the agreement weren't announced.  
</P>
<P>

<P>
	In two seasons with the Heat, Walters has averaged 2.7 points  
and 1.4 assists per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Walters also spent 2 1/2 seasons with New Jersey and parts of three

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Organizers Amend Bid Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Atlanta Olympic officials admit offering college  
scholarships that weren't accepted and possibly breaking the law 
three times while trying to land the 1996 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	But former organizing chief Billy Payne and former Attorney  
General Griffin Bell denied that the ``excesses,'' which appear in 
an amended report to Congress made public Thursday, were part of 
any vote-buying scheme. Rather, they said, they were the result of 
``overexuberance'' by Atlanta bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a corrupt system, but it is subject to abuse,''  
said Bell, also a former federal judge and now a partner in the 
Atlanta law firm King &AMP; Spalding, which represents the organization 
that bid for the games. ``We had a couple of cases where we gave 
gifts of $1,000, and given all the people fighting for the same 
thing, I'm amazed it didn't go higher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report was delivered to a House Commerce subcommittee  
investigating Olympic bidding Wednesday, and it shows that former 
Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, who co-chaired the bid committee, 
offered a Georgia Tech scholarship to the daughter of Maj. Gen. 
Henry Edmund Olufemi Adefope, Nigeria's IOC representative. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell said Young did so without consulting with the Atlanta  
school. The offer was later declined because Bell said the IOC 
member ``did not want any embarrassment to fall upon Mr. Young.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The daughter of Hungarian IOC member Pal Schmitt was also  
offered a tennis scholarship at Georgia, but she declined. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers in Salt Lake City bribed IOC members with cash and  
scholarships in trying to land the 2002 Winter Olympics, prompting 
the congressional investigation and resulting in the resignation or 
dismissal of nine IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the delay, I am pleased that we now have all the  
answers,'' said Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., who is heading the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell also said eight disputed boxes of records will be made  
public Friday morning. Payne has fought a lawsuit by The Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution and Atlanta television station WSB backed by 
state Attorney General Thurbert Baker to make them public. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell also said his report found ``nothing about sex'' when it  
came to currying favor with IOC delegates, but he acknowledged the 
controversial boxes contain salacious but unconfirmed details about 
each delegate received from other sources. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that it's gossip is exactly why I wanted to keep  
these private,'' Payne said. He also apologized for any 
embarrassment the violations may have caused Atlanta and the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-inch document amends a report submitted to Congress in  
June, which Bell said was ``incomplete'' because Payne and others 
didn't have much time to meet the original deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell said only three favors to IOC members may have been  
illegal. Gifts of a live bulldog and a carburetor to the IOC 
delegates from Cuba and Libya, respectively, may have violated a 
U.S. embargo on both countries. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, two Atlanta officials carried cash into the country  
for the Jamaican delegate, and split the amount between them to 
avoid having to declare the cash to customs. The money was later 
given back to the delegate's American business in the form of a 
cashier's check. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also says that several delegates may have requested  
tickets to Atlanta and Toronto, another bidding city, for the same 
time, and then cashed in one and taken a connecting flight between 
the cities, pocketing the difference. But it also says that no such 
abuses could be documented. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell said that Atlanta organizers were operating under a culture  
in which the IOC had never ``questioned anybody about the size of 
gifts; had ever sanctioned anybody over the size of gifts; and ever 
threatened anyone with sanctions over the size of gifts.''

<HEADLINE>  Storm Stops Flights, Closes Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTAUK, N.Y. (AP) -- Creating havoc even at half-strength,  
Tropical Storm Floyd raced into the Northeast with gusty winds and 
torrential rain Thursday, grounding hundreds of flights, closing 
school for 3 million students, even postponing a U.N. meeting on 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	Drenching much of the East Coast, Floyd raced across Long Island  
and into New England after rolling through the Carolinas in the 
morning. By 11 p.m., its winds had fallen below hurricane force to 
60 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 12 deaths were blamed on Floyd, eight from traffic  
accidents in the Carolinas and Virginia. Two girls in Delaware 
drowned after a storm-swollen creek swept them into a sewage pipe, 
a woman was killed in Virginia when a tree fell on her mobile home, 
and one man was presumed drowned in the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm swept away portions of a bridge in North East, Md.,  
forcing 100 families downstream to abandon their homes. Four oil 
tanks holding 80,000 gallons collapsed, though officials were 
unsure if the oil contaminated nearby Chesapeake Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	While still a hurricane, Floyd drilled ashore at Cape Fear,  
N.C., knocking out power to more than 1.4 million in the Carolinas 
and dumping more than a foot of rain that flooded hundreds of North 
Carolina homes. But the overall damage was considered modest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're most fortunate,'' said George Lemons, a National Weather  
Service forecaster in Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	From there, Floyd's winds weakened steadily to less than half  
its fearsome peak of 155 mph. The minimum wind speed for a 
hurricane is 74 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 p.m. EDT, the storm's center was 25 miles east of  
Hartford, Conn., and moving quickly northeast at 35 mph. 
Forecasters said it would continue to weaken on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the gentler Floyd was threat enough for New York and New  
Jersey authorities, who declared states of emergency. Public 
schools were closed in Washington, Baltimore, all of New Jersey, 
Philadelphia and New York City -- a part of the country more 
accustomed to snow days. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time anyone could recall all schools in New  
Jersey and New York City closing because of a hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	By evening the storm had dropped up to 12 inches of rain in  
Philadelphia, where a sold-out Bruce Springsteen concert was 
postponed, and 11 inches in Annapolis, Md. Up to 8 inches were 
expected in Connecticut. Southeastern Virginia got up to 17 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	The wind set a Ferris wheel spinning on its own at Ocean City,  
Md., and overturned an empty truck on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. 
New York City sent its municipal employees home early, urged 
business to close and shut down the upper deck of the Verrazano 
Narrows Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of airline flights were canceled along the East Coast,  
grounding tens of thousands of passengers. Amtrak suspended all 
train service south of Washington, and service farther north was 
disrupted by a mudslide and fallen trees. Ferry service was 
canceled from Cape Cod to Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message is, don't fool with Mother Nature,'' said New York  
City Council Speaker Peter Vallone. ``Stay home if you can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York's mass transit system proved vulnerable to rain just  
three weeks ago. A freak storm during the morning rush hour dumped 
3 inches of rain, halting subway trains and disrupting commuter 
rail service. Hundreds of thousands of workers got to work late or 
not at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm shut commuter rail service north of Manhattan,  
temporarily trapping roughly 15,000 commuters who hadn't joined the 
early rush out of the city. Limited service was restored a few 
hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Stock Exchange stuck to regular hours, but the U.N.  
Security Council postponed a meeting on protecting civilians in war 
zones. U.N. officials said it was the first time in recent history 
that a formal, open meeting of the Security Council was derailed by 
bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The eastern end of Long Island, residents made last-minute runs  
for flashlights and emergency supplies and hammered plywood over 
windows. But the storm didn't follow its projected path, and by 9 
p.m. many who had fled to shelters began returning home. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a joke,'' said Morgan Paul Neff, a bartender at  
O'Murphy's in Montauk, where vacationers and locals took shelter 
through the evening. ``We get weather like this nine or 10 times a 
winter. I didn't even take in my furniture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters had worried it would be Long Island's harshest storm  
since September 1985, when Hurricane Gloria caused an estimated 
$130 million in damage and knocked out power to 750,000 homes and 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Floyd knocked out power for 47,000 customers on Long  
Island, and across the Long Island Sound 48,000 in Connecticut lost 
power later in the night. Winds were clocked at 60 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities ordered the evacuation of Fire Island, off the south  
coast of Long Island, but not all its 2,000 residents obeyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Feraro, armed with candles, flashlights, batteries and a  
cell phone, hunkered down with his wife in their Fire Island home a 
mere 150 feet from the white-capped Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to ride this one out,'' said Feraro, who risked a  
ticket for ignoring the order. ``We're going to spend our time 
watching the storm. We have a perfect view.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Atlantic City, N.J., the Miss America Pageant had no  
immediate plans to curtail Saturday's indoor pageant, but city 
officials feared the storm might force them to cancel Friday's 
pageant parade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon said 8,000 members of the National Guard in  
Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia were 
mobilized to help communities recover from Hurricane Floyd. 
National Guardsmen in Delaware, New Jersey and New York were put on 
alert. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1.3 million people ordered from their homes in the Carolinas  
were given the OK to return, though heavy traffic, flooded roads 
and fallen trees remained obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in the South have yet to tally the damage, but  
insurance experts estimated South Carolina's losses at $25 million, 
with the figure certain to be higher in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowhere along the Atlantic coast did Floyd strike as hard as it  
did in the Bahamas. Authorities there finally got to assess the 
damage Thursday and said hundreds of homes were flattened and 
roofless on several islands. Thousands of people faced the prospect 
of weeks without telephone, electricity or reliable water service. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trees were skinned like bananas,'' said Michelle Rolle, a  
resident of Abaco, an island in the Bahamas. ``This hurricane was 
by far the worst we've seen.''

<HEADLINE> Indians' Alomar Bruises Wrist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cleveland second baseman Roberto Alomar left  
Thursday night's game against New York in the first inning after 
bruising his left wrist while handling a throw. 
</P>
<P>
	The AL Central champion Indians said no X-rays were planned and  
that Alomar was day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar was hit on the wrist when a throw from left fielder David  
Justice short-hopped him near the bag at second. Alomar immediately 
grabbed the wrist and was replaced in the bottom of the inning by 
Enrique Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar, in his first season with the Indians, is batting .331  
with a career-high 23 homers and 106 RBIs. He leads the AL with 107 
runs scored and is tied for second with 37 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians have been hurt by injuries all year, though Alomar  
had missed only 93 innings in 145 games.

<HEADLINE> Gates To Donate $1B for Minorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates pledged Thursday to  
donate $1 billion for college scholarships for minority students, 
saying he wants to change the face of American leadership -- 
including that of his own company. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Gates Millennium Scholars Program,'' supported by the  
world's richest man -- a Harvard dropout -- and his wife, Melinda, 
will provide 1,000 scholarships a year for 20 years to 
Asian-American, black, Hispanic and American Indian students. 
</P>
<P>
	``This country is in an incredible time period. The advances in  
technology are really quite breathtaking,'' Gates said at a news 
conference. ``Is everybody getting a chance to benefit from this? 
The answer is really no. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do hope in the years ahead that as you look at the kids in  
school and you look at our industry, you will see a broad, diverse 
representation, because I think that really builds a strong 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gift is the couple's largest single philanthropic  
contribution and among the largest ever, rivaling a $1 billion 
commitment by CNN founder Ted Turner to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton applauded the decision. ``These landmark  
scholarships will help address important needs -- the need to 
encourage young people to become teachers, the need to ensure that 
our children are well-prepared in math and science, and the need to 
open the doors oif higher learning to all students,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Negro College Fund will administer the scholarship  
program starting next year, with help from the Hispanic Scholarship 
Fund and the American Indian College Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Those three organizations' combined scholarship budget is $51  
million. Gates will almost double that with his donations of $50 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many young people do not get the opportunity to reach their  
potential because of the barriers of finances,'' said William Gray 
III, president and chief executive officer of the United Negro 
College Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to lower those barriers. ... It's a wonderful  
moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scholarships, to be awarded primarily for academic  
achievement and financial need, will support four years of 
undergraduate education, plus graduate studies in education, 
library science, engineering, math and science. 
</P>
<P>
	Eligible students must have a 3.3 grade-point average, be  
nominated by a teacher or principal and commit to performing 
community service. Scholarship winners would have to maintain a 3.0 
grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
	With assets of $17 billion, the Bill and Melinda Gates  
Foundation is the second-largest philanthropic foundation in the 
world, behind London-based Wellcome Trust. Since 1997, it has given 
more than $2.4 billion, primarily for global health and education. 
</P>
<P>
	``The greatest thing you can do is provide somebody with a  
wonderful education,'' Gates said. ``I was an incredible 
beneficiary of seeing wide-open horizons, so education is something 
that Melinda and I believe in very deeply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gates, who dropped out of Harvard to found Microsoft, has a net  
worth of more than $90 billion. His wife is a graduate and trustee 
of Duke University.

<HEADLINE> College Football Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	With the focus of the college football world centered in Florida  
this week, several teams outside the Top 25 are looking to get in. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's highlights feature No. 1 Florida State looking to  
avenge its lone conference loss last season against No. 20 North 
Carolina State; national champion and No. 2 Tennessee traveling to 
SEC East rival No. 4 Florida; and No. 3 Penn State at No. 8 Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's game, No. 23 Colorado State was at No. 25 Brigham  
Young. 
</P>
<P>
	At Syracuse, N.Y., No. 6 Michigan (2-0) looks to atone for last  
season's 38-28 loss to Syracuse, which is 2-0 for the first time 
since 1993 and hoping to crack the rankings with a victory. Last 
year's game was the first between the teams since 1918. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss was the only one for the Wolverines against the Big  
East in five games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We remember,'' Michigan coach Lloyd Carr said. ``Yet looking  
back doesn't do you any good in terms of preparing for this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Syracuse linebacker Keith Bulluck, returning from a one-game  
suspension, is upset about his team's non-ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm starting to take this season as a whole personally,'' he  
said. ``A lot of teams get credit just because of who they are. 
Syracuse has been successful the last four seasons and we still get 
looked over. We want respect. No one's going to give us respect, so 
we have to take it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be our first true test,'' he added.  
``Michigan says they're looking for payback and revenge. They think 
that just because they're No. 6 in the country they're going to 
walk in here and leave with a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, the only way they're going to get a victory is through a  
war, and that's exactly what it's going to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other Top 25 games Saturday, it is Southern Miss at No. 4  
Nebraska; Tulsa at No. 7 Texas A&AMP;M; No. 9 Wisconsin at Cincinnati; 
Central Florida at No. 12 Georgia Tech; Ohio at No. 13 Ohio State; 
Central Michigan at No. 14 Purdue; Louisiana-Monroe at No. 15 
Arkansas; UTEP at No. 16 Kansas State; Louisiana Tech at No. 18 
Alabama; Stanford at No. 19 Arizona; Fresno at No. 21 UCLA; and New 
Mexico State at No. 22 Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
	At South Bend, Ind., Notre Dame (1-2) looks to avoid dropping  
out of the Top 25 with a third straight loss, while Michigan State 
(2-0) is on the verge of cracking the poll for the first time this 
season. The Irish have won 17 of the last 21 meetings but the 
Spartans have won two straight. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a long season,'' Notre Dame senior safety Deke Cooper  
said. ``We're still hoping for a national championship. We don't 
know how the rest of the season is going to go for everybody 
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State is just 2-12-1 in 15 games on grass but has won  
its first two for only the second time since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	At Los Angeles, former Southern Cal coach Ted Tollner will try  
to beat his former team for the second time with San Diego State, 
which lost 35-6 to the Trojans last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were disappointed because of their showing at Illinois  
(38-10 loss last week),'' Tollner said of his team. ``We're looking 
forward to trying to right ourselves where we play a more 
respectable football game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mountain West is 2-0 against the Pac-10 this year, but San  
Diego State is 13-43-3 against current Pac-10 teams, and has lost 
25 straight non-conference road games since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern Cal tailback Chad Morton, who rushed for 110 yards  
against the Aztecs last year, thinks it will be a closer game this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little bit scary just because they are out for revenge  
against us,'' Morton said. ``They have a lot of guys back. It's in 
the Coliseum, and a lot of these guys are from LA. They probably 
love playing in the Coliseum against us. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of them probably wanted to go to USC and couldn't, so  
it's their chance to show that they belong here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of behind-the-scenes rivalry that goes on  
here,'' second-year Southern Cal coach Paul Hackett said. ``A lot 
of our players over the years have played with, or played against 
each other in high school. Certainly we recruit in the same kind of 
areas.''

<HEADLINE> Some Markets Close Due to Hurricane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Large stock markets battened down and refused to  
close early today as Hurricane Floyd approached, but many small 
financial exchanges planned to shut before the normal closing time. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading of bonds, commodities and metals on several markets were  
to halt early, but the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq stock 
markets chose to continue trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're open for business,'' said NYSE spokeswoman Diana  
Desecio. ``We plan to stay open for regular business hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd, which was expected to weaken to a tropical storm by  
evening, threatened to flood highways and train tracks and ravage 
power lines as it moved into the region. 
</P>
<P>
	That led the New York Mercantile Exchange, where metals from  
silver to aluminum are traded, to close most trading at noon today, 
two to three hours earlier than normal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're worried about what will occur because of the  
hurricane,'' said Nachamah Jacobovits, spokeswoman for the 
exchange, where about 8,000 traders and staff work each day. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Board of Trade followed suit, calling a 1:05 p.m.  
halt to trading on its CRB futures contracts, a list of 17 
commodities. Night trading of futures contracts on foreign 
currencies were also to be shut. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have concerns about transportation issues,'' said spokesman  
Terence Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	All financial and agricultural markets operated by the Chicago  
Board of Trade, however, were to remain open until the usual 
closing times. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Bond Market Assocation set a 1 p.m. closing for  
U.S. fixed-income markets due to the hurricane.

	UAW, DaimlerChrysler Reach Deal  
</P>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- The United Auto Workers won a 3  
percent wage increase and a clearer path toward organizing nonunion 
plants at DaimlerChrysler AG in a tentative contract agreement 
today, local union officials said. The national contract is said to 
cover 75,000 workers. Officials at two UAW locals said they were 
informed the four-year proposed contract also provided a $1,350 
signing bonus for each union member. Neither DaimlerChrysler nor a 
spokesman for UAW national negotiators would disclose terms. UAW 
spokesman Frank Joyce said a ratification vote has yet to be 
scheduled, but one local leader said it was planned for the end of 
next week. DaimlerChrysler stock was down 13/16 at 71 1/4 in afternoon 
trading in New York.

	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Commission has opened an  
antitrust probe into the conduct of eight Austrian banks, alleging 
that from 1994 to 1998 they conspired to fix interest rates and 
banking commissions. European Union spokesman Stefan Rating said 
today that investigators identified 300 formal and informal 
meetings at which officials from the eight banks discussed setting 
fixed rates, prices and commissions. He called the cases ``only the 
tip of the iceberg.' Rating said said the banks have two months to 
answer the allegations in writing, after which they will be invited 
to a hearing at the EU headquarters in Brussels.

develop the next generation of leaders,'' Gates said in a statement

	Report: Trade Deals Helping Israel

	GENEVA (AP) -- Israel has been able to grow economically by  
making free trade agreements with Europe, North America and Jordan, 
according to a report released today. Foreign trade plays a vital 
role in Israel's economy, with imports and exports of merchandise 
accounting for half of the gross domestic product of $98.4 billion, 
says the 159-page review by the World Trade Organization. Israel is 
the only country in the world to have free trade agreements with 
both the United States and the European Union, and also trades

<HEADLINE> 19 Cos. Join Holocaust Labor Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nineteen more German companies have joined a  
group negotiating compensation for Nazi-era slave labor, a Treasury 
official told state finance officers Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	There are now 35 companies willing to participate in the  
compensation settlement, Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart E. 
Eizenstat said in a statement prepared for a New York hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen German companies have been named in various U.S.  
lawsuits for using forced or slave labor during World War II. Under 
international negotiations Eizenstat is overseeing, German industry 
is planning to establish a foundation that would cover victims of 
private business while the German government is setting up a second 
foundation for other claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Eizenstat said German industry sees compensation as a moral  
responsibility and plans to compensate victims of all wartime 
German companies, whether or not the companies are still in 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Eizenstat's testimony was prepared to update officials from  
various states on the effort, including New York, Pennsylvania, 
Texas, Florida, Kansas and California.

<HEADLINE> India Cigarettes Popular With Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- High-nicotine flavored cigarettes imported from  
India appear to be gaining in popularity among adolescents, federal 
health officials said Thursday, citing a study of Boston-area 
middle and high schoolers. 
</P>
<P>
	The study of 642 students found that 40 percent had tried the  
thin cigarettes -- called bidis or beedies -- at least once and 16 
percent were current bidi smokers, the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention said. Eight percent were heavy bidi smokers, having 
smoked more than 100. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hearing anecdotal evidence from around the country that  
bidis are popular with young people and are increasingly 
available,'' said Michael Eriksen, director of the CDC's Office on 
Smoking and Health. ``We're concerned that it's becoming chic, 
particularly among urban minority kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bidis are filled with tobacco flakes, hand-rolled with a  
greenish-brown leaf, tapered at both ends and tied with a tiny, 
colored thread. 
</P>
<P>
	The unfiltered cigarettes are shaped like marijuana joints and  
come in a variety of scents that hide the harsh taste of the 
tobacco. They also cost about half as much as regular cigarettes -- 
a paper-wrapped bundle of 20 bidis can be purchased for as little 
as $1.50. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal health officials and antismoking activists say bidis are  
more harmful than cigarettes. The CDC said at least one study found 
that bidis produce more than three times the amount of carbon 
monoxide and nicotine and about five times the amount of tar as 
cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked why they chose bidis instead of regular cigarettes,  
23 percent of the Massachusetts teens surveyed in March and April 
said they tasted better and 18 percent cited price. Thirteen 
percent said they thought bidis were safer and 12 percent said they 
were easier to buy. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to grocery and convenience stores, bidis are sold in  
health food stores, and that may be misleading young people, the 
CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no warning labels like on cigarette packs. Kids say  
they're easier to purchase,'' Eriksen said. ``All the signs that 
teens would look for to tell them that this product is harmful 
aren't there the way they should be.''

got a deep freezer sitting right here and it's full.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, Hurricane Floyd spread more fear than destruction  
along this resort coast. The worst damage was flooding, which made 
residents prisoners in their own homes and brought daily life to a 
virtual standstill. 
</P>
<P>
	Elijah Brown, Mrs. Brown's 15-year-old son, was itching to get  
out of the house. ``It's boring,'' he mumbled, staring at his 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	His mother laughed. ``He just wants to ride with his friends,''  
she said. ``He doesn't care where.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few miles away on route 905, Henry Ford Jr. complained he had  
stayed up all night Wednesday. He had waded through thigh-high 
water to rescue his sister, aunt and cousin, who were trapped in a 
flooding house. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to take a church bus in there to get them out,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A curfew enacted Wednesday afternoon in Myrtle Beach and  
surrounding areas was lifted late Thursday morning after 
authorities surveyed local streets. 
</P>
<P>
	On coastal highway 17, snapped traffic signals hung at eye  
level. Police blocked some segments of the beachfront thoroughfare. 
Getting out of Myrtle Beach became a frustrating search for roads 
clear of floodwaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, many felt thoroughly blessed to have missed Floyd's fury.  
</P>
<P>
	``I said `Thank you, Jesus,''' said Mrs. Brown, standing on the  
steps of her white clapboard house. ``I'd rather be inconvenienced 
than to lose a life.''

<HEADLINE> General Mills Earnings Up 9 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN VALLEY, Minn. (AP) -- Strong sales of Cheerios, Wheaties  
and Kix and improvement in international sales helped General Mills 
Inc. boost earnings 9 percent in its first fiscal quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The results Thursday matched Wall Street expectations. In  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, General Mills rose 37 1/2 
cents a share to $83.93 3/4 
</P>
<P>
	The food company earned $158.5 million, or $1.01 a share, for  
the quarter ended Aug. 29, compared with $145.0 million, or 92 
cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 7 percent to $1.57 
billion, from $1.47 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Sanger, chairman and chief executive, said the results  
reflected ``strong unit volume growth, margin improvement and an 
increased earnings contribution from our international 
operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect the same combination of factors to drive low  
double-digit growth in earnings per share for the full 2000 fiscal 
year,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	General Mills said market share for Big G cereals grew to more  
than 26 percent in the quarter in volume terms and to 32 percent in 
dollars, spurred by strong sales of its established brands plus the 
company's new Honey Nut Chex, NesQuik and Sunrise cereals. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoplait and Colombo yogurt captured 33 percent of the market  
during the quarter, up 4 points. Sales of Pop Secret popcorn, 
Nature Valley granola bars and fruit snacks also were up, but those 
gains were offset by weak performance of Bugles and other snack 
bars, the company said, leaving total snacks sales volume below 
last year's first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite weakness in the Russian market, General Mills said its  
international earnings grew at a double-digit rate.

<HEADLINE> Bill Blass Strides Through Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Saying the show must go on, Bill Blass staged  
his spring 2000 runway preview Thursday before a packed audience of 
loyals undaunted by the wind, rain and fury of the remnants of 
Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	All through the show, driving rain pummeled the roof of the tent  
used for most of the week's designer previews. But that didn't 
deter Blass from continuing with the Fashion Week show he expects 
will be his last before he sells his 26-year-old company. 
</P>
<P>
	Blass' garden-party floral prints and vivid sherbet shades  
provided springtime warmth to a swan song that threatened to turn 
into ``Swan Lake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of a dramatic effect for my swan song,'' said Blass  
backstage before his show, dapper in an impeccable navy suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``All morning long the ladies have all been coming backstage,''  
he said of his social-page following. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got there literally bedraggled and I thought, surely those  
ladies won't break their necks to make it even if it is Bill's last 
show,'' said CeCe Cord, a longtime customer. ``And one after 
another came in, looking more perfect than the next, in white suits 
and high heels and jewelry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 77-year-old designer, who plans to sell his  
$700-million-a-year company within the year, received a standing 
ovation. Audience members said they would not consider missing the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my job,'' said veteran fashion columnist Marylou Luther,  
toting a plastic bag as headgear. ``If I were a war correspondent, 
I wouldn't say, `I'm not going to this war.' So here I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to miss him so much,'' said Vogue editor in chief  
Anna Wintour. ``He's not been afraid of color in this decade of 
black and minimalism. ``He's remained very much his own master.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, ``Color, color, color'' was Blass' assessment of his  
collection. ``Massive color, bright color, in-your-face color, no 
more pale colors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For spring, the typical well-heeled Blass customer will wear  
long, lean, column gowns, attention-getting thanks to thigh-high 
slits and bright stripes or big bouquet patterns of lime, yellow 
and hot pink. Sequins splashed all over skirts, ruffles cascading 
on necklines and scalloped hems all add up to a season of 
embellishments. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night downtown designer Anna Sui presented her  
``Rococo Gypsy'' collection of mismatched pieces reminiscent of 
various times and places. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing really goes together. It's a thrown-together look,''  
said Sui of her deliberate attempt at undeliberate dressing, based 
on recent visits to rococo palaces in Europe. Her vivacious street 
fashion is an amalgam of bustle skirts and corsets, hippie peasant 
blouses and embroidery that evoked the era of Empress Josephine. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Wednesday night, London designer Nicole Farhi showed her  
women's collection in New York for the first time during Fashion 
Week. The show tied in with the Sept. 9 opening of her New York 
store. 
</P>
<P>
	Farhi, whose company generated $75 million in wholesale sales in  
1998, is known for minimalist clothes that emphasize comfort. Her 
side-tie wrap dresses and sequined wrap skirts projected a look of 
ease.

<HEADLINE> Senate Rejects Fuel Standards Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate has endorsed a five-year-old freeze  
on raising vehicle fuel efficiency standards, a victory for the 
auto industry, which says tougher standards means higher costs, 
reduced consumer choices and cars that are less safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents of lifting the ban said it was time to re-examine  
fuel standards in light of the popularity of sports utility 
vehicles, which get poorer gas mileage than passenger cars and pour 
more pollutants into the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate, by a 55-40 vote, on Wednesday defeated an amendment  
to a Transportation spending bill that would have put the Senate on 
record as opposing a House-imposed provision banning the government 
from even studying changes in fuel standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The House version of the spending bill has included that  
provision every year since 1995. Until this year, the Senate went 
along with the House version with little protest. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, however, Sens. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., Dianne  
Feinstein, D-Calif., and Richard Bryan, D-Nev., led an effort to 
challenge the study freeze, arguing that the auto industry had the 
technology to increase fuel efficiency without sacrificing safety 
or performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Those opposing government studies are ``neo-Luddites who are  
fearful of the consequences of what new technology might make 
possible,'' Bryan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress in 1975 set the corporate average fuel economy, or  
CAFE, standard at 27.5 miles per gallon on new passenger cars and 
20.7 mpg for light trucks. A manufacturer's CAFE for autos is the 
average fuel economy for all its cars, from the smallest subcompact 
to full-size sedan. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, vehicles in the United States today use about 17  
million barrels of oil a day, three million less than if CAFE 
standards had not been imposed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bryan said that with the remarkable growth of SUV sales, the  
average MPG of new cars has steadily declined this decade. Nearly 
50 percent of all new vehicle sales today are SUVs, light trucks or 
minivans, all which are required to meet only the lower lighter 
truck mileage standard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I own three Jeeps, I love my Jeeps,'' Feinstein said. ``But I  
have no doubt that my Jeeps can have the same kind of fuel 
efficiency standards'' as passenger cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort to increase the standards is backed by such groups as  
the Sierra Club and the Union of Concerned Scientists. In addition 
to automaker and business group opposition, auto unions have 
expressed concern that it could mean a loss of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those jobs and Michigan's economy are jeopardized by efforts  
to increase standards for CAFE,'' said Michigan's Sen. Spencer 
Abraham, a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	Abraham said that the go-ahead for government studies would  
almost certainly result in higher fuel standards. ``Make no 
mistake,'' he said, ``if the House funding prohibition is stripped 
from this bill, the Department of Transportation will raise CAFE 
standards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A yes vote is a green light to raise CAFE,'' agreed Gloria  
Bergquist, spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile 
Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Becker of Sierra Club said that even with the Senate defeat,  
``we are building support to ultimately change the standards and 
make the gas guzzler obsolete.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	Hurricane Floyd washed away part of the sports calendar for a  
third straight day as it swept up the East Coast on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oakland Athletics and Baltimore Orioles, who were rained out  
on Wednesday, lost their second game to the storm. The games 
probably will be made up as part of a doubleheader Sept. 23, an 
off-day for both clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Even playing indoors didn't guarantee that the games would go  
on. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy rain and flooded roads caused postponement of NHL  
exhibitions matching the Detroit Red Wings and Rangers in New York 
and the Washington Capitals against the Flyers in Philadelphia. The 
Caps-Flyers will play Sept. 27. No new date was set for the game at 
Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening round of the BC Open in Endicott, N.Y., was  
postponed, but organizers still hoped to get in all four sessions 
before sundown Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some golfers managed to tee off before the rain began, but they  
soon had to head for the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``By our third or fourth hole, the bunkers were full of water  
and the greens were starting to fill up,'' said Tom Lehman. ``There 
was just not much you could do about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The forecast for Friday called for showers and breezy conditions  
in the morning, and sunshine breaking through in the afternoon. 
Sunny skies were expected on the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	In Loudon, N.H., Thursday's time trials for Saturday's New  
Hampshire 100 at New Hampshire International Speedway were rained 
out. The 44-car starting lineup was set based on the current 1999 
championship point standings and postmarked entries for the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Belmont Park in New York was closed after the track became too  
wet and muddy for the horses and jockeys. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the Hudson River in New Jersey, Monmouth Park, which is  
hard by the seashore, and The Meadowlands in East Rutherford both 
called off their cards. 
</P>
<P>
	The aptly named Carolina Hurricanes of the NHL lost two  
preseason games this week to Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Their meeting with the Florida Panthers on Tuesday in Fort  
Myers, Fla., was called off, as was Wednesday's exhibition against 
the Atlanta Thrashers in Greenville, S.C.

<HEADLINE> AmSouth, First American To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Stockholders of First American Corp. and  
AmSouth Bancorp. on Thursday approved their $5 billion merger, 
which will create one of the largest banks in the Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
	About 93 percent of AmSouth voting stockholders approved the  
deal in Birmingham, Ala. Some 70 percent of shareholders voted, 
said company spokesman Jim Underwood. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly afterward in Nashville, a similar majority of First  
American's voting shareholders gave their OK. About 67 percent of 
stockholders voted, said spokeswoman Vicki Kessler. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal gives First American shareholders 1.871 shares of  
AmSouth common stock for each First American common share. 
</P>
<P>
	AmSouth stock closed down 50 cents at $21.94 on the New York  
Stock Exchange, while First American stock closed down 62 1/2 cents at 
$40.87 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger will create a bank with $42 billion in assets and 660  
branches and 1,365 ATMs in nine Southeastern states. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, announced June 1, already received regulatory approval  
and is expected to close Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies will merge operations in mid-February. The company  
will be called AmSouth Bancorp. and will be headquartered in 
Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
	It will operate in Tennessee, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi,  
Georgia, Louisiana, Arkansas, Kentucky and Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Watson Goes Against Tougher Foes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Tom Watson's much-anticipated debut on the Senior  
PGA Tour came last week at the Comfort Classic in Indianapolis. 
This week, he gets his first test against the tour's best. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson finished tied for 22nd and was nine shots behind winner  
Gil Morgan in his first senior tournament. Not a bad showing, but 
it came against a weak field. Morgan was the only player in the top 
five on the 1999 money list. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson plays at the $1.3 million Bank One Championship at Bent  
Tree Country Club in Dallas starting Friday. This time, he will be 
facing a field that includes leading money-winner Hale Irwin, 
five-time senior tour winner Bruce Fleisher, four-time winner Allen 
Doyle and the top 11 on the money list. 
</P>
<P>
	``They sure kicked my butt, didn't they,'' said Watson of his  
debut last week. ``Jack Nicklaus told me these guys can play and it 
wasn't news to me. I've been reading the scores they've been 
shooting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watson's second tournament as a senior will coincide with the  
tour's return to the Dallas area after a three-year absence. 
</P>
<P>
	That should be welcome news for the 17 Texas golfers among the  
senior golfers. The tour also makes a stop in San Antonio for the 
Southwestern Bell Dominion in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``I so happy because because Dallas is such a great golf town,''  
said Don January, who lives in Dallas and is the 1986 Reunion 
champion. ``There needs to be two tournaments in Texas and I'm glad 
they didn't put them back-to-back. Hopefully, this time it'll 
stick.''

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno and South African

<HEADLINE> Cowboys' Johnston Out for Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Dallas Cowboys fullback Daryl Johnston will  
miss the rest of the season because of further neck problems 
related to 1997 surgery on a herniated disc. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston, 33, conceded the latest problem, discovered in tests  
Wednesday, could end his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is going to be a tough decision,'' he said. ``That will be  
considered at the end of the season. ... The strange thing is I 
thought after making it through last season, I'd be OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston had surgery six weeks into the 1997 season to fuse two  
vertebrae in the neck. The procedure left the area above the fused 
vertebrae vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston said he suffered a burning sensation in his neck during  
Sunday's opening victory over the Washington Redskins. It was the 
first time he felt such a sensation, known as a ``burner,'' since 
the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	A test Wednesday indicated he suffered a ``change in disc  
space,'' Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors decided he should not play the rest of this season and  
will re-evaluate the injury in six to nine months. No surgery has 
been scheduled, and Johnston said doctors are concerned another 
fusion could limit his range of motion. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston, a key run blocker in three Super Bowl championships  
for the Cowboys in the 1990s, played last season without 
complications in his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas' only backup fullback is Robert Thomas, who converted  
from linebacker in the last week of training camp. Team owner Jerry 
Jones said a move might be announced later today to fill Johnston's 
roster spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very disappointed, first and foremost for Daryl,''  
Jones said. ``He's been an inspiration for everyone.''

<HEADLINE> New London Market for Tech Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A new market for technology companies will be  
launched in November, the London Stock Exchange said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new market, called techMARK, will include more than 170  
companies already listed on the exchange. Those companies will 
retain their existing FTSE index and industry classifications. 
</P>
<P>
	``London is a major center for the listing and trading of all  
types of companies including leading technology stocks,'' said 
Gavin Casey, chief executive of the stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``The launch of techMARK builds on this success and is part of  
our long-term drive to support innovative growth companies, 
including smaller businesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said it will increase the profile and visibility of  
technology shares, and enable private and professional investors to 
target technology stocks more easily. 
</P>
<P>
	When the market begins operations in November, FTSE  
International will calculate continually updated indices for 
techMARK. FTSE also provides the Exchange's blue-chip barometer, 
the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new techMARK indices will enable investors to invest  
directly in this exciting new market. I am confident that you will 
see retail funds based on the FTSE techMARK indices before the year 
end,'' said Mark Makepeace, managing director of FTSE 
International. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the best-known names on the new index are British  
Aerospace PLC, British Telecommunications PLC and Cable &AMP; Wireless 
PLC.

	BASSETT, Va. (AP) -- Former WBC heavyweight champion Oliver  
McCall will revive his boxing career next week with a bout against 
Samson Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight is set for Sept. 25 at Bassett High School, near  
McCall's home in Collinsville, Va. The card will include seven or 
eight bouts. 
</P>
<P>
	McCall, 35, hasn't fought since early 1998. He was released from

a one-year sentence for assault and battery of a law enforcement 
officer and resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	McCall (34-6) said he wanted to fight at the school because he  
has two daughters on its girls' basketball team. He has been 
training since May in Orwell, Ohio.

<HEADLINE> Bill Affects Elderly Job Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- National organizations that help needy senior  
citizens find jobs would lose money to states under legislation 
approved by a House committee Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill updates the Older Americans Act, which sets priorities  
for the use of federal dollars going to state and local programs 
for elderly -- everything from Meals on Wheels to nursing home 
ombudsmen. 
</P>
<P>
	National groups such as AARP and Green Thumb receive 78 percent  
of the $440 million annually that goes to jobs programs for senior 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this means for the states is that they have very little  
authority to direct national organizations to serve seniors in 
certain parts of their state and they are left to fill the gaps 
with very little resources,'' said Rep. Bill Goodling, chairman of 
the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee passed the legislation by a voice vote.  
</P>
<P>
	The change gradually would reduce the proportion of money going  
to national groups to 55 percent, with state agencies on aging 
getting more funding. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democrats and the Clinton administration are opposed,  
saying the change could be disruptive for thousands of senior 
citizens who have job placements through the national groups, which 
often provide stipends to help pay needy elderly people who work 
part-time doing community service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Program results confirm that the national grantees serve more  
people at a lower cost and place more enrollees in jobs in the 
competitive labor market than do the state agencies,'' said Labor 
Secretary Alexis Herman in letter sent Wednesday to Goodling, R-Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, the legislation approves a new $125 million  
program proposed by President Clinton that would offer advice and 
help to families caring at home for sick or disabled elders. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill still faces a vote by the full House, and the Senate  
has yet to consider Older Americans Act reauthorization this year. 
Since 1994, disagreements among lawmakers about proposed changes 
have led Congress to skip reauthorization all together, instead 
opting to simply provide money for aging programs operating under 
old guidelines.

<HEADLINE> Congress Approves Pay-Raise Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress sent legislation to President Clinton  
today that would boost salaries for the next president, federal 
workers and lawmakers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The pay raises were part of a $28 billion measure financing the  
Treasury Department and smaller agencies for fiscal 2000, which 
begins Oct. 1. The Senate gave final congressional approval to the 
bill by 54-38, with several senators saying that many ``no'' votes 
were because of the pay raises for lawmakers. The House passed it 
by 292-126. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, which Clinton is expected to sign, would open the door  
for a $4,600 pay raise for members of Congress to $141,300 a year. 
The boost, which would take effect in January, would be lawmakers' 
first since January 1998 and second since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	By law, legislators receive an annual salary increase unless  
they vote to block it, and the Treasury bill is the traditional 
vehicle for doing that. The measure contained no language 
preventing the 3.4 percent increase, nor was it mentioned during 
brief debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the legislation, the next president's salary would double  
to $400,000 in January 2001, the first increase for the chief 
executive since 1969. And federal workers would get average pay 
raises of 4.8 percent, their highest annual increase since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate also voted 95-0 for a $49.5 billion transportation  
measure that boosts spending for roads, mass transit and airports. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Republicans were forced to drop a provision that  
would have cut mass transit aid to New York and California after 
Democrats objected. The House approved a different version of the 
bill in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Appropriations Committee was also expected to approve  
a huge spending bill today that would top Clinton's request for 
veterans' health care by $1.1 billion and ease House-approved cuts 
in space programs and housing, but trim some environmental 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The money was part of a $90.9 billion measure financing  
veterans, housing, space and environmental programs for fiscal 
2000. A subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee 
approved the bill by voice vote Wednesday as lawmakers, just two 
weeks from the new fiscal year, sorted through spending 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's veterans-housing bill illustrated that even as  
Republicans walk away from budget fights with Clinton, others are 
brewing. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner  
complained that a $196 million cut by the subcommittee in her 
agency's operations budget threatens ``the backbone of our national 
environmental effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the cuts will affect environmental enforcement and air  
and water pollution programs. She also decried a $100 million 
shortfall in what the EPA wanted for the Superfund toxic waste 
program and said lawmakers earmarked $197 million on ``special 
home-state projects'' the EPA did not seek. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would finance 120 environmental research and  
construction projects from coast to coast. They ranged from 
$250,000 for acid rain research at the University of Vermont to 
$1.5 million for a wastewater treatment plant in Kauai County, 
Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the legislation would provide about the same as Clinton  
requested and $1 billion more than the House approved last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would give NASA the full $13.6 billion Clinton  
requested, and exceed his $17.3 billion proposal for veterans' 
health care by $1.1 billion. And though it would trim $1 billion 
from Clinton's $28 billion request for housing, it provides $1 
billion more for housing than the House did. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would also fund the national service volunteer program  
and the selective service -- both eliminated by the House bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sky is not falling here,'' said Sen. Christopher Bond,  
R-Mo., the bill's chief author. ``We're doing our job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bills are among 11 spending measures for the coming fiscal  
year that Congress has not completed. Only two spending measures 
have been shipped to the White House so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying they were determined to get all the bills to Clinton on  
time, Republican leaders continued trying to figure out how they 
would pay for them without spending Social Security surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders were strongly considering ways to spend an emerging  
package of emergency agriculture aid in the remaining two weeks of 
fiscal 1999. The money -- likely to exceed $7 billion -- would not be 
dispersed to farmers that quickly, but it would be counted in 
1999's books. 
</P>
<P>
	Also proposed was a plan to delay $4 billion in Medicaid  
payments to the states from next September into early October, the 
start of fiscal 2001. The shift would save no money but ease fiscal 
2000 spending pressures by $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans plan to use all $14 billion projected for next  
year's federal surplus, excluding Social Security. About $1 billion 
would be restored from cuts in Medicare payments to nursing homes 
made in 1997; $3 billion to renew several expiring business tax 
benefits; and $4 billion to pay for next year's census. 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves about $6 billion to beef up spending bills.  
Republicans estimate they need to find perhaps $20 billion more in 
savings to complete all the bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Not voting on the transportation bill were Sens. John Breaux,  
D-La.; Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii; Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.; John 
McCain, R-Ariz.; and Paul Wellstone, D-Minn.

<HEADLINE> Report: Irish QB in Ticket Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Notre Dame is investigating a report  
that a former backup quarterback tried to sell complimentary 
tickets, a school official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	School spokesman Dennis Moore said Notre Dame learned of the  
allegations involving Eric Chappell, who was dismissed from the 
team earlier this week, several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We treat this like we treat anything. Any time we think there  
are any potential NCAA ramifications, we make a full report to the 
NCAA,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame's student newspaper, The Observer, quoted an  
anonymous source in Thursday's editions who claimed Chappell 
offered to sell him and a 1998 Notre Dame graduate two tickets for 
the Sept. 4 Notre Dame-Michigan game for $50 each. 
</P>
<P>
	The source said he had previously received free tickets from  
Chappell and other players and claimed that the 1998 graduate had 
given Chappell at least a dozen gifts over the last 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The source said he notified the athletic department after  
declining to purchase the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore wouldn't discuss the specifics of the report.  
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA Committee on Infractions, already looking at the  
football program, is expected to rule within the next several 
months whether to penalize the university over contact between a 
booster and up to a dozen players. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA spokeswoman Jane Jankowski said it would be up to the  
committee to determine whether the latest allegation would affect 
its decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bob Davie dismissed Chappell from the team earlier this  
week, saying he had violated an undisclosed team rule. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm comfortable that we acted immediately on any information  
we had,'' Davie said Thursday night. ``I'm totally comfortable that 
we took the right steps with our actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that the proper steps have been taken, so there's no  
sense in speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The senior has played in only three games during his career at  
Notre Dame and was listed third on the quarterback depth chart. He 
started last season against Southern Cal when starter Jarious 
Jackson was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Chappell, who earlier this week said his ``punishment fit the  
crime'' after he was kicked off the team, denied the allegations to 
The Observer. Phone calls by The Associated Press to his dorm room 
went unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame spokesman John Heisler said it is school policy to  
give four passes to players who make the trip for road games or 
dress for home games. 
</P>
<P>
	The players don't receive actual tickets but submit a list of  
names during the week to the school for a pass list. People on the 
list then show some form of identification to be admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Heisler said the practice doesn't violate NCAA rules, and the  
university pays for the passes out of its budget. But players are 
explicitly informed that they are not allowed to sell the passes, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an NCAA violation,'' Heisler said of selling passes.  
``That would be well known.''

<HEADLINE> Gunman Shatters Church Celebration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Thumping bass notes from a Christian  
rock band shook the lobby of Wedgwood Baptist Church. In walked a 
stranger dressed in black and smoking a cigarette. ``What's the 
program?'' he demanded. 
</P>
<P>
	A church maintenance worker approached the tall, gaunt man with  
long hair. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Gene Ashbrook, 47, pointed a semiautomatic handgun,  
squeezed the trigger -- and began a shooting rampage that shattered 
lives as well as the shining glass windows and the joyful revelry 
at the church sanctuary Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaving the bleeding janitor crumpled on the ground near the  
front door, Ashbrook strode on. 
</P>
<P>
	Toting two guns and all the ammunition he could stuff in his  
pockets, he asked where the kids were and continued toward the 
sanctuary, where 150 teen-agers stomped and clapped to roaring 
Christian anthems of the rock band Forty Days. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was Sydney Rochelle Browning he met next, tucked onto a  
sofa in the foyer. Browning, 36, was the director of the children's 
choir. She was the first to die. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody knows whether she spoke to the gunman. But he opened fire  
again, leaving Browning's body slumped gently in place. She looked 
like she was sleeping against the wall, witnesses later recalled, 
retracing the killer's footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
	A young man peddling Christian rock CDs in the lobby was the  
last victim shot outside the sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time Ashbrook reached the broad double doors leading into  
the church's heart, three people sprawled behind him, dead or 
seriously wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the sanctuary, some teen-agers had heard the popping  
sounds but assumed they came from the huge speakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in a calamitous shower of glass, bullets shattered windows  
flanking the entry. Ashbrook slipped into the back of the 
sanctuary, but few noticed -- many teen-agers remained absorbed in 
the music. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman slammed his fist into the door, loud enough to hush  
the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Kids fumbled with their paper programs. A skit was scheduled to  
follow the concert, and many assumed the gun-toting stranger was an 
actor. There were half-smiles, nervous laughs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashbrook seemed a bit uncertain, pacing in the back of the  
sanctuary and muttering to himself. Then he began to yell, to 
curse. 
</P>
<P>
	Reality seeped slowly through: As Ashbrook began firing into the  
crowd, people fell, some bloodied, some dying. 
</P>
<P>
	Students dived beneath the gleaming wooden pews or scampered  
along the aisles. Some fled, some froze. Still others stood, cried 
``Shoot me!'' ``I'll stand for Jesus!'' or ``You need Jesus Christ 
in your life!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps they still assumed the killer was a visiting actor; some  
recalled a young woman who was killed at April's shooting at 
Columbine High School when she declared her belief in Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashbrook was enraged. He roamed the aisles in the now quiet  
sanctuary, shooting those who called out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shut up,'' he ordered. ``Stay still.'' Spent rounds clanged on  
the floor behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	A young girl collapsed behind Adam Hammond, a youth minister for  
Southwayside Baptist Church. Her blood soaked Hammond's clothes as 
he hid beneath a pew. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I would die there,'' Hammond later told the Baptist  
Press. ``I didn't know what to do; I don't guess anyone does until 
they're in that situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashbrook yanked a pipe bomb from his pocket, lit the fuse and  
rolled it toward the stage. It clattered down to the front of the 
church, and an explosion echoed off the vaulted ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time two police officers dashed into the church, seven  
people were fatally wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashbrook sunk into a back pew. Less than five minutes after he  
walked in, Ashbrook raised his gun to his head. One last, muffled 
shot sounded in the sanctuary.

<HEADLINE>  Bird Plans To Stop Coaching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Larry Bird always planned to stay only three  
years as coach of the Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	He made it official Wednesday, saying he would step down at the  
end of the 1999-2000 season when his three-year contract expires. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came to Indianapolis, I sat down and talked to (Pacers  
president) Donnie Walsh and said straight out that three years was 
long enough for one coach at one place,'' Bird told Indianapolis 
television station WISH during a satellite interview from Naples, 
Fla., with broadcasters to promote his book, ``Bird Watching: On 
Playing and Coaching the Game I Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a great experience for me. It's not something I  
dreamed of doing,'' said Bird, selected NBA coach of the year in 
his rookie season on the Indiana bench when the Pacers reached the 
seventh game of the Eastern Conference playoffs before losing to 
eventual champion Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers followed up by winning the Central Division  
championship last season, but were upset in the Eastern Conference 
finals by the New York Knicks, a loss that Bird said ``broke my 
heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's statements confirm a portion of Bird's book in which  
he said he told Walsh that he would complete his contract as coach. 
``He wants me to come back, and I'm not a quitter. I plan to stick 
to the original provision of my contract to coach for only three 
years. That will be more than enough for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh said he hasn't discussed Bird's future since last season,  
but didn't expect Bird to continue as Pacers coach after his 
contract expired. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is I'd like to see him continue with the  
franchise in some way,'' Walsh said. ``I'm extremely pleased with 
everything he's done as a coach, and if he doesn't want to coach, 
then I'd love to have him with us in another role. 
</P>
<P>
	``Larry and I have to sit down and discuss his desires. We  
haven't had any recent conversation about his future and I've told 
him that I'd like to have one when he gets back in town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked by Indianapolis TV station WRTV whether he would  
accept a front-office job with the Pacers, Bird didn't rule it out, 
but said he has no current plans to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see after the year's up,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, we can talk him out of it, but he's been honest  
from the beginning about this. He said three years and this will be 
the third year. It's been great playing for him and we want to 
finish strong for him,'' point guard Mark Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird said he didn't expect to change his mind, no matter what  
happens in the upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
	``These players have made it a great experience for me. After  
last year, I'm very down from the way we ended up. I thought we had 
a great shot at getting to the finals, and we didn't do it. This 
year is going to be no different. We're going to work hard and I'll 
expect a lot out of them,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Amnesia Victim Found in Oklahoma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- She passed from one 18-wheeler to another  
for days, wandering. When she looked in the mirror, she didn't 
recognize the face staring back, nor did she recall how she ended 
up on a dark highway, rain-soaked and bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a month after suffering a blow to the head, the mystery  
woman is staying at a women's shelter with only vague notions about 
who she is. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's scary. Indescribably scary,'' the woman said as she  
pushed back a lock of brown hair. ``I don't know who I am, where 
I've been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Workers at the shelter call her Angel, for now.  
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 19 a truck driver brought her to a truck stop near  
Springer, about 80 miles south of Oklahoma City, and asked a clerk 
to call for help. When a sheriff's deputy arrived, Angel had only 
the clothes she was wearing and a $20 bill in her pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	She wears a wedding ring but knows nothing of a husband. She has  
the scars of a Caesarean section birth, but can't remember any 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	She knows a lot about animals and can explain their breeding  
habits, their diets and their muscular structures. But when 
officials asked whether she perhaps could be a veterinarian, Angel 
didn't seem to understand what a veterinarian was. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs has taken over the  
investigation, partly because Angel appears to be an American 
Indian and partly because BIA Capt. Larry Hoklotubbe has developed 
a special devotion to this case. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the most bizarre mystery I've worked in 23 years of law  
enforcement,'' he said. ``We've done everything that good police 
work says to do, and we've got nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoklotubbe said the FBI found no matches to Angel's  
fingerprints, nor did a BIA database in Carson City, Nev. She also 
didn't match any of the missing persons reports that were checked. 
</P>
<P>
	While hitchhiking, Angel remembers seeing a road sign that said  
``Now leaving the land of enchantment.'' That's New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Three doctors who have examined Angel all concluded that her  
amnesia resulted from a head trauma. Her face was bruised and 
burned when she first turned up at the truck stop, and doctors 
suspect those injuries came from an airbag deploying in a car 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Under hypnosis by a psychiatrist, Angel told of crashing into a  
concrete embankment during a nighttime thunderstorm, but she 
couldn't provide any details. 
</P>
<P>
	She says she wants to solve the mystery, but she is afraid to  
discover her past. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm scared to find out, scared I won't like myself,'' she  
said. ``But I'm scared to stay this way, too, not knowing.''

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Reserves at Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea's usable foreign exchange  
reserves have reached a record $65.28 billion, central bank 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea was forced to agree to a $58 billion loan from the  
International Monetary Fund in November 1997 to save its faltering 
economy. The nation's foreign exchange reserves, which stood at $7 
billion at that time, have since increased sharply with the help of 
large trade surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea recorded a trade surplus of $39 billion last year,  
thanks to sharply decreasing imports and a weak won that made its 
exports cheap in international markets. This year's surplus through 
mid-August was more than $15 billion.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Baht Hits 12-Month Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thailand's government said it was not  
concerned at the prospect of the baht sinking below 40 to the U.S. 
dollar, which the currency promptly did on Thursday to hit a 
12-month low. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts said they expected central bank intervention in  
currency markets on Friday to prevent a further fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The baht closed at 40.05 to the dollar Thursday, after an Asian  
close on Wednesday of 39.475 to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recent instability over the past month, the exchange rate  
for the baht had ranged from about 36 to 37 to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Finance Minister Pisit Leeahtam said Thursday that the  
baht's fall was in line with weakness among the region's currencies 
because of the unsettled situation in East Timor and expectations 
that China will devalue its yuan. 
</P>
<P>
	Pisit said the government floated the baht in July 1997 and ``we  
should not interfere with it now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Satian Tantanasarit, a senior vice president at Thai Danu  
Bank, said he expected Thailand's central bank to intervene in 
Asian trade Friday if the dollar climbs to a range 40.25. 
</P>
<P>
	A rapid depreciation of the baht two years ago triggered a run  
on currencies across Southeast Asia, leading to a regional economic 
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Bush: 'Wave of Evil' Sweeping U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate  
George W. Bush said Thursday that ``a wave of evil'' -- not a lack 
of gun control laws -- is the cause of rampant gun violence in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	Scrapping two fund-raisers to rush home to Texas and the scene  
of a deadly shooting spree, the GOP front-runner said the tragedy 
had not softened his pro-gun views. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know of a law -- a governmental law -- that will put  
love in people's hearts,'' the Texas governor told reporters at a 
news conference. He toured a local elementary school and met 
privately with former President Gerald Ford before leaving for 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	His eyes red and moist, Bush said: ``It's hard to explain how  
hatred lurks in somebody's heart to the point where he walks into a 
church where children and adults were seeking God's guidance and 
shoots them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven people were fatally shot Wednesday night at a Fort Worth,  
Texas, Baptist church before the gunman killed himself in a pew. 
Authorities did not know the man's motive. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting posed a potential political problem for the  
two-term governor who signed a 1995 law allowing Texans to carry 
concealed weapons with a permit. Democrats have questioned his 
commitment to federal and state efforts to require background 
checks at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who spoke to police in Texas shortly before the news  
conference, said he was told the suspect did not have a 
concealed-weapons permit. ``I don't know his background, but it 
sounds to me like he's mentally deranged,'' Bush said. ``You bet, 
I'd like to make sure people like him don't have guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he didn't budge from his belief that new anti-gun laws are  
not the answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There seems to be a wave of evil passing through America now  
and we as a society can pass laws and hold people accountable for 
the decisions they make, but our hopes and prayers have got to be 
that there is more love in society,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This man obviously was acting as a result of evil in his  
heart,'' Bush said. ``I would hope that Americans would 
collectively pray for love in people's heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like most Republicans generally in line with the National Rifle  
Association, Bush said current laws need to be enforced. Punish 
people who illegally sell guns or who commit crimes with a gun; 
keep weapons out of the hands of felons and mentally ill people; 
ban certain assault weapons and require background checks at gun 
shows, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he embraced a GOP-backed bill in the House this year  
which the White House and gun-control advocates said would weaken 
existing laws governing gun shows. Democrats in Texas criticize 
Bush for failing to back a state gun show bill, though the governor 
said federal law made the measure unworkable. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said that ``most Americans want somebody reasonable who has  
a rational view'' of the topic. 
</P>
<P>
	He canceled the remainder of his Michigan trip, including a  
gathering of state Republicans on Mackinaw Island.

<HEADLINE> Damage Award Against Ford Overturned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MODESTO, Calif. (AP) -- A judge overturned Thursday a $290  
million damage award against Ford Motor Co., ruling that a juror's 
dream and a TV show tainted deliberations about three deaths in a 
rollover accident with a Ford Bronco. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanislaus County Superior Court Judge Roger Beauchesne granted  
Ford a new trial on the punitive damages, saying jury misconduct 
may have influenced the July 12 verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge upheld the jury's unanimous finding that a defective  
roof was responsible for the deaths of a husband, wife and son when 
their Ford Bronco overturned on a freeway in June 1993. The jury 
awarded surviving family members $5 million in compensation, an 
amount Beauchesne reduced by $469,000. 
</P>
<P>
	During deliberations, one juror allegedly talked about a  
nightmare in which children of the jurors were killed in a Ford 
Bronco that was rolling over while the automaker's lawyers chanted, 
``Where's the proof?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A second juror said she'd heard about an episode of ``60  
Minutes'' in which a report about fires in Ford Mustangs included 
callous remarks by Lee Iaccoca, the former Ford executive who 
introduced the Mustang and later became chief executive of 
Chrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	Both jurors submitted statements saying they based their  
verdicts solely on the evidence presented in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	But Judge Beauchesne granted Ford a new trial on the punitive  
damages, saying the two jurors' comments may have influenced the 
deliberations. He noted that the jury vote on punitive damages was 
9-3, the exact majority needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford spokesman Jim Cain said the ruling was gratifying, but the  
company maintains the Bronco wasn't defective and may appeal the 
case further. 
</P>
<P>
	The $290 million verdict had been the second-largest of its  
kind, coming just two weeks after a Los Angeles jury awarded $4.9 
billion to six people who were severely burned when their Chevrolet 
exploded in a rear-end collision. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1993, Juan Romo was driving the 1978 model Bronco when  
he swerved to avoid a van he was passing. The vehicle rolled over, 
killing Romo's mother, Salustia, 40; his father, Ramon, 39; and his 
brother, Ramiro, 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Romo, then 19, and his two surviving sisters, Evangelina, 14,  
and Maria, 8, were slightly injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Their lawyers argued that Ford knew the Bronco's roof was unsafe  
but decided to save the extra cost of reinforcing it with steel, a 
change made on post-1979 Broncos. The plaintiffs' witnesses 
included a former Ford executive vice president who said company 
officials knew the roof was virtually certain to fail in a 
rollover. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford asserted that the Bronco's roof was sound and met federal  
safety standards, blaming the deaths on Romo and the driver he was 
passing. 
</P>
<P>
	In seeking a new trial, Ford offered statements by jurors that  
fellow juror Denise Salinas had described a ``60 Minutes'' segment 
about faulty fuel tanks in Ford Mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
	Iaccoca, then Ford's president, was incorrectly quoted by  
Salinas as saying Ford would rather defend against lawsuits than 
recall or fix vehicles. Beauchesne said Thursday a tape of the 
program contained no such statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Romos' lawyers recently submitted a sworn statement from  
Salinas in which she said she briefly mentioned what someone had 
told her about the program, but agreed with another juror that it 
was irrelevant to the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford also submitted declarations that a second juror, Karen  
Zaccheo, described her nightmare about rolling Broncos and burning 
children as an ``omen,'' and advised other jurors they did not need 
to follow the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Zaccheo's declaration, offered by the Romos' lawyers, confirmed  
that she mentioned the dream but denied the additional statements. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurence Drivon, a lawyer for the Romos, said plaintiffs'  
lawyers will review the ruling before deciding on their next step.

<HEADLINE> Russia Harvests 68 Percent of Grain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian farmers have harvested 68 percent of the  
annual grain harvest and 20 percent of the vegetable crop, the 
Agriculture Ministry reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers have cleared 69.6 million acres of grain, or 3.4 million  
acres more than during the same period last year, the ministry 
said, according to the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	State-owned farms have cleared 92,900 acres of vegetables, 20  
percent of the government's goal of 457,000 acres, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has forecast that Russia's grain harvest this  
year will reach 66 million tons, in spite of damage by summer 
drought and swarms of locusts. Last year, the grain harvest totaled 
just 47.8 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Candidates' Reactions to Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Presidential candidates' reactions to the Wednesday shootings at  
Wedgwood Baptist Church in Fort Worth, Texas that killed eight, 
including the gunman. 

</P>
<P>
	``First and foremost, very deep sympathy for the families and  
friends of the victims. It's unimaginable to deal with that. They 
are all in (Bill) Bradley's thoughts. ... I think that sadly it 
once again re-enforces the need for greater, more effective gun 
control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Eric Hauser, spokesman for former Sen. Bill Bradley, a  
Democrat 

</P>
<P>
	``A hurricane is something we cannot do anything about. It is an  
act of God. But this shooting is something people do to people. 
</P>
<P>
	We do know that the availability of assault weapons and deadly  
weapons in the hands of people who shouldn't have them contributes 
to a repeat (of such) incidents, to having these things happen over 
and over again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic front-runner, at a  
meeting with students in San Diego commenting on Hurricane Floyd 
and the church shootings 

</P>
<P>
	``We must stop turning a blind eye to societal elements that  
create such empty hearts that commit these crimes. We never thing 
this could happen in our own community, but the people of Fort 
Worth have become the latest victims. ... I urge the Justice 
Department to review the evidence in these recent shooting to 
determine if a pattern of crimes against men and women of faith 
exists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- GOP Gary Bauer in a statement  

</P>
<P>
	``I don't know of a law -- a governmental law -- that will put  
love in people's hearts. ... There seems to be a wave of evil 
passing through America now, and we as a society can pass laws and 
hold people accountable for the decisions they make, but our hopes 
and prayers have got to be that there is more love in society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Texas Gov. George W. Bush  

</P>
<P>
	``This doesn't change his position at all. He's been talking on  
the Judiciary Committee about how the Clinton-Gore Administration 
has done poor job of prosecuting gun crimes. If we made clear that 
anybody who used a gun in crime would be severely punished ... that 
is what we need to be doing. Until that's done there should not be 
any more gun laws.''

<HEADLINE> Regulators Halt Lotion Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The manufacturer of a popular antibacterial  
hand lotion agreed Wednesday not to make claims the product ``stops 
germs,'' government regulators said. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement with the Federal Trade Commission means Unilever  
Home &AMP; Personal Care USA is prohibited from making any claims that 
its Vaseline Brand Intensive Care Antibacterial Hand Lotion ``stops 
germs longer than washing alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No marketing claims will wash without adequate  
substantiation,'' said Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's 
consumer protection division. 
</P>
<P>
	``The degree and duration of the lotion's effectiveness have not  
been scientifically established,'' the commission said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	In making the settlement with the FTC, New York-based Unilever  
admitted no wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the active ingredient in the hand lotion is  
``triclosan,'' a common antibacterial ingredient, but it has not 
been proved effective against viruses such as those that cause 
colds and the flu, said the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now there's simply no evidence that using antibacterial  
lotion reduces the incidence of any disease,'' Bernstein added. 
</P>
<P>
	Unilever ads for the lotion appeared nationwide in newspapers  
and magazines and were broadcast on radio and television.

<HEADLINE> Doctors See More Female Circumcision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dr. Nawal Nour's clinic rings with different  
languages, as women from Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan flock to see the 
Boston gynecologist and obstetrician. 
</P>
<P>
	Many are hunting a doctor who won't flinch or interrogate them --  
because they have undergone a procedure very few American doctors 
have ever seen: Female circumcision. Or, as critics call it, female 
genital mutilation. 
</P>
<P>
	Female circumcision is a cultural practice in parts of Africa  
and the Middle East that involves cutting a woman's genitals, 
usually before puberty. It can range from clipping or burning the 
clitoris, to cutting off all the external genitals and sewing the 
remnant tissue to leave just a tiny opening. 
</P>
<P>
	It's quite a shock the first time a U.S. doctor sees one of  
these cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Women complain of leaving doctors who upset or embarrassed them  
with: ``Oh, you've been scarred!'' or ``How did this happen, who 
did this?'' 
</P>
<P>
	First reactions aside, many doctors also don't know what care  
women may need for complications like severe pain, infections or 
difficult childbirth, says Nour, who runs an African women's health 
clinic at Brigham and Women's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 130 million women and girls worldwide are estimated to have  
undergone the ritual cutting, and the last time U.S. officials 
counted -- in 1990 -- they estimated 168,000 had moved to this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Those numbers ``are a gross underestimation,'' contends Nour,  
saying a rapid rise in immigration means more American doctors need 
to know how to care for those women. 
</P>
<P>
	The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, faced with  
increasing calls for treatment advice, agrees. So this month, it is 
issuing the first recommendations on counseling and treatment for 
circumcised women. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-authored by Nour -- and accompanied by pictures to show what  
different forms of female circumcision look like before doctors see 
their first patient -- the recommendations are being sent to all 
medical schools and ob-gyn residency programs in the United States 
and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Nour spent much of her childhood in Sudan and Egypt, and has  
numerous relatives who underwent female circumcision. She became a 
gynecologist partly because ``I wanted to go back to Sudan, to 
provide good care for women in developing nations, and I really 
have been very adamantly against this practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Boston, she gave medical lectures on female circumcision, and  
``the next thing I knew ... my clinic started filling up with 
African patients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Step 1 for U.S. doctors, Nour says, is understanding female  
circumcision so the patient doesn't feel judged. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really hard if you've never seen this before not to  
react. ... It's a terrible act that's been performed,'' says Nour. 
``Of course it's shocking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All I'm asking is (that) physicians sort out their own  
feelings first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many proponents say female circumcision promotes chastity,  
because sex can become painful. International organizations working 
to stop the ritual cutting say it's violence against women -- girls 
can die from bleeding or infection, and survivors can have years of 
complications. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of controversy abroad, the women who move here need  
medical care. 
</P>
<P>
	Some seek merely routine gynecologic care without condemnation  
of a ritual they accept. If they don't consider themselves 
mutilated, Nour warns, the actual terms doctors use become 
important in establishing trust. 
</P>
<P>
	Other women suffer pain during sex or menstruation, infertility,  
cysts, absesses or recurrent infections, all long-term 
complications the ACOG recommendations address. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider a pregnant woman who has been infibulated -- the most  
severe circumcision, which leaves only a tiny vaginal opening. 
Corrective surgery widens that opening so she doesn't suffer a 
terrible tear during labor. It is not hard, says Nour, who wrote 
step-by-step instructions, but the scar intimidates some doctors 
into thinking such women's only option is a Cesarean section. 
</P>
<P>
	Some women want surgery to improve quality of life, Nour says,  
citing a newly married couple who sought her help because sex is so 
difficult -- while others will be insulted if such surgery is 
offered unasked.

<HEADLINE> Gore Blasts Bush's Education Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore took direct aim Thursday  
at George W. Bush's national education plan, saying the Republican 
presidential front-runner's proposal to strip failing schools of 
federal funds would ``virtually destroy them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You cannot strengthen learning by weakening public  
education,'' Gore told more than 1,500 business leaders at the 
U.S.Hispanic Chamber of Commerce's national convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``In many neighborhoods, public schools would be devastated'' by  
Bush's school voucher plan, Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination,  
also took an unmistakable shot at Bush's views on gun control one 
day after a gunman's rampage in a Fort Worth, Texas church left 
seven victims and the shooter dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said Thursday that ``a wave of evil'' -- not a lack of gun  
control laws -- is the cause of rampant gun violence in America. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Gore said: ``We can do something to cut down on the  
kinds of tragedies that these people have suffered in Fort Worth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We do know that the availability of assault weapons and deadly  
weapons in the hands of people who shouldn't have them contributes 
to a repeat in (such) incidents, to having these things happen over 
and over again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore never mentioned Bush by name.  
</P>
<P>
	Gore made his 59th visit to California as vice president chiefly  
to release a U.S. Department of Justice report recommending that 
the federal and state governments stiffen laws outlawing 
``cyberstalking'' and making it easier to track those who 
repeatedly harass and threaten others through the Internet and 
other electronic means. 
</P>
<P>
	The report called on states to review their existing laws and  
toughen them where there are no statutes that directly address 
online stalking. It also said federal laws, which currently bar 
online stalking of children, should be expanded to cover adults; 
that sentences for such crimes be toughened; and that laws be 
passed that ease investigators work in tracking electronic 
stalkers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The laws that have begun to appear on the books of progressive  
states like California must be on the books of every state,'' Gore 
said during meeting a with about three-dozen young people and 
law-enforcement officials at San Diego State University, where he 
heard from two women students who said online harassment had left 
them unnerved. 
</P>
<P>
	``And federal law must be amended to give us the tools to deal  
with this crime appropriately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Gore has attacked Bush's school-voucher plan since Bush  
unveiled it Sept. 2, the vice president's remarks Thursday were his 
most pointed criticism yet of how Bush would pay for his plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush proposed that chronically failing schools be denied  
so-called Title I federal funds that flow to classrooms in poor 
neighborhoods, and he would give the money to states, which would 
pass them to parents. They could use the money to pay for a variety 
of educational purposes, including private school tuition. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush campaign aides said his plans would require schools to  
perform. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too bad that Vice President Gore has got such low  
expectations for public schools in America.... Bush knows that we 
have high expectations that schools will rise to the challenge, and 
we can make sure no child is left behind in our educational 
system,'' said Bush campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's address to the Hispanic business group was his fourth in  
as many days and came on the first day of his second California 
swing in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president left Washington at about 1 a.m. Thursday,  
about seven hours earlier than he had initially planned, to beat 
Hurricane Floyd as it churned toward the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	He taped two national morning news programs and made an  
appearance on The Weather Channel, where he provided an update 
about what the federal government knew about the storm and what 
disaster-management agencies were doing to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
	In a conference call with reporters, he pledged to improve his  
standing in New Hampshire polls that show him locked in a dead heat 
with former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, the other Democrat 
running. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to campaign vigorously in every community across New  
Hampshire,'' he said, ``meeting people one on one, family by 
family, community by community.''

<HEADLINE> NFL Telecasts Get Passing Grades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The opening week of the NFL season went a lot smoother for the  
networks than for the New York Jets and Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	The return of instant replay was a success -- so far. Both ABC  
and CBS benefited from Dan Dierdorf jumping from the former to the 
latter. And television ratings were up -- across the board. 
</P>
<P>
	Week One had 11 replay reviews and four reversals. The average  
time of the review took 55 seconds, according to Dennis Lewin, the 
NFL's head of broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
	More importantly, there were no glitches.  
</P>
<P>
	``The replay clearly is going well and the technology is working  
well, but it will never be without controversy,'' Lewin said. 
``This is not a perfect system. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll never have a perfect system.''  
</P>
<P>
	Dierdorf, now with Verne Lundquist as CBS' No. 2 team, had a  
chance to see the most meaningful replay of the week in the 
Packers' comeback win over Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was exactly what the NFL wanted,'' Dierdorf said. ``It was  
an incorrect call on the field -- an important play that really 
mattered -- and it eventually turned into a touchdown for Green Bay. 
It worked perfectly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierdorf's departure from ABC's ``Monday Night Football'' has  
made the NFL's showcase broadcast a much easier listen with just Al 
Michaels and Boomer Esiason in the booth. Yet his presence gives 
CBS a solid No. 2 team, and more importantly, has allowed the 
network to shift Randy Cross into the studio. 
</P>
<P>
	Cross is just one piece that is responsible for a much-improved  
``NFL Today'' show. Craig James and Jerry Glanville were also 
brought in with holdover Jim Nantz. 
</P>
<P>
	``What makes these guys good is they have strong opinions and  
give good information,'' Nantz said. ``We don't want to be quite on 
the same level as Fox as how bizarre we are, but we also want to 
let Jerry be Jerry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nantz was right on the money with his lead-in to the crew's  
predictions of the Buffalo-Indianapolis game. He spoke about Bills 
running back Antowain Smith and the team's unhappiness with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith finished with 7 yards.  
</P>
<P>
	Overnight ratings, which measure the top 46 markets, were up for  
Fox's and CBS' pregame shows from the first week of 1998. CBS was 
up 3 percent to a 3.2, while Fox jumped 24 percent to a 4.6. Fox 
Sports Net's debut, with Chris Myers, Marv Levy, Jackie Slater and 
Chris Spielman, put up a .5. 
</P>
<P>
	But the big winner of the week was ``MNF,'' which along with the  
other networks reaped the rewards of the NFL starting the season 
the week after Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a plus, not starting the season on Labor Day,'' Lewin  
said. ``We knew that going in. There is a chance to do that on a 
regular basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC posted a 16.1 rating, up 9 percent from last year's opener.  
After reverting back to the traditional 9 p.m. ET start time, 
ratings in all West Coast market's were up, including Seattle (28 
percent), Sacramento (26), Portland (25), San Francisco (20) and 
Los Angeles (12). 
</P>
<P>
	CBS' six games posted a 12.0 overnight rating, up 46 percent  
from the first week last season. Fox's doubleheader jumped 12 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the return of the Browns posted a 9.57 rating on ESPN  
Sunday night despite Cleveland being blown out 43-0 by Pittsburgh. 
Last year's first game, between Oakland and Kansas City, had a 
7.14.

<P>
	HBO executive producer Ross Greenburg is expecting that  
Saturday's welterweight title fight between Oscar De La Hoya and 
Felix Trinidad will not only be as entertaining, but will also sell 
as well as the big boys. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya's bout against Pernell Whitaker in April 1997 had  
800,000 buys and grossed $34 million. But the retail price of that 
fight was $39.95. This weekend's fight costs about $10 more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't ever remember a big fight with even odds and two guys

<HEADLINE> Business PACs Go To Democrats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After years of favoring Republican  
congressional candidates, business-oriented political action 
committees are boosting the share of their contributions going to 
the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	The shift comes as both parties prepare for an election in which  
the Democrats need to capture just five seats to regain control of 
the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight of the 10 biggest corporate political action committees  
boosted the share of donations going to Democrats in 1999, compared 
with the 1998 elections, an Associated Press analysis of Federal 
Election Commission records shows. 
</P>
<P>
	In many cases, Democrats are getting their largest percentage of  
business PAC contributions since the 1994 election, when they lost 
control of Congress to the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1994 elections, corporate PACs gave Republican  
congressional candidates $33 million, compared with $31 million for 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	But after the GOP takeover, corporate PACs turned decisively  
Republican in their giving. In the 1998 elections, corporate PACs 
gave $48 million to Republican candidates and just $23 million to 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless the Republicans solidify their hold on the House as the  
Democrats did, I don't see a majority of PACs giving just to 
Republicans,'' said Candice Nelson, an associate professor of 
political science at American University. 
</P>
<P>
	PACs are the donating arms of special interest groups and can  
give up to $5,000 per election to each federal candidate. That 
compares with a $1,000 limit for individual donors. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials say they are not boosting donations to  
Democrats simply because they expect a change of control in 2000. 
But they say some new Democratic members who picked up seats in the 
last two elections are more moderate than many of their more 
veteran colleagues and more likely to vote with business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our system is based on contributing based on their belief in  
an open and free trade system and support for a strong business 
community,'' said Tad Segal, a spokesman for United Parcel Service, 
which increased its Democratic contributions from 21 percent during 
the 1998 elections to 28 percent during the first half of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Another factor is that Democratic lawmakers have made an effort  
to reach out to the business community. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've yet to find a disagreement,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel,  
D-N.Y., who would be in line to take over the powerful Ways and 
Means Committee if Democrats regain the House majority. ``If you're 
talking about research and development, we're there. If you're 
talking about trade, we're there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The increased giving to Democrats by business PACs is further  
evidence that ideology aside, the business of political giving is 
often driven by practicality, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Business PACs are probably the most pragmatic givers there  
are,'' said Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center for 
Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group. ``They know that 
there's a chance the Democrats will take control of the House in 
2000 and they're preparing for that eventuality by covering their 
bets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Republican officials predict things will turn in their  
favor closer to the election. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the PAC community may be hedging bets early, we believe  
that as the election draws near, the PACs will come to realize that 
it's actually the labor unions that control the Democrat agenda, 
not business,'' said Jill Schroeder, a spokeswoman for the National 
Republican Congressional Committee.

<HEADLINE> Dragging Death Trial Gets Graphic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRYAN, Texas (AP) -- With the cold clank of metal, prosecutors  
stretched a 24 1/2-foot steel chain across the courtroom in the trial 
of a man accused of helping to drag a black man to death -- sights 
and sounds that appalled and upset many in the room. 
</P>
<P>
	One juror covered his open mouth with his hand, then looked  
away. Other jurors winced. Members of Byrd's family, seated in the 
courtroom audience, dabbed tears. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Russell Brewer, 32, the second of three white men  
accused of capital murder for the slaying of James Byrd Jr., looked 
straight ahead as the chain was uncoiled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sitting back there wondering why anyone would hook  
somebody up that way,'' Betty Boatner, Byrd's sister, said later. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally seated in the front of the courtroom during Brewer's  
trial, she said she knew the chain would be shown Thursday and 
moved to the back of the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unbelievable to me, and unbearable,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Brewer, 32, could join John William King, 24, on death row if  
convicted of the June 7, 1998, murder of Byrd. The third man, Shawn 
Allen Berry, 24, is awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry's brother, Louis, testified he had seen the chain in the  
back of his brother's truck. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agent Norm Townsend testified how Shawn Berry led him and  
other authorities to the chain, buried in a hole under a piece of 
plywood behind the trailer home of a friend. That happened the day 
after Byrd's torso -- minus a head, neck and arm -- was found at the 
end of a bumpy Jasper County back road.

<HEADLINE> FBI Recovers Bodies in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In two trips to Kosovo, FBI forensic experts  
recovered the bodies of about 200 people for the international 
tribunal looking into possible war crimes committed against ethnic 
Albanian civilians, bureau officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Working closely with local villagers searching for friends and  
relatives who disappeared during the war, FBI teams identified 
about 75 percent of the victims they found, said Dr. Donald Kerr, 
who oversees the FBI laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of 23 members of the same family -- ranging in age  
from 2 to 94 -- were found at one burial site this month, FBI team 
members told a news conference. The 2-year-old boy, recovered from 
the shallow grave north of Pristina, was clad in a red snow suit; 
he had shrapnel in his head from a hand grenade. A 4-year-old girl 
from the same family apparently had been beaten to death with the 
butt of a rifle. 
</P>
<P>
	The work was ``very emotional'' but ``my entire team wanted to  
go back'' after the first round of work was completed in June, said 
FBI section chief Art Eberhart, a team leader on both trips. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing I'll always remember is when I stared into the eyes  
of a 6-year-old boy,'' the lone survivor from the scene where the 
23 family members were slain, Eberhart said in an interview. When 
Eberhart offered him a piece of candy and tried to make friends, 
the boy ``didn't utter a word. I still saw the fear in his eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI teams recovered the bodies of about 70 possible war  
crime victims on the June trip and 124 during the second trip that 
ended Monday. The teams also included anthropologists and 
pathologists from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology who 
conducted field autopsies to determine causes of death. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 60 people went on each of the two trips. The FBI  
laboratory is conducting ballistics, blood, explosive and DNA tests 
on bullet fragments, cartridge cases and victims' clothing. The 
bureau's final report will go to the International Criminal 
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia within the next three months. 
The FBI has already given the tribunal some information from both 
trips. 
</P>
<P>
	``While reuniting people with the remains of their loved ones  
isn't pleasant, it helps in terms of closure,'' Kerr said in an 
interview. ``In effect, the FBI teams were welcomed by the Kosovar 
Albanians. We were looked at as helping them recover from what had 
happened.''

<HEADLINE> Floyd Shuts Down Much of New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The remnants of Hurricane Floyd shut down the  
city that never sleeps Thursday, sending workers home early and 
forcing an almost unprecedented shutdown of schools. 
</P>
<P>
	In preparation for the heavy wind and rain that was expected to  
hit around the evening rush hour, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani ordered 
all non-emergency city workers to go home between noon and 3 p.m. 
He also urged private businesses to close early if they could. 
</P>
<P>
	``My daughter was excited -- she didn't have to take the bus to  
school today,'' said William Wilcox, whose little girl attends a 
Catholic school in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm and expected  
to pass through Long Island, east of the city, an extra 1,000 
police were in uniform to deal with any kind of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be dealing with the side effects of it, but they're  
going to be very, very strong and very difficult,'' Giuliani said. 
``Winds, when you get up to 40 mph, can be very dangerous in New 
York City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The school closure caught parents by surprise, forcing some to  
stay home while others scrambled for baby-sitters. 
</P>
<P>
	Commuter rail lines boosted service in the early afternoon to  
handle the increased number of passengers heading home early. Some 
express buses began running at noon rather than 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, by mid-afternoon, some commuters were facing a crunch.  
There were long lines for taxis and buses. Water puddled on subway 
platforms and dripped onto tracks, reminiscent of the flash 
flooding that brought city transit to its knees Aug. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations allowed workers to leave at 1 p.m. and  
canceled a meeting on protecting civilians in war. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Jameson, a paralegal in an office near Wall Street,  
couldn't believe he got to leave, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought New Yorkers were supposed to be resilient, scared by  
nothing,'' he said as a few raindrops pelted him. ``Now we're going 
home early, which I find comical.''

<HEADLINE> Prentice Hopeful on Royals Ownership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Rebuffed by major league owners and  
delayed by Hurricane Floyd, Miles Prentice remains optimistic he 
will soon own the Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hope would be that we would have it done by  
Thanksgiving,'' Prentice said in an interview Thursday from his 
home in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, major league owners tabled a discussion of the bid  
by Prentice's group to buy the Royals for $75 million, triggering 
worry about the future of major league baseball in small-market 
Kansas City. Many fans remember when Charles O. Finley moved the 
Athletics from Kansas City to Oakland in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to start working tomorrow with people in the  
commissioner's office,'' Prentice said. ``We have scheduled some 
meetings and we're going to get them focused more specifically on 
Kansas City now that they've gotten some major deals out of the 
way. I am absolutely optimistic we're going to get this done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the meeting in Cooperstown, N.Y., owners also tabled the  
$122.4 million sale of the A's to a group headed by Save Mart Foods 
chairman Bob Piccinini and voted to merge the administrative 
operations of the American and National leagues. They also approved 
Carl Lindner's bid to buy out Marge Schott as majority owner of the 
Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, with many flying back to areas affected by Hurricane  
Floyd, they adjourned a day early. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were the victim of a little bit of unfortunate confluence  
of events,'' said Prentice, a New York lawyer who has been pursuing 
the Royals for almost three years. ``There were some truly 
historical changes and they spent quite a bit of time on that. The 
ownership committee meeting moved up because of the threat of 
weather, so things were put on a much faster track than a lot of 
people anticipated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There have been reports that owners are concerned about the size  
of Prentice's group -- almost 50 investors -- as well as their 
overall capitalization at a time when many small-market teams such 
as the Royals are struggling to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I've said, I was disappointed but not discouraged,'' said  
Prentice. ``We had an opportunity to visit with (commissioner Bud 
Selig) and we came away with a very strong feeling on the part of 
Bud and Major League Baseball to ensure that Kansas City has 
baseball, and that they'll work with our group to complete the sale 
as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A board of directors has controlled the Royals since the 1993  
death of Ewing Kauffman, who founded the expansion franchise in 
1969. It's been almost a year since the board approved Prentice's 
group after it met the requirement of more than 50 percent local 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sales of other franchises have taken longer than a year,''  
Prentice said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prentice also said Selig was quoted out of context at his news  
conference on Wednesday when he referred to ``additional 
alternatives'' being considered for the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he made that comment about additional alternatives, we  
were all quite surprised because he hadn't mentioned that to us 
before,'' Prentice said. ``I think he was trying to respond to 
questions about Oakland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owners are not scheduled to meet again until January and Selig  
said nothing would happen until he receives the report from a 
special committee studying the economics of the game. The report is 
not due for at least two months. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question we're the smallest market and they do  
have some issues about small markets,'' Prentice said. ``But Bud 
reaffirmed his intent to try to ensure that baseball remains in 
Kansas City. That was a point he made to reassure us because 
obviously that's a concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More tax-funded improvements to 27-year-old Kauffman Stadium may  
be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Luxury suites, new food courts and things like that,'' said  
Prentice. ``That's an important factor. Our view is the people of 
Kansas City support baseball and would be willing to support the 
improvements that are required. (Selig's) comment to me a number of 
times was, `We're going to have a new stadium (in Milwaukee). What 
are you getting?'''

<HEADLINE> Senator Backs Stricter Gun Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A steep decline in federal gun prosecutions  
during the Clinton administration shows Clinton is ``soft on 
crime,'' the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Justice Department official said that federal authorities are  
working with states to lock up gun criminals and more gun cases, 
state and federal, are going to court. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican who is running for  
president, released a Judiciary Committee staff report Wednesday 
that said federal gun prosecutions dropped from 7,048 in 1992, when 
George Bush was president, to 3,807 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to mouth off about gun control, but we've got lots  
of laws on the books that aren't being enforced,'' Hatch said at a 
news conference that also included one of the students injured 
during the Columbine High School shootings in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Passing any law will not stop any criminal from getting a gun  
if he knows the violation won't be prosecuted,'' said Rick 
Castaldo, whose son, Rich, was shot eight times and paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bea Witzleben, a top gun policy official at the Justice  
Department, said the figures used for Hatch's report may not 
reflect all gun cases filed by federal prosecutors. She said the 
number of criminals serving federal prison terms of more than five 
years for gun crimes is up more than 25 percent since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our combined state and federal effort has resulted in more  
criminals going to jail for guns than was true in 1992,'' Witzleben 
said. ``At the same time, violent crime with firearms has gone 
down, so we think it's working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said the Justice Department should crack down on gun  
crimes and designate one prosecutor in each U.S. Attorney's office 
to focus exclusively on firearms offenses. A juvenile crime bill 
passed by the Senate includes $50 million for this kind of effort, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also said the number of gun cases referred to  
prosecutors by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms dropped 
by 44 percent from 1992 to 1998, though the agency's staff of 
investigators dropped 14 percent during that period. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch and Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., also criticized the  
Clinton administration for not prosecuting more felons who 
illegally try to buy guns. While computerized background checks 
stopped 100,000 people from buying guns illegally during the 
system's first seven months, only 200 of those cases were referred 
to prosecutors, the senators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Witzleben said that although it is a federal crime to lie on a  
gun application, those cases are often difficult and time-consuming 
to prove. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can never do every violation of the law,'' she said. ``What  
we try to do is take the most dangerous criminals off the 
streets.''

<HEADLINE> Chernobyl Nuclear Waste Deal Signed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Ukraine and a consortium of Belgian, French  
and Italian firms signed a deal Thursday to build a nuclear waste 
processing facility at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The $122 million contract, to be financed by the European Bank  
for Reconstruction and Development, was signed in Kiev by Ukraine's 
state nuclear energy company Energoatom and Belgium's Belgatom, 
France's SGN and Italy's Ansaldo. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is a key part of the 1996 agreement between the former  
Soviet republic and the EBRD on improving safety at Chernobyl. The 
plant became infamous in 1986 after its No. 4 reactor exploded, 
spewing radiation over large parts of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Ukraine, at the West's urging, has pledged to close down the  
troubled facility by 2000, but wants outside financial help to 
complete the lengthy procedure of removing nuclear fuel and turning 
the plant into an environmentally safe zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Chernobyl's four Soviet-designed RBMK reactors have  
already been shut down, leaving only one reactor in operation. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> UAW Turns Attention to GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- With a set of precedent-setting contract terms  
from DaimlerChrysler AG in its pocket, the United Auto Workers 
appears ready to focus on negotiating a new contract with General 
Motors Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	GM will be expected to match many terms of DaimlerChrysler's  
apparent agreement -- a four-year contract with 3 percent raises 
every year, a signing bonus and clauses aimed at protecting union 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said that given the industry's record sales and  
profits, the UAW could win more than in the past -- and that all 
sides would work to avoid costly national strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think at this point that (UAW President) Stephen  
Yokich would have signed off on anything that wasn't a pretty good 
deal,'' said John Revitte, a professor at the Michigan State 
University School of Labor and Industrial Relations. ``He wanted 
something that would give him leverage at GM or at Ford.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM spokesman Edd Snyder said lower-level talks with the UAW took  
place Thursday. The GM contract covers 222,000 workers, including 
those at Delphi Automotive, GM's former parts division. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement on a new national contract for 75,000  
DaimlerChrysler workers came after three months of talks and more 
than 40 hours of marathon bargaining. Terms of the tentative 
agreement were not released by company or union spokesmen. 
</P>
<P>
	But local union officials in Indiana and New York said the deal  
was a four-year contract -- rather than the standard three-year pact 
-- with a 3 percent annual wage increase plus a $1,350 signing 
bonus. Recent contracts had in some years paid lump sums rather 
than percentage increases. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press reported the base  
wages for assembly workers would reach $22.63 per hour in the 
fourth year, up from the current $20.11. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Brown, president of Local 550 in Indianapolis, also said  
he had been told the deal includes a statement by DaimlerChrysler 
emphasizing its neutrality in union organizing. The union has said 
it would like to organize DaimlerChrysler's Mercedes-Benz sport 
utility factory in Alabama with 1,600 workers and Freightliner 
commercial truck plants in the Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
	It is against federal labor rules for the issue to be part of  
the UAW's contract. But by stating its neutrality in the contract, 
DaimlerChrysler could stay on good terms with its largest union. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Brown said the deal includes an agreement not to  
spin off any parts of the company into independent businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a clause might be aimed more at GM and Ford than  
DaimlerChrysler. GM has spun off its Delphi parts unit, and Ford 
would like to spin off its Visteon parts unit, a move the UAW 
opposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown and Scott Stanton, vice president of Local 624 in  
Syracuse, N.Y., also said the deal includes improvements in retiree 
benefits. Nearly half of the UAW's 407,000 active autoworkers at 
GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler are eligible for retirement within 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``That part of it sounds good,'' said Brown, whose local  
represents 1,350 workers at a DaimlerChrysler foundry. ``The rest 
of it we'll have to wait and see when we go to Detroit next week on 
Monday or Tuesday for an informational meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanton said a ratification vote was scheduled for Sept. 25.  
</P>
<P>
	Workers interviewed leaving DaimlerChrysler's truck plant in  
Warren on Thursday afternoon said they had heard little about the 
agreement because of the secretive nature of the negotiations. Some 
said they were pleased with what they had heard so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing well. We're working a lot of overtime. We're  
building a good product,'' said Matthew Lyons, 46, of Macomb 
County's Macomb Township. ``Chrysler has been good to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the company, the average assembly worker at  
DaimlerChrysler is 43 years old, has 16 years of experience and 
earns about $70,000 a year, thanks to overtime and profit sharing. 
The same worker gets 37 paid vacation days a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders have said that workers were entitled to a share of  
record automaker profits; the three companies combined earned more 
than $5.5 billion in the second quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Wages are an issue at GM, which has sought to mend fences with  
the UAW after last summer's 54-day strike at two Flint parts 
factories. The strike virtually shut down the automaker's North 
American production. 
</P>
<P>
	According to union newsletters, the UAW has asked GM for higher  
wages, and has sought better overtime compensation with more money 
and extra time off. In recent years, automakers have held down 
employment by increasing overtime; the average GM hourly worker 
adds about 9 hours of overtime a week. Union newsletters also said 
GM had proposed a lifetime employment guarantee for workers with 
more than 10 years of experience. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest issue between Ford and the union appears to be  
Ford's plans for Visteon and the unit's 23,500 UAW workers. The UAW 
fears a separate parts company would try to cut jobs and lower 
wages. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Brickner, a retired Michigan State University labor  
professor, said the no-spinoff clause might be aimed at Ford and 
GM, which spun off its Delphi parts unit, rather than 
DaimlerChrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect that's going to weigh heavily in the Ford and GM  
unit talks,'' he said. Brickner said the UAW may tell the companies 
``you have to pay a price for doing something else with you parts 
companies.''

<HEADLINE> Quayle Warns GOP on Policy Shift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Former Vice President Dan Quayle warned  
fellow Republicans today that continuing to drift away from core, 
conservative policies is a ``recipe for defeat'' because it will 
lead to a third-party candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look around. Right here in New Hampshire, a sitting senator,  
Bob Smith, has left the party. Pat Buchanan is on the verge of 
bolting to the Reform Party,'' the presidential hopeful said in a 
breakfast speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a genuine frustration among rank and file  
Republicans, who see little difference between the Republican 
establishment and the Democratic establishment,'' he said. ``They 
see the Republican leadership more concerned with winning than with 
the ideas that make our party great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle said he could unite the diverse factions in the party and  
bring independents and so-called ``Reagan Democrats'' on board by 
emphasizing key issues such as term limits, tax cuts, local control 
of education and a firm foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will be your voice. I will keep the faith. I won't back  
down,'' he told business people and professionals who attended his 
breakfast speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle addressed some of those issues during visits around the  
state Wednesday, the first day of a three-day swing. 
</P>
<P>
	A president can afford to make mistakes at home, but foreign  
policy flubs are unforgivable, Quayle told Dover Rotary Club 
members Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``With health care, the budget or education, you can recover,  
but if in foreign policy you make a mistake, the country can pay 
dearly for a generation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States should stop being ``an international 911  
operator'' and keep American troops out of East Timor, Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a superpower, our role is not peacekeeping,'' he said.  
``Our role is peacemaking... I do not believe that even though we 
are the only superpower, we should be the global policemen of the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration said Wednesday sending troops to East  
Timor could help Indonesia's transition to democracy and protect 
U.S. military and economic interests. But Quayle said the U.S. 
military already is stretched too thin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're spread all over the world, and when there is a serious  
crisis in an important region of the world, we may not be able to 
do the job,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle was unfazed by his poor showing in state polls -- 3  
percent of likely New Hampshire GOP primary voters said they'd vote 
for Quayle in a WMUR-CNN poll released this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle said he has enough money to get through the New Hampshire  
primary and will evaluate his support after that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been behind before,'' he said. ``I just have to take my  
message to the people and let them choose. I think after I do that, 
I'll do exceedingly well.''

<HEADLINE> FedEx Parent Reports Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- FDX Corp., the parent of Federal Express,  
reported disappointing results for its just-ended quarter and 
warned of possible weakness in the current quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The package delivery company earned $159 million, or 52 cents a  
share, during the company's first quarter ended Aug. 31. In the 
same three-month period last year, FDX earned $149 million, or 50 
cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose to $4.3 billion in the latest quarter, improving  
from $4.1 billion a year earlier, while operating income remained 
level at $284 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan B. Graf Jr., the company's chief financial officer, said  
domestic package volume grew 3 percent at FedEx and 4 percent at 
RPG, another FDX subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	Those gains were several percentage points lower than expected,  
Graf said, largely due to a decline in inventory by some of major 
customers. High fuel costs also kept earnings down, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf also said Hurricane Floyd had caused no major physical  
damage to FDX properties, but was expected to result in a loss of 
some $15 million in business due to missed deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, FDX shares  
slid more than 12 percent, falling $5.43 3/4 to $38.25.

<HEADLINE> Master P Invited to Raptors Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Millionaire rapper Master P hasn't given up his  
dream of making the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Master P, born in New Orleans as Percy Miller, was invited to  
training camp Thursday by the Toronto Raptors. He was waived by the 
Charlotte Hornets during camp last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, 29, has parlayed his rap records into a flourishing  
business with his own label, No Limit Records, and a financial 
interest in a sports agent business, No Limit Sports. His company 
represents NFL rookie Ricky Williams, and NBA players Ron Mercer 
and Derek Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very earnest about his dream of making it in the NBA,''  
Raptors general manager Glen Grunwald said. ``We know he was in the 
Hornets camp last year. He's been working hard since then. He knows 
it's a long shot but he's willing to give it a go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An all-state high school player in Louisiana, Miller's  
collegiate career at Houston was brief. 
</P>
<P>
	Before signing with the Hornets, he was with the CBA's Fort  
Wayne Fury. Miller is an acquaintance of Toronto coach Butch 
Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes Magazine lists Miller among the top 10 entertainers in  
terms of annual salary, at $56 million.

<HEADLINE> Cancer-Fighting Protein Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers have found that a protein that  
helps regulate blood clotting can be changed into a cancer fighter 
that starves tumors. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery adds to a growing list of proteins known to block  
cancer by preventing blood vessel formation. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers led by Judah Folkman and Michael S. O'Reilly at  
Boston's Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School found that 
antithrombin, a protein that controls the formation of blood clots, 
changes in molecular shape to become a cancer fighter. The 
transformation occurs when it is cut by an enzyme that, ironically, 
can originate from cancer tumors. 
</P>
<P>
	The reshaped molecule works by blocking formation of blood  
vessels that would supply oxygen and nutrients to cancer cells. The 
action is similar to two other proteins, endostatin and 
angiostatin, that the Folkman-O'Reilly team found last year. Human 
trials of those proteins are to start soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The study of the new protein appears Friday in the journal  
Science. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Reilly said he found the anticancer properties of the reshaped  
antithrombin molecule while studying a curious thing about small 
cell lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	When patients with this cancer are treated with radiation, the  
primary tumor is suppressed, but very often the patient then 
develops cancer at another site, said O'Reilly. The new cancer 
developed only when the first cancer was in retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed that the big tumor was preventing formation of  
little ones,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	To test this, O'Reilly put lung cancer cells under the skin  
above both back hips of laboratory mice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whichever tumor was the first to form became the dominant  
tumor,'' he said. The dominant tumors formed bulging masses, while 
on the opposite hip the cancer growth was tiny, with almost no 
blood vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	This meant, said O'Reilly, that the big tumor was secreting some  
protein that suppressed the other tumor. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers isolated this protein from the mouse tumors and  
found that it was an antithrombin molecule that had been reshaped 
and was able to inhibit angiogenesis, which is the formation of 
blood vessels. They called the protein aaAT. 
</P>
<P>
	Further tests showed that aaAT is a powerful inhibitor of vessel  
formation with an action about like that of angiostatin and 
endostatin, said Folkman. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key finding here is that the body apparently has a  
storehouse of proteins whose only function is to turn off blood 
vessel formation,'' said Folkman. ``This is a surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Folkman said he expects other such proteins to be discovered.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know how many,'' he said. ``We keep finding them.''  
</P>
<P>
	The so-called antiangiogenic proteins work by preventing tumors  
from growing blood vessels that tap the blood circulation system of 
the patient. Without this connection, the tumor cells are starved 
for oxygen and nutrients. In laboratory mouse studies, these 
proteins cause tumors to shrivel and even disappear. 
</P>
<P>
	Human trials of endostatin and angiostatin are to begin this  
fall in Boston and the National Cancer Institute is planning to 
sponsor two clinical trials at other hospitals. These early studies 
are designed only to test the safety of the drugs. In monkey tests, 
the drugs have shown no toxic effects, even when given at high 
doses. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Reilly said it may take several years before aaAT is ready for  
human trials.

<HEADLINE> Panel: Americans Face New Dangers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans are feeling increasingly secure, but  
they shouldn't, says an independent panel set up by the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing dangers ranging from ``mass disruption'' by attacks on  
information systems to ``mass destruction'' from nuclear weapons in 
the hands of terrorists, the U.S. Commission on National 
Security/21st Century paints a frightening picture of the next 
quarter century. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans will become increasingly vulnerable to hostile  
attack on our homeland, and our military superiority will not 
entirely protect us,'' the commission offered Wednesday as its No. 
1 conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	If the nation is drawn into war, it will bring ``casualties and  
carnage, and combat will not be like a video game, even for 
Americans,'' said the commission headed by former Sens. Warren 
Rudman, R-N.H., and Gary Hart, D-Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference releasing the first of three planned  
reports, Rudman cited ``the spreading ability of terrorists to 
strike Americans at home and abroad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart said, ``Nonmilitary threats, such as those concerning the  
global economy, environment and health may become as serious and 
life-threatening to us as traditional military threats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commission members said America needs to restructure forces to  
meet 21st century challenges -- a topic the panel will continue to 
address. It will propose a national strategy next year and offer 
final recommendations to achieve national safety to the next 
president in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14-member panel also includes former House Speaker Newt  
Gingrich, R-Ga.; former U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young, who is set to 
head the National Council of Churches; retired Gen. John R. Galvin 
and other diplomatic, military, academic, media and business 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The last such sweeping reassessment of how to secure the United  
States was made in 1947 at the end of World War II and the same 
basic defense structures remain, Rudman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich said no one on the panel believes the current setup  
makes sense for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we are the most powerful nation in the world, in some  
ways we are becoming more vulnerable,'' Gingrich said.

<HEADLINE> De La Hoya-Trinidad Fight a Monster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Oscar De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad are a  
couple of welterweights doing heavyweight numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	At a time when boxing was supposed to be on the ropes, De La  
Hoya and Trinidad may generate some $80 million in revenue when 
they step into the ring Saturday night in a welterweight title 
fight so intriguing even this city's oddsmakers can't figure out a 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
	From the gambling houses on the Las Vegas Strip to the prisons  
of Puerto Rico, the rare matchup of unbeaten champions is the most 
anticipated non-heavyweight fight since Sugar Ray Leonard met the 
likes of Marvelous Marvin Hagler and Thomas Hearns in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight is so big that the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino didn't  
even bother to sell tickets to the general public. All 11,610 seats 
were quickly taken by hotels offering them to their biggest 
gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This thing is a monster,'' promoter Bob Arum said. ``The  
Hispanic community is at a fever pitch over this, and it's selling 
well everywhere else too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya is a slight 6-5 favorite over ``Tito'' Trinidad, but  
both fighters will come out winners with some of the biggest purses 
ever paid outside a Mike Tyson fight. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya is guaranteed at least $21 million -- even more if the  
pay-per-view sales are as good as expected -- while Trinidad will 
get at least $10.5 million for the scheduled 12-round fight that 
will unify the IBF and WBC versions of the 147-pound title. 
</P>
<P>
	The casinos figure to make even more, with high-rollers flocking  
to town on a Mexican independence day weekend to watch a 
Mexican-American champion facing Puerto Rico's biggest sports hero. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sports crowds in general gamble more money and fight crowds in  
particular are known to gamble even more,'' said Rob Powers, 
spokesman for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. ``In 
addition to that, the media exposure Las Vegas gets is invaluable. 
You can't even calculate it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Promoters are hoping more than 1 million homes spent $49.95 to  
get the pay-per-view telecast of the fight, and demand is so great 
in Las Vegas alone that it will be shown on closed-circuit TV at 
various hotels to another 30,000 people paying $50 a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	In Puerto Rico, which has only 220,000 homes capable of ordering  
pay-per-view, a quarter of them had already bought it by the 
beginning of the week and more than half were expected to watch it 
by fight time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Puerto Rican government said it would foot the bill to have  
the fight on 16 TV sets at the capital building for 8,000 poor 
residents to watch the match. Four prisons are also showing it as a 
reward for good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Local radio stations have dubbed it ``Tito fever'' and the fight  
has become a matter of national pride to the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to celebrate in Puerto Rico Saturday night,''  
Trinidad promised this week. ``It will be the biggest party ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Trinidad is huge in the Puerto Rican market, De La Hoya is  
a proven pay-per-view fighter whose movie-star looks and flashy 
smile draw screaming Mexican-American girls to his appearances. The 
1992 Olympic gold medalist was born and raised in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oscar's fights have primarily attracted the Mexican market,  
but Trinidad brings tremendous buys among people of Puerto Rican 
heritage,'' Arum said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though not matching the 1.9 million pay-per-view buys of the  
second Mike Tyson-Evander Holyfield heavyweight fight, De La Hoya's 
1997 fight with Pernell Whitaker was bought by 800,000 households. 
He has generated $150 million in revenue in seven pay-per-view 
fights, according to TVKO, the HBO arm that does the pay-per-view. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Oscar wins this fight, he'll be the biggest thing in boxing  
in decades,'' said HBO executive Lou DiBella, who helped arrange 
the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	In an era where few champions ever meet each other and the major  
titles are so fragmented that only the most ardent boxing fans know 
who holds titles, the fact two undefeated fighters in their prime 
are fighting makes the bout even more unusual. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad is 35-0 with 30 knockouts, while De La Hoya is 31-0  
with 25 knockouts. Both are 26, and both are big punchers. But both 
also have suspect chins, and have gone down in their careers. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the reason the fight is almost even at sports books,  
where millions of dollars are expected to be bet on both fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting more and more by the hour,'' said Vinny  
Magliulo, who runs the Caesars Palace sports book. ``This fight 
will be one of the highest, if not the highest, bet non-heavyweight 
fights ever.''

<HEADLINE> House Panel To Review Farm Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With lawmakers working on another  
multibillion-dollar bailout of the farm economy, the Republican 
chairman of the House Agriculture Committee says it's time to 
consider changes to the government's GOP-authored farm policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how much more we have to be hit over the head  
with a 2-by-4 until we look at this,'' said Rep. Larry Combest, 
R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Combest announced plans Thursday to hold hearings early next  
year with an eye toward implementing any changes to the 1996 
``Freedom to Farm'' law by next fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have so far resisted rewriting the law, which ended  
a Depression-era system of farm subsidies, but commodity prices 
plummeted last year because of a worldwide glut of grain and are 
expected to remain depressed through 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 law scaled back price-supporting subsidies and ended  
restrictions on what farmers could plant. In return, farmers were 
guaranteed fixed but declining annual payments through 2002, when 
the law will expire. Critics say that doesn't provide enough help 
when commodity prices are low. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress gave farmers $6 billion in additional aid last year and  
is working on a similar package that could exceed the $7.4 billion 
approved by the Senate last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have faulted the Clinton administration, saying it  
hasn't pushed hard enough to open new markets for U.S. crops. Rep. 
George Nethercutt, R-Wash., said he is ``fundamentally supportive'' 
of the 1996 law but added, ``I also think there can be some 
fine-tuning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Combest, who became chairman of the committee this year, only  
reluctantly supported the law in the first place after voting 
against an earlier version in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Combest and the American Farm Bureau Federation, the  
nation's largest farmer organization, say they are interested in a 
proposal by Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, for a new system of 
subsidies that would be tied to crop yields and commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Farm Bureau has strongly supported the 1996 law and remains  
opposed to other changes sought by Democrats and organizations that 
tend to represent small-scale farm operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Combest's announcement came one day after the White House wrote  
to House and Senate appropriators, declaring that the 1996 law is 
failing because of ``fundamental shortcomings'' and urging 
lawmakers to consider finding a new way to subsidize growers. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton signed the measure into law but said then that  
it wouldn't provide a sufficient safety net when commodity prices 
were low. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chairman Combest should be applauded,'' said Tom Buis, a  
lobbyist for the National Farmers Union, which has long opposed the 
law. ``Something isn't working when we're not getting the price 
from the market and we keep having to come back to Congress all the 
time to make ends meet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Agriculture Committee chairman, Richard Lugar,  
R-Ind., wants to leave the law alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, there are people who have always been uncomfortable  
with it ... but a substantial numbers of farmers are in favor of 
the Freedom to Farm program,'' said spokesman Andy Fisher.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Birthright Israel program, funded by private  
donors, Jewish organizations and the government of Israel, is 
offering all college-age Jews free airfare to Israel and a 10-day 
``Israel Experience'' program. 
</P>
<P>
	The trips are set for next January and February. College  
students aged 26 and younger may get information through campus 
Jewish groups or by phoning (888) 99ISRAEL. They also may contact a 
Web site: www.israelexperience.org. 
</P>
<P>
	Birthright Israel plans to extend the offer in 2001 to high  
school students, ages 15 and up, and to set up a $300 million fund 
to perpetuate the program. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of offering a visit to every Jewish youth was announced

 *Lutheran accord denounced    	
</P>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The recent unity pact between the Evangelical  
Lutheran Church in America and the Episcopal and Moravian churches 
has worsened relations with the nation's other major Lutheran 
denomination. 
</P>
<P>
	A.L. Barry, president of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod,  
says the decisions pushed the two Lutheran churches farther apart. 
``An even more serious erosion of a genuine Lutheran identity'' 
will be the inevitable result, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	The Evangelical Lutheran national assembly agreed to share  
clergy, sacraments and mission projects, and to act jointly on 
major church issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry's conservative denomination, which avoids ecumenical  
involvements, has 2.6 million members. The Evangelical Lutherans 
claim 5.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago Barry attacked the Evangelical Lutherans' full  
communion pact with the Presbyterian Church (USA), Reformed Church 
in America and United Church of Christ, saying long-standing 
differences between Lutheran and Reformed churches were not 
adequately addressed. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry has also criticized an agreement on the doctrine of  
salvation by grace, or ``justification,'' between the Lutheran 
World Federation and the Vatican, which is to be formally endorsed 
in Germany on Reformation Day, Oct. 31.

	DENVER (AP) -- The first Roman Catholic seminary United States  
affiliated with a papal university in Rome has opened in Denver 
with 59 students. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. John Vianney Seminary is on the campus occupied until  
1995 by the St. Thomas Seminary. It will train priests from around 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The seminary is named in honor of a 19th century Frenchman who  
is the patron saint of parish priests.

 *Catholic radio network expands    	
</P>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- Catholic Family Radio is awaiting FCC  
approval for the purchase of three radio stations in Maine, plus 
stations in Boston, Springfield, Mass., and Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	The network, which started broadcasting in January, is a  
for-profit business that is not part of the Roman Catholic Church. 
But network chief executive John T. Lynch and other investors 
believe that Catholic views need to be part of religious radio 
programming, which is dominated nationally by Protestants. 
</P>
<P>
	Catholic Family Radio has stations in Milwaukee; Minneapolis;  
Chicago; Philadelphia; Denver; Kansas City, Kan.; Los Angeles and 
San Francisco. It offers an all-talk format and 24-hour 
broadcasting. Lynch said his network prefers ``a stealth manner'' 
to a confrontational, fire-and-brimstone approach.

 *And deliver us from food ...    	
</P>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Some overweight Christians are working on the  
theory that they can slim down by concentrating on their 
relationship with God. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm accountable to a counselor at Jenny Craig or Weight  
Watchers, I can blow them off. But if I'm accountable to God, 
that's an entirely different story,'' Joy Jankowski says. Jankowski 
coordinates the local Weigh Down Workshop at the Redeemer 
Evangelical Free Church in Greenfield. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-week course requires dieters to meet two hours each week.  
At each session, they pray for help getting through tough times 
without bingeing, or ask for the strength to resist favorite 
fattening foods. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan was developed by Gwen Shamblin, a dietitian and former  
faculty member at the University of Memphis. The workshop claims 
30,000 disciples worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	LiLi Ji, a professor of nutritional science and exercise  
physiology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, says religion 
clearly can work as a method of weight loss. But, she adds, diet 
programs that train body and mind not to enjoy food could lead to 
eating disorders.

<HEADLINE> Modified Campaign Finance Bill Eyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Struggling to overcome a threatened  
filibuster, sponsors of campaign finance legislation intend to 
submit a slimmed down bill for Senate debate in hopes they can 
build support as they move toward a final vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure will include a ban on so-called soft money in  
federal elections, and include a provision to curb unions' ability 
to take compulsory dues paid by non-union members and funnel them 
into political activities. 
</P>
<P>
	It will not include restrictions on advertisements that attack  
candidates but escape regulation because they are presented as 
``issue ads'' not covered by existing election law. Nor will it 
include a requirement for disclosure of campaign finance reports on 
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I support a more comprehensive bill and hope a more  
extensive package will eventually past the Senate, I also am a 
realist and know that we must not let the perfect bill be the enemy 
of real reform,'' Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said in announcing a 
change in strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., McCain's partner in the struggle  
for campaign finance legislation, said a ban on soft money was 
``the bare minimum of reform that we can accept this year.'' He 
added that he and McCain want to introduce legislation ``which 
changes the dynamic of the situation,'' a reference to their 
failure to overcome past filibusters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate debate is expected in early October. Republicans have  
filibustered legislation in the past, and have threatened to do so 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved legislation Tuesday night that contains the  
two restrictions that McCain and Feingold will offer, as well as 
others. That bill was passed on a bipartisan vote of 252-177, after 
a daylong debate during which supporters said it was essential to 
reduce the role of money in political campaigns, and critics said 
the bill was a violation of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	In their statement, McCain and Feingold stressed their support  
for a more far-reaching bill than they will introduce. But they 
added they hope the bill would be broadened through amendments on 
the Senate floor, and overall prospects for passage would improve 
as senators succeed in shaping it to their liking. 
</P>
<P>
	Hard money refers to contributions that are limited in size,  
regulated by the federal government, and which corporations, unions 
and certain other groups are banned from making. 
</P>
<P>
	Soft money is unregulated by the federal government, and  
donations are frequently made in six-figure amounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign finance legislation has been stymied in the Senate in  
recent years by Republican filibusters. Last year, supporters of 
curbs on campaign money garnered 51 votes, slightly more than a 
majority but well short of the 60 needed to overcome a filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
	Several congressional sources, who spoke on condition of  
anonymity, said sponsors of the measure expect an amendment to be 
offered in the debate to raise the permissible hard money 
contribution limits for individuals. These have been pegged at 
$1,000 per candidate since campaign finance legislation was passed 
in the post-Watergate era of the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	One official added that the amendment might be offered by Sen.  
Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican who has been a supporter of the 
filibuster in the past, but is viewed by McCain and Feingold as a 
potential convert. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, it was unclear what the impact of the changes  
would have on Senate Democrats, who have been united in supporting 
the measure in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans raise more money than Democrats in hard money  
donations as well as soft money donations. But the disparity in 
hard money is larger, and some Democrats will presumably be 
reluctant to give up soft money at the same time they agree to a 
provision that can help Republicans out-raise them by even greater 
amounts in hard money.

<HEADLINE> House Ends Business Ahead of Floyd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Hurricane Floyd barreled toward the coast  
Wednesday, House leaders called off legislative business for the 
week so representatives could catch flights home before local 
airports might close. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, announced that the House  
would shut its doors after a last flurry of votes ``to give the 
membership the greatest opportunity to get flights back to their 
districts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Members hurried past a dozen or so ornate metal outdoor lounge  
chairs that had been brought inside from the Capitol's many 
balconies to protect them against Floyd's winds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish all my colleagues safe travel home,'' Armey said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Senate and the rest of the Washington-area federal  
government offices were to remain open, according to the Majority 
Leader's office and a tape recording at the Office of Personnel 
Management. 
</P>
<P>
	``All federal employees are expected to report for work on

<HEADLINE>  Explosion Shatters Russian Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- An explosion devastated an apartment building  
today in southern Russia, leaving at least 17 people dead and 115 
others injured in what authorities said was the fourth massive 
terrorist attack in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Explosives hidden in a truck demolished the front of a  
nine-story building in the city of Volgodonsk, close to Russia's 
volatile Caucasus Mountains region, where Russian forces have been 
battling Islamic militants, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest explosion came as speculation mounted in Moscow that  
President Boris Yeltsin's government could face a political crisis 
because of its apparent inability to end the wave of attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Traces of explosives were found in the wreckage, the Federal  
Security Service said. It was the fourth major explosion involving 
a large apartment building in Russia during the past two weeks. All 
of the explosions happened overnight, when residents were sleeping, 
apparently to inflict a maximum number of casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast brought down the front of the building, badly damaged  
a nearby police station and about 20 other surrounding buildings, 
Interior Ministry officials said. The explosion left a four-yard 
crater in front of the apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 17 people were killed and 115 others were wounded,  
about 50 of them in serious condition, officials said. Volgodonsk 
has a population of about 250,000 people and is 500 miles south of 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters fought a blaze that engulfed several floors of the  
building, and rescue workers and volunteers pulled away piles of 
rubble, hunting for survivors, officials said. The building is in a 
drab residential area of rows of similar apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin discussed the latest explosion at a meeting today with  
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the strength and resources to wipe out terrorism,''  
Yeltsin said, according to the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin's fitness to govern Russia is again under question with  
the spate of recent bombings and the unresolved conflict in 
Dagestan in southern Russia, where Islamic rebels are battling 
Russian government forces. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has insisted he will not declare a state of  
emergency, and that he will serve out the remainder of his term, 
which expires in the middle of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Moscow is buzzing with rumors of possible political  
changes. There is daily speculation about the government declaring 
a state of emergency, which would allow Yeltsin to rule by decree. 
There is also talk that Yeltsin may dismiss Putin, who assumed 
office just last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the rumors are contradictory. Some say Yeltsin plans to  
extend his term by postponing or canceling parliamentary elections 
in December and the presidential poll set for next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	But other rumors say Yeltsin might suddenly resign in coming  
days, install Putin as interim president, and announce presidential 
elections within three months in the expectation that Putin would 
win. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kremlin has denied each and every one of these rumors, but  
it hasn't stopped the speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's blast targeted a building that contained 100 apartments  
in the small city Volgodonsk, 600 miles south of Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian authorities suspect Islamic militants from southern  
Russia are responsible for three earlier explosions, which killed 
at least 275 people, including two blasts in Moscow. A car bomb 
destroyed a military housing complex Sept. 4 in Dagestan, killing 
64 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have not produced evidence linking the blasts to any  
particular group. 
</P>
<P>
	The militants, who are fighting for a separate Islamic state,  
had threatened to strike targets in Russia. But they have denied 
any involvement in the recent explosions. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a national anti-terrorism operation, codenamed  
Whirlwind, authorities discovered on Wednesday a weapons cache 
containing 150 dynamite charges, 17 grenades and other explosives 
in Russia's Far East, Federal Security Service officials said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Local residents led the authorities to the wooded area where the  
explosives were hidden about 30 miles from port city of 
Vladivostok, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were investigating who stockpiled the weapons.  
</P>
<P>
	The latest explosion came after massive security sweeps in  
Moscow and other major Russian cities. Police have been searching 
for explosives in apartment buildings throughout the Russian 
capital and rounding up suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin said Wednesday that the people who carried out the attacks  
in Moscow were hiding in the breakaway republic of Chechnya, adding 
that Russia would ask the Chechen government to ``hand over the 
criminals.''

<HEADLINE> AMH, Plaintiff Settle Fen-phen Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANTON, Texas (AP) -- A Texas woman who won a jury verdict of  
$23.3 million for heart damage she suffered after taking the diet 
drug combination fen-phen settled with the pharmaceutical maker 
Thursday for a small fraction of that amount. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the settlement came on the same day as reports that the  
company -- American Home Products Corp. -- is close to settling most 
of the thousands of diet pill lawsuits filed against it for at 
least $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home's beleaguered shares rose $3.31 1/4, or 8 percent, to  
$46.56 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home made fenfluramine, the ``fen'' in the fen-phen  
combination and gave the drug a brand name of Pondimin. It also 
made Pondimin's chemical cousin Redux. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Texas case, Debbie Lovett, 36, of Grand Saline, blamed  
American Home and subsidiary Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories for damage 
she suffered after taking fen-phenfor more than three months 
starting in October 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lovett's attorney Kip Petroff would not disclose the amount  
of the settlement, but said the deal was reached after considering 
state law that caps monetary awards in civil suits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The amount of the settlement was significantly less than the  
amount of the verdict, but the amount of the settlement is more 
than 90 percent of what we thought would be awarded after all of 
the evidence was considered and after the statutory cap on punitive 
damages was applied as required by law,'' Petroff said. 
</P>
<P>
	AHP spokesman Doug Petkus went a bit further in discussing the  
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the amount is confidential, American Home Products can  
confirm it totaled less than 10 percent of the amount returned by 
the jury,'' Petkus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of fen-phen cases have been filed across the nation,  
but Ms. Lovett's lawsuit was the first to reach a jury. Jurors last 
month found the company was fully liable for Ms. Lovett's ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products marketed Pondimin and Redux until  
September 1997. That was when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
pushed for their withdrawal after a Mayo Clinic study linked the 
drugs to potentially fatal heart valve damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Fenfluramine had been sold since the 1970s but became widely  
used in the 1990s when doctors prescribed it in combination with 
another drug, phentermine. When taken alone, phentermine never was 
associated with health problems. It remains on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the larger settlement, two newspapers reported Friday  
that final details were being worked out and the deal could be 
announced as early as Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Star-Ledger of Newark said the settlement could exceed $5  
billion, and would resolve more than 4,100 lawsuits brought by 
8,000 people. The Wall Street Journal said the settlement would be 
about $3 billion. Both reports cited anonymous sources. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home officials refused to comment on the possibility of  
a wide-ranging settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Star-Ledger reported that the company's offer includes  
payments to patients harmed by the diet drugs, along with follow-up 
medical examinations for millions of other users. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal said those who feel the agreement is inadequate  
could opt out and pursue cases on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	The Star-Ledger said unresolved issues on Wednesday included the  
structure of the payout and the terms of a side deal with 
plaintiffs in New Jersey, where a civil trial is under way over 
whether the Madison N.J.-based drug maker should be liable for the 
cost of future medical checkups. 
</P>
<P>
	The pending settlement would cover individual lawsuits and  
class-action suits certified in eight states, the newspaper said. 
It would need a federal judge's approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Journal reported that the FBI is probing whether  
the American Home revealed all it knew about dangers of Redux prior 
to its approval by the government in 1996. The company denied 
knowing about any such inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home's stock has languished in recent months largely  
due to uncertainty about how much it will have to pay to resolve 
the diet drug lawsuits.

<HEADLINE> Defensive End Ends Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Defensive end Darren Mickell ended his  
19-month retirement and signed a one-year, $400,000 contract with 
the New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickell said personal and family problems are behind him and he  
has regained the ``hunger'' to play again. 
</P>
<P>
	Club officials are seeking a two-week roster exemption for  
Mickell, who retired on Feb. 23, 1998. If the NFL agrees, Mickell 
will not count against the 53-player roster for two weeks. He is 
expected to begin practicing immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	The earliest Mickell would play is against the Chicago Bears on  
Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see what happens,'' Ditka said. ``We'll find out if he  
can do anything over the next few weeks, and if he can, we'll bring 
him on board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mickell, who is 29, said he hoped to be in shape to play in a  
couple of weeks. He has been working out with a private trainer in 
recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickell has played in the NFL for seven seasons. He started 25  
games in two seasons with the Saints. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his decision to come out of retirement was due partly to  
the loss of veteran defensive end Joe Johnson, who suffered a 
season-ending knee injury on Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been thinking about it all summer,'' Mickell said. ``I'd  
been working out over the summer, then the injury to Joe made me 
want to come back even more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mickell was suspended for four games during the 1996 season in  
New Orleans for violating the league's substance abuse policy.

<HEADLINE> Vols Wary of Florida Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Western Michigan riddled Florida's  
defense. Central Florida also had its way with the Gators. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's not the Florida defense that Tennessee quarterback  
Tee Martin expects to see Saturday night when the No. 2 Volunteers 
and No. 4 Gators meet in Gainesville. 
</P>
<P>
	``Against us, they're always faster, they're always bigger and  
they always go to the right places,'' Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Theories vary as to how the Gators, with 10 new defensive  
starters, managed to yield 865 yards to Western Michigan and 
Central Florida. Practically all of it, 784 yards, was in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have given up a bunch of passing yards,'' Florida coach  
Steve Spurrier said. ``Maybe it was due to the nature of the games 
we've had (29- and 31-point victories). Maybe we're just not very 
good covering passes right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Western Michigan threw for 405 yards, 314 of it in the first  
half of what was at the time a competitive game. By the second 
game, the young Gators defense was tighter; even though Central 
Florida threw for 379 yards, almost all of it came after Florida 
was comfortably ahead and playing substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't seen a team just drive, drive, drive against that  
defense, but they did give up big plays,'' Martin said. ``But you 
can forget about all the games they've played. It's going to be a 
different Florida defense out there Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee also knows Florida didn't pull out all the stops  
against two lesser opponents, a factor even Gators defensive 
coordinator Jon Hoke admits. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be more things in the game plan'' this weekend, he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Much is made of all the new Florida starters, but there is still  
a good deal of experience on the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the starters are sophomores. All of them played last  
year as freshmen, which says a lot about their abilities. 
</P>
<P>
	In the defensive line, Derrick Chambers, Buck Gurley, Gerard  
Warren and Alex Brown had eight starts among them going into the 
season, and all had played at least 396 snaps in college. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren will see his first action this year after sitting out a  
two-game suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	The new linebackers replace a trio of players who are all in the  
NFL now. Keith Kelsey, a senior, logged 753 plays going into the 
season; sophomore Andra Davis had played 301. The other linebacker, 
Eugene McCaslin, is an experienced player, but only on offense. He 
was switched from tailback in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	In the defensive backfield, all four starters started at least  
one game before this season. They had been in for an average of 461 
plays each before this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're awfully good,'' Tennessee offensive coordinator Randy  
Sanders said. ``You hear about them losing 10 starters, but they've 
got 14, 15 or 16 guys who have played against us. It's not like 
they're devoid of talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In last year's 20-17 overtime victory over the Gators, Tennessee  
played things close to the vest offensively. The Vols gained 235 
yards on 54 plays, the second lowest number of plays all season. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, making the second start of his career, was 7-of-20 for  
64 yards passing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watched that game five or six times this week,'' he said.  
``There was so much of me that was missing. I feel bad about that 
game, but we won, so I feel good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At that point in his career, Tennessee was not asking Martin to  
do much because of his inexperience. More of the burden will be on 
his shoulders Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going into this game last season I had confidence, but only in  
what I was doing at the time,'' Martin said, estimating he ran 
about 25 percent as much of the offense then as he does now. ``I'm 
a much smarter quarterback with more experience now. The offense is 
better now because of my progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers bear him out. Martin has thrown for at least 200  
yards in his last four games. Over the last 10 games, he has 
completed 63 percent of his passes, with 14 touchdowns and four 
interceptions.

<HEADLINE> Texas Shooting Victims Mourned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Hours after a gunman opened fire in the  
sanctuary of Wedgwood Baptist Church, pastor Al Meredith was in the 
morgue standing over the body of one of his congregants. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities had asked Meredith to identify Susan ``Kim'' Jones,  
but the pastor said he found it difficult to recognize the 
23-year-old woman he remembered as a warm, exuberant seminary 
student. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't be sure it was her because she wasn't smiling,''  
Meredith said. ``She just beamed. There are people who walk into a 
room and it lights up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones was one of seven people killed by Larry Gene Ashbrook,  
47, who entered a church service for teen-agers Wednesday evening 
and opened fire before turning the gun on himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Also killed were choir director Sydney Browning, 36; seminary  
student Shawn Brown, 23; Justin M. Ray, 17; and Kristi Beckel, 
Joseph D. Ennis and Cassandra Griffin, all 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven others were wounded, and three were in serious condition  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people were Sunday school teachers and one of the  
favored soloists in the church, the children's choir director, 
kids, youth members, some active, some just getting active, some 
just beginning to find God,'' Meredith said. 
</P>
<P>
	The grief was particularly pronounced at Southwestern Baptist  
Theological Seminary and Brewer High School, both of which had 
students caught in the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ennis was a freshman at Brewer, where he played on the  
basketball team. Justin Laird, a sophomore junior varsity football 
player who was celebrating his 16th birthday Wednesday, was shot in 
the back. He was in serious condition Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer athletic director Ben Davis praised both Ennis and Laird  
as hard workers and ``fine young men.'' He said students and 
teachers were struggling to come to terms with the loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two of the safest environments you think you can put your  
child in are the school and the church,'' Davis said. ``You think 
you don't have to worry about their safety. When that's violated, 
it's really upsetting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Browning was a 1991 graduate of the seminary, while Ms.  
Jones and Brown were both students. 
</P>
<P>
	Meredith praised Ms. Browning's tireless efforts in social work  
programs, saying ``she defined commitment.'' In addition to serving 
as the children's choir director, Ms. Browning was an honored 
teacher in the Fort Worth Independent School District. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a very warm and talented individual and a gifted  
singer,'' said Derick Wilson, a seminary student. ``She's going to 
be sadly missed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones and Brown both enjoyed working with youths, and they  
hoped to continue that work after they left the seminary, Meredith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones graduated from Texas Christian University last year,  
and had recently become the leader of a Bible study class for 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown taught Sunday school classes at Wedgwood with his wife,  
Kathy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shawn was on fire for God,'' said Connie Yeagley, another  
seminary student. ``He was the type of person that when you were 
around him, you walked away with a smile.''

attorney's office, said Wednesday the decision was made because 
evidence did not show Rodman was so drunk that he could not care 
for his own safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the standard we must prove in court before a jury,''  
Richards said. ``We reached this conclusion after talking with 
police and reviewing statements from five witnesses who were at the 
bar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waived by the Los Angeles Lakers last April after a stormy seven  
weeks with the team, the 38-year-old Rodman was released on his own 
recognizance after spending several hours in jail following his 
arrest outside the restaurant Aug. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they made the right call,'' Rodman's attorney, Paul S.  
Meyer, said from his office in Costa Mesa. ``The potential criminal 
charges evaporated in the light of all the facts. 
</P>
<P>
	Police originally recommended Rodman be charged because he was  
offered a chance to leave the restaurant and didn't, according to 
Sgt. Mike McDermott. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman was a member of two championship teams with the Detroit  
Pistons and three more with the Chicago Bulls. He is not under 
contract for the 1999-2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Also arrested at the time of the disturbance was Donn Emerson,  
36, who was charged Wednesday with obstructing a police officer and 
possession of marijuana, both misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The marijuana was discovered when he was booked. There were  
11.5 grams in his pocket,'' Richards said. ``Apparently, Mr. 
Emerson was not letting police officers conduct their interviews, 
and he was getting in the way. Police repeatedly asked him to step 
back, and he refused to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Emerson faces a maximum of one year in jail and a  
$100 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Restaurant owner Ralph Furra, whose wife, Julie, was managing  
the bar at the time, said a woman apparently was taunting Rodman. 
He responded, and then the woman's boyfriend grabbed Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were called and asked Rodman to take a taxi home, but he  
refused.

<HEADLINE> Holtz in First Home Game at S.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Let the hullaba-Lou begin.  
</P>
<P>
	With Hurricane Floyd safely gone, South Carolina can revel in  
Lou Holtz's first game coaching the Gamecocks on Saturday at 
Williams-Brice Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	A sellout crowd of more than 82,000 will be on hand when Holtz  
runs out before the home folks for the first time since taking the 
head coaching job in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's an excitement here that there hasn't always been  
before,'' athletic director Mike McGee said. 
</P>
<P>
	The festivities start Friday afternoon with ``Lunch with Lou,''  
an event the coach brought with him from Notre Dame. More than 
1,000 people are expected at Seawell's restaurant near the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The main event should occur slightly before 7 p.m. Saturday when  
the skinny coach jogs out to the sidelines to the team's 
traditional opening, ``2001: A Space Odyssey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to seeing our fans and being in the  
stadium, I heard so much about it,'' Holtz said. ``But no, I'm not 
anxious to play East Carolina.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People are anxious to hear Holtz. At Notre Dame, the lunchtime  
gathering grew from 300 people to sometimes more than 3,500 during 
Holtz's 11 seasons, school athletic spokesman John Heisler said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was moved from a conference room to Notre Dame's hockey dome.  
And despite an assistant coach, a Fighting Irish star or two and 
maybe a special football guest, the main attraction was Holtz, 
Heisler said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see what a speaker he is,'' Heisler said. ``For whatever  
reason, the event became part of the home football tradition. It 
was something you wanted to go to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz usually gives a football rundown, but invariably talks of  
goal-setting and achieving much more than you thought, Heisler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Notre Dame, Holtz closed by answering some audience  
questions. ``That was usually a fun part,'' Heisler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robb McBurney, a South Carolina season-ticket holder, has  
dreamed of Holtz walking the sidelines. ``In a lot of ways for us, 
this is when the season really starts,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the coach applauds a player, it's what the crowd is  
feeling; when he grabs a face mask and chews out a lineman three 
times his size, ``it is probably what the fans wish they could do, 
too,'' McBurney said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gamecocks lost their first two games at North Carolina State  
and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	When Holtz closed his weekly TV show, he talked of persevering  
through the tough times. Then he turned to the cameras and said, 
``I hope to see you all at the stadium Saturday night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was ready to go right then,'' McBurney said.

<HEADLINE> Penn State's Arrington Stirs Hubbub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -- Linebackers, start your engines.  
</P>
<P>
	With five Butkus Award candidates on the same field, Saturday's  
showdown between No. 3 Penn State and eighth-ranked Miami already 
figured to be a linebacker showcase. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, a few choice words by Penn State's LaVar Arrington has  
stirred some animosity into the matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every team has one guy that runs his mouth,'' Hurricanes  
defensive tackle Damione Lewis said Thursday. ``He just made two 
linebackers step up their games even more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's likely no game this season will feature such an array of  
talented linebackers, five of the 65 players on the Butkus 
committee's preseason list of candidates to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State was the only school to have all three of its starters  
make the list -- Arrington, Brandon Short and Mac Morrison. Miami's 
Nate Webster and Dan Morgan also are candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrington, featured repeatedly on TV and in publications before  
the season, apparently doesn't keep tabs on the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked Wednesday to respond to Morgan's assessment that Miami had  
the better group, Arrington said, ``Who's Dan Morgan?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long pause. ``No, I'm serious,'' Arrington said.  
</P>
<P>
	After somebody finally told him that Morgan is Miami's starting  
weakside linebacker, Arrington replied: ``Huh. Hey, you've got to 
feel that way. If he didn't feel that way, there'd be something 
wrong with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's possible Arrington truly may have been oblivious.  
Nevertheless, the quote wound up on Miami's bulletin board bright 
and early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's feeding Dan's fire,'' Webster said. ``Dan's not going to  
dwell on it, but it's going to be in the back of his mind. I think 
Dan has something in store for them Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Morgan spent much of Thursday trying to downplay  
the hubbub. Asked if he might take a moment Saturday to introduce 
himself to Arrington, the junior chuckled. 
</P>
<P>
	``All that stuff is funny to me,'' said Morgan, who has led the  
Hurricanes in tackles in each of his first two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	But for a brief minute after the TV cameras turned off, Morgan  
took on a more serious tone. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can talk all the trash you want,'' Morgan added. ``I'm  
going to show who Dan Morgan is on Saturday. If they don't know who 
Dan Morgan is, they'll find out Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a tough week for Arrington, who also has been roundly  
criticized for his two-penalty-flag takedown of Pitt punter Greg 
DeBolt last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has to understand that he is in the limelight,'' Penn State  
coach Joe Paterno said. ``He has to be able to have a little 
tighter control over himself than somebody else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arrington, at 6-foot-3 and 242 pounds, has an NFL body and a  
knack for the big play. He was the Big Ten's defensive player of 
the year as a sophomore last season, sparked by plays such as 
stealing a handoff from Ohio State quarterback Mark Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was Short who led the Nittany Lions last year with 67  
tackles, and he tops the team again in 1999 with 18 through three 
games. Morrison was fourth last season with 47. 
</P>
<P>
	For Miami, Morgan collected 150 tackles last year and Webster  
had 134 in 10 games, ranking them 1-2 in the Big East in tackles 
per game. Michael Smith, the only starter not on the Butkus list, 
added 69 tackles, more than any Penn State linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know which one would be your better unit,'' Paterno  
said. ``I think Miami's kids have played great football. All three 
of them run really well. In that sense, they are very much like our 
guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arrington, in fact, could have been playing alongside Morgan and  
Webster if not for a last-minute change of heart. He says he was 
set to commit to Miami until linebacker Marlin Barnes was fatally 
shot in a lover's triangle and coach Dennis Erickson left for the 
NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``Penn State ended up being the better pick for me,'' he now  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	He figures to be a target for some angry Hurricanes.  
</P>
<P>
	``For him to be talking before the game, that's awful brave of  
him,'' Webster said. ``I guess everything will be shown Saturday.''

<HEADLINE> Reno Laments Hate Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lamenting the latest mass shooting in the  
United States, Attorney General Janet Reno said today Americans 
must look hard at the issue of ``how we handle guns, of how we deal 
with mental illness, of how we deal with hate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno, discussing the killing rampage Wednesday night at a  
Baptist church in Fort Worth, Texas, said, ``The thought of gunfire 
in a place of worship should be inconceivable. But for families, 
for others last night, the inconceivable became a reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She made the remarks at her weekly news conference.  
</P>
<P>
	Discussing recent shooting episodes, including the Atlanta  
massacre and a spate of school shootings, the attorney general said 
FBI agents are on the scene in Fort Worth. ``We are prepared to 
assist in any way that we can,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A gunman identified by police as Larry Gene Ashbrook of Fort  
Worth burst into a church service and opened fire. Seven people 
were fatally shot, and the gunman killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1999 alone,'' Reno said, ``we have watched as innocent  
people were gunned down while attending school, while walking home 
from a church or synagogue, while playing at a summer camp, while 
working in their offices, while delivering mail and now while 
worshiping in their church.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This morning, we have ... many more questions than answers,''  
she added. ``We will search for those answers and try, as another 
community mourns its dead, to find a way to end this type of 
senseless and destructive violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is going to require the commitment of all Americans to look  
at the issue of how we handle guns, of how we deal with mental 
illness, of how we deal with hate,'' she said. ``We don't know what 
the situation is here, but all of these events cry out for America 
to come together and to address them in an effective, permanent 
manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She renewed her call for legislation the Clinton administration  
has been seeking in Congress to place tighter curbs on handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope that people would look, not just at what handguns  
have done to America this year, not in the context of this case, 
but what handguns have done to America over the last many years,'' 
Reno said, ``and that this nation would listen to its people who 
again and again cry out for ... asking government to make sure that 
we take reasonable steps to ensure that guns are not placed in the 
hands of people who are not lawfully entitled to have them.''

<HEADLINE>  Major Bombing Attacks in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The blast that tore apart a Moscow apartment building today was  
the latest in a series of deadly explosions in Russia, and 
authorities said they were treating it as a terrorist attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Here is a list of the worst explosions in the past few years:  
</P>
<P>
	-- May 22, 1996: Nineteen people, including eight children, are  
killed in a blast at an apartment building near St. Petersburg. 
Authorities blame explosives kept in one of the apartments. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Nov. 16, 1996: A bomb rips through a building housing Russian  
military officers and their families, killing 64 people, in 
Kaspiisk in the restive southern region of Dagestan. 
</P>
<P>
	-- March 19, 1999: A bomb explodes at an outdoor food market in  
the southern city of Vladikavkaz, killing more than 50 people. 
</P>
<P>
	-- April 26, 1999: An explosive device, believed to have been  
planted in an elevator, injures 11 people at Moscow's Intourist 
Hotel, near the Kremlin. The building also houses several business 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Aug. 31, 1999: A bomb at an upscale shopping mall just outside  
the Kremlin injures 40 people; one woman dies several days later 
from burns. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Sept. 4, 1999: A car bomb outside an apartment building  
housing the families of military officers kills 64 in Buinaksk in 
Dagestan. Islamic militants are blamed for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Sept. 9, 1999: An explosion tears apart a nine-story apartment  
building in southeast Moscow. At least 93 people are killed. 
Authorities say they suspect a terrorist attack. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Sept. 13, 1999: A suspected bomb destroys an apartment  
building in southern Moscow, leaving dozens dead or missing in the 
rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Sept. 16, 1999: A bomb shears off the front of a nine-story  
apartment building in the city of Volgodonsk, about 500 miles south 
of Moscow. At least 17 people were killed and 184 others were 
wounded.

<HEADLINE> NFL: 3 Giants-Bucs Calls Missed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The NFL reviewed three critical plays from  
last Sunday's game between the New York Giants and Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers and found officials made the wrong call in each 
instance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucs were told a Trent Dilfer fumble returned for a  
first-quarter touchdown should have been ruled an incomplete pass. 
Replays showed the quarterback's arm was moving forward when he was 
sacked by New York's Jessie Armstead. 
</P>
<P>
	A second Dilfer turnover, a fourth-quarter interception that  
prompted his benching, also should have been disallowed because 
Dilfer stepped out of bounds before releasing the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Referee Ed Hoculi made what the Bucs believe was the biggest  
error when he reversed a fourth-quarter pass reception after 
reviewing the play under the league's new instant replay rule. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-yard catch by Karl Williams, on Tampa Bay's final  
possession, would have given the Bucs -- trailing 17-13 -- a first 
down at the Giants' 49. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead the ball was moved back to the Tampa Bay 23. Three plays  
later, the Bucs were stopped on downs at their 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all the technology we've got, if he can't make the right  
call, how can he be in charge of a crew?'' Dungy said he asked 
league officials. ``Their response was everybody makes mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucs didn't challenge Christian Peter's 38-yard fumble  
return that gave the Giants a 7-0 lead because assistant coaches in 
the press box didn't see replays in time to determine whether to 
dispute the ruling on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoculi reversed Williams' reception after the league's replay  
assistant called for a review. 
</P>
<P>
	Dungy is not a fan of the new instant replay rule, which allows  
coaches to challenge one call per half. Replay assistants determine 
which plays will be reviewed in the final two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There aren't many people in the league office or with us who  
really understand it, or know what we're trying to do. It's not a 
good situation right now, in my opinion,'' the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you just have to challenge anything that you think is  
close. Don't worry about the timeouts because you don't know what 
they're to overturn and what they're not.''

<HEADLINE> Steelers' Bettis Ready for Ravens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- After making paste of the Cleveland Browns in  
little more than a half of work, Steelers running back Jerome 
Bettis said he is ready to carry a full load. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettis practiced all this week for the first time since he was  
sidelined with a knee injury two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettis was limited to just a few practice days last week and  
played less than three quarters in the 43-0 win over Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first test of Bettis' left knee since surgery to  
remove scar tissue six weeks ago. Apparently there are no lingering 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettis ran for 89 yards on 18 carries against the Browns and  
expects more carries against the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say what will happen, because I haven't done it yet,''  
Bettis said. ``I'm not in the same condition all the other guys are 
in, because they didn't miss training camp. But I'm getting closer 
every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``So, in terms of the running game, it's really similar,'' he  
said. ``The one difference is for running backs. It's probably the 
most natural position on the field, but a receiver's routes have to 
be precise. And you can't be coached to run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hardest parts of the job are positioning oneself to pick up  
blitzes and running the right pass routes. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's more of a mental thing, and I tried to stay involved  
with the offense that way during camp,'' Bettis said. ``So, I'm as 
ready as I can be this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bettis' blocker, fourth-year fullback Jon Witman, also said  
Bettis is ready to go into high gear. While Bettis criticized 
Witman before this season, they worked together well against 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Witman said they could get better with each game.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to be able to establish our up-the-middle runs,''  
Witman said. ``If we don't, it could be a long day for us. We don't 
want to depend solely on the pass, because they have a good 
defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He praised Baltimore's defensive line and linebackers  
</P>
<P>
	``Their whole defense is fast,'' Witman said. ``I think they're  
underrated overall. ... They're one of the speediest teams we'll 
play this year, and it's just a matter of how good or bad that 
they'll execute. So, it'll be tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers may be without starting left guard Alan Faneca, who  
has a sore ankle and has not practiced much this week. He is listed 
as questionable against Baltimore and would be replaced by veteran 
Roger Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettis will prepare to play four quarters.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just trying to get myself installed into the lineup,''  
Bettis said. ``But it really doesn't matter, because I'm still 
working hard to get in better shape and get ready for the Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be another exciting crowd and a tough place to  
play in. But we just have to suck it up and try to go out to get 
another one this week. They played us really tough last year, in 
both games, and we don't expect anything less this season.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley Supports Gays in Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gays should be protected by the landmark 1964  
Civil Rights Act and allowed to serve openly in the military, Bill 
Bradley said in a magazine interview released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the question of a California anti-gay-marriage ballot  
initiative, Bradley also aligned himself more closely -- and more 
readily -- with the gay community's legislative agenda than Vice 
President Al Gore. Both Democratic presidential candidates are 
dueling for the influential gay and lesbian vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I was a voter in California, I would not support the Knight  
initiative,'' Bradley told The Advocate, a gay and lesbian 
newsmagazine, in a published interview due on newsstands Sept. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's divisive and ... I don't think a referendum is  
the place for this kind of an initiative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former New Jersey senator said he still opposes same-sex  
marriage because of ``the religious nature of marriage and respect 
for the diversity of views on that subject.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate interview published last month, Gore told The  
Advocate he needed to ``educate myself'' on the so-called Knight 
measure on California's March 2000 ballot, which would define 
marriage as between a man and woman only. His campaign press 
secretary, Kikki Moore, said late Thursday Gore has decided to 
oppose Knight. ``Consider him educated,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Bradley and Gore support legal protections for ``domestic  
partners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Going further than Gore's push for a pending  
anti-job-discrimination bill, Bradley said he would add sexual 
orientation to the 1964 act broadly outlawing racial, religious and 
sex discrimination in employment, housing, lending and public 
accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would clearly indicate that discrimination against gays  
is in the same category as discrimination against other protected 
groups,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such an expansion was first championed by New York liberal Rep.  
Bella Abzug in 1973. But in 1993, the gay community considered 
public-opinion polls, pared down its goals and has since pursued 
the more widely politically palatable Employment Non-Discrimination 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is focusing on ENDA as ``the most practical way to move  
forward on an agenda of non-discrimination'' because it ``can 
actually pass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said homosexuals should be allowed to serve openly in  
the U.S. Armed Forces, but admitted that he has not determined 
``the timing and method'' of such a change to military policy. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, before President Clinton signed into law the ``don't  
ask, don't tell'' policy allowing gays to serve as long as their 
sexuality remained a secret, Bradley voted for a Senate amendment 
to lift outright the military's ban on gays. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, in this campaign season, has said only that ``don't ask,  
don't tell'' should be implemented with ``more compassion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's position ``clearly represents a different, more  
positive thinking than the vice president's,'' said David Smith, 
spokesman for Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay 
right's group. 
</P>
<P>
	On the full menu of gay issues, Bradley and Gore have virtually  
identical records, but Gore has trumped Bradley in ``energy and 
commitment,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senator Bradley comes off as ambivalent at best. But these  
statements in this article certainly send the right message and I'm 
sure it will cause several potential voters to perhaps look more 
closely at his candidacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996 exit polls, self-identified gay voters accounted for 5  
percent of the total voting public, and 7 percent of Clinton's 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley campaign spokesman Eric Hauser said Bradley gave the  
interview because the magazine requested it and not to court gay 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``He spoke from his heart,'' Hauser said.  
</P>
<P>
	Telling the magazine that he has gay friends but no gay family,  
Bradley said homosexuality ``happens to be an attribute about as 
meaningful as having blond hair.''

<HEADLINE> 200 Americans Going To East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton gave the go-ahead Thursday  
for limited U.S. participation in an Australian-led peacekeeping 
force for East Timor. He said about 200 U.S. troops will be 
involved, but the Pentagon said the total could increase if 
Australia asks for more help. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have decided to contribute to the force in a limited but  
essential way, including communications and logistical aid, 
intelligence, airlifts of personnel and material and coordination 
of the humanitarian response to the tragedy,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at the White House, Clinton said half the U.S.  
personnel will be on the ground in East Timor. The rest will be in 
Darwin on Australia's north coast, which is to serve as the main 
support base for the 7,500-strong peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	The American forces will play a support role, unlike in other  
international peacekeeping operations such as Kosovo and Bosnia 
where American soldiers are on the ground to patrol the peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``This mission is in America's interest for several reasons,''  
Clinton said. ``Indonesia's future is important to us not only 
because of its resources and its sea lanes, but for its potential 
as a leader in the region, and the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president also cautioned that ``on any mission like this  
there are dangers and risks of casualties. There remains a great 
deal of work ahead. But this force is well-equipped for the job and 
it is a job that is in the interest of peace and stability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Pentagon, Navy Vice Adm. Scott Fry told reporters the  
administration would consider requests by Australia for additional 
U.S. contributions. ``The door has got to stay open,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're comfortable with the contribution we've made so far,''  
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said. ``We're comfortable with our 
offer to consider additional requests. And without ruling anything 
in or out, we'll just have to wait and see what requests, if any, 
come forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, no U.S. aircraft will fly into East Timor, but U.S.  
planes such as Air Force C-17, C-130 and C-5 transports will ferry 
other nations' heavy equipment into Darwin, Fry said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is possible that later on, U.S. planes will fly into the  
provincial capital of Dili or the Baucau airport east of Dili, in 
which case 30 to 40 American troops who specialize in remote 
airport operations may go in to organize refueling operations and 
air traffic control, Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The American contingent will be commanded by Marine Corps Brig.  
Gen. John Castellaw, deputy commander of the 3rd Marine 
Expeditionary Force in Okinawa, Japan. He has been involved in 
other humanitarian military operations, including Operation Provide 
Comfort in northern Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen signed an order Thursday for the  
U.S. forces to be ready to move within 48 hours, although it will 
be longer than that before they go to Darwin, the admiral said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fry said the 200 Americans will be drawn from a variety of U.S.  
military installations in Asia and the Pacific, including Japan, 
Hawaii and Guam, although details on specific units are not yet 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia and Malaysia are expected to provide the backbone of  
the force, about 7,500 strong. Also contributing will be France, 
Canada, Portugal, Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand and New 
Zealand.

<HEADLINE> Rodham Brothers Asked To Scrap Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House has urged President Clinton's  
brothers-in-law to abandon a business deal in the former Soviet 
republic of Georgia, after an opponent of Georgian President Eduard 
Shevardnadze tried to use that deal for his own political 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, told Hugh and  
Tony Rodham earlier this month that their efforts to establish 
walnut and tea processing businesses in western Georgia were 
``being misrepresented as somehow reflecting a change in U.S. 
policy,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Berger ... suggested that, all things considered, that  
they should withdraw from this,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers at first rejected the request, saying in a  
statement they had no reason to believe they are their associates 
were involved ``in any illegal activities.'' But their lawyer, 
James Hamilton, later told The Washington Post they had decided to 
withdraw from the venture because they did not want ``to do any 
harm to the first lady or the administration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rodhams, brothers of first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton,  
spent eight days in Georgia in late August, looking into 
investments in Batumi, capital of the Ajaria region. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ajaria area's local political boss, Aslan Abashidze, issued  
a statement a few days after the visit suggesting that the Rodhams' 
presence in the region represented ``political support rendered to 
him by U.S. President Bill Clinton,'' the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shevardnadze's government informed the Clinton administration  
about the visit only a few days beforehand. Once in Georgia, the 
Rodhams visited Shevardnadze in the nation's capital, Tbilisi, 
before heading to Batumi. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, declined to comment,  
deferring to Lockhart's remarks.

<HEADLINE> Oil Futures Soar to 31-Month High  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Even a storm-abbreviated trading day couldn't interrupt crude  
oil's months-long rise in futures trading Thursday, with the price 
flirting with the $25-a-barrel mark and closing at a 31-month high. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas futures, meanwhile, sank. In another market, the  
absence of feared damage in Florida from Hurricane Floyd sent 
orange juice futures lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange and the New York  
Board of Trade closed two to three hours early as the city braced 
for expected transportation chaos as a result of fast-approaching 
Floyd and the flooding it was expected to bring. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're worried about what will occur because of the  
hurricane,'' said Nachamah Jacobovits, spokeswoman for the 
mercantile exchange, which has about 8,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude for delivery in October rose 38 cents to $24.51 after  
hitting $24.80 early in the session -- its highest level since Jan. 
30 1997, when it closed at $24.87. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts cited technical reasons and continued bullishness as  
the reason for crude's modest 2 percent gain before trading was 
curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's just not a lot of reason to push prices lower at this  
point,'' said George Beranek, an oil analyst for Petroleum Finance 
Co. in Washington. ``We have seen some fairly bullish inventory 
reports, and OPEC is maintaining good discipline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which meets  
next week in Vienna, Austria, has given no hint of budging from a 
production cutback plan it adopted last spring to boost prices. 
</P>
<P>
	With U.S. inventories falling and world consumption soon to rise  
during the Northern Hemisphere winter, no end to oil's gushing 
price appears in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one expert raised the 'R' word as a possibility if oil  
shoots past the $30-a-barrel mark, although he suggested U.S. 
officials would pressure OPEC to raise production if the prospect 
of a recession emerges. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some stage, if these soaring oil prices really start to  
generate inflation fears and we see interest rates rising and a 
recession developing, President Clinton might make a phone call to 
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and say, 'Do you remember Desert Storm? 
You owe us one,''' said Tim Evans, senior energy analyst for 
Pegasus Econometric Group in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	October natural gas futures fell 8.3 cents to $2.545 per million  
British thermal units after the American Gas Association reported a 
higher-than-expected increase in storage levels the previous day. 
Floyd's influence also was cited in the decline -- the cooler 
weather it brought dimmed chances for an increase in power demand 
any time soon in the eastern United States. 
</P>
<P>
	October unleaded regular gasoline fell .15 cent to 68.90 cents a  
gallon, and October heating oil inched up 2 cents to 61.08 cents a 
gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Orange juice futures had soared in anticipation of Floyd's  
arrival along the Florida coastline. But with the storm gone 
northward and the orange crop largely unscathed, the price dipped 
for a third straight day before trading ended early. 
</P>
<P>
	Frozen concentrated orange juice futures for November delivery  
fell .85 cent to 90.70 cents a pound on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange -- nearly a dime lower than the level reached earlier in 
the week.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Mexican Prosecutor Found Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) -- He lost two brothers to gunshots as a  
youth and investigated another's assassination as a high-ranking 
prosecutor. Now Mario Ruiz Massieu himself has died, apparently a 
suicide, while facing trial in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ruiz Massieu family climbed from middle class origins into  
Mexico's political elite -- gaining wealth along with power -- only 
to fall into scandal, personal tragedy and one of the country's 
most stunning political mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruiz Massieu was found dead Wednesday at his home in New Jersey,  
where he had been under house arrest since 1996. Officials there 
said the 48-year-old attorney apparently took his own life with an 
overdose of antidepressants. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. courts had seized millions of dollars in his Texas bank  
account. He faced criminal charges in Houston for allegedly 
laundering suspected drug bribes. Back home in Mexico, he was 
accused of helping cover up his brother's murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Tragedy has stalked the Ruiz Massieu family.  
</P>
<P>
	Two brothers, Wilfrido and Roberto, were shot to death in front  
of the family home in Acapulco in 1965 by the father of Roberto's 
former girlfriend. Another brother, Arturo, is a fugitive accused 
of illegal real estate dealings in Acapulco. 
</P>
<P>
	A fourth brother, Jose Francisco, married a sister of Carlos  
Salinas de Gortari, who became president of Mexico in 1988. Though 
the couple later divorced, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu and Salinas 
seemingly remained friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu rose through the ranks and was  
secretary-general of the governing Institutional Revolutionary 
Party, or PRI -- until he was shot to death in September 1994 by a 
hired gunman in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario, then a federal deputy attorney general, was named to  
probe the death of his brother. But he created a storm of 
controversy by resigning a month later, accusing senior PRI 
officials of hindering his investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after Ernesto Zedillo took over as president in December  
1994, the investigation took an even more shocking turn. 
Prosecutors arrested Salinas' brother, Raul, on charges of 
masterminding the Ruiz Massieu slaying, and officials soon said 
Mario Ruiz Massieu was in on the coverup. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Ruiz Massieu left Mexico days later and was arrested at  
Newark International Airport on charges of failing to declare 
$46,000 in cash that he carried. He had been fighting extradition 
attempts ever since.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Downgraded to Tropical Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTAUK, N.Y. (AP) -- Creating havoc even at half-strength,  
Tropical Storm Floyd raced into the Northeast with gusty winds and 
drenching rain Thursday, grounding hundreds of flights, closing 
school for 3 million students, even postponing a U.N. meeting on 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd headed for Long Island and New England after rolling  
through the Carolinas in the morning. By evening, its winds had 
fallen below hurricane force to 65 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	At least seven deaths were blamed on Floyd, six from traffic  
accidents in the Carolinas and one man presumed drowned in the 
Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	While still a hurricane, Floyd drilled ashore at Cape Fear,  
N.C., knocking out power to more than 1.4 million in the Carolinas 
and dumping more than a foot of rain that flooded hundreds of North 
Carolina homes. But experts considered the overall damage to be 
modest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're most fortunate,'' said George Lemons, a National Weather  
Service forecaster in Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	From there, Floyd's winds weakened steadily to less than half  
its fearsome peak of 155 mph. The minimum wind speed for a 
hurricane is 74 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	At 7 p.m. EDT, the storm was off New Jersey, moving  
north-northeast at nearly 30 mph, and was expected to reach Long 
Island in a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the gentler Floyd was threat enough for New York and New  
Jersey authorities, who declared states of emergency. Public 
schools were closed in Washington, Baltimore, all of New Jersey, 
Philadelphia and New York City -- a part of the country more 
accustomed to snow days. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time anyone could recall all schools in New  
Jersey and New York City closing because of a hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	By evening the storm had dropped more than 6 inches of rain on  
Philadelphia, where a sold-out Bruce Springsteen concert was 
postponed. Up to 8 inches were expected in Connecticut and 12 
inches in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The wind set a Ferris wheel spinning on its own at Ocean City,  
Md., and overturned an empty truck on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. 
New York City sent its municipal employees home early, urged 
business to close and shut down the upper deck of the Verrazano 
Narrows Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of airline flights were canceled along the East Coast,  
grounding tens of thousands of passengers. Amtrak suspended all 
train service south of Washington, and service farther north was 
disrupted by a mudslide and fallen trees. Ferry service was 
canceled from Cape Cod to Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message is, don't fool with Mother Nature,'' said New York  
City Council Speaker Peter Vallone. ``Stay home if you can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York's mass transit system is particularly vulnerable to  
rain. Just three weeks ago, a freak storm during the morning rush 
hour dumped 3 inches of rain, halting subway trains and disrupting 
commuter rail service. Hundreds of thousands of workers got to work 
late or not at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Stock Exchange stuck to regular hours, but the U.N.  
Security Council postponed a meeting on protecting civilians in war 
zones. U.N. officials said it was the first time in recent history 
that a formal, open meeting of the Security Council was derailed by 
bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eastern end of Long Island, directly in the storm's  
projected path, residents made last-minute runs for flashlights and 
emergency supplies and hammered plywood over windows. 
</P>
<P>
	It was expected to be Long Island's harshest storm since  
September 1985, when Hurricane Gloria caused an estimated $130 
million in damage and knocked out power to 750,000 homes and 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're getting panicky,'' said Harold Herbert of Herb's  
Market in Montauk, on the easternmost tip of Long Island, as his 
customers lined up for batteries, water, ice and cold cuts. ``I 
don't think this hurricane is as bad as some of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities ordered the evacuation of Fire Island, off the south  
coast of Long Island, but not all its 2,000 residents obeyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Feraro, armed with candles, flashlights, batteries and a  
cell phone, hunkered down with his wife in their Fire Island home a 
mere 150 feet from the white-capped Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to ride this one out,'' said Feraro, who risked a  
ticket for ignoring the order. ``We're going to spend our time 
watching the storm. We have a perfect view.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Atlantic City, N.J., the Miss America Pageant had no  
immediate plans to curtail Saturday's indoor pageant, but city 
officials feared the storm might force them to cancel Friday's 
pageant parade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon said 8,000 members of the National Guard in  
Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia were 
mobilized to help communities recover from Hurricane Floyd. 
National Guardsmen in Delaware, New Jersey and New York were put on 
alert. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1.3 million people ordered from their homes in the Carolinas  
were given the OK to return. But many of those who tried 
encountered heavy traffic; others were stymied by flooded roads and 
fallen trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in the storm-hit Southern states have yet to tally  
the damage. But insurance experts estimated South Carolina's losses 
at $25 million. The figure is certain to be higher in North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowhere along the Atlantic coast did Floyd strike as hard as it  
did in the Bahamas. Authorities there finally got to assess the 
damage Thursday and said hundreds of homes were flattened and 
roofless on several islands. Thousands of people faced the prospect 
of weeks without telephone, electricity or reliable water service. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trees were skinned like bananas,'' said Michelle Rolle, a  
resident of Abaco, an island in the Bahamas. ``This hurricane was 
by far the worst we've seen.''

<HEADLINE> Neighbors Say Gunman Was Loner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOREST HILL, Texas (AP) -- Larry Gene Ashbrook was a jobless  
loner who exposed himself, screamed obscenities and kicked doors 
during fits of rage, according to his neighbors in the 
working-class suburb where he spent much of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the way he looked at you,'' neighbor Venita Hord said  
Thursday. ``I was scared of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Fort Worth on Wednesday, Ashbrook, 47, shot seven people to  
death at a prayer meeting in a Baptist church before sitting down 
in a pew and killing himself. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, investigators were picking through his modest,  
wood-frame house, which he had ransacked by breaking holes in the 
walls, pouring concrete in the toilets, overturning furniture and 
slicing up family photos, said Bob Garrity, FBI special agent in 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Old journals revealed that he believed ``people are out to get  
him'' and was particularly upset about his difficulty in finding 
and keeping a job, acting Fort Worth Police Chief Ralph Mendoza 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he was just somebody who was a social outcast,''  
Garrity said. ``This has the appearance of being a very troubled 
man, who for whatever reason in his own mind, sought to quiet 
whatever demons that bothered him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors said Ashbrook never married or had children, and had  
peculiar habits like leaving home for an hour each morning carrying 
a blue canvas bag. 
</P>
<P>
	Elderly residents would retreat into their homes when Ashbrook  
walked down the street, intimidated by his menacing appearance. He 
invariably opened and closed doors to houses and cars with violent 
kicks. 
</P>
<P>
	He also became more erratic after his mother died nine years  
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before she died, Larry still had it together. After she died,  
he went mental,'' said Karen Ivey, a neighbor for 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashbrook lived for many years with his father, Jack D. Ashbrook,  
who died two months ago at age 85. Jack Ashbrook, a retired 
railroad switchman, was a longtime member of Pleasant Ridge Church 
of Christ, but his son did not attend, said Bill Pullen, a senior 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Pullen described Ashbrook's father as ``salt of the earth'' and  
``a kind and gentle person'' who missed his late wife but enjoyed 
fellowship at the church. He never met Ashbrook or his older three 
siblings. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the street from the Ashbrooks' home, longtime neighbors  
said they saw Larry Ashbrook push his father down more than once, 
but did not call police because they feared retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figured if his father would put up with him, it wasn't any  
of our business,'' Jack Hord said. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Mrs. Hord: ``We should have called the law on him.''  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hord recalled meeting with her neighbors in her front yard  
four or five years ago. Ashbrook, believing the neighbors were 
talking about him, exposed himself and screamed obscenities, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another neighbor, Earl L. Thomason, remembered Ashbrook as a  
friend of his younger son's. He would come over to borrow a tool or 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once or twice I'd have it about mowed and he'd come over and  
finish it for me or something like that,'' Thomason said. ``He was 
just a neighbor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomason said Ashbrook joined the Navy after attending O.D.  
Wyatt High School, at the same time his own son joined the Army in 
1971. The young men didn't spend much time together after that. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy officials confirmed Ashbrook was an enlisted sailor, but  
they had no other information. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda McConn, who has lived in Ashbrook's neighborhood since  
1961, was a high school classmate of the gunman's sister. She 
always though Ashbrook was harmless. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always saw him driving around in his father's old Chevy,''  
Ms. McConn said. ``We always just kind of thought he was kind of 
useless.''

<HEADLINE> British Panel Looks into Nandrolone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A panel of British scientists is investigating  
whether contaminated meat and unlicensed food supplements could be 
responsible for the spate of positive tests for the steroid 
nandrolone. 
</P>
<P>
	UK Sport, which oversees drug testing in Britain, said Thursday  
it was concerned by the possible impact of ``external sources'' of 
nadrolone metabolites. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been a series of positive tests for nandrolone this  
summer in different sports, including high-profile cases in track 
and field involving former Olympic 100-meter champion Linford 
Christie of Britain and Jamaican sprinter Merlene Ottey. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking at the possibility of nandrolone arising  
through the food chain,'' said Michele Verroken, UK Sport's 
anti-doping chief. ``The use of steroids in animal farming is 
illegal, and we are consulting with the Department of Agriculture 
to find out what they are aware of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Verroken said the panel would also examine whether food and  
nutritional supplements contain nandrolone. 
</P>
<P>
	``The supplements cause a considerable problem because they are  
unregulated and unlicensed,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts have been puzzled by a sudden surge of positive tests  
for nandrolone, a muscle-building steroid that has been available 
for decades and detectable in standard drug tests for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Christie and fellow British sprinters Doug Walker and Gary  
Cadogan have all been cleared by the national athletics federation 
on grounds there was no proof the nandrolone in their system ``was 
derived from a prohibited substance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am deeply concerned when doubts are raised about the  
system,'' the UK Sport chairman, Sir Rodney Walker, said. ``There 
is a perception that if athletes test positive, the system must be 
flawed or incorrect. This does nothing for the reputation of 
sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Verroken said the UK Sport panel -- comprising 20 scientists and  
other experts -- was beginning its research on the basis that 
nandrolone tests are ``entirely reliable.'' She said the goal was 
to ensure the methods are ``beyond reproach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Verroken said the panel will look at how nandrolone is produced  
naturally in the body and the effect of exercise on the body's 
production of steroids. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel will also study new testing techniques, including the  
use of high resolution equipment; collection and storage of 
samples, and disciplinary rules and procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	The group has met once already and is expected to complete its  
work in early December. The findings will be forwarded to the 
International Olympic Committee, the International Amateur Athletic 
Federation and other world bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said the track and field  
federation welcomed the British initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any study which can be useful can be taken into consideration  
by the IAAF medical and doping commission,'' he said. ``We want to 
solve this problem once and for all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF medical chairman, Arne Ljungqvist of Sweden, said last  
month that he and other experts believed the rash of nandrolone 
cases were due to food supplements spiked with the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Under IAAF rules, athletes are considered to have committed a  
doping offense if a banned substance is found in their bodies, 
regardless of whether they took it intentionally or not.

<HEADLINE> Gates To Donate $1B for Minorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates pledged Thursday to  
donate $1 billion for college scholarships for minority students, 
saying he wants to change the face of American leadership -- 
including that of his own company. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Gates Millennium Scholars Program,'' supported by the  
world's richest man -- a Harvard dropout -- and his wife, Melinda, 
will provide 1,000 scholarships a year for 20 years to 
Asian-American, black, Hispanic and American Indian students. 
</P>
<P>
	``This country is in an incredible time period. The advances in  
technology are really quite breathtaking,'' Gates said at a news 
conference. ``Is everybody getting a chance to benefit from this? 
The answer is really no. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do hope in the years ahead that as you look at the kids in  
school and you look at our industry, you will see a broad, diverse 
representation, because I think that really builds a strong 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gift is the couple's largest single philanthropic  
contribution and among the largest ever, rivaling a $1 billion 
commitment by CNN founder Ted Turner to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton applauded the decision. ``These landmark  
scholarships will help address important needs -- the need to 
encourage young people to become teachers, the need to ensure that 
our children are well-prepared in math and science, and the need to 
open the doors oif higher learning to all students,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Negro College Fund will administer the scholarship  
program starting next year, with help from the Hispanic Scholarship 
Fund and the American Indian College Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Those three organizations' combined scholarship budget is $51  
million. Gates will almost double that with his donations of $50 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many young people do not get the opportunity to reach their  
potential because of the barriers of finances,'' said William Gray 
III, president and chief executive officer of the United Negro 
College Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to lower those barriers. ... It's a wonderful  
moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scholarships, to be awarded primarily for academic  
achievement and financial need, will support four years of 
undergraduate education, plus graduate studies in education, 
library science, engineering, math and science. 
</P>
<P>
	Eligible students must have a 3.3 grade-point average, be  
nominated by a teacher or principal and commit to performing 
community service. Scholarship winners would have to maintain a 3.0 
grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
	With assets of $17 billion, the Bill and Melinda Gates  
Foundation is the second-largest philanthropic foundation in the 
world, behind London-based Wellcome Trust. Since 1997, it has given 
more than $2.4 billion, primarily for global health and education. 
</P>
<P>
	``The greatest thing you can do is provide somebody with a  
wonderful education,'' Gates said. ``I was an incredible 
beneficiary of seeing wide-open horizons, so education is something 
that Melinda and I believe in very deeply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gates, who dropped out of Harvard to found Microsoft, has a net  
worth of more than $90 billion. His wife is a graduate and trustee 
of Duke University.

<HEADLINE> Thrasher Future on Stefan Shoulders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Patrik Stefan was admittedly nervous the first  
time he stepped on the ice for the Atlanta Thrashers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, there's pressure when everybody is looking at  
you,'' the 19-year-old center said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the strapping native of the Czech Republic has grown  
more comfortable in the spotlight, providing a tantalizing glimpse 
of the skills that made him the No. 1 pick in the NHL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``The top four or five guys in this year's draft are going to be  
outstanding players,'' said general manager Don Waddell, who 
engineered a draft-day deal to land Stefan. ``But I couldn't get 
that feeling about anybody else that I got with Patrik.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Thrashers have gone to great lengths to ensure that  
Stefan's development is unimpeded by the growing pains of an 
expansion franchise. Waddell said he's not concerned about this 
season or next -- when the losses figure to be frequent -- but looks 
forward to seeing Stefan at the ripe old age of 22 or 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got to earn his playing time,'' Waddell said. ``If he's  
ready now, we'll bring him on quicker. If not, we'll bring him 
along slower and be prepared to stand back and take all the 
questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To ease the transition, coach Curt Fraser put Stefan on a line  
with 32-year-old Kelly Buchberger, who played on three Stanley 
Cup-winning teams in Edmonton with players like Wayne Gretzky, Mark 
Messier and Grant Fuhr. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the back of his mind, Patrik has got to know every person  
in the building is watching him,'' Fraser said. ``He's got to 
forget that. Just go out, play the game and have fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchberger has noticed in Stefan some of the same traits that  
were prevalent in those great Edmonton teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of young guys are not open to suggestions,'' Buchberger  
said. ``But Patrik is very polite and he wants to learn. He wants 
to be the best he can be. He's an easy guy to take to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only question is whether the Thrashers have the next Eric  
Lindros (superstar) or the next Brett Lindros (a career cut shot by 
concussions). Stefan suffered two concussions last season with the 
Long Beach Ice Dogs, playing his final game in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel fine,'' insisted Stefan, who turned 19 Thursday.  
``That's all behind me. I don't even think about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, doubts persist because of the way Stefan's agent handled  
the situation prior to the draft. Rich Winter refused to release 
his client's medical records, prompting Tampa Bay to give up its 
chance to land Stefan with the No. 1 pick. The Thrashers relied on 
their own medical research to reach a different conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no more risk of injury with Patrik than there is with  
any other player,'' Waddell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Stefan jumped at the chance to leave the Czech  
Republic when an offer came from the International Hockey League, a 
step below the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to play in the NHL, and the IHL helped me,'' he said.  
``It's a good league. I got to play against men and I learned a 
lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking little English, Stefan moved in with a family in  
Southern California. His mother and father took turns visiting him 
to make the adjustment easier. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was hard the first couple of weeks and months,'' he  
recalled. ``I learned a lot -- not only about hockey, but about 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Stefan was one of the better players in the IHL  
until the concussions took their toll. In 33 games, he scored 11 
goals and added 24 assists, earning a spot in the league's All-Star 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Stefan's skating is deceptively quick and elusive. Like many  
Europeans, he has soft hands and extraordinary passing skills, but 
he's also big enough (6-foot-2, 205 pounds) to take an NHL-style 
beating. He does his best work behind the net and in the corners, 
drawing comparisons to Ron Francis. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very mature for his age,'' Buchberger said. ``Hopefully,  
that will make his adjustment to the NHL a lot easier. A lot of 
junior players have problems the first couple of years. But you can 
already tell he's one of the best players on the ice.''

	Floyd Brings Winds, Rain to Northeast  
</P>
<P>
	MONTAUK, N.Y. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Floyd raced into the  
Northeast with gusty winds and torrential rain today. Floyd headed 
for Long Island and New England after rolling through the Carolinas 
in the morning. By evening, its winds had fallen below hurricane 
force to 65 mph. At least seven deaths were blamed on Floyd. Two 
girls in Delaware were missing after a storm-swollen creek swept 
them into a sewage pipe. While still a hurricane, Floyd drilled 
ashore at Cape Fear, N.C., knocking out power to more than 1.4 
million in the Carolinas. But the overall damage was considered 
modest. 

</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Grounds Travelers  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd's express ride up the East Coast  
grounded tens of thousands of airline passengers around the country 
today and stopped Amtrak trains on their tracks. Airlines resumed 
service to and from Florida, Georgia and parts of the Carolinas but 
canceled several hundred flights into and out of airports from 
Boston to Washington as the storm raced toward the Northeast with 
gusty winds and rain of up to a foot. Flights into and out of 
Hartford, Conn., New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore were also 
canceled. Some passengers trying to make connnections were rebooked 
through other cities.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton gave the go-ahead today for  
limited U.S. participation in an Australian-led peacekeeping force 
for East Timor. He said about 200 U.S. troops will be involved, but 
the Pentagon said the total could increase if Australia asks for 
more help. Clinton said half the U.S. personnel will be on the 
ground in East Timor. The rest will be in Darwin on Australia's 
north coast, which is to serve as the main support base for the 
7,500-strong peacekeeping force.

	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Pat Buchanan had an answer today when  
asked what it would take to keep him in the Republican Party rather 
than running as the Reform Party candidate. ``I think if George 
Bush came to me and said, `Pat, I've seen the light and you've got 
to be our nominee,''' he said, laughing. Buchanan said it will be 
another month before he will say which party he's running with. 
Buchanan, who complains Republicans have forsaken their 
conservative roots, said he doesn't expect winning the Reform Party 
nomination would be easy, though he says he is confident he could 
do it and then go on to win the presidency.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress today approved legislation doubling  
the next president's salary to $400,000 and letting lawmakers 
themselves receive pay boosts of $4,600 or more. Also getting pay 
raises in January would be Vice President Al Gore, Cabinet 
secretaries and about 1,300 other top-level executive branch 
officials. The 3.4 percent boost would raise most lawmakers' pay to 
$141,300 beginning in January. The Senate approved the bill by 
54-38, a day after the House gave its endorsement by 292-126.

	Damage Award Against Ford Overturned  
</P>
<P>
	MODESTO, Calif. (AP) -- A judge today overturned a $290 million  
damage award against Ford Motor Co. Stanislaus County Superior 
Court Judge Roger Beauchesne granted Ford a new trial on the 
punitive damages, saying jury misconduct may have influenced the 
July 12 verdict. The judge upheld the jury's unanimous finding that 
a defective roof was responsible for the deaths of a husband, wife 
and son when their Ford Bronco overturned on a freeway in June 
1993. The $290 million verdict had been the second-largest of its 
kind.

Paxson Communications Corp., one of the nation's biggest owners of 
television stations. The deal announced today may help revive 
Paxson's year-old PAX network, adding highly rated NBC shows to a

<HEADLINE> Report: Gore Woos Mayor for DNC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Philadelphia Mayor Edward G. Rendell is  
reportedly being courted by Vice President Al Gore to take a top 
position with the Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Rendell and top Democratic officials declined comment on the  
reports Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post, citing unidentified sources, said Rendell  
told Gore that he would ``love to do it'' even though there are 
risks to his expected gubernatorial bid in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Rendell spokesman Kevin Feeley and DNC officials did not return  
calls on Thursday seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	It was uncertain what position Rendell and Gore discussed.  
</P>
<P>
	Rendell spokesman David Yarkin told the Post that Rendell had  
not been offered the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Friends of his from the party have talked to him about it and  
asked him if he'd be interested in the DNC position if a vacancy 
existed,'' Yarkin said. ``He said, 'I would consider it strongly.' 
'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rendell, who will leave office at the end of the year,  
reportedly caught the attention of Gore with his successful push to 
persuade the Republican Party to hold its 2000 national convention 
in Philadelphia and by chairing a Gore fund-raiser in June that 
raised $450,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's advisers reportedly are concerned about the amounts of  
money raised by GOP front-runner Texas Gov. George W. Bush and fear 
that Gore will deplete many of his resources, the newspaper 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore campaign spokeswoman Kiki Moore disputed that account of  
the sentiment among Gore's staff and advisers and said they are not 
worried about what their current or probable opponents are doing. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush raised $37.2 million through June 30 and Gore raised $17.5  
million through the same period, according to Federal Election 
Commission filings. Since then, Bush has disclosed he has raised a 
total of $50 million and Gore has not made any more information 
public. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Networks Linking Off-Hours Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hoping to protect investors from sharp price  
swings in the brave new world of extended-hours trading, a new 
alliance plans to show stock quotes from different markets on a 
single ticker tape. 
</P>
<P>
	The partnership announced today among eight electronic trading  
systems includes industry leader Instinet, a unit of the Reuters 
Group PLC, and top newcomers in the extended-hours market such as 
Island ECN, MarketXT and Archipelago. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance is designed to centralize information in the same  
way that stock quotes from a variety of sources are disseminated 
through a single clearinghouse during regular market sessions. By 
creating the image of a more seamless market, investors can make 
better-informed decisions, the group said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``During traditional market hours, the best prices available on  
electronic trading systems for Nasdaq securities are consolidated 
with the quotes of market makers and specialists,'' the statement 
said. ``The linking of these electronic trading systems is intended 
to foster similar transparency ... outside of traditional market 
hours to facilitate efficient execution of customer orders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The non-binding agreement comes amid a fierce scramble to offer  
extended-hours trading to individual investors -- and criticism that 
low off-hours volume will expose consumers to wild price swings if 
there isn't enough demand to buy or sell a stock. 
</P>
<P>
	For that reason, Island and MarketXT, the first two electronic  
markets to offer extended hours through retail brokerages, have 
required investors to specify the most they're willing to pay when 
buying a stock or the least they're willing to take when selling. 
Likewise, trading has been limited to shares of major companies 
that are likely to generate sufficient volume for price stability. 
</P>
<P>
	The new alliance ``is a very positive step for the after-hours  
market and it hopefully will alleviate some of concerns about 
market fragmentation'' and price swings, Chris Concannon, general 
counsel for Island, said late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the partners, which are known in the industry as  
Electronic Communications Networks or ECNs, would become a 
subscriber to the other seven. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, many of the ECNs already subscribe to the other trading  
systems, said Concannon. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new alliance takes that relationship a step farther by  
enabling each ECN to see the best offers on another network and 
execute a trade for its customers on that network if a better price 
is available. 
</P>
<P>
	The partnership also calls for the creation of a real-time  
``ticker tape'' of stock quotes like the ones that stream across 
the bottom of the television screen on CNBC and other business news 
networks. The tape, to be compiled by an undetermined data service, 
would feature the most recent trades executed on the various ECNs. 
</P>
<P>
	For most individual investors, the new extended-hours services  
mark the first time they're being given a chance to manage their 
portfolios or react to late news outside normal daytime trading. 
That privilege has been long reserved for elite money managers 
handling large pools of money such as mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The other partners in the new ECN alliance are Bloomberg  
Tradebook, a unit of the Bloomberg news organization; RediBook, 
itself a joint venture between Fidelity Investments, Charles 
Schwab, Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, and Spear Leeds &AMP; Kellogg; the 
Brass Utility, or Brut, trading system; and Strike Technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	Archipelago's backers include ETrade Group, Goldman Sachs, J.P.  
Morgan, Instinet, Merrill Lynch and the CNBC unit of General 
Electric. Island was created by the Internet brokerage Datek 
Online, which recently sold a minority stake in the ECN to TD 
Waterhouse Group.

<HEADLINE> Starr Has Mixed Feelings for Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- If he had it to do over again, special  
counsel Kenneth Starr says he would have let another investigator 
delve into the messy details surrounding President Clinton's affair 
with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Starr defended his work, he acknowledged that by the  
time the scandal was uncovered, his investigation of Clinton for 
Whitewater had already dragged on for so long that the public was 
growing weary and suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think in retrospect I made a serious mistake,'' he told some  
550 people at a public forum here Wednesday. ``I think it would 
have been much better for the country for the Lewinsky matter to 
have been handled by another independent counsel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr also expressed mixed feelings about Clinton, calling him  
``gifted and talented'' on the one hand, but adding he was 
disappointed with the president's personal behavior and the fact 
Clinton wasn't truthful with the American public when the affair 
was first uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
	``My real disappointment with our leader was when he took a poll  
on whether to tell the truth,'' Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
	During his speech, Starr reiterated his opinion that the  
congressional statute calling for the appointment of special 
prosecutors not be renewed. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old law was allowed to lapse in June amid lack of  
support. Starr said it was born in the post-Watergate era of good 
intentions but was hopelessly flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I opposed the statute when I first served in the Justice  
Department in 1981,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The statute,'' he continued, ``simply does not work. The  
Congress was trying in effect to create a separate branch of 
government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he made it clear where he thinks the real blame in a scandal  
lies -- and it's not with the special counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the real responsibility is on our public officials to  
be as transparent and honest as possible,'' he said, ``and if there 
is a problem, to get the problem out there and deal with it.''

	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Quaker Oats Co. is breaking ground for a new  
$115 million Gatorade plant that is expected to bring about 200 
jobs to Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	The facility is being built in an industrial park near the

<HEADLINE> India Cigarettes Popular With Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Federal health officials fear that more and more  
youths are turning to imported high-nicotine, unfiltered cigarettes 
that come in flavors such as strawberry and chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
	A study of 642 Boston-area middle and high school students found  
that 40 percent had tried the thin cigarettes -- called bidis or 
beedies -- at least once and 16 percent were current bidi smokers, 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight percent were heavy bidi smokers, having smoked more than  
100. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hearing anecdotal evidence from around the country that  
bidis are popular with young people and are increasingly 
available,'' said Michael Eriksen, director of the CDC's Office on 
Smoking and Health. ``We're concerned that it's becoming chic, 
particularly among urban minority kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Imported from India, bidis are filled with tobacco flakes,  
hand-rolled with a greenish-brown leaf, tapered at both ends and 
tied with a tiny, colored thread. 
</P>
<P>
	The cigarettes are shaped like marijuana joints and come in a  
variety of scents that hide the harsh taste of the tobacco. They 
also cost about half as much as regular cigarettes -- a 
paper-wrapped bundle of 20 bidis can be purchased for as little as 
$1.50. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal health officials and antismoking activists say bidis are  
more harmful than cigarettes. The CDC said at least one study found 
that bidis produce more than three times the amount of carbon 
monoxide and nicotine and about five times the amount of tar as 
cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked why they chose bidis instead of regular cigarettes,  
23 percent of the Massachusetts teens surveyed in March and April 
said they tasted better and 18 percent cited price. Thirteen 
percent said they thought bidis were safer and 12 percent said they 
were easier to buy. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to grocery and convenience stores, bidis are sold in  
health food stores, and that may be misleading young people, the 
CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no warning labels like on cigarette packs. Kids say  
they're easier to purchase,'' Eriksen said. ``All the signs that 
teens would look for to tell them that this product is harmful 
aren't there the way they should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., asked the Federal Trade  
Commission to investigate whether the cigarettes should be sold in 
health food stores. The FTC already is investigating reports the 
cigarettes are often sold without required warning labels.

<HEADLINE> Reno Laments Hate Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lamenting the latest mass shooting in the  
United States, Attorney General Janet Reno said today Americans 
must look hard at the issue of ``how we handle guns, of how we deal 
with mental illness, of how we deal with hate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno, discussing the killing rampage Wednesday night at a  
Baptist church in Fort Worth, Texas, said, ``The thought of gunfire 
in a place of worship should be inconceivable. But for families, 
for others last night, the inconceivable became a reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She made the remarks at her weekly news conference.  
</P>
<P>
	Discussing a host of shooting episodes around the country,  
including one in Atlanta, and a host of shootings at schools 
earlier in the year, the attorney general said that FBI agents are 
on the scene and assisting local authorities. ``We are prepared to 
assist in any way that we can,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A gunman identified by police as Larry Gene Ashbrook of Fort  
Worth burst into a church service and opened fire. Seven people 
were fatally shot, and the gunman killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1999 alone,'' Reno said, ``we have watched as innocent  
people were gunned down while attending school, while walking home 
from a church or synagogue, while playing at a summer camp, while 
working in their offices, while delivering mail and now while 
worshiping in their church.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This morning, we have ... many more questions than answers,''  
she added. ``We will search for those answers and try, as another 
community mourns its dead, to find a way to end this type of 
senseless and destructive violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is going to require the commitment of all Americans to look  
at the issue of how we handle guns, of how we deal with mental 
illness, of how we deal with hate,'' she said. ``We don't know what 
the situation is here, but all of these events cry out for America 
to come together and to address them in an effective, permanent 
manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She renewed her call for legislation the Clinton administration  
has been seeking in Congress to place tighter curbs on handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope that people would look, not just at what handguns  
have done to America this year, not in the context of this case, 
but what handguns have done to America over the last many years,'' 
Reno said, ``and that this nation would listen to its people who 
again and again cry out for ... asking government to make sure that 
we take reasonable steps to ensure that guns are not placed in the 
hands of people who are not lawfully entitled to have them.''

<HEADLINE> Nike First-Quarter Profits Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- After a year of cost-cutting in 1999,  
Nike reported Thursday its earnings were up 22 percent for its 
first quarter in fiscal 2000, but revenue remained flat for the 
world's largest maker of athletic shoes and clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Beaverton-based company posted a profit of $200 million, or  
70 cents a share, compared with $164 million, or 56 cents a share, 
in the year-ago quarter. Sales were stuck at $2.5 billion, the same 
level as the first quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Nike's results were well above the 66 cents a share  
predicted by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us, it was a near-great quarter,'' said Nike Chairman Phil  
Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	He said domestic shoe sales showed a 3 percent increase while  
global sales advanced 4 percent. But Nike clothing sales declined 6 
percent overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Future orders for delivery between September 1999 and January  
2000 were up 2 percent to $3.2 billion from the first quarter of 
1999, but domestic orders were down 7 percent. Orders in Europe, a 
traditionally strong sales area for Nike, were up 15 percent while 
Asia jumped 37 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight said orders were affected by a decision to move from a  
four-season selling cycle to three seasons, shortening the spring 
season by a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike also continued an aggressive $1 billion stock repurchasing  
effort launched in February 1998, buying back $142 million worth of 
shares during the first quarter of fiscal 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike shares closed up 56 1/4 cents, at $54.75, on the New York  
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Japan Wary of Recent Yen Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's economy continues to improve, but a recent  
surge by the yen threatens to derail recovery, the government said 
Friday in a monthly report. 
</P>
<P>
	The Economic Planning Agency said consumers are feeling more  
confident, corporate profits are rebounding and exports are rising 
thanks to a recovery in the Asian region. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the EPA kept its assessment unchanged from the  
previous month, saying that while economic conditions remain 
severe, the economy has improved somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rapid appreciation of the yen, which hurts exporters by  
making their products less competitive abroad, could undermine the 
prospects for a recovery, said Takashi Omori, director of the 
national economic division at the EPA's research bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen's recent surge ``is a matter of concern. It depends how  
far it goes, but for the short-term, a sudden rise is a negative 
factor for the economy,'' Omori said. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen has been gaining strength as foreign investors buy the  
currency to invest in Japanese stocks and other assets on growing 
hope that the economy has finally turned around from its worst 
downturn in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The flows gained momentum last week following the release of  
gross domestic product data showing the economy expanded 0.2 
percent in the April-June quarter from the previous period, 
building on the 2.0 percent growth registered in the January-March 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell to a 44-month low of 103.20 yen Wednesday,  
despite dollar-buying currency market intervention by the Bank of 
Japan last week on Friday and on Tuesday this week to curb the 
yen's rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The developments in currency markets are all the more troubling  
because the foundations for a sustained economic recovery in Japan 
are still shaky. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said that private consumption is recovering gently  
despite flagging incomes. That represents a slight upgrade from the 
previous month's assessment that spending was recovering but lacked 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the agency said that while consumers were more  
inclined to open their purses, falling wages continue to sap 
strength from spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Another pillar of private demand -- private capital investment --  
also continues to decline, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	More foreboding for the economy's outlook, the agency downgraded  
its assessment of private housing investment and public investment 
-- two sources of strength that helped to propel growth in the first 
half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The economy is also losing impetus from public investment  
spending, which has played a central role in underpinning the 
economy, the EPA said.

<HEADLINE> Columbia/HCA Exec Agrees To Plea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. executive has  
agreed to a deal with prosecutors to avoid a second trial on a 
Medicare fraud conspiracy charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Lynn Dick, 55, signed a pretrial diversion agreement last  
month, Monte Richardson, of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Tampa, 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	If a person successfully satisfies the 12-month program, charges  
are dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said he couldn't provide any details. But defendants  
who sign such agreements typically agree to cooperate with 
prosecutors, pay restitution and perform community service, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick was among four Columbia/HCA managers in Florida charged  
with health care fraud. They were the first indictments to come 
from a 2 1/2-year federal probe of the Columbia/HCA, the nation's 
biggest hospital chain. The investigation continues. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the managers were convicted, one was acquitted and the  
federal jury in Tampa failed to reach a verdict on Dick, the chief 
financial officer of Columbia/HCA's central Florida division in 
Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick is on leave from his job. His attorney, William Jung, could  
not be reached to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, sentencing is set for Oct. 15 for Robert Whiteside,  
48, of Brentwood, Tenn., and Jay Jarrell, 44. Whiteside heads 
Columbia/HCA's single market hospitals in Nashville, Tenn., and 
Jarrell is president of the company's southwest Florida division. 
</P>
<P>
	They were found guilty of conspiring to defraud and defrauding  
Medicare, Medicaid and CHAMPUS, tax-supported health programs for 
the disabled, elderly, poor and military. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men face up to 30 years in prison and $1.5 million in  
fines.

</P>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd roared ashore today near  
Cape Fear with 110 mph wind, flooding the Carolina coasts with more 
than a foot of rain and causing at least seven deaths. More than 
480,000 utility customers in the Carolinas and Virginia have lost 
power. Flooding and power failures combined to shut down 
Portsmouth, Va.'s water supply system, which serves 110,000 
customers. At 9 a.m. EDT, the storm was centered 70 miles 
south-southwest of Norfolk, Va., and moving north-northeast at 
about 25 mph. Hurricane warnings were posted as far north as 
Plymouth, Mass. Public schools are closed for the day across New 
Jersey and in New York City and Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia 
ordered schools closed early.

related to his decision to grant clemency to more than a dozen 
members of a violent Puerto Rican nationalist group. The clemency 
grants have stirred up a political firestorm, with law enforcement 
groups and victims of actions by the group accusing Clinton of 
using clemency to boost his wife's Senate ambitions. Committee 
officials have threatened to seek contempt charges if they aren't

an aisle. Seven people were fatally shot last night before the 
gunman -- identified today as 47-year-old Larry Gene Ashbrook --

Mrs. Cooke was released pending sentencing Nov. 4; she could face a 
year in jail. The Immigration and Naturalization Service is trying 
to deport Mrs. Cooke to her native Bolivia because of a 1986 
conviction on a cocaine conspiracy charge.

<HEADLINE> Sprewell Pulled Over by Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell of the New York Knicks  
made a positive impression on police after being pulled over with a 
friend while driving on Interstate 94. 
</P>
<P>
	A passenger in Sprewell's black 1997 Lamborghini was taken into  
custody on an outstanding warrant. The Knicks guard followed the 
squad car to the Public Safety Building to post $300 bail for his 
passenger. 
</P>
<P>
	At the station, two officers approached the 29-year-old former  
Milwaukee high school star and asked to be photographed with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very cooperative and a real nice person,'' said officer  
Booker Bennett, who described himself as a Knicks fan. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell was driving south on I-94 when the Racine County  
Sheriff's Department alerted Kenosha County deputies to watch for 
two black sports cars which reportedly were racing. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputies saw the Lamborghini and pulled it over at 12:07 a.m.  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In running background checks, deputies learned the passenger,  
Raymond Pope of Milwaukee, had an outstanding warrant for driving 
after revocation of his license, and he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell served a 68-game suspension when he was with the Golden  
State Warrioers for choking coach P.J. Carlesimo.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Reverses on Sunday Provision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVO, Utah (AP) -- Without taking the field, the BYU women's  
soccer team got its biggest victory of the season Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA championship cabinet, meeting in Indianapolis,  
suspended waivers approved earlier this season by committees 
governing competition in women's soccer and women's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	The committees had sought to ban from NCAA play any school with  
written policies against Sunday competition. Thursday's ruling 
clears the way for BYU to play in the NCAA tournaments if the 
Cougars qualify. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt all along this happened because the NCAA people didn't  
understand our position, that we were not going to accommodate 
them,'' said Elaine Michaelis, BYU's director of women's athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	The waivers were approved after national television contracts  
for the NCAA finals in both sports placed the games on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
	If BYU or Campbell, the only schools affected by the waivers,  
reach this season's championship game in either sport, the NCAA 
said Thursday it will alter its schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``We concluded that if a team has earned the opportunity to  
participate in a championship through its performance, we must do 
everything possible to accommodate them,'' said Jean Lenti Ponsetto 
of DePaul, chairwoman of the championship cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	BYU is owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  
Campbell is a Southern Baptist college in Buies Creek, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Administrators on those campuses challenged the committee  
rulings. The Trans America Athletic Conference, of which Campbell 
is a member, has proposed legislation to eliminate the waiver. 
</P>
<P>
	The BYU women's soccer team is 6-0 and ranked 11th in the  
sport's latest coaches poll. The Cougars were traveling for a game 
Friday at Southern California and coach Jennifer Rockwood couldn't 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are ecstatic, just thrilled,'' Michaelis said.  
</P>
<P>
	In initially approving the waivers, NCAA officials said changing  
the tournament schedule to accommodate one school could cause too 
much disruption to others. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal, BYU and Campbell outlined a possible legal  
challenge. Michaelis said the NCAA approved a clause earlier this 
year which prohibits discrimination based on sex, race, creed or 
religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We prefer to think they made their decision on a philosophical  
basis and not under the threat of legal action,'' Michaelis said. 
</P>
<P>
	In women's basketball, the final has been played on a Sunday for  
years. At BYU, the Sunday issue became topical in soccer after the 
Cougars reached the third round of last year's NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	For 35 years, the Sunday Rule, also known as the BYU Rule, has  
allowed teams qualifying for NCAA play in any sport to request not 
to be assigned competition on certain days because of religious 
beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's soccer and women's basketball were the only sports in  
which governing committees approved the waivers.

<HEADLINE>  Schott Reign Ends in Cincinnati </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- On a day of historic change, baseball  
got rid of its highest-profile woman and lost its highest-ranking 
black official. 
</P>
<P>
	Marge Schott's rocky 15-year reign as owner of the Cincinnati  
Reds ended Wednesday when baseball approved the $67 million sale of 
her controlling interest to her limited partners. 
</P>
<P>
	National League president Len Coleman, the top minority official  
in the game, announced his resignation immediately after owners 
voted to merge the administrative operations of the American and 
National leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	And in developments that caused disappointment and anger, owners  
put off the proposed sales of the Kansas City Royals and Oakland 
Athletics, citing the uncertain futures of baseball's small-market 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott, who repeatedly has infuriated baseball with inflammatory  
statements about minorities and women, will be replaced as the 
Reds' controlling owner by Carl Lindner, who owns the Great 
American Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, in which 36.7 percent of the team's shares change  
hands, values the franchise at $181.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott couldn't be reached for comment, and Lindner, who  
attended the meeting, referred comment to John Allen, the team's 
managing executive since Schott agreed in June 1996 to give up 
day-to-day control of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the end of a historic chapter in our organization,''  
Allen said. ``It's the start of the next chapter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owners also unanimously approved a resolution calling on their  
lawyers to redraft the Major League Agreement, which governs 
baseball, to merge the AL and NL in all areas but on the field, 
where the leagues and divisions will remain unchanged for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, saying his job would become irrelevant with the change,  
was the lone dissenting vote in the baseball's executive council, 
then said he will quit after the World Series and will become a 
senior adviser to commissioner Bud Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	``The role of league president has become like a Studebaker -- a  
good ride while it lasted,'' Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	AL president Gene Budig, who did not attend Selig's news  
conference, was offered the job of senior vice president under 
Selig in charge of educational and government affairs. There was no 
word if he would accept it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baseball took a very historical step that it had to do,''  
Selig said. ``It is imperative that we conduct ourselves as a 
single entity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the NL began in 1876 and the AL in 1900, each league ran  
its own affairs. But the commissioner's office, founded in 1920, 
has taken an increasing active role, especially since 1984, when 
Peter Ueberroth had the leagues move into the same building. 
</P>
<P>
	Interleague play, which began in 1997, provided further impetus.  
Under the change, umpires, scheduling and player discipline will 
switch to the commissioner's office, subject to collective 
bargaining with players and umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, the system was an anachronism,'' Selig said.  
</P>
<P>
	The owners voted 28-2 to table the $122.4 million sale of the  
A's to a group headed by Save Mart Foods chairman Bob Piccinini, 
and 29-1 to table the $75 million sale of the Royals to a group 
headed by Miles Prentice. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Oakland and the Chicago Cubs voted against the motion to  
table to the A's sale. The Royals were the only vote against 
tabling their deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Piccinini's agreement to buy the team from Steve Schott and Ken  
Hofmann expires if it doesn't close by Monday, and his group seemed 
stunned. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I'm concerned, we're out of it,'' Piccinini said.  
``Unless the present owners put an extension on it, we're dead 
meat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prentice, a New York investor, agreed last Nov. 13 to buy the  
Royals from a trust that acquired the franchise following the death 
of founder Ewing Kauffman in 1993. Since spring, management 
officials have said they were concerned his bid had too many people 
and not enough money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hopeful we would be approved,'' Prentice said. ``We were  
not rejected. They did not turn us down. That's the important 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig said no action would be taken on the A's and Royals until  
after the owners' economic study committee, appointed last January, 
makes its report. He said the sales weren't approved because he 
wasn't convinced the deals would ensure the survival of the 
franchises in their cities for ``a couple of generations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, baseball's economics are unlikely to change until after  
the 2001 season at the earliest, when the sport's labor agreement 
with players probably will expire. The economic study committee 
does not include the players association, which is expected to 
reject its findings. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed sale of the Montreal Expos from Claude Brochu's  
group to a group headed by New York art dealer Jeffrey Loria also 
wasn't considered. The team and the commissioner's office agreed 
Friday not to put it to a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal's situation is tied to a new ballpark.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everything has to be signed, sealed and delivered,'' Brochu  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	While a group in northern Virginia has been interested in buying  
the Expos, Selig has said his first choice is to keep the team in 
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This saga is looking like `Gone with the Wind,' except we  
don't have Scarlett O'Hara or Rhett Butler to play in it,'' Selig 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Anaheim Angels said reports of their possible  
sale were exaggerated, and no deal was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners originally intended to meet for two days, but cut it  
short, concerned about getting home with Hurricane Floyd heading 
north.

<HEADLINE> Former U.S. POWs Want Out of Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The American soldiers, hearts pounding, hands  
behind heads, dropped to their knees. The Serb captors placed guns 
to the back of the prisoners' heads. Staff Sgt. Christopher Stone 
wondered if he would be executed. Spc. Steven M. Gonzales thought, 
``Am I going to see one of my friends get shot in the head?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the ensuing week, the POWs, hooded, handcuffed and legs  
bound, endured beatings, interrogations and death threats as NATO's 
air war against Yugoslavia raged overhead. After 32 days of 
isolation, they were released in May and welcomed home as heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	The experience changed their priorities, turning soldiers who  
recently had re-enlisted into men intent on quitting the Army, 
getting a college education and rebuilding their lives, they said 
in an interview this week with The Associated Press, marking their 
first extensive public comments about their captivity and future 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	But, so far, they're running into red tape. Their resignations  
were cleared through Army command in Europe in July, but Pentagon 
officials have given them no clear answer on whether they will be 
released from service, the soldiers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're kind of in limbo,'' Stone said. ``We're waiting, biding  
our time, as day after day goes by.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm waiting on this decision to know what I can do,'' said  
Gonzales, who has scholarships lined up that would pay his tuition 
at Texas A&AMP;M. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone, Gonzales and a third American soldier who was captured  
with them, Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez, said their division commander 
and other Army officials told them they had their choice of 
assignments when they returned from 30 days leave from their base 
in Germany to visit their families in the United States -- including 
resigning from the active-duty military. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez has been granted a transfer effective Oct. 3 to Fort  
Irwin near Barstow, Calif., where he will finish his last year in 
the Army near family in Los Angeles before planning to go to 
college, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martha Rudd, an Army spokeswoman at the Pentagon, said she could  
not confirm what Army officials told Stone and Gonzales about their 
options. She said such requests for early release are rare and take 
time to make their way through the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Stone said he would like to join the National Guard,  
which has offered him a scholarship in his home state of Michigan 
to attend a state college there. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzales said he, too, would like to continue to serve part-time  
in the military, joining the guard or reserves in his home state of 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Stone, 25, and Gonzales, 22, had re-enlisted for several  
years shortly before they were abducted March 31 near the 
Macedonian border, where they were on lightly armed patrol in a 
Humvee vehicle. The soldiers were released May 2, seven weeks 
before NATO bombings ended, halting a bloody war against ethnic 
Albanians in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a shock,'' said Gonzales.  
</P>
<P>
	The three were ambushed by about 20 Yugoslav soldiers who fired  
about 50 rounds at their Humvee. Outgunned, with their engine 
smoking and believing their gunner had been shot, the American 
soldiers showed their hands and slowly emerged from their vehicle, 
thinking perhaps friendly Macedonians had mistakenly fired upon 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	They were knocked to the ground by their Serb captors and kicked  
in the head and body. Stone got a broken nose and Ramirez two 
broken ribs. All three suffered broken or chipped teeth and 
abrasions on their heads and wrists. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez's abrasions on his wrists from the handcuffs were so  
deep that deep red marks from the cuts are still visible. 
</P>
<P>
	They were given little food and water and allowed to go to the  
bathroom only once a day at first. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez, 24, said he and the others started to hallucinate. ``I  
thought I saw some fellow soldiers. I called out to one.'' Stone 
added, ``You're almost in a daze, in a fog.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a week of beatings, the soldiers were moved to tiny  
solitary confinement cells and treated more humanely. Their hands 
and feet were freed. There was more food and only sporadic 
beatings. 
</P>
<P>
	The three soldiers were interviewed together this week in the  
Washington area, where they were honored with an award from a 
veterans' group and met with Energy Secretary Bill Richardson and 
Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone and Gonzales notified the 1st Infantry Division of their  
decisions to quit the service in June and their requests to leave 
the Army were approved in July by Maj. Gen. David L. Grange, the 
division commander. They also were approved by Gen. Montgomery 
Meigs in Europe, according to the soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	By the last week of July, the papers reached the Pentagon.  
</P>
<P>
	The soldiers said they talked briefly to Army Secretary Louis  
Caldera on Sunday and to Sgt. Major Robert Hall on Monday, and both 
said the requests were pending but did not say whether they would 
be granted. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, who traveled to Yugoslavia to  
gain the soldiers' freedom, said the Pentagon should honor 
commitments officials made to the soldiers. ``They are heroes,'' he 
said. ``When soldiers are prisoners of war, it is standard 
operating procedure to allow them to make a transition. That should 
be honored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rudd, the Army spokeswoman, said early leave was granted in  
special circumstances but there were no specific categories of 
circumstances, such as being a former POW, that would make approval 
nearly automatic. 
</P>
<P>
	Grange was unavailable for comment since he had recently left  
his post in anticipation of retiring, Army public affairs in Europe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a prominent case in 1995, Air Force Capt. Scott O'Grady was  
shot down over Bosnia and was forced to hide about a week in the 
Bosnian countryside near hostile forces, eating ants and bugs, 
until he was rescued. 
</P>
<P>
	Within three months of his rescue, O'Grady was allowed to leave  
Aviano Air Base in Italy for a part-time reserve position with the 
419th Fighter Wing in Utah.

<HEADLINE>  Carolinas Survive Floyd Rendezvous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- After bracing for the worst, the  
Carolinas emerged soggy but largely unscathed Thursday from their 
head-on encounter with Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm dumped more than a foot of rain in many areas along  
the North and South Carolina coasts, flooding basements and roads. 
More than 1 million people in the two states lost power, and nearly 
80,000 spent Wednesday night in shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	But with its winds reduced to just 110 mph from their ferocious  
peak of 155 mph, Floyd caused relatively little damage to buildings 
after coming ashore near Cape Fear, N.C., before dawn. There was 
nowhere near the devastation inflicted by Hurricane Hugo on South 
Carolina 10 years ago or by Hurricane Fran on North Carolina in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're most fortunate,'' said George Lemons, a National Weather  
Service forecaster in Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Flooding was the biggest problem, making highways impassable in  
several counties. U.S. 70, the chief link between Raleigh and the 
middle coast, was closed east of Goldsboro. The city of Wilmington 
got 13 inches of rain that flooded streets and low-lying areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael McGowan, owner of a beachfront seafood restaurant 12  
miles from Wilmington, decided to ride out the storm after Floyd 
was downgraded steadily from Category 4 -- the second most severe 
rating. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw it went down to a Category 2 -- then it just becomes a  
big pain, a big rainstorm,'' he said. ``We've been here before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGowan and five friends dined on seafood during the storm, then  
ventured out with a video camera. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like `The Blair Witch Project,''' he said. ``It was  
pretty crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A big oak tree crashed down outside Al Bech's two-story colonial  
home in Wilmington, but he was in good spirits. ``I think we got 
along pretty good,'' he said. ``I have only six or seven shutters 
off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, Gov. Jim Hodges lifted evacuation orders for  
the coast by mid-morning. Seeking to avoid the traffic backups that 
plagued the evacuation, Hodges said he would make Interstate 26 a 
one-way highway back to Charleston so people could return home more 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wrath of Hurricane Floyd did avoid South Carolina in a  
significant measure,'' Hodges said. ``We're all blessed with 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 16 inches of rain fell around the coastal resort of Myrtle  
Beach, leaving up to 3 feet of water on U.S. 501 heading into the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have widespread flooding -- not only in areas that have  
historically flooded, but in areas that I've never seen flood in 15 
years,'' said Bill Stephens, the Myrtle Beach emergency operations 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Barrett had to wade through three feet of water to get out  
of his condominium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was nothing, nothing, just a little bit of rain,'' he said.

historically flooded, but in areas that I've never seen flood in 15

<HEADLINE>  Schott Reign Ends in Cincinnati </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- On a day of historic change, baseball  
got rid of its highest-profile woman and lost its highest-ranking 
black official. 
</P>
<P>
	Marge Schott's rocky 15-year reign as owner of the Cincinnati  
Reds ended Wednesday when baseball approved the $67 million sale of 
her controlling interest to her limited partners. 
</P>
<P>
	National League president Len Coleman, the top minority official  
in the game, announced his resignation immediately after owners 
voted to merge the administrative operations of the American and 
National leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	And in developments that caused disappointment and anger, owners  
put off the proposed sales of the Kansas City Royals and Oakland 
Athletics, citing the uncertain futures of baseball's small-market 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott, who repeatedly has infuriated baseball with inflammatory  
statements about minorities and women, will be replaced as the 
Reds' controlling owner by Carl Lindner, who owns the Great 
American Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, in which 36.7 percent of the team's shares change  
hands, values the franchise at $181.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott couldn't be reached for comment, and Lindner, who  
attended the meeting, referred comment to John Allen, the team's 
managing executive since Schott agreed in June 1996 to give up 
day-to-day control of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the end of a historic chapter in our organization,''  
Allen said. ``It's the start of the next chapter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owners also unanimously approved a resolution calling on their  
lawyers to redraft the Major League Agreement, which governs 
baseball, to merge the AL and NL in all areas but on the field, 
where the leagues and divisions will remain unchanged for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, saying his job would become irrelevant with the change,  
was the lone dissenting vote in the baseball's executive council, 
then said he will quit after the World Series and will become a 
senior adviser to commissioner Bud Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	``The role of league president has become like a Studebaker -- a  
good ride while it lasted,'' Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	AL president Gene Budig, who did not attend Selig's news  
conference, was offered the job of senior vice president under 
Selig in charge of educational and government affairs. There was no 
word if he would accept it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baseball took a very historical step that it had to do,''  
Selig said. ``It is imperative that we conduct ourselves as a 
single entity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the NL began in 1876 and the AL in 1900, each league ran  
its own affairs. But the commissioner's office, founded in 1920, 
has taken an increasing active role, especially since 1984, when 
Peter Ueberroth had the leagues move into the same building. 
</P>
<P>
	Interleague play, which began in 1997, provided further impetus.  
Under the change, umpires, scheduling and player discipline will 
switch to the commissioner's office, subject to collective 
bargaining with players and umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, the system was an anachronism,'' Selig said.  
</P>
<P>
	The owners voted 28-2 to table the $122.4 million sale of the  
A's to a group headed by Save Mart Foods chairman Bob Piccinini, 
and 29-1 to table the $75 million sale of the Royals to a group 
headed by Miles Prentice. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Oakland and the Chicago Cubs voted against the motion to  
table to the A's sale. The Royals were the only vote against 
tabling their deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Piccinini's agreement to buy the team from Steve Schott and Ken  
Hofmann expires if it doesn't close by Monday, and his group seemed 
stunned. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I'm concerned, we're out of it,'' Piccinini said.  
``Unless the present owners put an extension on it, we're dead 
meat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prentice, a New York investor, agreed last Nov. 13 to buy the  
Royals from a trust that acquired the franchise following the death 
of founder Ewing Kauffman in 1993. Since spring, management 
officials have said they were concerned his bid had too many people 
and not enough money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hopeful we would be approved,'' Prentice said. ``We were  
not rejected. They did not turn us down. That's the important 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig said no action would be taken on the A's and Royals until  
after the owners' economic study committee, appointed last January, 
makes its report. He said the sales weren't approved because he 
wasn't convinced the deals would ensure the survival of the 
franchises in their cities for ``a couple of generations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, baseball's economics are unlikely to change until after  
the 2001 season at the earliest, when the sport's labor agreement 
with players probably will expire. The economic study committee 
does not include the players association, which is expected to 
reject its findings. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed sale of the Montreal Expos from Claude Brochu's  
group to a group headed by New York art dealer Jeffrey Loria also 
wasn't considered. The team and the commissioner's office agreed 
Friday not to put it to a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal's situation is tied to a new ballpark.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everything has to be signed, sealed and delivered,'' Brochu  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	While a group in northern Virginia has been interested in buying  
the Expos, Selig has said his first choice is to keep the team in 
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This saga is looking like `Gone with the Wind,' except we  
don't have Scarlett O'Hara or Rhett Butler to play in it,'' Selig 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Anaheim Angels said reports of their possible  
sale were exaggerated, and no deal was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners originally intended to meet for two days, but cut it  
short, concerned about getting home with Hurricane Floyd heading 
north.

<HEADLINE> Chargers Coach To Make NFL Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Mike Riley seems almost too good to be true.  
</P>
<P>
	The new coach of the San Diego Chargers does things others in  
the NFL won't: he values his players' opinions, lets his star 
linebacker make cameo appearances at tight end and is friendly to 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	He's the anti-Kevin Gilbride.  
</P>
<P>
	And to listen to the players, Riley is precisely the coach  
needed by this floundering franchise, which has lost 31 games in 
three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he has done in a short amount of time is gain the respect  
of men in this locker room, and we haven't even played a game 
yet,'' said Junior Seau, the All-Pro linebacker/part-time tight 
end. 
</P>
<P>
	That first game comes Sunday when the Chargers, idle on opening  
weekend, visit Cincinnati. It's also the NFL debut for Riley, 46, 
who helped lead Oregon State -- once described as ``a coach's 
graveyard'' -- back toward respectability before becoming San 
Diego's fourth head coach in as many seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley's temperament certainly matches the city he works in.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's the first coach I've ever had that has been laid-back and  
relaxed,'' running back Terrell Fletcher said. ``Don't mistake it 
that he doesn't have a fiery edge, that he doesn't have a 
competitive edge, because he does. It's just an extremely unique 
blend, particularly in this business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, the guys, we're giving all we have for him. We'll  
lay out in front of trucks for him if we have to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, maybe they all won't go that far.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd chase the truck for him, maybe run into it for him,''  
linebacker Lew Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's exactly what the NFL needs,'' Bush said. ``We all  
know that the bottom line is winning, all right? You get a guy in 
here sometimes who gets so serious and so caught up in, `Win, win 
win, drill, drill, drill,' that you lose the fun in it. And he's 
brought the fun back to the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley's personality and open-minded approach is opposite that of  
the stubborn, dictatorial Gilbride, who lost the players' 
confidence and was fired after six games last year, with a record 
of 6-16. 
</P>
<P>
	The players appreciate that the yelling and belittling have gone  
away, that there's less hitting in practice and that Riley lets the 
assistants do more coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still work hard,'' Bush said. ``When Sunday comes, I'm not  
going to forget how to hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's Riley's reputation as a truly nice guy.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you go to heaven and you look around and Mike Riley isn't  
there, you'll know you're not in heaven,'' said John Robinson, 
Riley's former boss at Southern Cal and now coach at UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just not going to have it any other way,'' Riley said of  
his disposition. ``I like coming to work and I like the good 
atmosphere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seau wouldn't even have approached Gilbride about playing tight  
end. Riley was receptive because he felt it could only help a team 
that went 5-11 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If somebody's got an idea, I always tell guys, `Hey, you can  
tell me whatever you want to,' '' Riley said. ``It doesn't mean 
we're always going to do it. If they're thinking about stuff, then 
that's what you want. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really like people to feel ownership in something, and along  
with that I want them to feel great about coming to work. I don't 
want them to dread coming in the gate over there. I didn't want the 
kids at Oregon State to dread coming into the football facility. I 
want them to feel excited about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That Riley was willing to leave his job as USC's offensive  
coordinator to take the Oregon State job for two years says 
something about him. True, he was going home -- his father, Bud, had 
been an assistant coach there, and Riley was a star high school 
quarterback in Corvallis. But the only tradition Oregon State had 
was losing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Beavers were 5-6 last year, their best record in 27 years.  
They came close to upsetting UCLA and did beat rival Oregon, in 
double overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not afraid of any challenge,'' said general manager Bobby  
Beathard, whose son, Jeff, played for Riley when he coached the 
CFL's Winnipeg Blue Bombers. Riley also was head coach of San 
Antonio in the World League for two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	No situation, not even San Diego's, could be as scary as taking  
over at Oregon State, Riley said. Yet that was as rewarding an 
experience as he's ever had. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that football team, when we first got there, was  
proud of where they were or who they were or anything,'' he said. 
``But at the end they were excited to be Beaver football players 
and that made me feel good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If only the same can happen for the Chargers, who don't want  
their nice guy to finish last. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley's approach ``is something special and it's something you  
would want to win for,'' Seau said. ``We just want to make him 
successful here in San Diego.''

<HEADLINE> Exxon-Mobil Merger Could Be Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Exxon's proposed $82 billion purchase of Mobil  
could be delayed beyond the companies' timetable as regulators 
press for more antitrust concessions in the deal that would create 
the world's largest oil company. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies had hoped to complete the merger by the end of  
this month. But people close to the deal say the Federal Trade 
Commission is demanding that the combined company divest more gas 
stations than had been expected, especially in the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are continuing to investigate the merger,'' FTC spokeswoman  
Vicki Streitfeld said Thursday. She would not comment about the 
timing of the review. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies could insist the FTC finish its review by Sept.  
30, but if Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. want to negotiate more 
lenient conditions for the regulators' approval of the deal, they 
could agree to extend the deadline, said sources who spoke only on 
condition of anonymity. The FTC also has the right to go to court 
to stop the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators are worried the combined company would dominate the  
gasoline business in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states, similar 
to a concern that arose in the merger of British Petroleum and 
Amoco, which was completed in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mobil and Exxon compete far more directly than BP and Amoco.  
The idea of more extensive divestiture (required) by the FTC 
certainly comes as no surprise,'' said Peter Gunst, general counsel 
for the Service Station Dealers of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts generally expect regulators to require the merged  
company to shed about 1,000 service stations, but they don't think 
that will derail the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is the financial benefit of the merger is so  
large that relatively modest divestiture of assets isn't going to 
stand in the way of a deal,'' said Michael Mayer, an analyst with 
Schroder &AMP; Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Even combined, Exxon and Mobil do not dominate the oil industry  
the way their parent company, John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil 
Co., did before it was split apart by in 1911. Together they 
control 1 percent of the world's oil reserves and 12 percent of 
U.S. reserves, according to the Energy Information Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of the gas station dealers met with FTC  
officials last week. Roy Littlefield, executive vice president of 
the dealers association, said the regulators asked about requiring 
the sale of all Exxon or Mobil stations in given metropolitan areas 
or larger regions. 
</P>
<P>
	``They talked about `what-ifs,' and that's the `what-if' that  
kept coming up,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon chairman Lee R. Raymond has said he expected federal  
regulators to force the sale of some gas stations where the two 
companies compete head to head, but he said both brands would be 
retained. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies estimate that the combined company, to be called  
Exxon Mobil Corp., would save $2.8 billion a year, a strong motive 
to move the deal along. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Thursday, after The Wall Street Journal reported  
the possibility of a delay, Exxon said it has been meeting for nine 
months with representatives of the FTC and the states in hopes of 
completing the merger review by its target of Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokesman Ed Burwell said the company would not comment  
on the details of those discussions. Mobil said it still expects 
regulatory reviews to be compleyted by around the end of the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of the companies being forced to sell hundreds of  
gas stations has alarmed some dealers in the Northeast whose 
businesses are closely linked to the brand name on their pumps and 
credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Operators who don't already own their stations want the right of  
first refusal to buy them, and they also want the right to band 
together to negotiate with gasoline suppliers -- a move that is 
opposed by regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Northeast service station operators will meet in two weeks and  
are expected to be courted by other oil companies. Littlefield said 
Amerada Hess Corp. and Chevron Corp. have booked hospitality suites 
at the event. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the gas station issue, FTC officials have  
expressed concern about the merger's impact on competition among 
refiners on the Gulf Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the two companies control about 18 percent of the  
refining capacity in the region. As a result, many analysts expect 
the FTC will force the companies to sell one of the Gulf Coast 
refineries. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon operates two refineries in Texas and Louisiana, Mobil  
operates one in Texas and another in Louisiana in a joint venture 
with the Venezuelan state-owned oil company. 
</P>
<P>
	European regulators are also looking at the deal. The European  
Commission is expected to insist that the new company end Mobil's 
refining and marketing joint venture in Europe with BP Amoco PLC 
and reduce its stake in Germany's largest natural gas company. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, Exxon rose  
43 3/4 cents to close at $77.68 3/4 a share, and Mobil shares were up $1 
at $101.12 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Favre Sees 'Dramatic Improvement' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Brett Favre doesn't plan on throwing a  
football with his injured hand until Friday. That doesn't mean his 
streak of 110 consecutive starts will be broken Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre says he will be ready for the game against the Detroit  
Lions because he has seen ``dramatic improvement'' in his hand, 
which has a sprained thumb and a muscle bruise after collisions 
during the preseason and in the Green Bay Packers' 28-24 win over 
the Oakland Raiders last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing with injuries is part of the game,'' he said  
Wednesday. ``More than likely, the remainder of the season it'll 
bother me one way or another. I'm ready for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Favre hit his hand on Russell Maryland's helmet in the third  
quarter of Green Bay's win over Oakland. He recovered to lead two 
fourth-quarter scoring drives, including an 11-play, 82-yard 
masterpiece in the final 1:51 for the winning points. 
</P>
<P>
	He suffered a sprained thumb in the preseason, and that injury  
still lingers along with the bruise and several scrapes on the 
hand, which was black-and-blue on Monday, but now looks almost 
normal. He doesn't expect to have the hand drained of fluid or to 
take a pain-killing shot, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre said that although a week off likely would help the hand  
heal more quickly, he won't miss a game. With seven more starts, he 
will pass Ron Jaworski for the longest starting streak by a 
quarterback in league history. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I took a week off, it probably would feel a lot better, but  
as long as I can keep slinging it and not hurt my team, I feel like 
I can play,'' Favre said. ``They know well enough by now that I'm 
not going to come out unless I absolutely have to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Backup quarterback Matt Hasselbeck threw nine touchdown passes  
during a standout preseason, but he has never taken a snap in a 
regular-season game after spending last season on the Packers' 
practice squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre has added incentive to play when Green Bay visits the  
Silverdome on Sunday. He and the Packers have won in Detroit just 
twice in his seven seasons with the team, including losses the last 
two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've really just got whipped out there,'' he said. ``Simple  
as that. We've made mistakes, they've capitalized on it, and you 
can't do that in someone else's environment.''

<HEADLINE> Floyd Weakens Before Landfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- One of the most fearsome storms of the century was  
a rather ordinary hurricane by the time it blew ashore. 
</P>
<P>
	When Floyd churned toward Florida, it was a monster, 600 miles  
wide with winds of 155 mph -- practically Category 5, the most 
severe. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time it hit the Carolinas early Thursday, however, it was  
down to 110 mph, a smaller, borderline Category 2 that brought 
torrential rain and high surf but not the catastrophic damage many 
had feared. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters say Floyd, in effect, took a deep breath before  
blowing ashore, but they don't why. And they cannot predict such 
weakening with the kind of accuracy with which they can forecast a 
storm's track. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricanes tend to intensify and weaken as they spin over warm  
water, as if they were breathing, said Lixion Avila, hurricane 
specialist at the National Hurricane Center. But scientists don't 
know exactly how atmospheric conditions contribute to these 
fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's our weakest point,'' Avila said. ``We don't know how to  
forecast changes in intensity very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters do know that storms weaken when they pass over  
cooler water or land, and generally strengthen when they are over 
warm water. But they don't fully understand a cyclical process 
``eye wall replacement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In eye wall replacement, the center, or eye, of a storm will  
shrink, causing the storm to intensify, over a matter of hours or 
days. Eventually the eye can shrink so much that it vanishes, and 
then a new, larger eye forms. 
</P>
<P>
	Avila likened the effect to a figure skater in a spin. With her  
arms outstretched, she spins slowly. When she draws her arms closer 
to her body, the revolutions are much faster. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the eye is big, it rotates slower and normally it's  
weaker, but when it's small it spins faster,'' Avila said. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was Category 4 storm when it hit the Bahamas. The storm  
started to weaken after crossing the island chain and heading up 
the Atlantic coast into cooler waters. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said they had no choice in putting up hurricane  
warnings along the East Coast alerting residents either to get out 
or hunker down because the storm was hugging the coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they start seeing some of the video from the Bahamas,  
they'll understand what a Category 4 hurricane would have done to 
their area had it made a direct impact,'' said hurricane specialist 
Ed Rappaport.

<P>
	They have more fame than they want, earned more money than they  
need and have the chance to grow old gracefully. This week, four 
sporting giants decided that wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Barry Sanders and John Daly are back  
in the news. Not to worry. All four are livin' large, but now they 
have one more thing in common with the rest of us: Even they don't 
always get what they want. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, who has one NBA championship left in him, wants to be a  
golfer. Bird, who could be coach-for-life in any NBA town he names, 
has decided three years is all the sitting he can stand. Sanders, 
still in the prime of his NFL career at 31, can't decide whether he 
wants to play until he knows where. And Daly, lost as ever, wants 
someone else to do the hard work of rehabbing for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Reading between the headlines:  
</P>
<P>
	--Winning ``unofficial'' money on the golf course hasn't provided  
Mike with the competitive buzz he had hoped for. So Wednesday he 
teed off in his first pro event, the $150,000 Chicago Open, in 
front of a 100-strong gallery that intimidated him more than the 
howling, bloodthirsty, celebrity-studded crowds at Madison Square 
Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan routinely plays 36 holes a day, six days a week now. But  
his new game looks suspiciously like his old one. He opened with an 
84, improved to 81 on Thursday but still missed the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a major difference between customer golf and  
championship golf. I'm realizing that,'' Jordan said, ``Yet, it's 
still a challenge for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the bottom line?  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't walk away from challenges.''  
</P>
<P>
	Despite spotting golfers in his generation a 15-year head start,  
Jordan really believes he'll catch them all by the time he's 
eligible for the Senior Tour. He turned 36 in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's first stab at a second career was unsatisfying enough  
to drive him back into the NBA. And remember, baseball hardly 
embarrassed him. Jordan left after a season in Double-A, batting 
.202 with 51 RBIs and 30 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Golf, though, will prove even tougher, and if he doesn't get  
better soon, expect Jordan back in a Bulls uniform before his 40th 
birthday. Of course, there's still tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	--Bird let his career plans slip while promoting a book, so he  
can't be that overworked. But most guys with a three-year contract 
who succeed like he did want to talk extension. Not Bird. He wants 
out, just like the deal says. 
</P>
<P>
	``That will be more than enough for me,'' he said, refusing to  
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird never liked the bench as a player. He apparently doesn't  
like it much better as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Most people consider reaching back-to-back Eastern Conference  
finals an unqualified achievement. Not Bird. He's either positive 
he can win it all this time or else, like Magic Johnson, he's 
discovered having great players is what makes a coach great -- not 
the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
	--Pity poor Barry. Sanders has got control problems, but they're  
of his own making. 
</P>
<P>
	After 10 years of honorable service, he walked away from a few  
million, a chance to become the NFL's all-time rusher and set off 
for Europe to find himself instead. 
</P>
<P>
	It's hard to tell exactly what he's looking for, since Sanders  
speaks only to a trusted few while everybody else around him is 
only too willing to talk. His father, his agent and the skycap at 
whatever airport Sanders is passing through any given week have all 
taken turns being interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	Agent David Ware answered the Lions' demand to return a chunk of  
Sanders' signing bonus with demands of his own. Not only won't 
Sanders play for Detroit again, he won't enter the Hall of Fame as 
a Lion or even acknowledge the team at his induction ceremony if it 
doesn't trade or release him. 
</P>
<P>
	Then -- and only then -- will Sanders decide if he wants to come  
back and play for a much better team. (Prediction: yes, yes, a 
thousand times, yes). 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders may be a sweetheart. And he may be anguishing over the  
call. But the whole episode looks suspiciously like good, 
old-fashioned extortion dressed up as a midlife crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	--Daly's change of circumstances -- he fell off the wagon again --  
is the only tragedy in the group. And not because he's squandering 
great talent and an ability to connect with galleries like few of 
his flat-bellied brethren can. 
</P>
<P>
	No. This is tragic because Daly stands to lose his life -- or  
what's left of it. Ely Callaway, the 80-year-old chairman of the 
equipment company that bears his name, went out of his way 
repeatedly to accommodate John and his lapses. But even he's 
bailing out. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly's shape has always provided a window into his soul and  
right now he's bloated. 
</P>
<P>
	Callaway threw him one final life preserver -- visit a national  
expert on addictions or lose the company's sponsorship -- and Daly 
wouldn't put it on. 
</P>
<P>
	He apparently reached the front door of the clinic before  
turning around. A source told The Associated Press that Daly 
figured inpatient treatment wouldn't be any different ``the third 
time around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sad thing is he might be right.  
</P>

	NEW YORK (AP) -- News and notes from around the Thoroughbred  
racing world, compiled by NTRA Communications (All time EDT):

<P>
          *KEENELAND SEPTEMBER SALE CONTINUES TO TOPPLE RECORDS   	
</P>
<P>
	The third day of Keeneland's marathon September Yearling Sale  
continued to show notable increases in all categories. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeneland reported 284 horses sold Wednesday for a gross of  
$27,996,500. The session's average price of $98,579 represented a 
42.1 percent increase over the $69,380 average for 271 horses that 
sold for a total of $18,802,000 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's median of $67,500 was up 32.4 percent over the  
$51,000 figure of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeneland officials noted that a total of 755 yearlings were  
reported sold to date for a gross of $148,885,500, breaking last 
year's three-day total of $108,818,000. The average price of 
$197,199 was up 43.9 percent over last year's average of $1 7,050 
for 794 yearlings. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-day median price of $110,000 represented a 26.4  
percent increase over the $87,000 median in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
                *TVG HAS SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH IN LOUISVILLE   	
</P>
<P>
	The Television Games Network had a successful launch Wednesday  
in Louisville, Ky., the city that served as the test region for the 
national television-wagering system four years ago, when the 
network operated under the name ODS. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Louisville Courier-Journal, that city is the  
only one in which wagers are being taken by TVG, which plans to 
expand betting first throughout Kentucky and then into Oregon and 
Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	TVG has about 1,700 account-holders in Louisville. All cable  
customers in Louisville can view the network's races. 
</P>
<P>
          *LEADING KEENELAND CONSIGNORS PLEDGE SUPPORT OF NTRA   	
</P>
<P>
	Eaton Sales, Taylor Made Sales Agency and Three Chimneys Farm  
announced they will contribute one-tenth of one-percent of all 
sales proceeds in 1999 beginning with the current Keeneland 
September Yearling Sale to the NTRA. 
</P>
<P>
	They cited their belief that the success of the National  
Thoroughbred Racing Association (NTRA) is critical to the 
Thoroughbred industry's future as the reason for their 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	These contributions, estimated to exceed $100,000, will be in  
addition to those made by their clients, as well as other buyers 
and sellers. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by the three, currently among the leading  
consignors to Keeneland's 11-day sale, was made following a 
presentation by officials from the NTRA, outlining the 
organization's programs. 
</P>
<P>
	NTRA representatives encouraged sellers and buyers to contribute  
a percentage of the purchase price of sale horses. 
</P>
<P>
      *BENEFIT LUNCHEON FOR INJURED JOCKEY TO FEATURE PEDRO MARTINEZ   	
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Red Sox and Sports Radio WEEI have joined forces to  
hold a fundraising event, ``Lunch with Pedro,'' featuring Red Sox 
pitcher Pedro Martinez, to benefit the Rudy Baez Assistance Fund, 
on Friday, Sept. 17 at the Park View Lounge in the 600 Club at 
Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Baez, 49, is a longtime New England-based jockey who was  
paralyzed from the chest down in a spill at Rockingham Park, Salem, 
N.H., in August. Both Baez and Martinez are natives of the 
Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	During the luncheon, guests will have their photo taken with  
Martinez, who will be joined by his brother, fellow Red Sox pitcher 
Ramon Martinez. Baez, currently a patient at the Kessler Institute 
for Rehabilitation in West Orange, N.J., will participate in the 
event via a live call-in to WEEI. 
</P>
<P>
	Home run leader Sammy Sosa has recorded a special inspirational  
message in Spanish for Baez, which will be played over WEEI Radio. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1,000 per plate tickets, which were limited to 50, has been  
sold out. All proceeds from the event will go to the Rudy Baez 
Assistance Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Donations can be sent to the Fund in care of Eastern Bank,  
Attention Rachel Sosnowski, 125 Washington St., Box 309, Salem, 
Mass. 01970. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rudy Baez has touched the lives of so many people through the  
years at Suffolk Downs and Rockingham Park,'' said event organizer 
Eddie Andelman of WEEI. ``Pedro Martinez and the Red Sox wanted to 
get involved, especially considering Pedro's connection with the 
Dominican Republic. This is our way to give back to Rudy who gave 
so much to the Boston sports scene and needs the financial support 
to help his family.''

                         *RACING TO HISTORY   	
</P>
<P>
	Sept. 17, 1973 -- Penny Chenery announced that Secretariat would  
make his inaugural start on the turf in the Oct. 8 Man o' War 
Stakes at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Sept. 18, 1920 -- Carrying the top weight of his career, 138  
pounds, 3-year-old Man o' War won the Potomac Handicap, conceding 
24 pounds to his nearest rival, Paul Jones, and 30 pounds to the 
second-place finisher, Wildair. 
</P>
<P>
	Sept. 18, 1943 -- The U.S. Army occupied the grounds of Hollywood  
Park as part of the war effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Sept. 19, 1943 -- Rider Eddie Arcaro returned to racing after a  
12-month suspension that resulted from his attempt to injure a 
fellow rider in the Cowdin Stakes the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sept. 19, 1942 -- Alsab, runner-up in the 1942 Kentucky Derby,  
beat 3-10 favorite Whirlaway, the 1941 Triple Crown champion, by a 
nose in a $25,000 match race at Narragansett Park. The match was 
arranged after Alsab was scratched from the Narragansett Special, a 
race won by Whirlaway one week earlier. Narragansett's president, 
James Dooley, offered to contribute the track's share of the mutuel 
handle, plus breakage, to the Army and Navy Relief Funds, making 
attendance at the race a patriotic gesture. Alsab and Whirlaway met 
twice more that year, with Whirlaway winning the Jockey Club Gold 
Cup on Oct. 3, and Alsab besting him in the New York Handicap on 
Oct. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Sept. 20, 1965 -- Jockey Jorge Velasquez made his American racing  
debut, riding for owner Fred W. Hooper, at Atlantic City 
Racecourse. He won with his first mount, aboard Keypoint, in the 
sixth race, at 8-1 odds. 
</P>
<P>
	Sept. 20,1976 -- Two-year-old Seattle Slew made his racing debut,  
winning a six furlong maiden race by five lengths at Belmont Park. 
His zesty workouts prior to the race made Seattle Slew the 2-1 
favorite and he was the public's choice in both his subsequent 
races that year. After only three starts (including the Champagne 
Stakes) in the space of 27 days, Seattle Slew was voted champion 
two-year-old colt for 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	Sept. 20, 1980 -- Before a crowd of 23,000 spectators, 4-year-old  
Spectacular Bid won the Woodward Stakes in the world's richest 
walkover. To the surprise of trainer Bud Delp and owners Harry, 
Teresa and Tom Meyerhoff, ``Bid'' was awarded only $73 ,300, which 
was half of the winner's share of the purse, but all that was 
allowable under the track's rules. There had not been a walkover in 
a major U.S. stakes race since Coaltown won the Edward Burke 
Handicap on April 23, 1949. 
</P>
<P>
	Sept. 21, 1938 -- A hurricane disrupted racing at Rockingham  
Park, which ended the day's program after the sixth race. Thirteen 
barns were destroyed during the storm.

course, going a half-mile in :48 3-5 at Belmont Park.

died at age 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Sept. 22, 1996 -- Larry Ross trained the top four finishers in a  
seven-horse field for the Washington HBPA Stakes at Emerald Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sept. 24, 1943 -- The Jockey Club announced the creation of The  
Jockey Club Foundation, which was established to aid indigent 
members of the racing community. 
</P>
<P>
	Sept. 25, 1866 -- Jerome Park, named for its founder, Leonard W.  
Jerome, opened in the Bronx, N.Y. The track was a magnet for New 
York's fashionable society, and the first to attract women in large 
numbers. Even the racehorses were fashionable, wit h ribbons of 
their owners' colors braided into their manes and tails. Jerome, 
seeking to emulate the British racing system, also established the 
American Jockey Club, precursor to the present Jockey Club, formed 
in 1894. 
</P>
<P>
	Sept. 25, 1948 -- Fans at Atlantic City Racecourse filed onto the  
track after the 3-2 favorite in the fourth race, Even Break, dwelt 
in the starting gate as the race went off. A total of $71,414 was 
refunded to the angry crowd of bettors. 
</P>
<P>
	Sept. 26, 1942 -- The Jockey Club stewards revoked Eddie Arcaro's  
license for one year after his display of ``rough riding'' aboard 
odds-on favorite Occupation in the Cowdin Stakes on Sept. 19. In 
the Cowdin, Arcaro deliberately drove his horse into another, 
Breezing Home, knocking his jockey, Vincent Nodarse, into the 
infield. Nodarse and his mount had crowded Arcaro at the start of 
the race, almost causing him to be unseated. 
</P>
<P>
	Sept. 27, 1894 -- Aqueduct Racetrack opened its doors. The  
building was torn down in 1955 and the new Aqueduct was reopened on 
Sept. 14, 1959. 
</P>
<P>
	Sept. 27, 1924 -- In the second his three specially staged  
International races, the French colt Epinard was again defeated, 
this time by a nose to Ladkin, at Aqueduct. A crowd of 40,000 
witnessed the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Sept. 27, 1947 -- Armed, then the world's leading money-winning  
Thoroughbred, met 1946 Kentucky Derby winner Assault in the first 
$100,000 winner-take-all match race, held at Belmont Park. Armed 
earned an easy victory over Assault, who was not in peak racing 
condition.

<HEADLINE> White House Admits Improper Lobbying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House conceded Thursday that federal  
regulators improperly tried to drum up support among bankers for 
the Clinton administration's opposition to Republican financial 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort was attributed to a miscommunication and White House  
officials insisted that they never intended for the regulators -- 
who are supposed to remain isolated from partisan wrangling -- to 
work on behalf of administration policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something we take seriously. It's incumbent on us to  
be clear and we take responsibility for that,'' said White House 
press secretary Joe Lockhart, who added that it was also the 
responsibility of the regulators to recognize limits on their 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there was nothing here intended,'' he said. ``There was no  
effort here from the policymakers at the White House to direct any 
regulators to do anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conflict originated after an interagency meeting at the  
White House to discuss implementation of the Community Reinvestment 
Act, which Senate Republicans had sought to kill as part of a bill 
overhauling banking regulations. President Clinton is a strong 
supporter of the CRA, which steers investment to impoverished 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the meeting, there were instructions sent to the  
Treasury Department about how to generate support for the CRA. And 
those instructions were mistakenly communicated to regulators at 
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there was one, you know, particular communication with  
Treasury that it's my best guess was misinterpreted at OCC and 
inappropriate contacts were made,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	In defense of the OCC workers, Lockhart said that anyone who was  
at the meeting or received a summary of the meeting could have 
``read that we were looking for them'' to defend the CRA. ``But 
that was not our intent,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Won't Turn Over FALN Files </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rebuffing a congressional inquiry, President  
Clinton invoked executive privilege Thursday and refused to turn 
over documents on his decision to offer clemency to members of a 
Puerto Rican separatist group. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fourth time the Clinton White House has used  
executive privilege to refuse a request from Congress. Clinton also 
invoked the privilege during independent counsel investigations 
into the Monica Lewinsky affair and former Agriculture Secretary 
Mike Espy. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics, including some in Congress, have accused Clinton of  
making the clemency offer to help first lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton's budding Senate campaign. Mrs. Clinton opposed the deal 
after it began to draw criticism and then was herself criticized by 
some prominent Puerto Ricans in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people have a right to know why President Clinton  
opened the prison gates and granted freedom to terrorists,'' said 
Rep. Vito Fossella, R-N.Y. ``If the president genuinely believes 
his clemency deal was justified, I find it curious that he would 
choose to stonewall Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said partisan politics  
was behind the congressional subpoenas for the documents, adding 
that Clinton was standing by his constitutional ``right to get 
confidential advice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That said, Lockhart stated ``absolutely and unequivocally'' that  
``the politics of New York or anywhere did not come into play'' in 
the clemency decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Kennedy, spokesman for the White House counsel, said the  
administration was providing some 10,000 pages of documents related 
to the decision, including thousands of letters exhorting the 
president to show leniency toward the prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	``But those that are directly related to the exercise of the  
president's constitutional authority are not being provided,'' 
Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House also rebuffed the committee's request to have  
the new White House chief counsel, Beth Nolan, testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House Government Reform  
Committee, was informed of the decision in a letter from White 
House Deputy Counsel Cheryl Mills. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has a moral obligation to the American people to  
explain why he let terrorists out of prison,'' Burton said. ``By 
claiming executive privilege he is, in essence, telling the 
American people that it's none of their business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Committee officials have threatened to seek contempt charges if  
they are not satisfied with the administration's response to 
congressional subpoenas. But in a six-page letter to Clinton, 
Attorney General Janet Reno argued that Clinton was on strong legal 
ground.

<P>
	``The White House staff and the Department of Justice act as  
confidential advisers to the president as part of the clemency 
review process, and executive privilege has long been understood to 
protect confidential advice generated during that process,'' Reno 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The FALN, Spanish initials for the Armed Forces of National  
Liberation, has been responsible for at least 130 bombings, but the 
White House said that none of the 16 members to whom Clinton 
extended clemency was involved in acts that caused death or injury. 
Fourteen of the FALN members accepted the offer, agreeing to 
renounce violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican who chairs the Senate  
Judiciary Committee, said he would present a subpoena for the 
documents at a committee meeting next Thursday. ``The issue is 
whether or not we're going to let the committee be stiffed,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., a Judiciary Committee member who  
had urged Mrs. Clinton to seek the New York Senate seat, lashed out 
at the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I regret greatly the actions of President Clinton,''  
Torricelli said. ``I hope the committee will learn more about his 
motivations and the process so that it's never repeated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In San Juan, Fernando Martin, vice president of Puerto Rico's  
Independence Party, called the congressional hearings into clemency 
nothing but ``party politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton extended the offer after a lengthy review by the former  
White House chief counsel, Charles F.C. Ruff. Prominent human 
rights advocates, including South African Anglican Archbishop 
Desmond Tutu and former President Carter backed the move. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is strong sentiment against Clinton's decision among  
law enforcement officials, who have characterized FALN members as 
terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton asserted executive privilege three times in 1996 -- when  
Congress demanded documents related to the White House travel 
office firings, a joint FBI-Drug Enforcement Agency memo to Clinton 
on drug enforcement, and foreign-policy documents on the 
administration's Haiti policy. Separately, the White House has 
asserted executive privilege in litigation and the independent 
counsel investigations.

<HEADLINE>  Floyd Charges Carolina Shore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd roared ashore today near  
Cape Fear with 110 mph wind, flooding the Carolina coasts with more 
than a foot of rain as tens of thousands of people huddled in 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	The eye of the huge storm hit the mainland at about 3 a.m.,  
preceded by hours of violent weather that included several 
tornadoes. Floyd then weakened rapidly as it headed across the 
southeastern corner of Virginia on its way back to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 1.3 million utility customers in the Carolinas and Virginia  
lost power, and 125,000 still had no power today in Florida. 
Flooding and power failures combined to shut down Portsmouth, Va.'s 
water supply system, which serves 110,000 customers. 
</P>
<P>
	At least seven deaths were blamed on Floyd.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been in nothing like this before,'' said Norma  
Childers, 62, a retired Rustburg, Va., nurse who came to North 
Carolina on vacation and was in a Wilmington motel when it lost 
power this morning. ``I'm getting too much fuss from my children. 
They're at home. They think that's where I'm supposed to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m., the storm was at the coast near Virginia Beach, Va.,  
and moving north-northeast at about 24 mph. After Floyd hit land, 
the top sustained wind around its center slowed to near 80 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The next targets after Virginia were expected to be the coasts  
of Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey, then New York's Long Island 
early Friday. Disaster preparations were under way in New York 
City, Massachusetts' Cape Cod and along the coast of Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane warnings were posted as far north as Plymouth, Mass.  
Public schools were closed in Washington, D.C., all of New Jersey, 
Philadelphia and New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities had urged more than 2.6 million people along the  
southern Atlantic coast to clear out of Floyd's path -- the biggest 
evacuation in U.S. history -- and more people were urged to evacuate 
today in parts of Virginia, Maryland and Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther south, however, evacuation orders were lifted today for  
all of the South Carolina coast, and thousands of evacuees crowded 
Georgia highways as they headed home. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Wilmington area, a runaway sailboat had jammed the  
drawbridge linking the city to Wrightsville Beach and cutting off 
the only link to the barrier island, and a church steeple was 
toppled in Beaufort. 
</P>
<P>
	In Duplin County, a hog farm waste lagoon ruptured and spilled  
about 2 million gallons of waste, threatening to pollute a creek 
state environmental officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Six twisters damaged homes and churches, but no injuries were  
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an exciting night,'' Calvin McGowan said today as he as  
he checked his 34-foot fishing boat, the Monitor. In 1996, 
Hurricane Fran threw the boat several hundred yards into a 
neighbor's yard. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the heavy rain appeared to have caused more problems  
than the wind. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got the worst flooding we've ever had in a storm,''  
North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt said today. 
</P>
<P>
	By midmorning, the rain stopped near Wilmington. There were  
still brisk gusts, and black clouds floated quickly overhead, but 
the sun already was poking through. 
</P>
<P>
	Areas of the North Carolina coast and the Myrtle Beach area of  
South Carolina had gotten up to 16 inches of rain, and a foot had 
fallen on Virginia's Tidewater region. Wilmington got 13 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the deaths were in North Carolina, and one storm-related  
death was reported in South Carolina and one in Virginia. In 
addition, one person was presumed dead in the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	Road flooding stalled cars and some motorists had to be rescued.  
In Virginia's Southampton County, a state trooper had to abandon 
her patrol car and swim to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	While the storm delivered only a glancing blow to Florida on  
Wednesday, it had enough power to destroy about 100 feet of the 
century-old Daytona Beach pier and shear off the end of piers at 
Jacksonville Beach and Flagler Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	About 350 miles off the coast, the Navy and Coast Guard rescued  
eight people Wednesday after their tugboat sank in 30-foot seas. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of airline flights had been canceled. Amtrak suspended  
all train service south of Washington and didn't expected to 
restore service until Friday at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges banned price gouging on essential  
items, threatening fines up to $100 or 30 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time South Carolina took a direct hit from a major  
hurricane was almost exactly 10 years ago, when Hugo struck near 
Charleston with 135 mph wind. The storm killed 29 people and caused 
$5.9 billion in damage, the most costly hurricane to hit the U.S. 
mainland until Hurricane Andrew hit Florida in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Thanks FEMA With Few Words </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton sipped water and nodded a  
lot Thursday, as he listened to hurricane damage reports from 
Cabinet secretaries, agency heads and governors in hard-hit states. 
But Clinton, a famously voluble politician, said unusually little 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The president severely strained his voice sometime during  
Wednesday's approximately 20-hour trip home from economic meetings 
in New Zealand -- apparently in part due to marathon phone calls 
from Air Force One to governors and federal officials dealing with 
Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton apologized for his hoarse, thin voice but did get  
through a brief address thanking Federal Emergency Management 
Agency officials and employees and praising new forecasting 
technology that Clinton said allowed early warning and evacuations 
ahead of Floyd's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can all be grateful to God that this storm turned away and  
didn't hurt us as bad as we feared,'' Clinton said during a visit 
to FEMA headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also chuckled admiringly as North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt  
made a bald pitch for more federal money to clean up from the storm 
that hit early Thursday. Hunt and the governors of South Carolina 
and Virginia spoke to Clinton via a video hookup. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton complied, declaring a major disaster in North Carolina  
and an emergency in Virginia, and releasing $528 million for 
hurricane relief. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton's  
hoarseness will probably force a postponement of his promised veto 
of the Republican-passed $792 billion tax cut until next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will spend Friday ``not talking,'' Lockhart said.  
</P>
<P>
	``When we gave him his schedule for today, he reminded us that  
the only cure for getting his voice back was not speaking, and we 
weren't helping today. So we're going to try to help tomorrow,'' 
Lockhart said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John  
McCain, R-Ariz., who has kept a close eye on scandals in the 
Olympics, has planned hearings for Oct. 20 on setting up 
independent drug testing for elite athletes, committee spokeswoman 
Pia Pialorsi said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearings will focus on the debate over whether drug-testing  
athletes should be performed by a private entity, rather than staff 
working for the International Olympic Committee or the U.S. Olympic 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, Olympic athletes are prohibited from using many  
substances, including stimulants, narcotics, anabolic agents and 
diuretics.

<HEADLINE> Mo. Lawmakers Ban Certain Abortions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The state's largest abortion provider  
has put its procedures on hold after Missouri legislators defined a 
certain type of late-term abortion as a criminal act. 
</P>
<P>
	Planned Parenthood affiliates in Kansas City and St. Louis said  
they planned to go to federal courts today to ask that the law be 
put on hold while they challenge it. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban on so-called ``partial-birth'' abortions creates a  
specific felony crime called ``infanticide'' that subjects anyone 
who causes ``the death of a living infant ... by an overt act 
performed when the infant is partially born or born'' to charges 
equivalent to murder. 
</P>
<P>
	In approving the ban Thursday, legislators overrode a veto by  
Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic state Sen. Ted House said Missouri's approach was  
different than other states' because the ban on late-term abortions 
is written into Missouri's criminal code. 
</P>
<P>
	``We draw the line at infanticide,'' said House, the bill's  
Senate sponsor. ``This statute has never been ruled on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is no record of the procedure ever being performed in the  
state, according to the state Department of Health. Abortions after 
the fetus is considered viable were already banned under state law. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics and supporters predicted the Missouri law eventually  
will reach the U.S. Supreme Court. Some critics have said it could 
be used to challenge the 1973 decision that legalized abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Bans on the procedure have been blocked or severely limited in  
19 of the 20 states where they have been challenged, the New 
York-based Center for Reproductive Law and Policy said. Abortion 
providers have appealed a federal judge's decision upholding a ban 
in Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Missouri Senate's vote Thursday was 27-7, a day after the  
House voted 127-34. Both chambers are controlled by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an unfortunate day for the women of Missouri,'' Carnahan  
said Thursday. ``This bill is far more extreme than its opponents 
claim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The governor contends the law is unconstitutional because it has  
no exception to protect the mother's health. He also insists that 
it outlaws abortions more than six weeks into pregnancy, going far 
beyond the targeted late-term procedure, which critics call 
``partial-birth'' abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan also says the law includes a legal defense that could  
be interpreted as helpful to perpetrators of violence against 
abortion providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion Rights Action  
League, said that the new law, if it stands, ``will actually result 
in the near elimination of abortions in the state of Missouri.''

<HEADLINE> Sick of Floyd? Here Comes Gert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Far out to sea, Hurricane Gert lost power slightly  
on Thursday with winds dropping to 135 mph, and forecasters said it 
was on a course to curve past Bermuda and stay away from the East 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 p.m. EDT, Gert -- the fourth Category 4 hurricane of the  
Atlantic season -- was about 1,095 miles south-southeast Bermuda, 
heading west-northwest at 10 mph. Earlier in the day, its sustained 
wind was 145 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``The threat to the Caribbean islands is lessening,'' said Todd  
Kimberlain, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in 
Miami. ``We don't want to write the storm off entirely, but the 
fact that it's gaining latitude is encouraging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said it could become a threat to Bermuda late in the weekend.  
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane was about 400 miles wide with a distinct eye and  
could widen as the storm enters the same atmospheric conditions of 
weak upper-level winds and warm ocean temperatures that produced 
Hurricane Floyd's huge proportions, said National Hurricane Center 
meteorologist Chris Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gert could become a very Floyd-like hurricane,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> More French Bank Mergers Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Just three weeks after Banque Nationale de Paris  
took over investment bank Paribas, a French banking watchdog group 
said Thursday that the French banking industry is ripe for further 
consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's annual report said that the number of credit  
institutions in France shrank to 1,209 at the end of last year from 
1,273 the year before, down nearly by half from 2,152 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't any consolidation among France's 15 largest  
credit institutions until four years ago, and French banking 
consolidation isn't over yet,'' one official from the Committee of 
Credit and Investment Institutions said at an off-the-record 
briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee, chaired by Bank of France Governor Jean-Claude  
Trichet, oversees France's financial services sector. This summer, 
the group made headlines for turning down Banque Nationale de 
Paris's takeover bid for rival bank Societe Generale. 
</P>
<P>
	Though government regulators turned down the BNP's bid for  
Societe Generale, BNP still ended up with Paribas. Together with 
Paribas, BNP is now France's largest bank and Europe's third in 
terms of assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also said foreign groups controlled the majority of  
banks in France in 1998, putting the French stake in the prized 
sector in the minority for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 187 bank branches in France belonged to foreign groups or  
were controlled by a foreign majority stake last year, compared 
with 172 controlled by French shareholders, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	While most takeover deals have remained within French borders,  
the committee noted that French banking is becoming more 
international. 
</P>
<P>
	Spain has become the largest foreign player, with Spanish  
companies owning 107 bank branches and 113 other financial and 
investment institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Trichet recently stressed that Societe Generale was not for  
sale.

<HEADLINE> 200 Million Paid for Cleaner Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Eleven companies have agreed to pay $200  
million to clean up contaminated drinking water under the San 
Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Wednesday is one of the largest good-faith  
offers ever made to remove dangerous chemicals from groundwater in 
the history of the Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund 
program, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies are to immediately begin designing and building  
wells and water treatment systems in the valley east of Los 
Angeles. Construction should be complete in about 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The massive aquifer beneath the San Gabriel Valley was found to  
be contaminated with industrial chemicals more than 20 years ago. 
The area was home to many industrial and defense companies starting 
in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	The basin still provides more than 50 billion gallons of  
drinking water each year. Residents for years have paid more for 
imported or cleaned water, but meeting federal and state standards 
has grown more difficult as the contamination spreads, the EPA 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The aquifer was declared a Superfund site in 1984, and 19  
companies were suspected of contributing to the pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the companies participating in the $200 million offer are  
defense giant GenCorp Aerojet, Huffy Corp., Oil &AMP; Solvent Process 
Co. and Wynn Oil Co. Negotiations are continuing with eight other 
suspected polluters.

<HEADLINE> Gore Blasts Bush's Education Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore took direct aim Thursday  
at George W. Bush's national education plan, saying the Republican 
presidential front-runner's proposal to strip failing schools of 
federal funds would ``virtually destroy them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You cannot strengthen learning by weakening public  
education,'' Gore told more than 1,500 business leaders at the 
U.S.Hispanic Chamber of Commerce's national convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``In many neighborhoods, public schools would be devastated'' by  
Bush's school voucher plan, Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination,  
also took an unmistakable shot at Bush's views on gun control one 
day after a gunman's rampage in a Fort Worth, Texas church left 
seven victims and the shooter dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said Thursday that ``a wave of evil'' -- not a lack of gun  
control laws -- is the cause of rampant gun violence in America. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Gore said: ``We can do something to cut down on the  
kinds of tragedies that these people have suffered in Fort Worth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We do know that the availability of assault weapons and deadly  
weapons in the hands of people who shouldn't have them contributes 
to a repeat in (such) incidents, to having these things happen over 
and over again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore never mentioned Bush by name. Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker  
did not immediately return a call seeking comment on Gore's 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore made his 59th visit to California as vice president chiefly  
to release a U.S. Department of Justice report recommending that 
the federal and state governments stiffen laws outlawing 
``cyberstalking'' and making it easier to track those who 
repeatedly harass and threaten others through the Internet and 
other electronic means. 
</P>
<P>
	The report called on states to review their existing laws and  
toughen them where there are no statutes that directly address 
online stalking. It also said federal laws, which currently bar 
online stalking of children, should be expanded to cover adults; 
that sentences for such crimes be toughened; and that laws be 
passed that ease investigators work in tracking electronic 
stalkers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The laws that have begun to appear on the books of progressive  
states like California must be on the books of every state,'' Gore 
said during meeting a with about three-dozen young people and 
law-enforcement officials at San Diego State University, where he 
heard from two women students who said online harassment had left 
them unnerved. 
</P>
<P>
	``And federal law must be amended to give us the tools to deal  
with this crime appropriately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Gore has attacked Bush's school-voucher plan since Bush  
unveiled it Sept. 2, the vice president's remarks Thursday were his 
most pointed criticism yet of how Bush would pay for his plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush proposed that chronically failing schools be denied  
so-called Title I federal funds that flow to classrooms in poor 
neighborhoods, and he would give the money to states, which would 
pass them to parents. They could use the money to pay for a variety 
of educational purposes, including private school tuition. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's address to the Hispanic business group was his fourth in  
as many days and came on the first day of his second California 
swing in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president left Washington at about 1 a.m. Thursday,  
about seven hours earlier than he had initially planned, to beat 
Hurricane Floyd as it churned toward the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	He taped two national morning news programs and made an  
appearance on The Weather Channel, where he provided an update 
about what the federal government knew about the storm and what 
disaster-management agencies were doing to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
	In a conference call with reporters, he pledged to improve his  
standing in New Hampshire polls that show him locked in a dead heat 
with former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, the other Democrat 
running. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to campaign vigorously in every community across New  
Hampshire,'' he said, ``meeting people one on one, family by 
family, community by community.''

<HEADLINE> Jordan Misses Chicago Open Cut by 15  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Even Michael Jordan couldn't come back from this  
big of a deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Chicago Bulls superstar shot a 10 over par 81  
Thursday in the second round of the Chicago Open, and missed the 
cut at the 54-hole event by 15 shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, who shot an opening round 84, arrived at the course less  
than an hour before his scheduled tee time Thursday and appeared 
relaxed. He talked with fans and leisurely smoked a cigar while 
hitting balls at the driving range. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan and playing partners Michael O'Connell and Dave Ryan teed  
off in front of a gallery of about 100 spectators, nearly half of 
them children. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't take long for Jordan's trademark smile to fade once  
his round began. He started his second round on No. 10 and recorded 
pars on his first four holes. But he hooked his drive into trees on 
the par-4 14th, and eventually two-putted for a bogey. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan made par on the 15th, but sliced his drive into the woods  
on the par-4 16th hole, drawing a chuckle from one fan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, was that funny?'' Jordan said jokingly to the chuckler.  
</P>
<P>
	He hit a tree with his second shot, punched his third shot into  
a bunker, blasted out and two-putted for a double bogey. Errant 
drives led to bogeys on 17 and 18, and Jordan made the turn at 5 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	He then bogeyed the first three holes on the back nine, missing  
a two-foot par putt on No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan found a fairway bunker with his drive on No. 4 but  
knocked his next shot to the front fringe. As he waited his turn to 
putt, he talked with six of his younger followers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Skipping school today?'' Jordan said with mock seriousness.  
``I'm telling on all you guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He made par at the fourth hole and as he teed off on No. 5, a  
group of children peering through a wooden fence behind the tee 
began yelling at Jordan to get his attention. His face once again 
broke into a smile. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you all tell who's who in this group?'' Jordan said,  
drawing laughter from his gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	He made par at Nos. 5 and 6, but hooked another drive on No. 7,  
which led to a bogey. He made par No. 8 but muffed a chip shot on 
No. 9 for another bogey and a back-nine 41. 
</P>
<P>
	``My score was a little better, but I putted worse today than I  
did yesterday,'' said Jordan, who entered the $150,000 tournament 
as an amateur. ``I was hitting the ball well enough to break 80 but 
I didn't putt well enough to break 80.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan said he will play competitive golf again, despite his  
disappointing showing this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a learning experience,'' he said. ``I look forward to  
hopefully getting the chance to do it again. I'll know what to 
expect, which is part of the battle, too.''

<HEADLINE>  Arafat Visits Jordanian King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and  
Jordan's King Abdullah II today discussed the status of refugees, 
Jerusalem and other thorny issues that are part of the final 
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah said in a magazine interview that traditionally Arab  
east Jerusalem is occupied lands that should be returned to the 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jerusalem is for us occupied Palestinian lands,'' Abdullah  
told the London-based, Lebanese al-Hawadeth weekly magazine in an 
interview to be published Friday. An advance text was made 
available to The Associated Press. ``We are backing our Palestinian 
brothers to enable them to regain their complete rights concerning 
this issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat returned home after a two-hour meeting with Abdullah,  
according to a communique which said the two leaders ``agreed to 
continue coordination and consultation on issues related to the 
final status negotiations, especially those pertaining to refugees, 
Jerusalem and the borders'' of the Palestinian entity. 
</P>
<P>
	The communique, broadcast on the state-run Jordan radio, said  
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak telephoned Abdullah and discussed 
peace efforts and final status talks with the Palestinians. It did 
not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	The status of Jerusalem is one of the most difficult issues  
remaining in Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. The talks began 
Monday and are expected to be concluded by September 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel insists that Jerusalem is its eternal and unified capital  
-- a claim not recognized by the international community. 
</P>
<P>
	Omar Khatib, Arafat's representative in Jordan, said talks  
between Arafat and Abdullah focused on refugees, Jerusalem, and 
``all issues related to the final status talks and coordinating 
positions in that regard.'' He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah said he wanted to ``protect Jordan's interests'' in the  
final negotiations that tackle sensitive issues, including the 
shape of a future Palestinian entity, its borders and the fate of 
Palestinian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	He said besides the individual rights of refugees, ``we have  
rights as a country hosting'' them. He did not elaborate, but 
officials said Jordan will claim compensation for money it spent on 
the refugees. No estimate was immediately available, but it is 
known that the state spends $300 million annually on 13 Palestinian 
refugee camps in the kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan is the largest Arab host to Palestinians who were  
displaced in the 1948 and 1967 Middle East wars. Roughly two-thirds 
of its 3.8 million people are Palestinian.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys' Johnston Out for Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Dallas Cowboys fullback Daryl Johnston will  
miss the rest of the season because of further neck problems 
related to 1997 surgery on a herniated disc. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston, 33, conceded the latest problem, discovered in tests  
Wednesday, could end his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is going to be a tough decision,'' he said. ``That will be  
considered at the end of the season. ... The strange thing is I 
thought after making it through last season, I'd be OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston had surgery six weeks into the 1997 season to fuse two  
vertebrae in the neck. The procedure left the area above the fused 
vertebrae vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston said he suffered a burning sensation in his neck during  
Sunday's opening victory over the Washington Redskins. It was the 
first time he felt such a sensation, known as a ``burner,'' since 
the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	A test Wednesday indicated he suffered a ``change in disc  
space,'' Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors decided he should not play the rest of this season and  
will re-evaluate the injury in six to nine months. No surgery has 
been scheduled, and Johnston said doctors are concerned another 
fusion could limit his range of motion. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston, a key run blocker in three Super Bowl championships  
for the Cowboys in the 1990s, played last season without 
complications in his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas' only backup fullback is Robert Thomas, who converted  
from linebacker in the last week of training camp. Team owner Jerry 
Jones said a move might be announced later today to fill Johnston's 
roster spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very disappointed, first and foremost for Daryl,''  
Jones said. ``He's been an inspiration for everyone.''

<HEADLINE> Columbia/HCA Agrees to Plea Bargain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. executive has  
agreed to a plea bargain with prosecutors to avoid a second trial 
on a Medicare fraud conspiracy charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Lynn Dick, 55, signed the agreement last month, The  
Tennessean in Nashville reported Thursday. His record will be 
cleared in a year if he meets conditions of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Monte Richardson, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in  
Tampa, confirmed the agreement to the newspaper, but did not 
provide any details. However, he said, defendants who sign such 
agreements typically agree to cooperate with prosecutors, pay 
restitution and perform community service. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick was among four Columbia/HCA managers in Florida charged  
with health care fraud. They were the first indictments to come 
from a 2 1/2-year federal probe of the Columbia/HCA, the nation's 
biggest hospital chain. The investigation continues. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the managers were convicted, one was acquitted and the  
federal jury in Tampa failed to reach a verdict on Dick, the chief 
financial officer of Columbia/HCA's central Florida division in 
Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick is on leave from his job. His attorney, William Jung, could  
not be reached to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, sentencing is set for Oct. 15 for Robert Whiteside,  
48, of Brentwood, Tenn., and Jay Jarrell, 44. Whiteside heads 
Columbia/HCA's single market hospitals in Nashville, Tenn., and 
Jarrell is president of the company's southwest Florida division. 
</P>
<P>
	They were found guilty of conspiring to defraud and defrauding  
Medicare, Medicaid and CHAMPUS, tax-supported health programs for 
the disabled, elderly, poor and military. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men face up to 30 years in prison and $1.5 million in  
fines.

<HEADLINE> Rookies Star for Browns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- Tim Couch isn't the only rookie who will get  
a first chance to start an NFL game Sunday when the Cleveland 
Browns play the Tennessee Titans. 
</P>
<P>
	Browns rookies Daylon McCutcheon, a defensive back, and Steve  
Zahursky, an offensive lineman, also will start. 
</P>
<P>
	After 43-0 first game loss at home against the Pittsburgh  
Steelers, Browns coach Chris Palmer has not hesitated to see what 
some of his less experienced players can do. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch, the former Kentucky quarterback who became the first  
player taken in the NFL draft, will start in Nashville in place of 
Ty Detmer. 
</P>
<P>
	McCutcheon, a third-round pick from USC, gets the start at  
cornerback in place on Antonio Langham, and Zahursky, an undrafted 
player from Kent State, gets the start at right guard in place of 
Scott Rehberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch said he was surprised by the turn of events.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel ready. I feel confident I can go out and do this.  
Hopefully, I can get the guys to rally around me and believe in 
me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCutcheon made three interceptions during the preseason. He is  
the son of NFL running back Lawrence McCutcheon. He's small, just 
5-foot-8, but possibly the Browns' best cover cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt real comfortable during the preseason and felt  
comfortable in the first game. You've just go to go out there and 
get experience and grow with the experience. Every week I'm going 
to go out there and compete and just learn,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He won't be surprised if the Titans target him quickly.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm expecting them to throw the ball at me. I'm a rookie and  
they're going to see that, and they're going to take advantage of 
that,'' he said. ``But you can't back down and you can't hide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zahursky, who played high school football in suburban Cleveland,  
won Palmer's confidence with strong performances in the preseason 
and practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said veteran linebacker John Thierry will get another  
start, but rookie Rahim Abdullah, from Clemson, will get plenty of 
action backing him up. Rookie Wali Rainer remains the starter at 
middle linebacker in place of the retired Chris Spielman. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Johnson, a rookie wide receiver from Syracuse who started  
the first game, will also return punts against the Titans.

<HEADLINE>  Costner Said Threw Pitches in Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The winces that Kevin Costner makes on the  
pitching mound in his new movie ``For Love of the Game'' aren't an 
act. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kevin threw every strike, threw every curve ball,'' said  
University of Texas baseball coach Augie Garrido, who served as a 
technical consultant on the film. ``There's one scene where you'll 
see about two or three pitches. There must be 140 more that he 
threw that day on the cutting room floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the film, which opens Friday, Costner plays an aging pitcher  
nearing the end of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Garrido and Costner became friends in 1992, when Costner came to  
dedicate a new baseball stadium at his alma mater, California State 
University at Fullerton. Garrido was then coaching Fullerton's 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Augie was the first person I thought of to help on this  
film,'' Costner said. ``I trust him implicitly on all fronts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garrido said he was glad to help his friend craft an authentic  
baseball movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like fulfilling a friend's request to help him,'' he  
said. ``It wouldn't be any different than your neighbor coming over 
and asking for help painting his fence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garrido said he didn't have to teach Costner about how to act  
and throw like a big-league pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the character by the time the film ended, including  
having a very sore arm,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bill Gates, Wife To Donate $1B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates and his wife  
are donating $1 billion over the next 20 years to finance college 
scholarships for minority students. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is critical to America's future that we draw from the full  
range of talent and ability to develop the next generation of 
leaders,'' Gates said in a statement issued before a news 
conference at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The gift -- being made through annual investments of $50 million  
a year -- is the couple's largest single philanthropic contribution 
and one of the largest ever, matching a $1 billion commitment by 
CNN founder Ted Turner to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gates Millennium scholarship program, which will begin next  
fall, will provide assistance to 1,000 students each year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gateses' goal is ``to provide financial assistance to  
high-achieving minority students who are in severe financial need 
and otherwise would be excluded from higher education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The program will be administered by the United Negro College  
Fund with support and participation by the Hispanic Scholarship 
Fund and American Indian College Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is truly a historic day. It's a wonderful moment,'' said  
William Gray III, president of the United Negro College Fund, told 
the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only will we change individual lives, we will change the  
educational landscape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Gates Foundation focuses on programs in global health and  
education. The scholarships will be in education, engineering, math 
and science. 
</P>
<P>
	Eligible students will be required to have a 3.3 grade-point  
average and be nominated by a teacher or principal. They must also 
write an essay about their goals, and commit to performing 
community service. 
</P>
<P>
	Winners would get enough money to cover tuition, room and board,  
and other expenses through college and graduate school. They must 
maintain a 3.0 grade point average. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates, whose company is the world's largest producer of computer  
software, has a net worth of more than $90 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the William H. Gates Foundation and the Gates  
Learning Foundation merged into the Bill and Melinda Gates 
Foundation. It is the largest philanthropic foundation in the 
United States, with assets of more than $17 billion, and 
second-largest in the world, behind the London-based Wellcome 
Trust. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time the merger was announced, the Gates foundations had  
spent or committed $707.4 million, including $322.1 million for 
global health projects, $300.7 million for education, $54.7 million 
for programs in the Pacific Northwest and $29.9 million for other 
philanthropic efforts. The first Gates foundation was formed in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, the Gateses' largest single donation was $100 million  
for vaccines for children in developing countries.

<HEADLINE> More Job Choices for Military Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More women are holding military jobs  
previously open only to men, but a government audit found that 
female soldiers still are restricted from certain military 
occupations. 
</P>
<P>
	Military women traditionally have worked in areas of health  
care, administration and personnel. Recent data suggest that hasn't 
changed over the years. However, since 1993-94, when legislative 
changes opened more combat-related jobs to women, female enlistees 
and officers have increasingly entered nontraditional fields such 
as aviation, surface warfare, air traffic control and field 
artillery. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a report Wednesday by the General Accounting  
Office, the investigative branch of Congress, the number of female 
Marine Corps officers who were pilots or naval flight officers 
increased from zero in 1993 to 62 -- about 7 percent of all officers 
-- last year. The number of enlisted Army women in field artillery 
increased from 32 during 1992 to 122 in 1998 -- a dramatic increased 
considering the number of men in that field decreased by 26.5 
percent during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, GAO auditors found Department of Defense and service  
barriers limiting the number of women going into nontraditional 
occupations. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the Navy limits the number of enlisted women in its  
nuclear training program because it does not allow women to serve 
on submarines, mainly because of a lack of privacy aboard the 
vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Army, some occupations are open to women, but the number  
of women in those occupations is limited because many of the jobs 
slots are in male-only units, like those involving direct ground 
combat. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO found the Air Force to have the most gender-neutral  
assignment policy.

<HEADLINE> Encryption Technology Limits Eased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House agreed Thursday to allow U.S.  
companies to sell the most powerful data-scrambling technology 
overseas with virtually no restrictions, a concession to America's 
high-tech industry over law enforcement and national security 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was a defeat for the Justice Department, which had  
forcefully argued that criminals and terrorists might use the 
technology to scramble messages about crimes or deadly plots. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, the decision should help U.S. companies in  
overseas competition -- and help consumers worldwide guarantee the 
privacy of their e-mail and online credit-card purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of restrictions on export sales said criminals and  
terrorists already could buy or download powerful encryption 
technology made in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who are going to misuse encryption for criminal  
purchases aren't going to limit themselves to U.S.-made encryption 
products,'' said Ed Gillespie, executive director of Americans for 
Computer Privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration will allow high-tech companies to sell even  
the most powerful encryption technology overseas to private and 
commercial customers after a one-time technical review of their 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House will still require companies to seek permission  
to sell the scrambling technology to a foreign government or 
military, and it maintains bans on selling to seven terrorist 
nations: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Sudan, North Korea and Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, the administration allowed companies to sell the  
most powerful scrambling technology only to specific industries 
overseas; other foreign customers were generally limited to 
so-called 56-bit encryption products, meaning those with 
72-quadrillion unlocking combinations. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a sweeping reform,'' said Dan Scheinman, senior vice  
president of legal and government affairs at Cisco Systems Inc. 
``Imagine you're banking online -- you want to make sure those 
things are safe from a hacker. You buy things, you want to make 
sure your credit card is secure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The export limits never directly affected Americans, who are  
legally free to use encryption technology of any strength. But U.S. 
companies have been reluctant to develop one version of their 
technology for domestic use and a weaker overseas version, so they 
typically sell only the most powerful type that's legal for export, 
even to Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forcing U.S. companies to do business under tight export  
controls was like asking them to use a black rotary telephone in a 
cellular, call-waiting world,'' said Harris Miller, president of 
the Information Technology Association of America, a trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics cited more than 800 products available worldwide with  
stronger scrambling technology than the United States allowed its 
companies to sell overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can pull it down over the Internet in less than 20  
minutes,'' said Gillespie. ``Having Japanese and German and Irish 
companies be at the forefront of this technology is not in our best 
interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A non-profit group of researchers demonstrated last summer it  
can unscramble a 56-bit coded message in just days using a 
custom-built computer worth less than $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House announcement follows its decision exactly one  
year ago to relax export restrictions. At the time, Vice President 
Al Gore promised the administration would reconsider its limits 
within the year.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose slightly against the yen Friday  
morning amid fears Japan's central bank may intervene in the market 
to stem the greenback's slide. Japanese stocks fell. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 105.26 yen at late morning, up 0.27 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo and also higher than its late New York level 
of 105.19 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 169.46 points,  
or 0.98 percent, to 17,122.13 at the end of the morning session. On 
Thursday, the average closed down 485.63 points, or 2.73 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	After hovering lower early in Asian trading, the dollar  
gradually edged up as some investors sold yen on worries the Bank 
of Japan would buy dollars to keep the U.S. currency from losing 
further ground, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's morning recovery came after Finance Minister Kiichi  
Miyazawa and Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami on Thursday 
discussed steps to halt the dollar's steep decline against the yen 
in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nihon Keizai economic daily said Friday that the two  
Japanese officials have agreed to ask U.S. and European monetary 
authorities to jointly intervene to curb the yen's strength, having 
concluded that single-handed intervention is having virtually no 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan has reportedly sold about $35 billion of yen  
since June 10, fearful that the currency's strength might make 
exports from Japan too expensive abroad and smother the country's 
nascent recovery from a prolonged recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the sales, Japan's currency has gained 13 percent  
against the dollar since the beginning of June. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the dollar fell to a 44-month low of 103.20 yen in  
London, despite the Bank of Japan's intervention last Friday and on 
Tuesday this week aimed at halting the yen's advance. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar has been under selling pressure after the United  
States posted a record current account trade deficit of $80.7 
billion in the second quarter of this year, including a $6.3 
billion deficit with Japan for June alone. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 109.45 yen, down  
from 109.47 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, Tokyo share prices moved lower amid  
continued concerns over the strong yen, although losses were 
moderate as the dollar recovered somewhat from its lows Thursday, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell  
63.96 points to close at 10,737.46. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 16.44 points, or 1.10 percent, to 1,479.34. 
The TOPIX closed down 29.01 points, or 1.90 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.6950 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.6900 percent. Its 
price fell 0.04 point to 101.75.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Up in Shortened Trading / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices moved slightly higher Thursday in a  
session cut short by the approach of Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 11/32  
point, or $3.43 3/4 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, fell to 6.07 percent from Tuesday's 6.10 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	With heavy rains from the hurricane threatening to disrupt  
travel in and around New York, the Bond Market Association, an 
industry trade group, decided Thursday morning to close the session 
at 1:00 p.m. EDT. Stock markets held regular trading sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury bond market benefitted from the end of a selling  
spree by insurance companies, which were cashing in bonds to raise 
money in the event Hurricane Floyd led to extensive insurance 
claims along the Atlantic Coast. Severe, widespread damages has yet 
to materialize. 
</P>
<P>
	A slight strengthening the dollar against the Japanese yen also  
contributed to the boost in the bond market. There had been worries 
that if the dollar sank too far, international investors would sell 
their U.S. bonds and invest elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of short-term Treasury securities rose 1/32 point, and  
intermediate maturities rose 1/8 point to 3/16, reported Bridge 
Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.68 percent as the  
discount fell 0.05 percentage point from Tuesday to 4.56 percent. 
Six-month yields were 5.02 percent, as the discount fell 0.04 
percentage point to 4.83 percent. One-year yields were 5.21 percent 
as the discount fell by 0.02 percentage point to 4.94 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, remained unchanged at 5.43 3/4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds was unchanged at 113 1/8. The average yield to 
maturity was unchanged at 5.86 percent.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Look At Day Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Securities and Exchange Commission is  
closely investigating several day-trading firms, with regulators 
finding violations at a number of the companies, SEC Chairman 
Arthur Levitt said today in congressional testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	The statements by Levitt, the government's top securities  
regulator, came as Congress took its first look at the risky 
popular practice of electronic day-trading. The hearing by the 
Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee on investigations occurred 
six weeks after exasperated trader Mark Barton shot and killed nine 
people at two day-trading firms in Atlanta before killing himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our preliminary findings indicate that many of these firms  
have extremely lax'' compliance with securities laws, Levitt 
testified. In addition, he said, ``We observed a number of 
advertising violations'' and sloppy record-keeping. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC ``will vigorously pursue any violations of law and has a  
number of enforcement investigations underway,'' Levitt told the 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC and the National Association of Securities Dealers, a  
self-policing brokers' group, have been scrutinizing 30 firms in 
the day-trading business to see if they make unrealistic promises 
of quick riches to investors. Day-trading firms nationwide have 
lured several thousand investors, who ride the tiniest ups and 
downs of the stock markets, squeezing profits by rapidly buying and 
selling shares electronically. 
</P>
<P>
	They pay their host day-trading firms commissions on each trade.  
Thousands of dollars of their own money are on the line, requiring 
nerves of steel and the ability to make snap decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The day traders, many of whom have abandoned their regular jobs,  
are distinct from the nation's 5 million or so amateur investors 
who occasionally trade on the Internet at home or at work. 
</P>
<P>
	State regulators have taken enforcement actions against several  
day-trading firms for alleged abuses in recent months. The 
regulators contend that most day traders are heading for losses and 
many are being misled by host firms that promise them quick riches 
and encourage improper loans to keep them trading. 
</P>
<P>
	One firm, according to regulators, told prospective investors  
that 85 percent of day traders make money at it. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's hearing of the Senate investigative panel aimed to  
answer three key questions, according to its chairwoman, Sen. Susan 
Collins, R-Maine: 
</P>
<P>
	--Is day trading nothing more than gambling?  
</P>
<P>
	``Very few Americans would think it prudent to quit their jobs  
or to cash in their retirement savings to become professional 
gamblers who support their families at a Las Vegas casino,'' Ms. 
Collins said. ``Yet the day-trading industry estimates that 4,000 
to 5,000 citizens are full-time day traders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Are some day-trading firms engaging in deceptive and fraudulent  
practices and if so, how widespread is the misconduct? 
</P>
<P>
	--What is the impact of day trading on the stock of individual  
companies that are widely traded, such as Microsoft, Intel and 
Dell, and on the financial markets? 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing was expected to be the first in a series by the  
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, the panel's senior Democrat, put it  
more bluntly. ``It's gambling,'' he asserted. ``Some of the firms 
touting day trading hold out a rainbow of big gains with little 
risk. But there's almost never a pot of gold at the end of the 
rainbow -- there's mostly financial pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The day-trading industry has some 60 firms operating with  
hundreds of offices around the country, providing their 
trader-customers with computers and high-speed hookups to 
electronic trading networks. In the face of growing scrutiny, the 
industry defends its practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey Houtkin, founder and chief executive of All-Tech  
Investment Group Inc., one of the biggest day-trading firms, says 
its customers must have at least $25,000 to invest and must 
demonstrate competency in trading. The New Jersey-based company's 
Web site contains a warning about the financial risks, but Houtkin 
says many customers are not warned directly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our clients are very sophisticated, relatively well-heeled,  
they know what they're doing,'' he said last month. ``To think that 
these people don't understand risk is almost insulting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barton shot some of his victims at All-Tech's Atlanta office,  
and fellow day traders who had lent him money were among those 
killed in his shooting spree, according to the lead investigator in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton reportedly had lost $400,000 to $450,000 trading at  
All-Tech and at the second firm where he shot people, Momentum 
Securities, in the past year.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Forces N.Y. Schools To Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- City officials closed schools and urged  
businesses to send workers home early as Hurricane Floyd bore down 
on the New York City area today. 
</P>
<P>
	With tropical storm-force wind and torrential rain poised to hit  
around the evening rush hour, possibly stranding hundreds of 
thousands of commuters, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani ordered all 
non-emergency city workers to leave work early. He also urged 
private sector businesses to close early if they could. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems that the worst of the storm is really going to hit  
us,'' Giuliani said at an early morning news conference. It would 
be the metropolitan area's worst brush with tropical storm 
conditions in 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hurricane Bob grazed the eastern tip of Long Island in '91 ...  
but you haven't seen anything like this since Hurricane Gloria in 
September of '85,'' said Bob Chartuk, spokesman for the regional 
office of the National Hurricane Center. 
</P>
<P>
	A tropical storm warning was in effect around the city and a  
hurricane warning was posted for eastern Long Island and parts of 
the New Jersey shore. Suffolk County on Long Island declared a 
state of emergency, and dozens of schools in the area planned to 
close early or, like New York City and New Jersey schools, did not 
open at all. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's mass transit system is particularly vulnerable to  
rain. Just three weeks ago, a freak storm dumped 3 inches of rain 
during the morning rush hour, halting most subway service and 
disrupting commuter rail lines that serve the suburbs. Hundreds of 
thousands of workers got to work late or not at all. 
</P>
<P>
	After Giuliani asked businesses to close early, some small  
financial exchanges announced they plan to shut earlier than 
normal, New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq stock markets chose to 
continue trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're open for business,'' said NYSE spokeswoman Diana  
Desecio. ``We plan to stay open for regular business hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani did not order the evacuation of low-lying areas and  
beach communities in the outer boroughs. But 20 city shelters were 
opened for residents who felt uncomfortable remaining at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Around the metro area, construction workers and residents were  
warned to secure anything that might blow away. 
</P>
<P>
	On Fire Island, a barrier island to the much larger Long Island,  
residents were ordered to evacuate this morning. The ferry there 
does not run amid gale-force winds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Long Island Power Authority was sending 3,000 workers with  
2,500 vehicles into the field in case of problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hurricanes have minds of their own,'' said LIPA Chairman  
Richard Kessel, who warned people to check flashlight batteries and 
make sure phones were working. When Gloria went through in 1985, 
750,000 Long Islan homes and businesses lost power, some for up to 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Jersey, Gov. Christie Whitman announced that all schools  
in that state would be closed today, and state workers would be 
sent home early this afternoon. National Guard troops were standing 
by to assist possible local evacuations along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
	But not everyone agreed with the decision to close schools when  
nothing more than a steady rain was falling and the worst of the 
wind was not expected for hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``Closing all the schools in New Jersey and New York City is  
just silly,'' Landon Leming, a Denville, N.J. resident who commutes 
daily to Manhattan, said as he waited for a subway train. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City public schools had not closed for bad weather  
since January 1996, when 20 inches of snow fell. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's Gov. George Pataki placed the National Guard on  
24-hour alert Wednesday and opened a state Emergency Operations 
Center in Albany.

<HEADLINE> Sacred Objects Returned to Navajos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Four sacred artifacts will be returned to the  
Navajo Nation, more than a decade after they were taken from a cave 
in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal officials plan a public prayer ceremony Friday in Window  
Rock to mark their return. Federal officials identified the 
centuries-old objects as a mask, a tortoise shell and two coverings 
that may be drum heads or ceremonial vessel coverings. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of items held by museums and private collectors have been  
returned voluntarily to the tribe since federal legislation in 1990 
cracked down on looting of American Indian sites. 
</P>
<P>
	But the objects being returned Friday are some of just a handful  
the Navajos have received through criminal investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Begay, Navajo cultural specialist, said Navajo leaders  
are pleased the items will be back in the hands of their rightful 
owners. Begay declined to say what the items were or how they are 
used. 
</P>
<P>
	``These artifacts were given to the Navajo people by our  
superiors, the powers,'' he said. ``For other people to have those 
items was not what they were intended for. They don't know how to 
use them or what they are used for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noel Johns, an agent with the Bureau of Land Management, said  
the items were taken from a cave in northwestern New Mexico in 
1986, before it was a crime. They were recovered in 1991 after 
tracking them through dealers in Santa Fe, N.M., and New York. The 
mask was found at a Tucson home. The other objects were at a Sante 
Fe gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	A New Mexico man pleaded guilty in 1992 to selling the  
artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
	Johns said it has taken years to return the objects to the  
Navajo Nation because federal regulations require that authorities 
ensure the objects are being returned to the proper tribe.

<HEADLINE> Algerians Approve Peace Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- Algerians overwhelmingly approved a  
peace plan designed by their new president to reconcile a nation 
torn apart by an Islamic insurgency, according to preliminary 
results Friday of a national referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 98 percent of Algeria's 17 million voters said ``yes''  
Thursday to the single question: ``Do you agree with the steps by 
the president of the republic toward civil concord?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The approval of was a strong endorsement for President Abdelaziz  
Bouteflika, who was elected in April after six other candidates 
withdrew, charging widespread fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	About 61 percent of the eligible population turned out to vote  
in the April election. About 85 percent cast ballots in Thursday's 
referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	Bouteflika's plan is intended to end violence that has left  
100,000 people dead since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The centerpiece of Bouteflika's peace plan is an amnesty and  
prison term reduction for all Islamic insurgents, except those 
convicted of rape, murder or planting bombs, provided they give up 
their weapons. The initiative has already been passed by 
parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	National reconciliation has been Bouteflika's top priority since  
he was elected in April after six other candidates withdrew, 
charging widespread fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's referendum was seen as a plebiscite for Bouteflika,  
Algeria's first civilian leader in 24 years. He has pledged to step 
down if voters do not approve his proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The streets of the capital, Algiers, were calm Thursday and  
shops were open as usual. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign posters and crowds in front of polling stations were  
the only evidence of the ``historic day'' announced by state media. 
Bouteflika voted early Thursday, renewing his call for a massive 
turnout. 
</P>
<P>
	The peace plan will reintegrate Islamic militants into society.  
The insurgency began in 1992 after the army canceled elections the 
now-banned Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about saying 'yes' to peace but also 'that's enough,  
the violence is over,''' a 37-year-old Algiers port worker who 
identified himself only as Youssef said before the final result was 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have had two brothers in jail for the past five years  
because they had fundamentalist leanings,'' said Mourad, a 
36-year-old customs worker who declined to give his full name. ``I 
can tell you that my mother will vote 'yes.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Algerians are wary of the referendum, saying they would  
find it difficult to vote for Bouteflika's plan with its offer of 
an olive branch to Islamic militants. 
</P>
<P>
	But others say it's time for this North African nation, rich in  
gas and oil, to move on and end its isolation. And Bouteflika's 
proposals have the support of some key Islamic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred members of the Armed Islamic Group, the most  
radical group, have turned in their arms in hopes of qualifying for 
the amnesty. Some have appeared before the probation commission and 
have been freed. 
</P>
<P>
	Algeria's main cities have been relatively calm since  
Bouteflika's election, but violence continues in some areas. 
Attacks blamed on the Armed Islamic Group have left some 200 people 
dead since the beginning of August.

<HEADLINE> BT, AT&AMP;T Announce Mobile Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- AT&AMP;T and British Telecom, two of the world's  
biggest communications companies, have formed a global alliance to 
link their wireless telephone operations with roaming agreements 
and other seamless services. 
</P>
<P>
	The new alliance, named Advance, comes as wireless rival  
Vodafone AirTouch of Britain works to forge an alliance with Bell 
Atlantic Corp. with an eye toward joining their U.S. mobile phone 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T and British Telecom provide wireless services in 17  
countries with a combined customer base of 41 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance announced Thursday was the latest in a series of  
major initiatives AT&AMP;T and British Telecom have undertaken in the 
past 14 months. The companies are still seeking regulatory approval 
for the $10 billion global communications venture they announced in 
July 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the wireless venture could ultimately serve as the  
precursor to a merger between companies' mobile operations, but at 
present appeared to be little more than a ``roaming'' agreement 
giving customers from either company access to the other's cellular 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you travel, you expect your BT or AT&AMP;T digital phone to  
work anywhere and everywhere with all of the advanced features you 
have -- just as if you were at home. This is not possible in many 
cases today for a whole host of reasons, including incompatible 
technology and government regulation,'' said John Zeglis, president 
of AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	``By pairing two of the leading telecommunications companies in  
the world ... we think we can make some things happen that will 
eventually give customers those `anytime, anywhere' capabilities 
from their mobile phones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of both companies rose on the New York Stock Exchange  
following Thursday's announcement. AT&AMP;T rose $1 per share, or 2.2 
percent, to $45.50, while British Telecom's NYSE-listed shares rose 
$5.25, or 3.5 percent, to $153. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is undoubtedly good news for BT,'' said Steve Wreford,  
analyst at CCF Charterhouse in London. ``Further down the line we 
are looking at links on a much wider scale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the wireless venture, the companies plan to test a  
Global Account Services package later this year, offering global 
contracts and consolidated management information to customers who 
are international travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T and British Telecom also announced earlier this year that

<HEADLINE> Floyd Shuts Down Much of New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The remnants of Hurricane Floyd shut down the  
city that never sleeps Thursday, sending workers home early, 
curtailing commuter train service and forcing an almost 
unprecedented shutdown of schools. 
</P>
<P>
	In preparation for the heavy wind and rain that was expected to  
hit around the evening rush hour, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani ordered 
all non-emergency city workers to go home between noon and 3 p.m. 
He also urged private businesses to close early if they could. 
</P>
<P>
	``My daughter was excited -- she didn't have to take the bus to  
school today,'' said William Wilcox, whose little girl attends a 
Catholic school in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm and expected  
to pass through Long Island, east of the city, an extra 1,000 
police were in uniform to deal with any kind of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be dealing with the side effects of it, but they're  
going to be very, very strong and very difficult,'' Giuliani said. 
``Winds, when you get up to 40 mph, can be very dangerous in New 
York City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The school closure caught parents by surprise, forcing some to  
stay home while others scrambled for baby-sitters. Schools are 
often shut for snow, but in no one's memory were they shut for 
hurricanes or other rainstorms. 
</P>
<P>
	Service was halted on Metro-North Commuter Railroad during the  
evening rush, stranding roughly 15,000 people who hadn't left 
early, or a quarter of the daily traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Rail lines had boosted service in the early afternoon to handle  
the increased number of passengers heading home early. Some express 
buses began running at noon rather than 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, by mid-afternoon, some commuters were facing a crunch.  
There were long lines for taxis and buses. Water puddled on subway 
platforms and dripped onto tracks, reminiscent of the flash 
flooding that brought city transit to its knees Aug. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations allowed workers to leave at 1 p.m. and  
canceled a meeting on protecting civilians in war. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Jameson, a paralegal in an office near Wall Street,  
couldn't believe he got to leave, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought New Yorkers were supposed to be resilient, scared by  
nothing,'' he said as a few raindrops pelted him. ``Now we're going 
home early, which I find comical.''

<HEADLINE> Man Pleads Guilty To Manslaughter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- A man who earned high grades in college  
after being ruled incompetent to stand trial in the killing of his 
ex-girlfriend pleaded guilty Thursday to a reduced charge of 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Curtis, 34, was charged a decade ago in the shooting  
death of Donna Kalson. Curtis shot himself in the head after 
allegedly killing Ms. Kalson outside a Stratford restaurant on Oct. 
30, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	In a surprise plea bargain, Curtis pleaded guilty to a charge of  
first-degree manslaughter Thursday. He faces up to 20 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	After Curtis was originally charged, courts concluded that  
Curtis had suffered brain damage that rendered him incompetent to 
stand trial. But in 1997, police discovered that Curtis had been 
earning As and Bs at several colleges. He was re-arrested in 
November 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	During his previous appearances in court, Curtis, who uses a  
wheelchair, had kept his chin on his chest, seemingly oblivious to 
everything going on around him. The image was in stark contrast to 
videotaped evidence showing Curtis attending classes, and talking 
about his plans for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, following another round of hearings, Bridgeport  
Superior Court Judge George Thim said Curtis was competent to stand 
trial in the 12-year-old murder case. Thim said Curtis 
``exaggerated his symptoms in an effort to influence the outcome of 
this criminal prosecution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday, Curtis answered a series of questions from the judge  
before admitting his guilt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We waited a long time to hear that,'' said Adrienne Urbano,  
Ms. Kalson's older sister. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plea bargain, Curtis gives up his right to appeal,  
prosecutor John Smriga said. He said he would ask the judge to 
impose the maximum 20 years when Curtis is sentenced Nov. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea bargain spares Ms. Kalson's relatives the ordeal of a  
long trial and ``gives the family closure,'' the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Urbano said her family struggled with whether to endorse the  
deal. She said the family thought it was the best way to make sure 
Curtis gets jail time.

<HEADLINE> Giants 6, Marlins 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The San Francisco Giants, who trail Arizona  
by seven games with 16 left to play, refuse to believe the race in 
the NL West is over. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants won their fifth straight Thursday, defeating the  
Florida Marlins 6-5 to sweep a three-game series, and moved a 
half-game closer to the idle Diamondbacks. San Francisco has won 22 
of its last 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvin Benard homered and drove in two runs as the Giants sent  
Florida to its seventh loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Bronswell Patrick (1-0) got the win in his Giants debut,  
pitching two scoreless innings of relief. Robb Nen pitched the 
ninth for his 35th save in 44 chances. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants took a 6-5 lead in the sixth. The tying run scored on  
a throwing error by shortstop Dave Berg and the lead run scored 
when his poor throw prevented the Marlins from turning an 
inning-ending double play. Brent Mayne got an RBI on the groundout. 
</P>
<P>
	Benard led off the first with his 14th homer for the Giants and  
added a run-scoring groundout in the fifth. Armando Rios and Bill 
Mueller had RBI singles. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Redmond, who had not homered since Aug. 19, 1998, hit a  
three-run shot for the Marlins in the fourth and Kevin Millar had 
two RBIs with a sacrifice fly in the first and a homer leading off 
the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Vladimir Nunez (6-9) allowed six runs on eight hits and three  
walks in 5 1-3 innings for the Marlins, who have lost nine straight 
on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Giants starter Kirk Rueter allowed five runs on seven hits --  
including two homers -- in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Benard has three leadoff homers this season, and five in  
his career. ... Redmond had gone 70 games since his last homer. ... 
Millar has 45 RBIs in his last 61 games. ... Patrick went 4-1 for 
Milwaukee last season. ... Rueter has allowed 25 homers this 
season, tops among Giants pitchers. ... The Giants won the season 
series 5-4. ... The Marlins threw out all five would-be base 
stealers in the three-game series, including two on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler To Streamline Board </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG plans to streamline its  
17-member management board, a move meant to signal the melding of 
Daimler-Benz AG and Chrysler Corp. into a single company. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes are to be detailed at a meeting of the company's top  
300 executives Oct. 6-7, The Detroit News reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-chairman Robert J. Eaton is expected to retain his seat on  
the board, while co-chairman Juergen Schrempp assumes full control. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, you cannot have two CEOs,'' Eaton told the  
newspaper at the Frankfurt International Motor Show in Germany. 
``But I'm sure as hell not thinking about retirement personally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is not clear how many seats would be dropped from the board,  
a structure required by German corporate law. 
</P>
<P>
	The News said up to seven seats could be eliminated and the  
board organized around functional responsibilities such as finance, 
marketing, purchasing and related businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The merger is history,'' Schrempp said Wednesday. ``Our  
company has entered a new phase. Our major objective is to have the 
fastest and leanest organization at all levels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials and senior executives declined comment to the  
News on the possible changes, which were outlined by Schrempp last 
week in a meeting with 400 senior managers. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies merged last November.  
</P>
<P>
	President Thomas Stallkamp, often assumed to be a likely  
successor to Schrempp, is expected to retain a seat on the board.

<HEADLINE> Justice OKs Phase of Lockheed Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first phase of a proposed merger between  
defense contractor Lockheed Martin Corp. and satellite access 
provider Comsat Corp. gained Justice Department approval Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's antitrust division said it would not challenge  
Lockheed's bid to acquire 49 percent of Comsat, which transmits 
voice and video signals by satellite. Lockheed's offer to purchase 
the 49 percent stake at $45.50 a share is scheduled to expire 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Comsat-Lockheed Martin partnership is a strong  
pro-competitive merger that will increase competition in the global 
telecommunications market by giving consumers an additional 
choice,'' said Betty C. Alewine, Comsat's president and chief 
executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department did not stipulate any conditions to  
allowing the acquisition to go through. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders approved the deal last month and the Federal  
Communications Commission signed off on the purchase Wednesday, 
designating the Bethesda, Md.-based Lockheed as an authorized 
carrier to acquire Comsat. The FCC determined that the 49 percent 
acquisition would not adversely affect the level of competition for 
providing satellite services or the manufacturing of communications 
satellites. 
</P>
<P>
	For Lockheed and Comsat to complete their proposed merger,  
Congress would have to lift certain limits on ownership of Comsat 
included in a 1962 law. The companies could then apply to the FCC 
for a full merger review, commission officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress chartered Comsat in 1962 to keep then-telephone  
monopoly AT&AMP;T from extending its control to international satellite 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
	Comsat's main business is selling access to the international  
satellite consortium Intelsat to U.S. companies, mostly large 
telephone carriers and TV networks. But the FCC voted Wednesday to 
give Comsat customers direct access to Intelsat, without a 
provider. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC officials said the move would let U.S companies operate on a  
level playing field with businesses in 94 other countries that can 
go directly to Intelsat. The commission said the change could lead 
to lower international calling rates and other consumer services. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin said the company is still reviewing the  
financial impact of Wednesday's FCC action. But in a statement, the 
company said it expected to close the first phase of the merger 
Saturday.

<HEADLINE>  Mike Tyson Speaks His Mind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson didn't dodge any question at a news  
conference Thursday formally announcing an Oct. 23 fight against 
Orlin Norris -- and some of his answers were dipped in acid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good, I'm in shape, I'm ready to fight,'' Tyson said.  
``I went from 280 pounds -- for they had me in the joint for a 
minute -- to 235 pounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Why, someone wanted to know, did he put on weight in jail?  
</P>
<P>
	``Have you ever been incarcerated, sir,'' Tyson replied. ``Go  
outside, hit somebody with a car, get incarcerated and see how fat 
you are when you go home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-round fight against Norris, a former cruiserweight  
champion, at the MGM Grand will be Tyson's first since he was 
released May 24 from a Maryland jail after serving 3 1/2 months for 
assaulting two motorists after a fender-bender. 
</P>
<P>
	The former undisputed heavyweight champion, who also has served  
three years in Indiana on a rape conviction, was asked if he ever 
thinks about what could have been different in his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coulda, shoulda, woulda,'' Tyson said. ``What should happen is  
there shouldn't be racism, there shouldn't be dysfunctional 
alcoholics that are reporters. I keep it real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he thought it was fair that he served jail time after  
pleading no-contest in Maryland, he replied, ``It's politically 
correct to put me in jail, to send me to prison.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He, added, however, ``I have no man to blame but myself. Other  
people contributed to it, but I have to carry the weight of a fool 
by myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A smiling Tyson, with hair on his head but none on his face,  
actually showed up early for the news conference, signed some 
autographs and talked to reporters after the conference ended. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight, to be televised on Showtime, is Tyson's first since  
he knocked out Francois Botha with a right to the jaw in the fifth 
round Jan. 16 at the MGM Grand. He was behind on all three 
officials' cards after four rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	That was his 46th win against three losses and his 40th  
knockout. It also snapped a two-fight losing streak to Evander 
Holyfield, including the notorious Bite Fight on June 28, 1997, 
which led to the revocation of his license for a little more than a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris, who turns 34 on Oct. 4, has a 50-5 record. He has scored  
27 knockouts, but craftiness, not power, is his game. He was the 
WBA cruiserweight champion in 1993-95. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the possibility of beating Tyson, Norris said,  
``People who write newspapers, you know, they all say, `You can't 
do this, you can't do that.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The odds were 10-1 that Norris can't do it.

<HEADLINE> Helms Demands Sanctions for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Jesse Helms demanded sanctions against  
China Thursday for selling missile technology. He said he would 
block confirmation of an assistant secretary of state if the 
Clinton administration does not comply. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms, R-N.C., issued the ultimatum -- any senator has the power  
to block nominations -- at a hearing at which CIA official Robert 
Walpole repeated intelligence conclusions that China and North 
Korea had aided Pakistan's missile capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Enough is enough,'' said Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign  
Relations Committee. He said he would stop confirmation of Robert 
Einhorn to be assistant secretary of state for nonproliferation 
until sanctions are imposed against China. Einhorn is currently a 
special adviser to the under secretary for nonproliferation. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms said after the hearing that he also opposes a tentative  
deal reached with North Korea. President Clinton said he is 
considering easing trade sanctions as long as the communist regime 
refrains from testing long-range missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he ought to have consulted with Congress before he  
opened his mouth about it,'' Helms said, calling North Korea a 
rogue nation. ``Some of us have been around longer than he has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helms said sanctions against China are required by the law aimed  
at stopping the spread of nuclear technology. He accused Einhorn of 
``gobbledygook'' in responding to questions about transfer of 
missile technology by China and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	China's sale of M-11 missiles, which have a 250-mile range, was  
disclosed in the CIA's annual National Intelligence Estimate on 
Missile Threats last week and confirmed by Walpole at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials believe China has come a long way since  
it was first disclosed in 1993 that it transferred some missile 
technology to Pakistan. The CIA has not provided details on its 
latest intelligence conclusions or specified whether it was 
referring to previously disclosed transfers in 1992 or more recent 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the administration is looking into the legal need  
for sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	``China continues to contribute to missile programs in some  
countries,'' Walpole told Helms, who was the only senator attending 
Thursday's hearing. Walpole, who oversees strategic and nuclear 
programs, said Pakistan has M-11 short-range ballistic missiles 
from China and Ghauri medium-range missiles from North Korea, but 
did not say how many. 
</P>
<P>
	``We assess both may have a nuclear role,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In his printed testimony, however, Walpole said the CIA  
continues to judge it unlikely that either China or Russia would 
sell a complete intercontinental ballistic missile or technologies 
that could lead to completion of one by another country. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA's report, for the first time, assessed the likelihood of  
several countries' missiles to reach the United States by 2015. 
</P>
<P>
	It characterized the prospect of North Korea acquiring a  
long-range missile as ``most likely,'' Iran's prospect was judged 
to be ``probable'' and Iraq was labeled a ``possible'' threat. 
Russia and China have long had missiles capable of reaching the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Walpole acknowledged that analysts differ on how likely each  
advancement may be. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, State Department spokesman James Foley called the  
possible transfer of M-11 missiles from China to Pakistan a matter 
of ``grave national security importance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials say the administration is evaluating whether the  
intelligence report discloses transactions that constitute a 
sanctionable violation. If they do, a ban could be imposed on 
transfers of technology relating to missile and military aircraft 
development, among other areas.

<HEADLINE> Charges Vs. Former Inmate Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Cook County prosecutors have dropped armed  
robbery charges against a man who spent more than 15 years on death 
row for a double murder he did not commit. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Porter, 43, was freed in February after another man  
confessed to the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Porter was granted a new trial for a $2 robbery  
committed the night of the 1982 murders. But late Wednesday, 
State's Attorney Richard A. Devine issued a statement saying he had 
reviewed Porter's case and dropped the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Porter already had spent more time on death row than he  
would have spent in prison if convicted of the robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anthony Porter was jailed for a crime he did not commit,''  
Devine said. ``While prosecuting him again for armed robbery is an 
option, it is clear that he would not return to jail even if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is time to end this matter.''  
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Thomas Fitzgerald granted the new trial Monday,  
saying Porter's original robbery conviction was tainted because he 
was initially tried before the same jury on the murder and armed 
robbery charges.

<HEADLINE> Damage Award Against Ford Overturned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. is entitled to a new trial  
to determine damages in a fatal rollover accident because jury 
misconduct may have tainted a $290 million award, a judge in 
Modesto has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	In setting aside the punitive portion of the verdict Thursday,  
Stanislaus County Superior Court Judge Roger Beauchesne said 
deliberations were infected by a juror's dream and a television 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge upheld the jury's unanimous finding that a defective  
roof was responsible for the deaths of a husband, wife and son when 
their Ford Bronco overturned on a freeway in June 1993. The jury 
July 12 awarded surviving family members $5 million in 
compensation, an amount Beauchesne reduced by $469,000. 
</P>
<P>
	During deliberations, one juror allegedly talked about a  
nightmare in which children of the jurors were killed in a Ford 
Bronco that was rolling over while the automaker's lawyers chanted, 
``Where's the proof?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A second juror said she'd heard about an episode of ``60  
Minutes'' in which a report about fires in Ford Mustangs included 
callous remarks by Lee Iacocca, the former Ford executive who 
introduced the Mustang and later became chief executive of 
Chrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	Both jurors submitted statements saying they based their  
verdicts solely on the evidence presented in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	But Judge Beauchesne granted Ford a new trial on the punitive  
damages, saying the two jurors' comments may have influenced the 
deliberations. He noted that the jury vote on punitive damages was 
9-3, the exact majority needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford spokesman Jim Cain said the ruling was gratifying, but the  
company maintains the Bronco wasn't defective and may appeal the 
case further. 
</P>
<P>
	The $290 million verdict had been the second-largest of its  
kind, coming just two weeks after a Los Angeles jury awarded $4.9 
billion to six people who were severely burned when their Chevrolet 
exploded in a rear-end collision. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1993, Juan Romo was driving the 1978 model Bronco when  
he swerved to avoid a van he was passing. The vehicle rolled over, 
killing Romo's mother, Salustia, 40; his father, Ramon, 39; and his 
brother, Ramiro, 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Romo, then 19, and his two surviving sisters, Evangelina, 14,  
and Maria, 8, were slightly injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Their lawyers argued that Ford knew the Bronco's roof was unsafe  
but decided to save the extra cost of reinforcing it with steel, a 
change made on post-1979 Broncos. The plaintiffs' witnesses 
included a former Ford executive vice president who said company 
officials knew the roof was virtually certain to fail in a 
rollover. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford asserted that the Bronco's roof was sound and met federal  
safety standards, blaming the deaths on Romo and the driver he was 
passing. 
</P>
<P>
	In seeking a new trial, Ford offered statements by jurors that  
fellow juror Denise Salinas had described a ``60 Minutes'' segment 
about faulty fuel tanks in Ford Mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
	Iacocca, then Ford's president, was incorrectly quoted by  
Salinas as saying Ford would rather defend against lawsuits than 
recall or fix vehicles. Beauchesne said Thursday a tape of the 
program contained no such statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Romos' lawyers recently submitted a sworn statement from  
Salinas in which she said she briefly mentioned what someone had 
told her about the program, but agreed with another juror that it 
was irrelevant to the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford also submitted declarations that a second juror, Karen  
Zaccheo, described her nightmare about rolling Broncos and burning 
children as an ``omen,'' and advised other jurors they did not need 
to follow the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Zaccheo's declaration, offered by the Romos' lawyers, confirmed  
that she mentioned the dream but denied the additional statements. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurence Drivon, a lawyer for the Romos, said plaintiffs'  
lawyers will review the ruling before deciding on their next step.

<HEADLINE>  Mike Tyson Speaks His Mind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson didn't dodge any question at a news  
conference Thursday formally announcing an Oct. 23 fight against 
Orlin Norris -- and some of his answers were dipped in acid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good, I'm in shape, I'm ready to fight,'' Tyson said.  
``I went from 280 pounds -- for they had me in the joint for a 
minute -- to 235 pounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Why, someone wanted to know, did he put on weight in jail?  
</P>
<P>
	``Have you ever been incarcerated, sir,'' Tyson replied. ``Go  
outside, hit somebody with a car, get incarcerated and see how fat 
you are when you go home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-round fight against Norris, a former cruiserweight  
champion, at the MGM Grand will be Tyson's first since he was 
released May 24 from a Maryland jail after serving 3 1/2 months for 
assaulting two motorists after a fender-bender. 
</P>
<P>
	The former undisputed heavyweight champion, who also has served  
three years in Indiana on a rape conviction, was asked if he ever 
thinks about what could have been different in his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coulda, shoulda, woulda,'' Tyson said. ``What should happen is  
there shouldn't be racism, there shouldn't be dysfunctional 
alcoholics that are reporters. I keep it real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he thought it was fair that he served jail time after  
pleading no-contest in Maryland, he replied, ``It's politically 
correct to put me in jail, to send me to prison.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He, added, however, ``I have no man to blame but myself. Other  
people contributed to it, but I have to carry the weight of a fool 
by myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A smiling Tyson, with hair on his head but none on his face,  
actually showed up early for the news conference, signed some 
autographs and talked to reporters after the conference ended. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight, to be televised on Showtime, is Tyson's first since  
he knocked out Francois Botha with a right to the jaw in the fifth 
round Jan. 16 at the MGM Grand. He was behind on all three 
officials' cards after four rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	That was his 46th win against three losses and his 40th  
knockout. It also snapped a two-fight losing streak to Evander 
Holyfield, including the notorious Bite Fight on June 28, 1997, 
which led to the revocation of his license for a little more than a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris, who turns 34 on Oct. 4, has a 50-5 record. He has scored  
27 knockouts, but craftiness, not power, is his game. He was the 
WBA cruiserweight champion in 1993-95. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the possibility of beating Tyson, Norris said,  
``People who write newspapers, you know, they all say, `You can't 
do this, you can't do that.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The odds were 10-1 that Norris can't do it.

<HEADLINE> Bahamaian Homes Flattened in Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARSH HARBOUR, Bahamas (AP) -- Stunned residents of Abaco Island  
salvaged rain-soaked possessions from flattened homes Thursday as 
the relief effort for Hurricane Floyd's victims slowly gathered 
steam. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors of Floyd's 145-mph winds gawked at sailboats flopped  
onto eroded beaches and seas of sand where tiny coastal villages 
once were. Hundreds of wooden homes were exposed to the elements, 
their roofs ripped off like paper during the storm's rampage 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least no one died,'' was a refrain repeated by residents  
Thursday as they balanced soaked mattresses on car roofs to dry. 
Clothes washed of mud littered every free space, laid out on the 
flattened ruins of some houses, fluttering from uprooted trees and 
car windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other Bahamian islands, residents of Abaco and the tiny  
keys on its periphery, population 11,000, faced the prospect of 
going weeks without telephone, electricity or reliable water 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	The 700-island archipelago reported one presumed death: that of  
a Freeport man swept out to sea from Grand Bahama Island. 
Authorities said they had no word of anyone who was critically 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Bahamians had heeded storm warnings and stayed out of harm's way  
inside churches and government buildings-turned-shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trees were skinned like bananas,'' said Michelle Rolle, a  
resident of Abaco's Sandy Point. ``This hurricane was by far the 
worst we've seen, but at least everyone is safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Abaco residents reported seeing tornadoes.  
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of homes were flattened, roofless or otherwise damaged  
in Abaco, Eleuthera and Cat islands. In Grand Bahama, Freeport's 
international airport was closed because of flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cat Island, two medical centers lost their roofs, and 2 1/2  
miles of the coastal road were washed away, said U.S. Embassy 
spokeswoman Lee Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the U.S. Agency for International Development's  
Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance helped Bahamian authorities 
assess damage and relief needs, Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a great need for fresh water and food,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	From Florida and Great Inagua Island, the U.S. Coast Guard  
dispatched patrol boats, a C-130 aircraft and helicopters to survey 
the northern and eastern islands hardest hit by Floyd and deliver 
medical supplies and communications gear, including a mobile 
communications trailer to Nassau. 
</P>
<P>
	On northern Eleuthera island, where winds reached 110 mph  
Tuesday, many homes were left without roofs and half the cemetery 
was washed away. 
</P>
<P>
	On Abaco, entire neighborhoods were flooded by storm surges  
whipped up by winds gusting to 190 mph, said Chris Lloyd, of the 
Bahamas Air Sea Rescue Association. In some places, homes looked as 
though they been randomly shoved together. 
</P>
<P>
	Club Med arranged flights out of the Bahamas for 380 guests who  
rode out the storm at its San Salvador resort and another 350 in 
Paradise Island near Nassau. Both resorts were temporarily closed 
for repairs, said spokeswoman Carol Boubard. 
</P>
<P>
	Most hotels reported only minor damage, including the Atlantis  
resort on Paradise Island, where 2,000 tourists weathered the 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to get off this island,'' said Elaine Bryant of  
Elizabeth, New Jersey. ``This is the worst vacation I have had. But 
I can't blame anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everywhere, neighbors joined to clear streets, clean homes and  
stock up on emergency supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nassau, market vendors set up their stalls; lines formed  
again at fast-food drive-thrus. 
</P>
<P>
	To the east, Hurricane Gert whipped up 130-mph winds, but  
forecasters said it would likely turn north on Friday and head into 
the open Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT, Gert was about 500 miles east of 
the northern Leeward Islands, moving west-northwest at 10 mph.

<HEADLINE> Patriots' Allen Revives Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Once, Terry Allen ran for an amazing 21  
touchdowns in a season. Twice, he rushed for more than 1,300 yards 
on two surgically repaired knees. 
</P>
<P>
	He had accomplished plenty and was content to retire from the  
NFL, enjoy his family and not worry about how his 31-year-old body 
would endure more batterings by huge defensive linemen. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the Patriots called.  
</P>
<P>
	Just 16 days after signing a two-year contract with New England,  
Allen rushed for a team-high 54 yards and a 22-yard touchdown in 
last Sunday's 30-28 win over the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he knows he can do better.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was rusty,'' Allen said. ``I didn't play the way I wanted to  
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he's with the team he wants to be with in a part-time role  
he likes. That's why he decided to stay in the NFL after nine 
seasons, five with Minnesota -- two of which he spent on injured 
reserve -- and four with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't going to come back to play for (just) anybody,'' said  
Allen, winless in his only two playoff games. ``I'm tired of 
getting myself beat up and not have a chance to win, and here I've 
got a chance to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His arrival improves the Patriots chances of doing that.  
</P>
<P>
	Their running game was shattered when Robert Edwards suffered a  
knee injury that could end his career at a beach football game 
during last season's Pro Bowl festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, the Patriots had lost a player who ran for 1,115 yards  
as a rookie and figured to get better. 
</P>
<P>
	They started rebuilding their running game by drafting Kevin  
Faulk in the second round. But, at 5-feet-8 and 197 pounds, there 
were doubts about him being an every-down player. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the Jets, who focus on leaving no gaps for runners, he  
gained just 17 yards on 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Terry probably understands a little bit more about how to run  
against that style of defense, where if there's not a crease you 
just run hard and try to get two or three yards,'' quarterback Drew 
Bledsoe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Pete Carroll would like one of them to emerge as the  
primary runner, but he figures it will take a few more games before 
that sorts itself out. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, he said Faulk probably will start Sunday against  
Indianapolis. Allen, a strong inside runner, should get 
considerable playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is tougher than nails and he's a tremendous competitor,''  
Patriots offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese said. ``He's a 
downhill kind of runner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He does have a kind of north-south style. He's got his  
shoulders square to the hole,'' left tackle Bruce Armstrong said. 
``It's not a whole lot of shaking. He's just a powerful runner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen missed his entire rookie season in 1990 with Minnesota  
after reconstructive surgery on his left knee. He sat out all of 
the 1993 season after rupturing the anterior cruciate ligament in 
his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he had a streak of four seasons in which he rushed for  
more than 1,000 yards. He gained 1,309 yards in 1995, then had his 
best year in 1996 with a Redskins-record 1,353 yards rushing, 21 
touchdowns on the ground and 32 receptions. 
</P>
<P>
	His rushing totals dropped to 724 yards in 1997 and 700 last  
season, when an ankle injury limited him to 10 games. The Redskins 
released him in April. 
</P>
<P>
	At this stage of his career, he feels he and the Patriots are a  
good fit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a place where I've got to be the man,'' Allen  
said. ``I can sit back and be the role player. It's Kevin's job. 
I'm going to come in and teach him everything I know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his impressive start, Allen knows he has some learning  
to do as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to get used to the way the guys block up front,'' he  
said. ``They've got to get used to the way I run, and then things 
will get better.''

<HEADLINE>  Floyd Downgrade to Tropical Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd roared ashore today near  
Cape Fear with 110 mph wind, then quickly weakened after flooding 
the coasts of the Carolinas and Virginia with more than a foot of 
rain and chasing tens of thousands of people into shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	By 5 p.m., as the center of the storm was about 10 miles south  
of Atlantic City, N.J., it was downgraded to a tropical storm again 
as sustained winds fell to 65 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 1.4 million utility customers from South Carolina to New  
Jersey lost power, and 125,000 still had no power today in Florida. 
Flooding and power failures combined to shut down Portsmouth, Va.'s 
water supply system, which serves 110,000 customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools were closed today for more than 2 million youngsters.  
</P>
<P>
	At least seven deaths were blamed on Floyd.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been in nothing like this before,'' said Norma  
Childers, 62, a retired Rustburg, Va., nurse who came to North 
Carolina on vacation and was in a Wilmington motel when it lost 
power this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm was traveling faster as it moved across land, with  
late afternoon speed of 30 mph. Winds of 65 mph extended about 200 
miles from the center, toward the east. 
</P>
<P>
	However, since Floyd struck the coast around 3 a.m., the top  
sustained wind fell quickly, down to about 75 mph, and by late 
afternoon to 65 mph, the National Hurricane Center said. The 
minimum wind speed for a storm to be called a hurricane is 74 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	After crossing land in eastern North Carolina and the  
southeastern corner of Virginia, Floyd's dash along the coast was 
expected to take it past Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey, then 
into New York's Long Island early Friday. Disaster preparations 
were under way in New York City, Massachusetts' Cape Cod and along 
the coast of Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane warnings were posted as far north as Plymouth, Mass.  
Public schools were closed in Washington, Baltimore, all of New 
Jersey, Philadelphia and New York City. New Jersey and New York 
City each have 1 million students. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton declared a major disaster today in North  
Carolina, and released $528 million to the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency to help hurricane victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The wind set a Ferris wheel spinning on its own at Ocean City,  
Md., and overturned an empty truck on the high Chesapeake Bay 
Bridge. Virginia closed the 18-mile-long Chesapeake Bay 
Bridge-Tunnel, and New York City shut down the exposed upper deck 
of the Verrazano Narrows Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities had urged more than 2.6 million people along the  
southern Atlantic coast to clear out of Floyd's path -- the biggest 
evacuation in U.S. history -- and more people were urged to evacuate 
today in parts of Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey and Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City sent nonessential municipal employees home early  
and urged businesses to do the same because of the possibility of 
widespread mass transit outages during the rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
	However, evacuation orders were lifted today for all of the  
South Carolina coast, and thousands of evacuees crowded Georgia 
highways as they headed home. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Wilmington area, a runaway sailboat jammed the drawbridge  
linking the city to Wrightsville Beach, closing the only link to 
the barrier island, and a church steeple was toppled in Beaufort. 
</P>
<P>
	On North Carolina's Outer Banks, already punished by Hurricane  
Dennis earlier this month, Floyd blew the roofs off two motels in 
Nags Head. 
</P>
<P>
	In Duplin County, a hog farm waste lagoon ruptured and spilled  
about 2 million gallons of waste, threatening to pollute a creek 
state environmental officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Six twisters damaged homes and churches in North Carolina, but  
no injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an exciting night,'' Calvin McGowan said today as he as  
he checked his 34-foot fishing boat, the Monitor. In 1996, 
Hurricane Fran threw the boat several hundred yards into a 
neighbor's yard. 
</P>
<P>
	The heavy rain appeared to have caused more problems than the  
wind. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got the worst flooding we've ever had in a storm,''  
North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Areas of the North Carolina coast and the Myrtle Beach area of  
South Carolina had gotten up to 16 inches of rain, and a foot fell 
on Virginia's Tidewater region. Wilmington got 13 inches before the 
rain stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the deaths were in North Carolina, and one storm-related  
death was reported in South Carolina and one in Virginia. In 
addition, one person was presumed dead in the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	While the storm delivered only a glancing blow to Florida on  
Wednesday, it destroyed about 100 feet of the century-old Daytona 
Beach pier and shear off the end of piers at Jacksonville Beach and 
Flagler Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Bahamas, Floyd had smashed hundreds of homes and knocked  
out utilities. One entire village was swept out to sea but all the 
residents had been evacuated before the hurricane struck. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the small Bahamian islands had extreme damage,  
officials said, and the U.S. Coast Guard sent ships and aircraft to 
survey the damage and deliver emergency supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of airline flights had been canceled along the East  
Coast. Amtrak suspended all train service south of Washington and 
didn't expected to restore service until Friday at the earliest.

<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Bayer Corp. and Bomanite Corp. of Madera,  
Calif., are forming a joint venture to provide a line of products 
for the architectural concrete market. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh-based Bayer and Bomanite made the announcement  
Thursday, forming QC Construction Products LLC, a joint venture 
using Bayferrox iron oxide pigments to make colored ready-mix 
concrete. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayferrox iron oxide pigments, made at the Bayer production  
facility in West Virginia, are insoluble, light fast, alkali and 
lime resistant, and stable under exposure to sunlight and UV 
radiation, officials said. They can be added to ready-mix concrete 
for residential, commercial and municipal buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	``With 25 standard colors and limitless custom colors, there's  
virtually no architectural concrete color challenge that QC 
Construction Products can't solve,'' said John L. Williams, 
president of Bayer's Coatings and Colorants Division.

<HEADLINE> Financier Keating Wins Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Financier Charles Keating, released from  
prison earlier this year after admitting federal fraud charges, won 
a federal appeals court ruling Thursday against a prosecution 
attempt to reinstate his state fraud convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 2-1 decision, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed  
with a federal judge that Keating's Los Angeles Superior Court 
convictions on charges of defrauding investors in the parent 
company of Lincoln Savings &AMP; Loan, American Continental Corp., were 
tainted by flawed jury instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Lance Ito's instructions improperly allowed the jury to  
convict Keating without deciding whether he intended to swindle the 
investors, the court said. A dissenting judge said Keating's 
fraudulent intent was established by ``absolutely overwhelming 
evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The investors, many of them elderly, lost nearly $200 million  
when American Continental's unsecured ``junk'' bonds turned out to 
be worthless. Taxpayers lost $3.4 billion in the collapse of 
Keating's Lincoln Savings. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating, who became a symbol of the S&AMP;L scandals of the 1980s,  
was convicted of separate charges in state and federal courts. He 
also owes $1.5 billion in damages to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	His federal convictions, for defrauding Lincoln and its  
investors, were overturned on the grounds that the jury had 
improperly heard about his Superior Court convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors then accepted his guilty plea this April to  
three counts of wire fraud and one count of bankruptcy fraud. The 
75-year-old financier was freed after serving nearly five years of 
a 12 1/2-year federal sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	His state sentence was 10 years, running at the same time as his  
federal term, and he had about six months to serve before parole 
when the state convictions were set aside in 1996 by U.S. District 
Judge John Davies. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Attorney General Sanjay Kumar said he disagreed with the  
court and wouldn't rule out an appeal, though no decision has been 
made. ``As a prosecutor, you want to see that justice is done,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating lawyer Stephen Neal said, ``I would hope they would have  
the good sense now to give up and move on to other things.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Reno Condemn Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans must find a way to protect young  
people -- ``as if it were our own children being targeted'' -- 
President Clinton said Thursday as he and Attorney General Janet 
Reno decried the latest deadly shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yet again, we have seen a sanctuary violated by gun violence,  
taking children brimming with faith and promise and hope before 
their time,'' Clinton told reporters at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we have to redouble our efforts to protect our  
children,'' the president said. He expressed sadness for 
Wednesday's attack on Wedgwood Baptist Church in Fort Worth, where 
a gunman killed seven worshippers and wounded seven others before 
killing himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we have to act as if it were our own children being  
targeted,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, during her weekly briefing, Reno also deplored the  
carnage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thought of gunfire in a place of worship should be  
inconceivable. But for families, for others last night, the 
inconceivable became a reality,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1999 alone, we have watched as innocent people were gunned  
down while attending school, while walking home from a church or 
synagogue, while playing at a summer camp, while working in their 
offices, while delivering mail and now while worshiping in their 
church,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who has urged Congress to pass laws restricting sales  
at gun shows and requiring childproof locks, made no mention of gun 
control Thursday. But he said the attack underscores the need to 
address a rise in gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that there is nothing we can do to assure that this  
will never happen,'' Clinton said. ``But there is a lot more we can 
do to assure it will happen more rarely. I can only hope that the 
shock of this event will spur that kind of action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno, meantime, said gun control must be among the steps to  
lessen violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope that people would look, not just at what handguns  
have done to America this year, not in the context of this case, 
but what handguns have done to America over the last many years, 
and that this nation would listen to its people who again and again 
cry out ... asking government to make sure that we take reasonable 
steps to ensure that guns are not placed in the hands of people who 
are not lawfully entitled to have them,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Phila. Mayor Wooed for DNC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Philadelphia Mayor Edward G. Rendell is  
reportedly being courted by Vice President Al Gore to take a top 
position with the Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very capable person who is a great leader, not only  
among Democrats but independents (and) independently thinking 
Republicans,'' Gore said Thursday night on ``Larry King Live,'' 
while not confirming the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been a fantastic mayor -- one of the best -- and he brings  
people together,'' he said. ``I would hope that he'd play a 
significant role of some kind, but it's premature to talk about 
specifics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rendell spokesman Kevin Feeley and DNC officials did not return  
calls on Thursday seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	David Yarkin, another Rendell spokesman, told The Washington  
Post that his boss had not been offered the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Friends of his from the party have talked to him about it and  
asked him if he'd be interested in the DNC position if a vacancy 
existed,'' Yarkin said. ``He said, 'I would consider it 
strongly.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Rendell, who will leave office at the end of the year,  
reportedly caught the attention of Gore with his successful push to 
persuade the Republican Party to hold its 2000 national convention 
in Philadelphia and by chairing a Gore fund-raiser in June that 
raised $450,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's advisers reportedly are concerned about the amounts of  
money raised by GOP front-runner Texas Gov. George W. Bush and fear 
that Gore will deplete many of his resources, the newspaper 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore campaign spokeswoman Kiki Moore disputed that account of  
the sentiment among Gore's staff and advisers and said they are not 
worried about what their current or probable opponents are doing. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush raised $37.2 million through June 30 and Gore raised $17.5  
million through the same period, according to Federal Election 
Commission filings. Since then, Bush has disclosed he has raised a 
total of $50 million and Gore has not made any more information 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's decision to opt out of the presidential matching funds  
system means that he can raise and spend unlimited money for next 
year's primaries. Gore, in exchange for about $13 million in public 
funds, will be limited to less than $40 million.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Lending at Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Lending by the World Bank hit an all-time high this  
year, largely because of the financial crisis in Asia, the bank 
said in its annual report Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	It added that the level was likely to fall as the Asian crisis  
subsides. 
</P>
<P>
	World Bank loans totaled a record $28.99 billion for the fiscal  
year ended June 30, up 1.4 percent from the previous year, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	A quarter of the total, or $7.3 billion, went to human  
development projects involving education, health, nutrition, and 
social protection. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are moving away from lending for infrastructure projects  
and focusing more on human development and social issues,'' Shuzo 
Nakamura, director of the bank's Tokyo office, told a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the single largest category was assistance for financial  
reform. That represented 23 percent of lending at $6.7 billion this 
year, up from $5.8 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Asia received 34 percent of all loans, or $9.8 billion. The bulk  
of that went to strengthen financial markets and promote 
transparency, the bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the single largest borrower was Argentina, at $3.2  
billion, two of the three top borrowers were in Asia: Indonesia at 
$2.7 billion and China at $2.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear if Indonesia will remain eligible for help.  
</P>
<P>
	``Unless the political and economic situations in Indonesia  
become clearer, the bank is unlikely to agree to further policy 
related structural adjustment loans,'' Nakamura said. He cited the 
situation in East Timor and the problems with Bank Bali. 
</P>
<P>
	An initiative to reduce the debt burden of some of the world's  
poorest countries made ``considerable headway'' this year, the bank 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far seven countries -- Uganda, Bolivia, Guyana, Mozambique,  
Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast and Mali -- have qualified for debt relief 
packages estimated to be worth $3.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Debt relief for developing countries and the World Bank's  
financial status are likely to be central topics at the annual 
meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in 
Washington starting Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be necessary to call for additional contributions from  
member countries so this (debt relief) commitment can be made,'' 
Nakamura said. 
</P>
<P>
	By region, lending to Latin America and the Caribbean reached  
$7.7 billion, up 28 percent from the previous year. Much of the 
money went for emergency relief following Hurricane Mitch, the bank 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Loans to Europe and Central Asia increased 34 percent, to $5.29  
billion, with the bank helping Russia and the other former 
communist nations undertake structural reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Middle East and North Africa lending soared 63 percent, to $1.58  
billion, mainly in support of economic reforms to increase 
private-sector development and open economies to global trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Loans to African nations rose 28 percent to $2.2 billion. There  
the World Bank focused on private sector development to accelerate 
economic growth and programs to promote government responsibility 
and social welfare.

<HEADLINE> Los Angeles Police Suspend 11 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Internal investigations revealed police  
officers have been involved in criminal activity ranging from drug 
dealing to keeping quiet about comrades' misbehavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten officers and a supervisor have been suspended with pay as a  
result of the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not like to label the LAPD as corruption-prone,''  
Chief Bernard Parks said Wednesday. ``I think we have a small 
number of officers that have chose to in some instances tarnish 
their badge'' 
</P>
<P>
	The police department declined to detail the allegations against  
the suspended officers, but unidentified sources quoted by the Los 
Angeles Times said they are suspected of a variety of crimes, from 
active participation in drug deals to code-of-silence violations 
that allowed delinquent behavior to go unpunished. 
</P>
<P>
	No criminal charges have been filed, police spokesman Don Cox  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the suspended officers worked at one point in the Rampart  
station, which handles one of the largest immigrant neighborhoods 
in the city, Parks said. Also suspected is a former officer 
recently fired by the department. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the alleged crimes was uncovered during an internal  
investigation of a 1996 police shooting of a man who allegedly 
pointed a gun at officers, the department said. Javier Ovando, 19 
at the time, was later convicted of assault. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge ordered Ovando released from state prison today at the  
request of prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The case is so hopelessly compromised by the actions of the  
arresting officers and the officers who testified at the trial that 
the case must be dismissed in the interest of justice,'' said Sandi 
Gibbons, spokeswoman for the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Information implicating the officers also stemmed from the case  
of former officer Rafael Antonio Perez, 32, who pleaded guilty to 
stealing more than eight pounds of cocaine from an evidence locker. 
He is awaiting sentencing.

<HEADLINE>  Hurricane Floyd Hits N.C. Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd tore ashore today near  
Cape Fear with winds of 110 mph, flooding the coasts of North and 
South Carolina as tens of thousands of people huddled in shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	The eye of the huge storm arrived on the U.S. mainland at about  
3 a.m., preceded by hours of violent weather that included more 
than a foot of rain and several tornadoes. More than 480,000 
utility customers in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia 
were without power. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been in nothing like this before,'' said Norma  
Childers, 62, a retired Rustburg, Va., nurse who came to North 
Carolina on vacation and was in Wilmington's Marriott Courtyard 
Hotel when it lost power this morning. ``I'm getting too much fuss 
from my children. They're at home. They think that's where I'm 
supposed to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 8 a.m., the storm was centered 40 east of Greenville and  
moving at 23 mph to the north-northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane was expected to churn across southeastern  
Virginia, then out to sea along the coasts of Maryland, Delaware 
and New Jersey before nearing New York's Long Island early Friday. 
Disaster preparations were being made in New York City, 
Massachusetts' Cape Cod and along the coast of Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane warnings were posted as far north as Plymouth, Mass.  
Public schools were closed for the day across New Jersey and in New 
York City. 
</P>
<P>
	In Portsmouth, Va., flooding from the storm and power failures  
combined to shut down the city's water supply system early today, 
police Sgt. Elizabeth Romero said. The system supplies 110,000 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The rain had stopped near Wilmington. There were still brisk  
gusts, and black clouds floated quickly overhead, but the sun 
already was poking through. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the Intercoastal Waterway in Wilmington, porpoises gently  
swam seaward past a 34-foot fishing boat that was thrown onto land 
across from Wrightsville Beach island. Surprisingly, there appeared 
to be little other damage on the mainland, aside from some road 
flooding and buckled piers. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities had urged more than 2.6 million people along the  
southern Atlantic coast to clear out of Floyd's path -- the biggest 
peacetime evacuation in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds like people are taking this seriously indeed and  
we're quite please with that,'' said forecaster Jack Beven at the 
National Hurricane Center. 
</P>
<P>
	While the storm delivered only a glancing blow to Florida and  
Georgia on Tuesday and Wednesday, it still forced the cancellation 
of hundreds of airline flights. Amtrak suspended all train service 
south of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	One death was attributed to the storm in North Carolina -- a  
person died when a car hydroplaned on wet roads Wednesday afternoon 
and crashed. A second person was presumed dead after being swept 
away by flooding near Greenville. One person was missing in the 
Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	When Floyd hit the coast near Cape Fear -- about 25 miles south  
of Wilmington -- the Category 2 storm was moving north-northeast at 
20 mph. Floyd's winds were down from a peak of nearly 155 mph at 
its core when it battered the Bahamas and were expected to weaken 
as it moved over land. 
</P>
<P>
	By nightfall Wednesday, areas of the North Carolina coast had up  
to 16 inches of rain. Wilmington got 13 inches of rain, flooding 
streets and low-lying areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Two twisters damaged homes and churches, but no injuries were  
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	As the storm passed, there were a few trees down and limbs on  
roadways in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
	Calvin McGowan smoked a fat cigar as he checked to see how his  
34-foot fishing boat, the Monitor, weathered the storm. In 1996, 
during Hurricane Fran, the boat was thrown several hundred yards 
and wound up upside down in a neighbor's yard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an exciting night. The sun's coming up now, so it'll be  
an exciting day,'' he said. ``Today's the day. Well, yesterday was 
the day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane-strength gusts of 80 mph earlier buffeted Charleston,  
S.C., and more than 200,000 people in the area lost power. More 
than 15 inches of rain fell on Myrtle Beach by midnight, and 
authorities said they had never seen such severe flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, in northern and central Florida, Floyd snapped power  
lines, smashed piers into driftwood and knocked out electricity to 
300,000 people. About 350 miles off the coast, the Navy and Coast 
Guard rescued eight people whose tugboat sank in 30-foot seas 
churned up by the hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	But Floyd made a northward turn that spared Florida and Georgia  
the catastrophic damage many had feared. NASA's Kennedy Space 
Center and its four shuttles were largely unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Hurley, checking into a Wilmington shelter with his wife  
and two children, said his family stayed home for Hurricanes Fran 
and Bertha in 1996, but not for Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	``They talk like this one is going to be pretty mean,'' he said.  
``It's got everybody shook up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Myrtle Beach authorities imposed a 3 p.m. curfew and turned off  
the water supply. The hospital sent its patients inland but kept a 
doctor and three nurses on emergency duty. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges banned price gouging on essential  
items, threatening fines up to $100 or 30 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time South Carolina took a direct hit from a major  
hurricane was almost exactly 10 years ago, when Hugo struck near 
Charleston with 135 mph winds. The storm killed 29 people and 
caused $5.9 billion in damage, the most costly hurricane to hit the 
U.S. mainland until Hurricane Andrew hit Florida in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Wilmington Marriott, Lynn and Gail Wilmer of Lynchburg,  
Va., sat with Ms. Childers as the storm roared outside. The three 
friends had arrived for a vacation on the beach, only to be forced 
into Wilmington on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilmer, 54, in his stocking feet, was recharging an oxygen  
concentrator on the generator lighting the lobby -- the hotel's only 
power. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as this is over with, I'm heading back up to Raleigh  
to spend some time with some friends,'' the retired restaurant 
manager said as he gasped for air. ``I've had enough of the 
beach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Wally Jones, a security guard for the hotel: ``We like Fs.  
Fran ruined us, so Floyd had to come.''

<HEADLINE>  Floyd Downgrade to Tropical Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd roared ashore today near  
Cape Fear with 110 mph wind, then quickly weakened after flooding 
the coasts of the Carolinas and Virginia with more than a foot of 
rain and chasing tens of thousands of people into shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	By 5 p.m., as the center of the storm was about 10 miles south  
of Atlantic City, N.J., it was downgraded to a tropical storm again 
as sustained winds fell to 65 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 1.4 million utility customers from South Carolina to New  
Jersey lost power, and 125,000 still had no power today in Florida. 
Flooding and power failures combined to shut down Portsmouth, Va.'s 
water supply system, which serves 110,000 customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools were closed today for more than 2 million youngsters.  
</P>
<P>
	At least seven deaths were blamed on Floyd.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been in nothing like this before,'' said Norma  
Childers, 62, a retired Rustburg, Va., nurse who came to North 
Carolina on vacation and was in a Wilmington motel when it lost 
power this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm was traveling faster as it moved across land, with  
late afternoon speed of 30 mph. Winds of 65 mph extended about 200 
miles from the center, toward the east. 
</P>
<P>
	However, since Floyd struck the coast around 3 a.m., the top  
sustained wind fell quickly, down to about 75 mph, and by late 
afternoon to 65 mph, the National Hurricane Center said. The 
minimum wind speed for a storm to be called a hurricane is 74 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	After crossing land in eastern North Carolina and the  
southeastern corner of Virginia, Floyd's dash along the coast was 
expected to take it past Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey, then 
into New York's Long Island early Friday. Disaster preparations 
were under way in New York City, Massachusetts' Cape Cod and along 
the coast of Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane warnings were posted as far north as Plymouth, Mass.  
Public schools were closed in Washington, Baltimore, all of New 
Jersey, Philadelphia and New York City. New Jersey and New York 
City each have 1 million students. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton declared a major disaster today in North  
Carolina, and released $528 million to the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency to help hurricane victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The wind set a Ferris wheel spinning on its own at Ocean City,  
Md., and overturned an empty truck on the high Chesapeake Bay 
Bridge. Virginia closed the 18-mile-long Chesapeake Bay 
Bridge-Tunnel, and New York City shut down the exposed upper deck 
of the Verrazano Narrows Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities had urged more than 2.6 million people along the  
southern Atlantic coast to clear out of Floyd's path -- the biggest 
evacuation in U.S. history -- and more people were urged to evacuate 
today in parts of Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey and Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City sent nonessential municipal employees home early  
and urged businesses to do the same because of the possibility of 
widespread mass transit outages during the rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
	However, evacuation orders were lifted today for all of the  
South Carolina coast, and thousands of evacuees crowded Georgia 
highways as they headed home. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Wilmington area, a runaway sailboat jammed the drawbridge  
linking the city to Wrightsville Beach, closing the only link to 
the barrier island, and a church steeple was toppled in Beaufort.

	``It was an exciting night,'' Calvin McGowan said today as he as  
he checked his 34-foot fishing boat, the Monitor. In 1996,

<P>
	Areas of the North Carolina coast and the Myrtle Beach area of  
South Carolina had gotten up to 16 inches of rain, and a foot fell 
on Virginia's Tidewater region. Wilmington got 13 inches before the 
rain stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the deaths were in North Carolina, and one storm-related  
death was reported in South Carolina and one in Virginia. In 
addition, one person was presumed dead in the Bahamas.

<HEADLINE> Kim Basinger in HBO Documentary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mysterious, overpowering blitzes of fear: In Kim  
Basinger's life, there have been so many. 
</P>
<P>
	But one stands out. The setting: her fourth-grade classroom at  
Alps Road Elementary in Athens, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very quiet and kids are raising their hands. But the  
teacher called on me,'' she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	Just thinking back on that moment during a recent interview,  
Basinger dislodged almost palpable dread. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stood up and I was shaking, and my mouth wouldn't move, and  
everybody stared at me, and I thought I was going to faint. I ran 
out of the classroom. It was horrible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unbeknownst to her or anyone else, Basinger was gripped by  
something called panic disorder. She still is. And however 
extraordinary her accomplishments as a star and Academy 
Award-winning actress, in one respect she remains all too common: 
She shares this affliction with as many as 28 million other 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Basinger provides a compelling case history in a new HBO  
documentary, titled simply ``Panic.'' Produced and directed by 
Eames Yates, whose credits include HBO's acclaimed ``Dead Blue: 
Surviving Depression'' of two years ago, ``Panic'' airs Friday at 8 
p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Basinger, the film visits an unemployable model in Los  
Angeles who is plagued by intermittent dizziness, shortness of 
breath, crying and terror. 
</P>
<P>
	It travels with a successful mortgage banker from Syracuse,  
N.Y., as he attempts to escape his geographic ``comfort zone'' for 
the four-hour drive to see his ailing grandmother in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet another subject: Earl Campbell, the Heisman Trophy-winning  
running back at the University of Texas who later played with the 
Houston Oilers, then fell victim to panic disorder after his 
football career ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Thinking back to when he hid in a room with the shades drawn and  
even contemplated suicide, he says, ``It wasn't any more of that 
tough stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Panic disorder comes in many forms with many causes. The film  
hears from experts who offer psychological and physiological 
theories, and try to explain to nonsufferers what the affliction is 
like. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. David Barlow, director of Boston University's Center for  
Anxiety &AMP; Research Disorders, asks us to imagine ourselves subject 
to lightning striking us two or three times a day, without warning. 
</P>
<P>
	``What would happen, of course, is that you could think of  
nothing else except: When is the next time that I'm going to be hit 
by this lightning?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Basinger agreed. ``There's a fear of fear, fear that fear will  
come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Panic disorder can result in feelings of isolation, inadequacy,  
paralysis. ``I remember how lonely I felt, and how in need of help 
I was,'' Basinger said. ``And for a length of time I couldn't find 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The breaking point, she recounts in the film, came when as a  
rising young actress she had a full-blown panic attack in a 
health-food store. She managed to get herself out to her car and 
drive home. She didn't leave again for six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Then aid came from Dr. Ronald Doctor, a clinical psychologist  
also seen in the film. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Doctor -- he gave me a new start in this life,'' Basinger  
said. ``I even had to learn how to drive again. It was quite a 
process, I'll tell you that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The good news: Whether with drugs or, as in Basinger's case, a  
behavior-modification program, panic disorder is highly treatable. 
</P>
<P>
	The bad news: Only one in four sufferers seeks help.  
</P>
<P>
	Today Basinger knows she'll never be ``cured.'' In particular,  
she declared, ``It will never be an easy task for me to get up in 
front of the public. I think I'm getting better, but it's an 
inch-by-inch process.'' She laughed. ``Not even a whole inch!'' 
</P>
<P>
	She recalled the Academy Awards in March 1998, when she won the  
supporting actress Oscar for her performance in ``L.A. 
Confidential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just absolutely scared to death,'' she said with a wry  
chuckle. ``And I knew that the next year, I had to hand the award 
out to the next winner. I don't know if I was more elated over 
winning, or more in pain over knowing that I had to come back!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The irony isn't lost on her: A terrified little girl from  
Chestnut Lane became an international celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
	``God only knows where it came from, and that's the truth,'' she  
said. ``Here I was, a kid in high school who never said a word, and 
then on the night of the Junior Miss Pageant, I stood up in the 
auditorium and sang that song from `My Fair Lady' -- 'Wouldn't It Be 
Loverly?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it was her blend of resolve and effective treatment that  
has made life loverly for Basinger. ``Panic'' is a bracing look at 
how she and others like her can succeed in spite of fear. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	`BRAVE NEW WORLD': The final program of the ABC News  
``Nightline'' series, ``Brave New World,'' features a quirky look 
at physics. Correspondent Robert Krulwich explains how atoms are 
small, quarks even smaller -- but that now, even smaller, is a new 
notion of what might compose everything in the universe: dancing, 
vibrating, pulsating ``strings.'' On the broadcast, the Emerson 
String Quartet performs Beethoven and Bach to bring alive the 
musical metaphors of String Theory. The house band They Might Be

<HEADLINE> Distributors Pick Films at Toronto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- It's deal time at the Toronto International Film  
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	``Human Traffic,'' a flashy production about British ``club  
culture,'' has been acquired by Miramax Films. ``Est-Ouest,'' a 
French-Russian collaboration starring Catherine Deneuve and 
Sandrine Bonnaire, was signed up by Sony Pictures Classics. Fine 
Line Features will be distributing ``Une Liaison Pornographique,'' 
an erotic film from Belgium, and ``Five Senses,'' a Canadian drama 
about five urbanites. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. rights are also reportedly being negotiated for ``The Big  
Kahuna,'' which stars Kevin Spacey as a fast-talking salesman; 
``But I'm a Cheerleader,'' a satire featuring Natasha Lyonne, 
RuPaul and Cathy Moriarty, and ``A Room For Romeo Brass,'' a 
lyrical British comedy about two teen-age boys and the older man 
who threatens their friendship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Buyers are being more cautious than they have in the past. But  
they seem to know what they want and to be targeting those films,'' 
Kelley Alexander, director of the festival's industry center, said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-day public festival ends Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	With more than 300 movies being shown here, Toronto is really at  
least three events in one. For major Hollywood features such as 
``American Beauty'' and ``Anywhere But Here'' it's a platform for 
early publicity. For dozens of obscure films it's the best, and 
likely last chance to find an audience. 
</P>
<P>
	In between are such movies as ``Est-Ouest,'' ``The Big Kahuna,''  
Paul Schrader's ``Forever Mine'' and Charles Burnett's ``The 
Annihilation of Fish.'' All involve established directors and/or 
stars, but begin with the festival with no United States 
distributor and sometimes no distributor at all. 
</P>
<P>
	More and more, Toronto is becoming a place to test a film's  
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Bernardo Bertolucci decided to bring his new film  
(``Besieged'') to Toronto last year instead of Cannes or Venice, 
that sent a signal to everyone,'' said Schrader, whose current work 
is an ``old-fashioned melodrama'' starring Joseph Fiennes and 
Gretchen Mol. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a public festival, that people dominate,'' Burnett added.  
``They come at nine o'clock in the morning to stand on line for a 
movie. You get a better sense of audience response here than you 
would at Cannes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Schrader virtually wore himself out getting ``Forever  
Mine'' ready for its Toronto unveiling, one of the festival's 
toughest tickets. He compressed a six-week post-production schedule 
into four weeks and only last Friday was editing in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days later, he was introducing the film to a packed festival  
theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnett, revered by peers for such works as ``Killer of Sheep''  
and ``To Sleep With Anger,'' takes a great risk with ``The 
Annihilation of Fish.'' Set in a California rooming house, the film 
stars James Earl Jones as a Jamaican immigrant and Lynn Redgrave as 
the lonely opera lover with whom he becomes involved. 
</P>
<P>
	They are both eccentric, to put it gently. Jones is pestered by  
an invisible demon whose power is so convincing that Redgrave ends 
up refereeing their endless wrestling matches. Redgrave, meanwhile, 
has never married, but claims that her great love is the equally 
invisible and definitely dead composer Giacomo Puccini. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching this movie to a Hollywood studio seems laughable: a  
deliberately-paced love story about a peculiar, elderly and 
interracial couple, neither of them played by box office stars. But 
a successful tryout at Toronto, where audiences applauded loudly 
for Burnett's film, could change some minds. 
</P>
<P>
	``People really, really love this film,'' Alexander said. ``A  
number of companies were interested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The risk, of course, in opening your movie at a public festival  
is that the public may not like it. For every publicized success -- 
such as Robert Duvall's ``The Apostle,'' a huge favorite two years 
ago -- there's a failure soon forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had the Neve Campbell feature, `Hairshirt,' here last  
year,'' said festival director Piers Handling. ``They came looking 
to have an `Apostle' experience. They had all the industry people 
here and the film just disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to turn around a first impression. If a film works,  
it works. If it doesn't you're probably toast.''

<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Hurricane Gert whipped up 145 mph winds about 2,200  
miles out at sea Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said it will probably curve east of Bermuda and stay  
away from the East Coast.

	At 11 a.m. EDT, Gert -- the fourth Category 4 hurricane of the  
Atlantic season -- was about 575 miles east of the Leeward Islands, 
moving west-northwest at 9 mph. 
</P>

	The hurricane was about 350 miles wide with a distinct eye and  
could widen as the storm enters the same atmospheric conditions of 
weak upper-level winds and warm ocean water that produced Floyd's 
huge proportions, said National Hurricane Center meteorologist

<HEADLINE> Energy Sec. Sets Lie Test Example </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Making good on a promise, Energy Secretary  
Bill Richardson has taken a polygraph test, answering such 
questions as whether he had ever been a spy or had unauthorized 
contact with foreign intelligence operatives. 
</P>
<P>
	No results were provided, but presumably he passed.  
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Wednesday, Richardson urged nuclear weapons  
scientists to do the same and not worry about the tests, which have 
become the subject of intense controversy and concern among the 
scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to the recent controversy over allegations of  
Chinese spying and lax security at weapons labs, the Energy 
Department plans to require some 5,000 scientists with access to 
nuclear secrets -- both at the labs and elsewhere in the department 
-- to submit to polygraph tests focused on security matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson took the polygraph Tuesday, the same day a number of  
scientists at the Livermore National Laboratory in California 
criticized the tests at an Energy Department hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	One scientist, David Dearborn, said the tests ``threaten our  
honor and integrity'' and are an ``intrusion to our right of 
privacy.'' Others questioned their accuracy and said the 
requirement will make it harder to attract top scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said Wednesday the scientists should not worry.  
</P>
<P>
	``I took the test. It was administered effectively, efficiently.  
It's easy and I believe scientifically sound,'' he said. ``I 
respect the views of some of the lab scientists. But I think they 
have nothing to worry about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I fail to understand their concerns,'' he continued. ``None of  
the questions involve lifestyles and (they) are properly focused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When visiting the Los Alamos weapons lab in New Mexico in June,  
Richardson was asked by a questioner why he wasn't taking a 
polygraph when the scientists were expected to do so. Taken aback 
for a moment, he finally promised that he too he would take the 
test. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then the polygraphs issue has become the most sensitive  
part of Richardson's wide-ranging program to enhance security in 
response to the months of controversy over the allegations of 
spying at government weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Richardson acknowledged in a meeting with reporters  
that he had gotten resistance ``from all sides'' on the polygraph 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed regulation that is expected to be issued  
soon, scientist working with top-secret nuclear information will be 
asked a limited, narrowly focused series of questions. They include 
if the persons had ever committed espionage, committed sabotage or 
terrorism, illegally disclosed classified information, or ever had 
any unauthorized contact with a foreign intelligence service. 
</P>
<P>
	If any of the four answers raises a red flag, a more complex  
test would have to be taken and the individual would be subject to 
an FBI investigation, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a proposal to reorganize the Energy Department and  
create a largely independent nuclear weapons agency moved another 
step forward in Congress. The reorganization was included in a 
defense spending bill that passed the House on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate is expected to approve the bill next week.  
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said he planned soon to discuss the legislation with  
President Clinton and ``most likely'' recommend a veto. While the 
defense measure passed the House 375-45, Richardson said he was 
heartened that 139 lawmakers, mostly Democrats, expressed concern 
that the agency was being given too much autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson has said the proposal as crafted in the defense bill  
``endangers health, safety and environmental oversight'' of the 
nuclear weapons program and would jeopardize security and 
counterespionage improvements he already has made. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, one of the authors of the proposed  
DOE reorganization, said the new agency will ``establish a clear 
chain of command ... where accountability is no longer a question'' 
when it comes to the nuclear weapons labs and security. He said it 
maintains all the current environmental safeguards.

<HEADLINE> Group To Auction Indie Films </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Lights! Camera! Auction? A business group  
plans to stage the first-ever live auction of movies, helping 
hungry independent filmmakers do deals with distributors. 
</P>
<P>
	Art in Motion, a partnership between a Chicago entertainment  
lawyer and two Mexican producers, began soliciting movies Thursday 
from filmmakers for the auction scheduled for March 3 in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The project, known as Films4Auction, will offer 20 movies to the  
top bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Sellers might be unknown filmmakers who have shopped their  
movies around the film festival circuits without landing a 
distributor, said Hal Kessler, the lawyer and partner in Art in 
Motion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see a lot of people involved in independent film projects  
and I can see their frustration'' trying to sell their movies, said 
another partner, Ramiro Gonzalez. ``This is another door for them 
to the distributors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buyers might be anyone from top studios to small distributors,  
and the films could be bought for theatrical, television or video 
release, Kessler said. They could come away with a steal, picking 
up an indie gem at a bargain price, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Distributors always are on the lookout for a breakthrough  
independent hit. ``The Blair Witch Project,'' shot for about 
$60,000, has grossed $136 million for Artisan Entertainment, which 
picked it up for $1 million at the Sundance Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're likely to get is a filmmaker whose tremendously  
valiant efforts to ruin many soles of shoes peddling their product 
for a year haven't paid off,'' Kessler said. ``It's that filmmaker 
who'll say to us, 'before I put my movie on a shelf, I want you to 
try to sell it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The auction will have safeguards to protect filmmakers from  
getting sold short. Filmmakers can set a reserve, the minimum price 
they will accept for their movies, and refuse to sell if bids fall 
below that. 
</P>
<P>
	Films could sell for as little as $75,000 or more than $1  
million if bidding becomes fierce, said Ricardo Del Rio, another 
partner with Art in Motion. The group figures the average sale 
price might be about $175,000 to $250,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The auction format may smooth over some frustrations first-time  
filmmakers go through in searching for distributors on the festival 
circuit, Del Rio said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're talking about here is fairness in a game that was  
controlled by the buyers,'' Del Rio said. ``Filmmakers will have a 
fair chance to have their picture shown, first of all, and to have 
people compete for a decent or fair price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Auction buyers would get distribution rights, while filmmakers  
would retain rights for sequels, novels or stage productions based 
on the movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Art in Motion will take a 10 percent commission on films sold,  
while buyers will pay an additional 10 percent over the selling 
price to the auctioneer, William Doyle Galleries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Auctions are offering everything from jewelry to real  
estate,'' said Louis Webre, vice president of marketing for the 
auction house. ``Film is just a natural for auction. It's not as 
out in left field as you would think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ads seeking submissions will appear in film trade publications  
and be distributed at film festivals, Art in Motion partners said. 
</P>
<P>
	Entrants must pay a $1,500 fee if they submit movies before Nov.  
13 and $1,750 after that. A filmmaker will get that fee back if the 
film is sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Art in Motion will pick the top 20 for auction and will screen  
the movies for potential buyers a few days before the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucius Barre, an independent-film promoter shopping movies this  
week at the Toronto Film Festival, said some distributors might be 
uncomfortable with the auction format, where they might have to 
make spot decisions on how much they are willing to pay for a film. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I will say nothing but encouraging things about this  
method,'' Barre said. ``There's a lot of worthwhile films that have 
fallen through the cracks, and this idea, whether or not you think 
it will fly, is a way of diversifying how we communicate between 
film buyers and sellers.''

<HEADLINE> Mandatory Graduation Tests Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Less than half of the nation's states require  
students to pass a test to get out of high school, but Education 
Secretary Richard Riley says all states need these exit exams. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley, a former South Carolina governor, once believed such  
tests were unfair to minority students who received inferior 
instruction under segregation. 
</P>
<P>
	But today's education system is ready for rigors of high  
standards for all children, Riley told a National Press Club 
audience here in the fifth of his annual back-to-school talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our schools need to give this growing number of young people  
both the capacity to do college-level work and the essential skills 
to prosper in our new economy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the tests won't be successful if students are not prepared  
to take them or if they are used as clubs to keep struggling 
students down. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still seem to be using America's high schools as sorting  
machines, tagging and labeling young people as successful, run of 
the mill or low achievers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His focus on high schools comes at a time when record-breaking  
school enrollments over the next decade will bring 1.3 million 
additional students in 9th grade through 12th grade. He said states 
and local school districts need long-term plans to prepare for the 
influx of high school-age children. Their teachers also need 
special attention, he said, calling for four to six week of extra 
training, which equals summer vacation for most children. 
</P>
<P>
	And he said teachers should be paid more.  
</P>
<P>
	Currently, 19 states require students to pass exit exams to  
graduate high school. Another seven plan tests by 2003. Federal law 
does not require high school tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald N. Tirozzi, executive director of the National  
Association of Secondary School Principals, said schools need extra 
help if these tests are to become a national standard. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time has truly come to find out what kids don't know. That  
information is important and meaningful as long as we have the 
resources to help the kids,'' Tirozzi said in an interview after 
Riley's speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Reciting a wish list, Riley also called for every high school  
student to be fluent in a foreign language by graduation, parents 
to curb their teens' working hours to 20 hours a week and states to 
provide more teacher training, advanced high school courses -- and 
mental health counseling amid concerns over school violence 
following April's shooting at a Littleton, Colo., high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley also called on Congress to increase funding for Clinton  
Administration initiatives that include federal money to build 
schools and hire 100,000 new teachers over seven years. Congress is 
set to renew the bulk of the nation's federal education laws this 
year.

<HEADLINE> General Mills Earnings Up 9 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN VALLEY, Minn. (AP) -- Strong sales of Cheerios, Wheaties  
and Kix and improvement in international sales helped General Mills 
Inc. boost earnings 9 percent in its first fiscal quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The results Thursday matched Wall Street expectations. In  
afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, General Mills was 
up 50 cents a share at $84.06 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The food company earned $158.5 million, or $1.01 a share, for  
the quarter ended Aug. 29, compared with $145.0 million, or 92 
cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 7 percent to $1.57 
billion, from $1.47 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Sanger, chairman and chief executive, said the results  
reflected ``strong unit volume growth, margin improvement and an 
increased earnings contribution from our international 
operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect the same combination of factors to drive low  
double-digit growth in earnings per share for the full 2000 fiscal 
year,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	General Mills said market share for Big G cereals grew to more  
than 26 percent in the quarter in volume terms and to 32 percent in 
dollars, spurred by strong sales of its established brands plus the 
company's new Honey Nut Chex, NesQuik and Sunrise cereals. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoplait and Colombo yogurt captured 33 percent of the market  
during the quarter, up 4 points. Sales of Pop Secret popcorn, 
Nature Valley granola bars and fruit snacks also were up, but those 
gains were offset by weak performance of Bugles and other snack 
bars, the company said, leaving total snacks sales volume below 
last year's first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite weakness in the Russian market, General Mills said its  
international earnings grew at a double-digit rate.

<HEADLINE> Tom Lehman Laments for John Daly  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ENDICOTT, N.Y. (AP) -- On a day when Tom Lehman was trying to  
focus on his golf game for the upcoming Ryder Cup, he took time out 
to consider the plight of his friend, John Daly. 
</P>
<P>
	Callaway Golf said Wednesday that Daly had reneged on a deal to  
stay away from alcohol and gambling. The company tore up his 
contract after Daly refused its offer to help him with his 
addictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it's not true,'' Lehman said after the first round of  
the B.C. Open was postponed by rain from Hurricane Floyd. ``It 
would be very sad. It's sad enough that Callaway yanked its 
sponsorship, although I think they've been very patient with John. 
I hope it's not true that he's drinking again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Callaway declined to say when or where Daly started drinking and  
gambling again, only that it was confirmed by company employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of sadness around here,'' Callaway spokesman  
Larry Dorman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Callaway took Daly on when everyone else abandoned him, putting  
its Big Bertha products into the hands of a player who has led the 
PGA Tour in driving distance every year but one since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	But in 19 events this year, Daly has missed the cut seven times,  
withdrawn four times and finished in the top 50 only four times.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Backers Once Fought Ethanol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- An environmental group that endorsed  
former U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley's presidential bid once went to court 
to block the federal subsidy for ethanol -- hugely popular among 
farm groups in Iowa, public records show. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the group has pushed the government to require  
special labeling for foods containing genetically engineered crops. 
Supporters say the best way out of the current farm crisis is 
improving farm research, including genetic engineering. 
</P>
<P>
	Both of the group's positions are unlikely to find favor with  
farm interests in Iowa, site of the presidential caucus that will 
initiate the 2000 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The political action committee for Friends of the Earth on  
Wednesday endorsed Bradley, a former senator from New Jersey, over 
Vice President Al Gore, for the Democratic nomination. The group is 
an environmental network operating in 63 countries and with 20,000 
members in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethanol subsidy is popular in farm states because distilling  
ethanol creates new markets for corn and can help prop up prices at 
a time when commodity prices are at historic low levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem for Bradley is there have been other incidents  
that have left farmers skeptical of his commitment to ethanol,'' 
said Paulee Lipsman, a member of the Democratic National Committee 
and a legislative staffer. ``Ethanol is obviously very popular 
right now given the condition of farm prices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commodity prices are at historic low levels right now.  
</P>
<P>
	The environmental group has been an opponent of ethanol, joining  
with other groups in filing a lawsuit against the U.S. Treasury 
Department in an effort to block the tax credit given to ethanol 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
	In that lawsuit, the group said the tax credit would boost  
demand for ethanol and that would increase the number of acres 
needed for farming, damaging the environment. That lawsuit was 
dismissed, and a federal appeals court upheld the dismissal in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethanol is alcohol that's distilled from corn and blended with  
gasoline to create a fuel that supporters say burns cleaner than 
traditional gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics dispute that analysis and claim the tax subsidy goes  
mainly to a few large ethanol producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said he was studying the issue but  
said campaign endorsements are based on an overall record and not 
specific items. 
</P>
<P>
	``The endorsement clearly reflected their support of his overall  
record,'' Hauser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Explaining the environmental group's record is Bradley's latest  
brush with the ethanol issue. As a senator, Bradley voted against 
the ethanol tax subsidy, though he says he supports the tax credit 
as a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said his responsibility as a senator required him to  
vote against the subsidy because it would have increased gasoline 
prices in New Jersey. He said he has a different constituency as a 
candidate for the presidential nomination.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan's Campaign Needs Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pat Buchanan is in his campaign element as the  
challenger, the fierce, blunt, sometimes belligerent conservative, 
taking on the Republican hierarchy and its preferred presidential 
nominees. 
</P>
<P>
	He has done it twice before, losing but marking -- some say  
scarring -- the men who were nominated in 1992 and 1996, both of 
them then beaten by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	But so far in this third try, it has not caught on. The polls  
rank him down the list of the nine-candidate field in the primary 
preference polls, money is short, and he only can protest what he 
calls an establishment rush to install Texas Gov. George W. Bush as 
the 2000 nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	So there is nothing to lose, and potentially, a treasury and a  
forum to gain, by bolting the Republican Party to seek the 
nomination of the Reform Party next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning that would take another kind of campaign, and not an  
inexpensive one, because party rules would require him to qualify 
for the ballot in 29 states where there will not automatically be a 
Reform line on the 2000 ballot. Or at least make the effort, with 
petitions and signature drives like those Ross Perot used to get 
the party started. 
</P>
<P>
	There also are political hurdles -- Gov. Jesse Ventura of  
Minnesota, the party's only major office holder, calls Buchanan a 
retread, and is talking about real estate magnate Donald Trump, who 
says he may run. Perot has not said he will not. 
</P>
<P>
	With a Buchanan ticket, the Reform Party would be taking on his  
antiabortion and other social issue stands, topics its leaders have 
so far avoided, wary of the divisions that beset Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	So winning the nomination in a sort of national primary by mail,  
phone and Internet next summer would be no sure thing. 
</P>
<P>
	But with it, Buchanan would head a ticket entitled to some $12.6  
million in federal campaign funds, reflecting Perot's showing in 
the 1996 election. He also could try to claim a spot in the 2000 
presidential campaign debates, as Perot did before. That is the 
kind of platform on which Buchanan is most formidable, and 
practiced. TV commentary is his between-campaigns profession. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if I can get three debates face-to-face, 90 minutes  
with Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush, I can be and I will be the next 
president of the United States,'' Buchanan said on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	That outcome is more than improbable, given the strength of the  
center in presidential elections, and the history of third party 
candidates, all of whom have run third since Theodore Roosevelt, 
second in 1912. 
</P>
<P>
	No third candidate has won an electoral vote by carrying a state  
since George Wallace in 1968. Perot got 19 percent of the popular 
vote in 1992, but did not carry a state. He got 8.5 percent in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan says he is heading toward running for the Reform Party  
nomination, and will decide within a month. He called it an 
agonizing decision, a major breach for him as a Republican, but he 
party loyalty has not been his priority in his prior campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	In this one, he said he could not commit to support a Bush  
ticket and that it would not be much different from the Democrats'. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a one party system masquerading as two, Buchanan says, and  
there should be a real opposition party -- the one that runs him. 
</P>
<P>
	Given what he already has said, it would be almost impossible  
for Buchanan to reverse field and return to the Republican 
campaign. ``It's time, maybe, to take a bye in the regionals and go 
straight to the finals,'' he said in one of his TV interviews that 
are building toward the switch. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Buchanan won his only Republican primary, narrowly  
upsetting Bob Dole in New Hampshire. After Dole's comeback that 
spring, Buchanan conceded the GOP nomination -- and said pointedly 
that he was not actively pursuing third party candidacy. ``Our 
options are open,'' he said then. He eventually endorsed Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan's startling challenge in New Hampshire in 1992 was an  
early sign of the weakness in President George Bush's unsuccessful 
election campaign. Buchanan got 37 percent of the vote against the 
president, who said he got the message of dissatisfaction. Buchanan 
campaigned on, finally endorsing the president at the GOP 
convention in a fiery conservative speech critics called divisive 
and damaging. 
</P>
<P>
	That was a problem for the father. Now Buchanan could be one for  
his son, George W., because conservative third party votes would 
most likely come from the Republican side. 
</P>
<P>
	A poll released Wednesday by the Pew Research Center showed Bush  
at 50 percent, Gore 35, with 9 percent saying they would vote for 
Buchanan as the Reform Party candidate. But 60 percent of the 
people who said they would prefer Buchanan in a three-way contest 
said they would choose Bush in a two-party election.

<HEADLINE> Archdiocese Sues Former Monsignor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A former monsignor relieved of his duties  
amid sexual abuse and fraud allegations has been sued by the San 
Francisco Archdiocese, which claims he embezzled $252,000 from the 
church. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed last week in San Francisco Superior Court,  
claims former Roman Catholic Monsignor Patrick O'Shea set up 
legitimate church accounts, then used the money for his personal 
properties and debts and falsified financial reports to the church. 
</P>
<P>
	The diocese also is trying to ensure that a $187,000 trust fund  
O'Shea set up in his own name goes to the church. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Shea's lawyer, Joseph O'Sullivan, says the allegations date to  
1995 and a three-year statute of limitations has expired. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney John Christian, representing the diocese, said  
Wednesday that the statute of limitations was not a concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been careful in constructing our complaint,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Charges of fraud, grand theft and falsifying tax returns are  
still pending against O'Shea, who was removed from his priestly 
duties in 1995 amid allegations he had molested boys between 1964 
and 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the church agree pay $2.5 million to 15 men who said  
they had been molested by O'Shea and two other San Francisco-area 
priests. 
</P>
<P>
	Criminal sex abuse charges against O'Shea had been dropped  
because the six-year statute of limitations had expired, then 
refiled when a state law extended the statute for molestation. 
</P>
<P>
	They were dropped again when an appeals court ruled the  
extension unconstitutional but the California Supreme Court last 
month overturned the appeals court ruling. Clarence Johnson, a 
spokesman for San Francisco District Attorney Terence Hallinan, 
said Hallinan will likely refile charges against O'Shea.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Bulls renounced their rights Thursday  
to guard Ron Harper, a key fixture on three championship teams, and 
re-signed forward Dickey Simpkins. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls parted ways with Harper, a 13-year veteran, allowing  
them to maneuver under the salary cap. The club could re-sign 
Harper before the regular season, though that appears unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish Harp all the best in the world because he gave us  
everything that we expected him to give and more,'' general manager 
Jerry Krause said. ``But time marches on, and there comes a time 
when you have to go with the younger guys in the backcourt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harper, 35, started for the Bulls the last five seasons and was  
part of three championship teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpkins is coming off his best season when he averaged 9.1  
points and 6.8 rebounds per game. His playing time more than 
tripled following the disbanding of the championship team. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpkins was selected by the Bulls in the first round of the  
1994 draft, traded to Golden State in 1997 and then re-signed by 
Chicago before last season.

<HEADLINE> Little Suspense Before Tax-Cut Veto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans have finally  
dispatched their tax cut bill to the president and Vice President 
Al Gore promptly went to Capitol Hill to proclaim it ``dead on 
arrival at the White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In anticipation of President Clinton's certain veto, Republicans  
and Democrats held competing campaign-style rallies at opposite 
ends of the Capitol on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``A veto says no to a reduction in taxes for middle- and  
lower-income families,'' said Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman 
of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee. ``A veto says no to 
making health insurance more affordable for Americans,'' as well as 
to making child care and college more affordable, relieving the 
so-called ``marriage penalty'' and increasing individual retirement 
accounts, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., released a letter they had written Clinton 
emphasizing that the tax cut bill ``does not take one penny from 
the Social Security Trust Fund.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time for the federal government to stop robbing Social  
Security to pay for other Washington spending,'' they added. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gore, speaking an hour later, saw the issue differently.  
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have passed a ``risky tax scheme,'' he said, and  
``it is dead on arrival at the White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also lectured Republicans about their spending bills.  
``They're in charge of the country,'' he said. ``They have a 
responsibility to act responsible and use real numbers and not 
phony numbers.''

<HEADLINE> Some Markets Close Due to Hurricane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stormy weather from Hurricane Floyd led some  
financial markets to close early on Thursday, but the largest stock 
markets stayed open. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're open for business,'' said NYSE spokeswoman Diana DeSocio  
as the rains from Floyd pummeled New York. The exchange closed at 
its normal time of 4 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Stock Market, which has no trading floor but conducts  
trading electronically, also stayed open as did the smaller 
American Stock Exchange. Some employees with long commutes left 
early, causing trading volume in the markets to be lighter than 
normal. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Floyd dumped heavy rains in New York most of the day,  
and was expected to hit in force around evening, possibly flooding 
highways and train tracks. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani urged private 
businesses to close early if they could. 
</P>
<P>
	The markets of the New York Mercantile Exchange, where metals  
from silver to aluminum are traded, closed at noon, two to three 
hours earlier than normal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're worried about what will occur because of the  
hurricane,'' said Nachamah Jacobovits, spokeswoman for the 
exchange, where about 8,000 traders and staff work each day. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Board of Trade followed suit, calling a 1:05 p.m.  
halt to trading on its CRB futures contracts, a list of 17 
commodities. Night trading of futures contracts on foreign 
currencies were also shut. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have concerns about transportation issues,'' said spokesman  
Terence Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond trading also ended early in New York. The Bond Market  
Assocation closed its fixed-income markets at 1 p.m.

<HEADLINE> UN: Angolan Refugee Flow Slows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) -- The flow of refugees from Angola's  
civil war has slowed because the fighting and hunger have kept them 
from leaving the country, a top U.N. refugee official said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fewer and fewer are coming out because of the war situation  
and because they lack the physical strength to move,'' said Soren 
Jessen-Petersen of the U.N. High Commission for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Jessen-Petersen came to South Africa as part of a whistle-stop  
tour to assess the continent's refugee crisis and draw attention of 
world donors to Africa's plight. Earlier this week the assistant 
high commissioner was in Ethiopia and Kenya and he planned to stop 
next in Ivory Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Aid workers were unable to intervene, he said, because neither  
the Angolan government nor the rebel movement fighting to overthrow 
it was prepared to guarantee their safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we are close to powerless, but people are suffering in a  
way that seems indescribable,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	He estimated that about 2 million Angolans have been internally  
displaced from the countryside into the cities. Another 3 million 
rural Angolans are out of reach of aid workers because they live 
under the control of the rebel force UNITA -- a Portuguese acronym 
for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola. 
</P>
<P>
	Since fighting between the government and UNITA resumed last  
year, after four years of relative peace under a U.N.-brokered 
pact, the rebels have blown up bridges, planted land mines and 
shelled airports in major cities in an effort to choke the 
government's supply routes. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflict, which first erupted with independence from  
Portugal in 1975, is one of 14 raging in Africa, where there 
approximately seven million refugees. The number does not include 
internally displaced people like those in Angola.

<HEADLINE> No Evidence of Scholarships to IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Attorney General Griffin Bell told  
Congress today that his review of Atlanta's efforts to land the 
1996 Olympics turned up no evidence of direct payments of money or 
scholarships to International Olympic Committee members or their 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the evidence does show is that Atlanta volunteers gave  
many gifts and were eager to accommodate IOC members,'' Bell said 
in a letter to Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., chairman of the House 
commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell said Atlanta sought the 1996 games within an IOC culture in  
which ``the written rules were often ignored, never enforced and 
all the participants knew it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Atlanta's bid practices may be considered in hindsight as  
``excessive in some respects,'' Bell said. The organizers of the 
Atlanta Games ``believed then and still believe today that they 
conducted their bid within the bidding culture of the time and that 
their conduct was within the bounds of that culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell said there is no evidence in the records that Atlanta  
organizers engaged in conduct similar to that of the organizers of 
the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City, who gave scholarships and 
cash to woo IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said there may have been instances in which IOC members  
received improper cash reimbursements for airline tickets. There 
were 10 instances in which investigators could find no 
documentation for ticket reimbursements, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell said his review also found no evidence to suggest that the  
Atlanta organizers ``paid for or promoted the provision of sexual 
favors to IOC members, or that volunteers were aware of any such 
effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Upton, who released Bell's letter, said he was pleased the  
subcommittee now has a complete accounting of Atlanta's bid 
practices. He promised a further review of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``As my investigation into Atlanta continues, what has emerged  
is a pattern of troubling and disturbing events in order to secure 
these games,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta officials, who planned to discuss Bell's finding at a  
news conference in Atlanta this afternoon, asked the former 
attorney general to review their bid practices after the initial 
report they provided to Upton's panel last summer was questioned by 
congressional investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Woodruff, a spokesman for Upton, said Atlanta officials  
have agreed to release eight boxes of previously secret records 
that were turned over to the subcommittee under subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
	Those records reportedly include documents indicating that  
Atlanta organizers thought IOC members could be bribed into voting 
for the city, although no evidence has surfaced that any such 
bribes were ever offered. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial report the Atlanta organizers submitted to the  
subcommittee last June listed 38 gifts that exceeded the IOC's $200 
limit. But records subpoenaed by the panel turned up evidence of 
other gifts, and Atlanta officials then agreed to provide a more 
complete accounting of their bid activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Echols, a spokesman for Atlanta Olympic organizers, said  
Atlanta officials expect the Bell report will ``bring closure'' to 
all the questions that have been raised about the city's bid in the 
aftermath of the Salt Lake City revelations.

<HEADLINE> Report: Irish QB in Ticket Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Notre Dame is investigating a report  
that a former backup quarterback tried to sell complimentary 
tickets, a school official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	School spokesman Dennis Moore said Notre Dame learned of the  
allegations involving Eric Chappell, who was dismissed from the 
team earlier this week, several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We treat this like we treat anything. Any time we think there  
are any potential NCAA ramifications, we make a full report to the 
NCAA,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame's student newspaper, The Observer, quoted an  
anonymous source in Thursday's editions who claimed Chappell 
offered to sell him and a 1998 Notre Dame graduate two tickets for 
the Sept. 4 Notre Dame-Michigan game for $50 each. 
</P>
<P>
	The source said he had previously received free tickets from  
Chappell and other players and claimed that the 1998 graduate had 
given Chappell at least a dozen gifts over the last 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The source said he notified the athletic department after  
declining to purchase the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore wouldn't discuss the specifics of the report.  
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA Committee on Infractions, already looking at the  
football program, is expected to rule within the next several 
months whether to penalize the university over contact between a 
booster and up to a dozen players. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA spokeswoman Jane Jankowski said it would be up to the  
committee to determine whether the latest allegation would affect 
its decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bob Davie dismissed Chappell from the team earlier this  
week, saying he had violated an undisclosed team rule. 
</P>
<P>
	The senior has played in only three games during his career at  
Notre Dame and was listed third on the quarterback depth chart. He 
started last season against Southern Cal when starter Jarious 
Jackson was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Chappell, who earlier this week said his ``punishment fit the  
crime'' after he was kicked off the team, denied the allegations to 
The Observer. Phone calls by The Associated Press to his dorm room 
went unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame spokesman John Heisler said it is school policy to  
give four passes to players who make the trip for road games or 
dress for home games. 
</P>
<P>
	The players don't receive actual tickets but submit a list of  
names during the week to the school for a pass list. People on the 
list then show some form of identification to be admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Heisler said the practice doesn't violate NCAA rules, and the  
university pays for the passes out of its budget. But players are 
explicitly informed that they are not allowed to sell the passes, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an NCAA violation,'' Heisler said of selling passes.  
``That would be well known.''

<HEADLINE>  Stewart Eyes Winston Cup Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUDON, N.H. (AP) -- Rookie Tony Stewart can set a Winston Cup  
record if another swift run at New Hampshire International Speedway 
lasts long enough to carry him to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	No first-year driver has won consecutively in NASCAR's top  
division. But Stewart, coming off his first career victory, 
certainly has a great chance Sunday in the Dura Lube 300. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months ago, he dominated the Jiffy Lube 300 on the same  
1.058-mile oval. But a bad estimate of fuel mileage left him dry 
less than three laps from the end. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing is for sure, we aren't going to run out of gas  
again,'' said Stewart, a winner last Saturday night at Richmond 
International Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
	He led 118 of 300 laps at NHIS in July before falling victim to  
a needless gamble by his crew. A substantial lead would have held 
up even with a quick pit stop in the waning laps, but Stewart 
stayed on the track until his sleek Pontiac ran out of gas. 
</P>
<P>
	He has put that midsummer nightmare behind him -- along with an  
embarrassing post-race disappearing act -- and is concentrating on 
finding the same combination that made him so dominant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We brought back the same car to Loudon, and we're confident  
about our chances,'' said Stewart, who wound up 10th in the Jiffy 
Lube 300. 
</P>
<P>
	Should the same kind of dominance be expected Sunday?  
</P>
<P>
	Two-time defending race champion Jeff Gordon isn't so sure.  
</P>
<P>
	``When people beat us the way those guys did, all the teams go  
back and really go to work,'' he said. ``Everybody tries to make 
their car better while the guy that was the best won't do much 
because they had the right combination to begin with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The right stuff has been with Stewart for most of his  
much-celebrated debut season. He has finished out of the top 10 
just four times in the last 21 races, and became only the third 
rookie to win in 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite such history, Stewart's first victory seemed like more  
of a ``when'' than an ``if'' almost from the outset. But its 
arrival in his 25th career start has left the 28-year-old Hoosier 
somewhat surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	``You dream about something like this your entire life, and when  
it finally happens it's like you're still dreaming,'' said the 
former USAC and Indy Racing League champion. ``I keep waiting for 
someone to wake me up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was stunned. We all were. It was the best moment of my life  
so far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, a 47-time winner with three Winston Cup championships in  
seven years on the circuit, believes Stewart should get used to the 
feeling. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the kind of talent he has and the cars the Joe Gibbs team  
is putting under him, they're a tough combination to beat,'' Gordon 
said. ``Once you start winning, there's no telling where it's going 
to stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, Jeff Burton, who won the July race for the third year in  
a row, and Mark Martin would seem to be the most likely spoilers of 
Stewart's dream. 
</P>
<P>
	Reigning series champion Gordon figures he might have something  
for Stewart, who also could tie the late Davey Allison's 1987 mark 
of two rookie victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon usually feels comfortable at NHIS, where he and Burton  
have three career victories apiece. But Gordon seems to be a little 
more confident in the second of New England's two annual races. 
</P>
<P>
	``There must be something about running at New Hampshire at this  
time of year,'' he said. ``We've been able to hit on the setup for 
both fall races.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His chances, and those of the other top contenders, could be  
further enhanced by the remnants of Hurricane Floyd. The storm 
threatens to play havoc with the Friday schedule, meaning reduced 
practice time is likely and postponement of qualifying is possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are teams like ours who usually have a good setup for  
the track and would probably fare even better with less practice 
time,'' Gordon said. ``The others just wouldn't have much 
opportunity to make many changes.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Aviation Promises Y2K Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's aviation authority said Wednesday it can  
guarantee the safety of flights over Russian territory and of 
airport operation during the changeover to year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The deputy chief of the Russian Federal Air Transport Service,  
Viktor Galkin, said the agency's experts have checked all computer 
systems and located the components that could cause problems, the 
Interfax news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The potentially faulty equipment is being replaced, and funding  
for the work has been secured, Galkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has been slower than western nations to address the  
so-called Y2K bug, a computer programming glitch that makes older 
computers read the date Jan. 1, 2000, as Jan. 1, 1900, causing 
systems to shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	But officials said they expect no problems with crucial systems.

<HEADLINE> SEC Warns of Day-Trading Firm Abuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's chief securities regulator told  
Congress Thursday that several day-trading firms have used 
deceptive advertising to lure investors into the risky practice of 
rapidly trading in and out of stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, testified that an ongoing examination has also found 
many firms have ``extremely lax'' compliance with securities laws 
including sloppy record keeping and insufficient supervision of 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC is closely investigating some of the firms with an eye  
to possible enforcement action, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt's statements came as Congress took its first look at the  
risky practice of electronic day-trading. The hearing by the Senate 
Governmental Affairs subcommittee on investigations occurred six 
weeks after exasperated trader Mark Barton shot and killed nine 
people at two day-trading firms in Atlanta before killing himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., a member of the subcommittee, noted  
that Barton is believed to have lost nearly half a million dollars 
in his day trading -- including $153,000 in one three-day ``binge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The risks associated with day trading are extremely serious,''  
Cleland warned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Electronic Traders Association, a group representing the  
day-trading industry, refuted widespread assertions that it is a 
form of gambling and insisted that most people who undertake it 
after training do not lose money. 
</P>
<P>
	The day-trading industry has some 60 firms operating with  
hundreds of offices around the country, providing trader-customers 
with computers and high-speed hookups to electronic trading 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Day-traders, who now number several thousand nationwide, ride  
the tiniest ups and downs of the stock market, trying to squeeze 
out profits by rapidly buying and selling shares. They pay their 
host day-trading firms commissions on each trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Many day traders have abandoned their regular jobs, making them  
distinct from the 5 million or so amateur investors who 
occasionally trade on the Internet at home or at work. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC and the National Association of Securities Dealers, a  
self-policing brokers' group, have been scrutinizing 30 firms in 
the day-trading business to see if they make unrealistic promises 
of quick riches to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our preliminary findings indicate that many firms have  
extremely lax'' compliance with securities laws governing their 
capital requirements and supervision of employees, Levitt 
testified. In addition, he said, ``We observed a number of 
advertising violations'' and some sloppy record-keeping. 
</P>
<P>
	State securities regulators, particularly in Massachusetts and  
Texas, already have taken enforcement actions against several 
day-trading firms. The state regulators contend that most day 
traders are heading for losses and many are being misled by host 
firms that promise them quick riches and encourage improper loans 
to keep them trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In Barton's case, fellow day traders who had lent him money were  
among those killed in his July 29 shooting rampage, according to 
the lead investigator. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, chairwoman of the Senate panel, was  
among those who suggested day trading could be nothing more than 
gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very few Americans would think it prudent to quit their jobs  
or to cash in their retirement savings to become professional 
gamblers who support their families at a Las Vegas casino,'' Ms. 
Collins said. ``Yet the day-trading industry estimates that 4,000 
to 5,000 citizens are full-time day traders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She offered some chilling examples of losses: A 28-year-old bank  
employee in California who left his job, borrowed $40,000 on credit 
cards and lost all his money within two months; an elderly Boston 
man with severe health problems who lost $250,000 of his wife's 
savings in just a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
	But Saul Cohen, a spokesman for the New York-based Electronic  
Traders Association insisted, ``Day trading is not gambling. The 
majority of those who day trade after training do not lose money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Day traders ``neither seek nor need the protection of  
regulators,'' Cohen said. ``Day trading provides great benefits to 
the economy and to small investors everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group said its 15 member firms, which include six of the  
largest day-trading companies, ``seek to be in compliance with all 
regulations; they promote risk disclosure and avoid hype.''

<HEADLINE> The Nation's Weather  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Hurricane Floyd made landfall today and moved northward,  
disrupting the lives of millions of people along almost the entire 
East Coast, but much of the rest of the nation had quiet weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The effects of Floyd were not limited to the high wind and heavy  
rain the center of the storm brought to the Carolinas and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	The tropical moisture interacted with a frontal boundary to  
produce a large swath of rain in the northeastern United States. A 
stationary front extends from east-central Maine, south through 
central Virginia, and continues into Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	By tonight and Friday, the Northeast will also have Floyd itself  
to grapple with as the storm moves up the coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere across the country, a trough of low pressure produced  
scattered showers and thunderstorms in portions of the central and 
southern Plains early this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The strongest storms affected eastern New Mexico and the Texas  
Panhandle. On Wednesday, golf ball size hail was reported near two 
Texas towns, Wolfforth and Grassland. Storms continued in the area 
early this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Scattered showers and thunderstorms were reported in western  
Kansas and central Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Other parts of the nation enjoyed quiet weather this morning and  
in general had a forecast for the same for the rest of the day. 
Clear to partly cloudy skies and dry weather were reported in the 
Great Lakes, Ohio and Mississippi valleys, and in the Gulf Coast 
states. Fair weather also prevailed in the northern and central 
Rockies and northern Plains. Skies were variably cloudy along the 
West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest temperature in the U.S. mainland Wednesday was 104  
degrees in Blythe, Calif. The low was 27 degrees in West 
Yellowstone, Mont. The overnight low early today was 27 at Stanley, 
Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's forecast called for highs in the 60s and 70s in the  
Great Lakes, Northeast and central Plains; the 70s from the 
mid-Atlantic states to the mid-Mississippi Valley; in the 80s in 
the Southeast and lower Mississippi Valley; and in the 80s to and 
lower 100s in the Southwest.

<HEADLINE> Padres Create VP Job for Ted Simmons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Ted Simmons, an eight-time All-Star catcher and  
a former general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates, was hired 
Thursday to oversee the San Diego Padres' scouting department and 
farm system. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons, 50, was named a vice president and will report directly  
to general manager Kevin Towers. The job was created specifically 
for Simmons, who has been a special assignment scout for the 
Cleveland Indians since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't even have a short list,'' said Towers, who worked  
under Simmons with the Pirates in the early 1990s. ``It was Ted 
Simmons or nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons will begin his new job on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a nice switchback for me,'' Simmons said from St.  
Louis, where he'll continue to live. ``It's very exciting for me 
because it takes me back to the kids. The kids will do anything -- 
and I mean anything -- to get to the majors. If you get them to 
listen, and you have information to convey, you'll get it to happen 
more quickly and less painfully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres still plan to hire a farm director to replace Jim  
Skaalen, whose contract wasn't renewed. Scouting director Brad 
Sloan will remain in his job. The overhaul of the baseball 
operations included the firing of a number of minor league coaches 
and amateur scouts on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget-conscious Padres have been reviewing their overall  
operation since spring training and feel they must do a better job 
of producing home-grown talent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think we needed a little different approach, a strong,  
stiff-armed approach down there to make sure that things we teach 
at the big league level filter down,'' Towers said. ``We needed a 
guy at the top to make sure it gets done. It'll get done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Towers and president Larry Lucchino said they wanted to follow  
the example of some perennial contenders who have one person in 
charge of player development and scouting. Among them are the New 
York Yankees, who swept the Padres in last year's World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Unable to keep key free agents, the Padres failed to contend  
this year even though they raised their player payroll by about $3 
million. They've seen plenty of their young talent this year. Two 
of their top youngsters, right-hander Matt Clement and catcher Ben 
Davis, starred in Wednesday night's 4-1 win over NL East-leading 
Atlanta, the team San Diego beat for the 1998 pennant. 
</P>
<P>
	Towers called Simmons ``a real innovative guy. He's a thinker,  
always trying to get an edge. We may think we have 20 prospects, 
and he'll want to find 10 more that our scouts don't think are 
prospects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons played for St. Louis, Milwaukee and Atlanta during his  
19-year major league career and reached the World Series once, with 
Milwaukee in 1982 against the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked as St. Louis' director of player development from 1988  
until being named GM of the Pirates on Feb. 5, 1992. He resigned on 
June 16, 1993, shortly after suffering a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons helped preside over the cost-cutting moves that gutted  
the Pirates following the last of their three straight division 
titles in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres gave Simmons a three-year contract. The Padres picked  
up Towers' option for the 2000 season during spring training, and 
will soon begin talks on an extension, Lucchino said.

<HEADLINE>  Peter Paying Dividends for Giants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Giving Christian Peter a second  
chance is starting to pay big dividends for the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only have the Giants found a usable defensive lineman, Peter  
is pushing Robert Harris for his starting left tackle spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter had an outstanding game filling in for an injured Harris  
last week. The play everybody noticed was his 38-yard fumble return 
for a touchdown, a play on which he bear-hugged the ball all the 
way to the end zone. But his play against the run was even better 
as New York limited the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to 77 yards in a 17-13 
win. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter laughs a lot about the touchdown. He has taken a lot of  
grief about it from teammates and even his brother, Jason, who 
plays for the Carolina Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	After Jason saw Christian rumble down the field with both arms  
wrapped around the ball on a highlight film, he didn't hesitate to 
call him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just told me I looked slower than I did when I returned the  
one at Nebraska 95 yards,'' Christian Peter said. ``It was just a 
very fortunate play. Jessie (Armstead) made an unbelievable play 
and it bounced into my hands. Anybody could have done it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peter's road to the end zone was a lot longer than 38 yards,  
though. 
</P>
<P>
	It started more than 2 1/2 years ago when the Giants made a  
controversial decision to sign Peter as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	A New Jersey native, he had been drafted in the fifth round by  
New England in April 1996. He was released a few days later when 
the team took some flak because of his off-the-field problems. 
</P>
<P>
	During his college years, Peter was arrested for a variety of  
offenses, including a third-degree sexual assault. He also was the 
defendant in a civil suit in which a former Nebraska coed alleged 
Peter twice raped her. 
</P>
<P>
	Since joining the Giants in January 1997, Peter participated in  
a rehabilitation program that included substance abuse and 
psychological counseling, treatment for attention deficit disorder 
and a program to complete his undergraduate degree. 
</P>
<P>
	Entering his third season, Peter's game is improving. After  
making only two tackles in 1997, he had 32 last year along with a 
sack and forced fumble. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not easy, sitting out a year. Talk to anyone who did  
that,'' Peter said Thursday after the Giants finished practice for 
Sunday's game against the Washington Redskins. ``Just getting back 
into the swing of things is never easy. I think I am doing all 
right, but there is so much room for improvement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive line coach Denny Marcin said Peter played very well  
against the Bucs. He had two tackles in addition to the touchdown 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was real stout against the run,'' Marcin said, adding that  
Peter is creating more competition for playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the coach noted no starter loses his job because of  
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going out there and doing my thing,'' Peter said.  
``Robert is an unbelievable football player. When he is healthy, he 
is pretty unstoppable. I have to be ready when the time comes to 
step in and play again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The way the Giants rotate their defensive linemen, Peter is  
going to get some more chances against the Redskins.

<HEADLINE> IRS Seeks Review of Pension Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internal Revenue Service says its national  
office, not field offices, will determine whether to approve 
individual company proposals to convert traditional pension plans 
into controversial ``cash balance'' plans. 
</P>
<P>
	In a memo to IRS division chiefs, Employee Plans Division  
Director Carol Gold says that ``a number of important issues'' have 
been raised when companies convert standard pension plans to the 
cash-balance arrangements. Critics claim they violate the 1967 Age 
Discrimination in Employment Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Field offices, Gold said in her memo dated Wednesday, should  
``request technical advice before closing any determination or 
examination case'' involving such a conversion. 
</P>
<P>
	In practical terms, that means the IRS national office must  
approve them first, but it does not necessarily signal an IRS shift 
in policy against the plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Over 300 companies, including computer giant IBM, have converted  
to the cash-balance plans, which can cut costs by reducing future 
benefits to middle-aged workers while permitting younger workers a 
bigger payoff if they leave before retirement. They typically shift 
some benefits from pension plans to stock options and higher 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Following age discrimination complaints from Rep. Bernie  
Sanders, I-Vt., other lawmakers and dozens of workers, the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission this week began a broad review of 
the plans. One IRS field office last year raised questions about 
potential violation of age bias laws.

<HEADLINE> Bahamians Assess Damage From Floyd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- An entire village swept out to sea. Homes  
smashed to pieces. Half of one island's cemetery washed away. Boats 
torn apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Bahamians on Wednesday began assessing the cost of a 12-hour  
battering from Hurricane Floyd, but the full extent of the storm's 
damage was not known because reports were not in from several 
islands still without communications. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nassau, the capital on New Providence Island, airline and  
telephone service was restored Wednesday and the most visible 
damage was uprooted trees. Many Nassau residents counted their 
blessings as reports came in of the destruction on near and 
far-flung islands. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole settlement of Crossing Rock was swept away'' an  
official said of a village on Abaco Island, 60 miles north of 
Nassau. The villagers had all been evacuated earlier, and no one 
was reported missing. 
</P>
<P>
	The official, senior officer Chris Lloyd of the Bahamas Air Sea  
Rescue Association, said there were reports of one presumed death -- 
a man who was missing in northern Grand Bahama, one of three 
islands in an archipelago of 600 that took a direct hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Tinker disappeared Tuesday west of Freetown after the van  
he was riding in got caught in a storm surge and he tried to swim 
to high ground. A friend, Nelson Davis, survived. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were trying to beat the hurricane. They were trying to  
get back to their homes when they got caught,'' said police 
inspector Kendall Deveaux. 
</P>
<P>
	Several people were treated for minor injuries, including a man  
on Providence Island who fell from a roof he was trying to prepare 
for the hurricane. At least two people were hit by projectiles 
flung through the air during the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Great Abaco and tiny keys that ring its eastern periphery,  
including Man-O-War, Green Turtle and Elbow Cay, sustained 
``extreme'' damage, Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Hubert Ingraham, accompanied by U.S. Ambassador  
Arthur Schechter, flew to outlying islands Wednesday to inspect 
storm damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Entire neighborhoods on Abaco were flooded by storm surges  
whipped up by wind gusts up to 190 mph, according to Lloyd. 
</P>
<P>
	In Marsh Harbour, the main town on Abaco, wooden homes were  
flattened and reduced to debris, left only partially standing or 
turned on their sides. A U.S. Coast Guard pilot said it looked like 
one in 10 houses were destroyed in one neighborhood of Marsh 
Harbour, which was first settled by 600 loyalist officers escaping 
the American Revolution in 1783. 
</P>
<P>
	On the hard-hit eastern island of San Salvador, Club Med  
officials were trying to charter aircraft to evacuate 380 tourists 
who rode out the storm at the resort, which like many hotels was 
running on generator power. 
</P>
<P>
	San Salvador's Riding Rock Inn, one of the four biggest  
employers on the island, sustained substantial damage, government 
ZNS radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
	But most hotels reported only minor damage, including the  
sprawling Atlantis resort on Paradise Island, across a bridge from 
Nassau. 
</P>
<P>
	Impatient tourists headed to Nassau's airport hours before it  
reopened Wednesday. One group of Americans chartered a plane in 
Fort Lauderdale to come get them. Local charters were booked up or 
not operating. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been trying to leave since Monday,'' said Liz Ramos of  
Stockbridge, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	On northern Eleuthera island, where winds reached 110 mph  
Tuesday, many homes were without roofs and half the cemetery was 
washed away. Boats on Eleuthera, 100 miles east of Nassau, were 
tossed like toys onto the shore. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nassau, curious onlookers gathered at a wharf where two  
freighters were beached. Residents in the capital shoveled sand 
from homes, removed uprooted trees from streets and congratulated 
themselves on preparing well. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't play around this time, but we're still fortunate,''  
said hospital worker Gregory Roberts, echoing the sentiments of 
Florida residents who escaped the brunt of Floyd on Wednesday. 
``It's a godsend that this hurricane didn't come closer. What we 
had is nothing compared to what could have happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was small consolation for Denise Skeete, who held her  
2-year-old son, Levi, as she watched neighbors trying to remove a 
tree that had smashed her tin-roofed wooden home in half. ``I am 
just worried about getting the tree out of my living room,'' she 
said.

<HEADLINE> Summer Squall Colt Sells for $1M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- A Summer Squall colt sold for $1 million  
Thursday during the fourth day of the annual Keeneland September 
Yearling Sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloodstock agent John Adger, representing Robert and Janice  
McNair and their Stonerside Stables, made the winning bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The colt was the 23rd yearling to reach the $1 million mark  
since the sale began Monday. A year ago, in a record-setting 
Keeneland September Yearling Sale, 12 yearlings were sold for $1 
million or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeneland sold 297 yearlings Thursday for $22,478,500, an  
average of $75,685 and median of $50,000. A year ago, Keeneland 
sold 290 yearlings for $18,381,500. The average was $63,384 and the 
median $47,000. 
</P>
<P>
	After the first four days of the 11-day sale, Keeneland had sold  
1,053 yearlings for $171,439,000, an average of $162,810 and median 
of $90,000. A year ago, through the first four days, Keeneland had 
sold 1,084 for $127,199,500. The average was $117,343 and the 
median $72,000.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- One of Bob Dobo's earliest memories is  
of an emergency shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	``My experience started with Hurricane Hazel,'' the city utility  
worker, 48, said Thursday as he used a chainsaw to carve up another 
in a line of majestic live oaks that once formed a protective arch 
along his street on the Intracoastal Waterway. ``I was 3 years old. 
... We just kind of take it in stride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It might be getting a little too easy for folks around here to  
take these things in stride. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than a year ago, Bonnie blew through Wilmington to little  
effect. Dennis brushed the area two weeks ago with much the same 
result. Now, that monster Floyd, for all its Category 4 bluster, 
caused little serious damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Most coastal residents and tourists heeded the evacuation order  
this time. But Jim Balkcum wondered how many of these reprieves it 
will take before people stop taking hurricanes seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	``They probably won't raid the grocery stores and the lumber  
stores anymore,'' said Balkcum, a used-car dealer who rode out all 
three storms, plus two before it, in his home just off the 
Intracoastal Waterway. ``And that'll be bad. That'll be bad, 
because you've got to prepare for the worst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calvin McGowan stayed with his wife and son along the Wilmington  
waterfront, mostly to protect his 34-foot fishing boat, the 
Monitor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last time my boat was up in my neighbor's yard,'' he said  
Thursday morning as he puffed on a stogie and checked for water in 
the bilge. Not far away, another boat lay in the grass where the 
storm surge gently deposited it. 
</P>
<P>
	At the height of Floyd, McGowan said it sounded ``like all the  
nails were coming out of the boards'' in his house. Still, he 
insisted he would have left if the storm had come in as a Category 
4. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it was blowing 155 mph, I was going to get out of here,''  
he said. ``I wouldn't stay for more than 135. Most people's limit's 
about 100. I've been through five of these, so I'm getting to be a 
veteran.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same could be said about brothers Dave and Rueger Houck, who  
violated a mandatory evacuation order on the coastal island of 
Wrightsville Beach with their friend Ryan McInnis. 
</P>
<P>
	The three used cell phones and a computer to keep tabs on the  
storm. So when the police came by Wednesday night and told them 
they'd be washed away if they stayed put, they just smiled -- even 
when the officers asked for the telephone numbers of their next of 
kin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've all studied climatology and meteorology in school,''  
McInnis, 24, a professional diver, said as he played his acoustic 
guitar. ``We made an educated guess to stay. It wasn't just for the 
risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three waded out into waist-deep water wearing scuba masks  
during the storm's peak. But Rueger Houck, a 24-year-old college 
student, said that doesn't mean he has no respect for nature's 
power. 
</P>
<P>
	``The storm surge coming down the street -- it was amazing,'' he  
said, the silver stud in his lower lip glinting in the late morning 
sun. ``It's a humbling experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting in the darkened lobby of a Wilmington hotel, college  
administrator Dick Aubrey was relieved to learn that his beachfront 
home on nearby Oak Island was intact. But he has seen at least a 
dozen tumble in the two years since he's lived there, and he knows 
this game of meteorological roulette can only go on so long. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've had enough numbers come up,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Helps Weather Channel Ratings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd was a boon to at least one  
business: The Weather Channel set viewership records this week as 
people anxiously tracked the storm during its soggy voyage up the 
East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	An average of 1.7 million people were watching The Weather  
Channel on Tuesday, with viewership hitting a peak of 3.5 million 
at 8 p.m. EDT, the network said. 
</P>
<P>
	That blew away the 17-year-old cable network's previous high,  
set during a blizzard in 1996. Wednesday's ratings were still high, 
but below Tuesday's. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to disparage the competition,'' said Terry  
Connelly, senior vice president of programming, ``but no one has 
the expertise that we have and the depth of knowledge in 
meteorology. And the public knows that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The network sent out five crews to cover Floyd, starting in West  
Palm Beach and Melbourne, Fla., over the weekend, then moving 
correspondents north to stay ahead of the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Keneely stood in a drenching rain on Solomons Island in  
Maryland on Thursday. Jim Cantore, who began the week in Florida, 
was stationed on Jones Beach in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Correspondent Mike Seidel, who rushed from Myrtle Beach, S.C.,  
to Wrightsville Beach, N.C., on Wednesday to stay ahead of Floyd, 
was on the air live at 2 a.m. Thursday when the eye passed directly 
over him. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hope, an 80-year-old former meteorologist at the National  
Hurricane Center, is a constant on The Weather Channel during the 
network's hurricane coverage. He tracks the storm and predicts its 
behavior while mixing in historical reminders of past hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Although The Weather Channel frequently shows the standard  
television hurricane stand-up -- a correspondent, buffeted by wind 
and nearly blinded by rain, talking into a microphone -- Connelly 
said the network won't put its personnel in harm's way. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Weather Channel mantra is you do not hype the story and  
you stay safe from the storm,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> BYU Standout Linebacker Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVO, Utah (AP) -- BYU linebacker Rob Morris, a candidate for  
the Butkus Award, left Thursday night's game against Colorado State 
early in the second half with a lower abdominal strain. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the injury was not considered serious and Morris was  
expected to return to practice next week and be available for BYU's 
Sept. 25 game against Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris appeared to be hurt after bursting through the Colorado  
State line and tackling Rahsaan Sanders for a 6-yard loss. Morris 
raised his arms in celebration, then walked cautiously back to the 
huddle. 
</P>
<P>
	On the next play, Morris went to the ground without contact as  
he dropped back into pass coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials stopped the clock with 11:29 left in the third quarter  
as Morris stumbled, bent over, toward the BYU bench. After being 
helped off the field by trainers, he was taken to the locker room. 
He was expected to be held out the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris was projected as a first- or second-round pick in the NFL  
after his junior season. He said he returned to school to help BYU 
win a championship in the first season of the Mountain West 
Conference.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Defector Begins NBA Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *BY LUIS CABRERA   	
</P>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Lazaro Borrell says realizing the dream of  
signing an NBA contract comes with a price. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leaving my family was the most difficult thing,'' said  
Borrell, a former Cuban national team player who defected July 17 
during the Tournament of the Americas in Puerto Rico. On Thursday, 
the 6-foot-8 Borrell, 26, signed a two-year contract with the 
Seattle SuperSonics. Additional terms weren't immediately 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	Borrell, speaking through an interpreter during a news  
conference, said signing a contract while separated from his 
parents and three siblings ``was very sad, and at the same time it 
was very exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since defecting, Borrell worked out for the Houston Rockets, New  
Jersey Nets, Portland Trail Blazers and Miami Heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted more freedom to be able to do what I do best, and  
that's play the game,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Borrell's versatility gives him a real chance to make the  
Sonics' roster out of training camp, team president Wally Walker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lazaro has a great feel for the game, a tremendous amount of  
ability,'' Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Borrell averaged 20.8 points per game for Obras Sanitarias in  
the Argentina Basketball League last season. He averaged 21.3 
points and 10.3 rebounds in three games for the Cuban team in 
Puerto Rico before defecting. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker said he was traveling last week when Borrell worked out  
for Sonics coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``This kind of came out of the blue,'' Walker said. ``After  
seeing him work out, the coaches called me, and after seeing him 
play today, I can see why. ... He has too much ability for us to 
pass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's comfortable handling the ball, he's comfortable away from  
the ball,'' Billy McKinney, Sonics executive vice president of 
basketball operations, said. ``He's a good passer, he's a good 
shooter. I could see, once he gets comfortable with the language, 
maybe playing some shooting guard, maybe even playing the point 
guard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney said Borrell has a good chance to make the team, but  
added, ``We're going to have a lot of competition for spots. We 
have some very hungry people here this year who want to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since last year, the Sonics have let go forwards Detlef  
Schrempf, Don MacLean, Billy Owens and Aaron Williams, center Olden 
Polynice, and guards Hersey Hawkins, Drew Barry and John Crotty. 
</P>
<P>
	To a core of point guard Gary Payton and forward Vin Baker, they  
have added forward Horace Grant, center Greg Foster, and guards 
Vernon Maxwell and Brent Barry, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	Borrell will be working with a language coach to learn English,  
and will also hit the weight room in preparation for training camp, 
Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The curve will be very steep for him in terms of basketball  
and the language, but he's further ahead in basketball.'' Walker 
said. ``He'll be given every opportunity to make the club.''

<P>
 *Church shooter leaves few clues as to why he went on rampage    	
</P>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Police picked through Larry Gene  
Ashbrook's trashed home and old journals on Thursday, finding holes 
punched in walls, concrete poured in toilets and family photographs 
shredded -- but no explanation for why he opened fire in a church, 
killing seven people and himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The 47-year-old Ashbrook appeared to be ``a very troubled man  
who ... sought to quiet whatever demons that bothered him,'' FBI 
agent Robert Garrity said. ``I don't know that we'll ever know the 
answer to the question of why it happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashbrook, dressed in blue jeans, a black jacket and smoking a  
cigarette, entered the Wedgwood Baptist Church in Fort Worth on 
Wednesday evening as teen-agers listened to a Christian rock band 
in the sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
	In the church lobby, Ashbrook confronted his first victims with  
a question: ``What's the program?'' Then he shot a janitor who 
approached him and killed two other people before walking into the 
crowded sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
	The 150 teen-agers gathered inside initially thought Ashbrook  
was part of a skit as he began cursing and spouting derogatory 
comments about Baptists. They scrambled for cover as Ashbrook 
opened fire, pausing at least twice to reload. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guy pointed at me and shot at me!'' an out-of-breath man  
told a 911 dispatch operator. ``I saw the flash of a muzzle and 
headed the other direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a woman here who looks like she's bleeding in the  
head!'' a church nursery worker told another operator. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashbrook lit and rolled a homemade pipe bomb down an aisle at  
one point. It exploded but did not harm anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven people -- choir members, seminarians and high school  
students -- were killed. Seven others were wounded, three seriously. 
Ashbrook then killed himself in a rear pew. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Ashbrook carried two weapons, a 9mm Ruger  
semiautomatic handgun and a .380-caliber AMT handgun. Investigators 
found six loaded 9mm clips in his jacket pocket but were unsure if 
the .380 was fired inside the church. 
</P>
<P>
	Acting police Chief Ralph Mendoza estimated there were 30 spent  
9mm shell casings inside the church. 
</P>
<P>
	The .380 was purchased legally from a now-closed flea market  
shop, Mendoza said. Officials still were researching the purchase 
of the 9mm. 
</P>
<P>
	Bomb-making tools, including files, pipes, fuses and gunpowder,  
were found inside Ashbrook's modest wood-frame home in the 
working-class suburb of Forest Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	The journals, some going back 10 years, indicated that Ashbrook  
had been upset about his inability to keep a job. Mendoza said 
Ashbrook's only known police record was a 1971 arrest for marijuana 
possession. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he was just somebody who was a social outcast,''  
Garrity said. ``We found evidence that he was a very emotionally 
disturbed person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashbrook never married or had children, and he lived alone since  
his 85-year-old father died in July. While some neighbors had 
dismissed him as a harmless eccentric, others said he had became 
erratic, even abusive, after his mother died nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before she died, Larry still had it together. After she died,  
he went mental,'' said Karen Ivey, a neighbor for 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The death of Ashbrook's father, who supported the son  
financially, ``may have driven him over the edge,'' Mendoza said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the weeks after his father's death, Ashbrook wrote rambling  
letters to the editor of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, discussing 
encounters with the CIA, psychological warfare, being assaulted by 
co-workers and being drugged by police. He also visited at the 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `I'm sorry to take your time up,''' said city editor  
Stephen Kaye, who described Ashbrook as cordial and apologetic. 
``He couldn't have been any nicer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A brother of the gunman declined comment when reached at his  
home Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashbrook was known to violently kick doors to houses and cars.  
One couple on his street recalled a time when Ashbrook, believing 
the neighbors were talking about him, exposed himself and screamed 
obscenities. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, President Clinton decried the latest deadly  
shootings, saying Americans must find a way to protect young people 
``as if it were our own children being targeted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. George W. Bush cut short a presidential campaign trip in  
Michigan to return to Texas and ``add some comfort.'' He blamed ``a 
wave of evil'' -- not a lack of gun control laws -- for rampant gun 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to explain how somebody would have enough hatred in  
their heart to walk into a church where people are seeking God's 
guidance and shoot them,'' he said with tears in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Wedgwood's senior pastor, Al Meredith, promised to hold regular  
services this Sunday at the large, red brick church if the police 
investigation was finished. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our heart's desire is that the king of darkness will not  
prevail over the kingdom of light,'' Meredith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the those killed were students and another was a graduate  
of the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, 
where hundreds packed an auditorium Thursday to sing and pray. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners filled the balcony and even sat on the floor. During a  
break for prayer, people kneeled four and five deep at the altar or 
held hands in small circles. 
</P>
<P>
	Many wept while singing ``Amazing Grace.''

<HEADLINE> Dennehy, 'Salesman' To Take Break </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Tony-winning revival of ``Death of a  
Salesman'' will close Nov. 7 to give its star, Brian Dennehy, time 
to rest up for the London production of the classic Arthur Miller 
drama. 
</P>
<P>
	The revival, starring Dennehy as salesman Willy Loman, has been  
playing on a reduced schedule of seven performances a week for 
several months, spokesman Jim Byk said Thursday. Broadway shows 
usually do eight. 
</P>
<P>
	The production also shut down for the week before Labor Day to  
give the cast a chance to recharge its batteries for the final 
weeks of the run. 
</P>
<P>
	Dates for the London engagement have not yet been set, but are  
planned for sometime next year, according to Byk. 
</P>
<P>
	The current ``Salesman'' won four Tony Awards, including prizes  
for Dennehy, his co-star Elizabeth Franz, director Robert Falls and 
the nod for best revival.

<HEADLINE> 200 Million Paid for Cleaner Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Eleven companies have agreed to spend $200  
million to clean up contaminated drinking water under the San 
Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	The massive aquifer beneath the San Gabriel Valley was found to  
be contaminated with industrial chemicals more than 20 years ago. 
The area was home to many industrial and defense companies starting 
in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Wednesday is one of the largest good-faith  
offers ever made to remove dangerous chemicals from groundwater in 
the history of the Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund 
program, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies are to immediately begin designing and building  
wells and water treatment systems in the valley east of Los 
Angeles. Construction should be complete in about 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The basin still provides more than 50 billion gallons of  
drinking water each year. Residents for years have paid more for 
imported or cleaned water, but meeting federal and state standards 
has grown more difficult as the contamination spreads, the EPA 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The aquifer was declared a Superfund site in 1984, and 19  
companies were suspected of contributing to the pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the companies participating in the $200 million offer are  
defense giant GenCorp Aerojet, Huffy Corp., Oil &AMP; Solvent Process 
Co. and Wynn Oil Co. Negotiations are continuing with eight other 
suspected polluters.

<HEADLINE> New Book About Justice O'Connor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- There's a new page-turner of a book out on  
Sandra Day O'Connor, an insider's look at one of the nation's most 
powerful women. Its title: ``Meet My Grandmother ... She's a 
Supreme Court Justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Courtney O'Connor, age 9, helps author Lisa Tucker McElroy tell  
kids some things about her grandma's job in the 32-page, 
photo-filled book. Courtney, who lives in the Phoenix area, takes 
readers along during a visit to the great marble palace on Capitol 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	When in Washington, hanging out at Grandma's office is just as  
cool as going bowling with her grandfather, Courtney reveals. 
</P>
<P>
	Grandmotherly words of wisdom are shared as well: ``Grandma says  
that all judges who are grandmothers should start their days by 
exercising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sure enough, the book published by The Millbrook Press of  
Brookfield, Conn., includes a photo of the early morning exercise 
class O'Connor, 69, attends three days a week in the Supreme Court 
gym. 
</P>
<P>
	``The basketball court is called 'the Highest Court in the  
Land.' That's a pretty funny joke, because the Supreme Court is 
also called the highest court in the land,'' Courtney explains. 
</P>
<P>
	Other insights include the fact that the justice, like her eight  
colleagues, ``wears really neat robes when she sits on the bench to 
hear cases.... Grandma doesn't have to walk around in her robes all 
the time. When she's not hearing cases, she just wears regular 
clothes. You wouldn't even know she was a Supreme Court justice by 
looking at her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor has been a national symbol since 1981 when she became  
the first women on the nation's highest court. During Courtney's 
visit, students from Sandra Day O'Connor High School in Helotes, 
Texas, stopped by to meet their school's namesake. Their picture 
appears in the book as well, along with the justice in a Panthers 
varsity letter jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	The book includes a 1950s photo the justice snapped of her  
husband, John, standing outside the Supreme Court building one 
Saturday. ``Grandma says that that was the closest she thought she 
would ever get to the Supreme Court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also included are helpful hints for readers who want to become  
Supreme Court justices, too. They include: 
</P>
<P>
	--''Study hard in school. To become a lawyer -- and later a  
justice -- you have to go to college and then law school.'' The 
Constitution does not require a justice to be a lawyer, readers are 
told, but all of the court's nine members are. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Watch lawyers in court. You can watch trials on 'Court TV.'  
You can also call lawyers in your community, tell them you are 
interested in being a lawyer and ask them if you can watch them in 
court.'' Supreme Court sessions are not televised because the 
justices do not allow it, but the book does not mention that.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Imports Rise in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Philippine imports rose in July to  
their highest level since the beginning of last year, the latest 
indicator that a strong economic recovery is under way. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Statistics Office said Thursday that imports rose  
to $2.79 billion in July, up 13.2 percent from a year earlier. It 
was the highest level since the $2.84 billion recorded for January 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports of electronics and components, accounting for close to a  
quarter of total imports, rose 40.1 percent to $655.37 million in 
July from the year-earlier month. The components are used to 
manufacture electronic products that are the backbone of the 
Philippines' exports and have sustained the country's strong 
economic recovery this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the seven months to July, the Philippines posted a trade  
surplus of $755 million, compared with a deficit of $1.44 billion 
last year. The surplus in July was $60 million, compared with a 
surplus of $35 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's economic planning chief, Felipe Medalla, says  
1999's growth targets are being revised, with the gross domestic 
product now seen expanding 3 percent to 3.5 percent. The original 
forecast was a range of 1 percent to 3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Running Stag Looks To Outrun Rivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When he made his American debut in the 1998  
Woodward at Belmont Park, Running Stag was listed at 48-1 and was 
referred to in jest as ``Running Nag.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The joking has since stopped. Running Stag, who finished third  
behind Skip Away and Gentlemen in last year's Woodward, will be 
making his eighth start in this country Saturday when he heads a 
field of seven for the $500,000 Woodward at 1 1/8 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've made no bones about the fact that everybody said our  
coming to America was a joke last year and that there are no good 
dirt horses in Europe,'' trainer Philip Mitchell said. ``Deep down, 
we knew we had the potential to run well in America. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kept telling people he is by Cozzene and that all of his  
offspring are late developers ... I expected him to improve as he 
got older and more experienced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year, at age 5, Running Stag finished a eye-opening second  
to Behrens in the Massachusetts Handicap in his first U.S. start of 
1999, won the Brooklyn Handicap at Belmont by 7 1/2 lengths and then 
crisscrossed the Atlantic again after a start in England to win the 
Saratoga Breeders' Cup Handicap in August by a half-length. 
</P>
<P>
	``We only had him about 85 to 90 percent for that race because  
there was no point in having him 100 percent for Saratoga, then 100 
percent for this race,'' Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Running Stag from across the Atlantic will be 1999 Dubai  
World Cup winner Almutawakel, who finished seventh in his only 
subsequent start in England in the Group 1 Juddmonte International 
at York. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took the view that after the World Cup we wanted to save  
some horse for the fall and the Breeders' Cup Classic -- we didn't 
want to give him a punishing campaign leading up to the fall,'' 
said Simon Crisford, racing manager for Godolphin. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Bailey will be aboard Almutawakel, who breaks from post  
No. 5, while Shane Sellers has the mount on Running Stag, who drew 
post No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Also starting in the Woodward, which will be joined on the  
``Super Saturday'' card by the Grade 1 Ruffian and the Grade 2 
Jerome Handicap, are, from the rail out, Black Cash (Edgar Prado), 
Barter Town (Jorge Chavez), River Keen (Chris Antley), Stephen Got 
Even (Gary Stevens), and Gander (Pat Day). 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Got Even, trained by Nick Zito, will be looking for his  
first Grade 1 win in the Woodward. One of the top choices for the 
Kentucky Derby after winning the GalleryFurniture.com at Turfway, 
the 3-year-old had an unsuccessful Triple Crown campaign and then 
came back to win an allowance at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
	The longshot in the field is Gander, a New York-bred gelding who  
won the Albany Handicap at Saratoga and is 1-for-2 on wet tracks.

<HEADLINE> Damage Award Against Ford Overturned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A Modesto judge overturned a $290 million  
damage award against Ford Motor Co. on Thursday, ruling that a 
juror's dream and a TV show tainted deliberations about three 
deaths in a rollover accident with a Ford Bronco. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanislaus County Superior Court Judge Roger Beauchesne granted  
Ford a new trial on the punitive damages, saying jury misconduct 
may have influenced the July 12 verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge upheld the jury's unanimous finding that a defective  
roof was responsible for the deaths of a husband, wife and son when 
their Ford Bronco overturned on a freeway in June 1993. The jury 
awarded surviving family members $5 million in compensation, an 
amount Beauchesne reduced by $469,000. 
</P>
<P>
	During deliberations, one juror allegedly talked about a  
nightmare in which children of the jurors were killed in a Ford 
Bronco that was rolling over while the automaker's lawyers chanted, 
``Where's the proof?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A second juror said she'd heard about an episode of ``60  
Minutes'' in which a report about fires in Ford Mustangs included 
callous remarks by Lee Iacocca, the former Ford executive who 
introduced the Mustang and later became chief executive of 
Chrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	Both jurors submitted statements saying they based their  
verdicts solely on the evidence presented in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	But Judge Beauchesne granted Ford a new trial on the punitive  
damages, saying the two jurors' comments may have influenced the 
deliberations. He noted that the jury vote on punitive damages was 
9-3, the exact majority needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford spokesman Jim Cain said the ruling was gratifying, but the  
company maintains the Bronco wasn't defective and may appeal the 
case further. 
</P>
<P>
	The $290 million verdict had been the second-largest of its  
kind, coming just two weeks after a Los Angeles jury awarded $4.9 
billion to six people who were severely burned when their Chevrolet 
exploded in a rear-end collision. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1993, Juan Romo was driving the 1978 model Bronco when  
he swerved to avoid a van he was passing. The vehicle rolled over, 
killing Romo's mother, Salustia, 40; his father, Ramon, 39; and his 
brother, Ramiro, 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Romo, then 19, and his two surviving sisters, Evangelina, 14,  
and Maria, 8, were slightly injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Their lawyers argued that Ford knew the Bronco's roof was unsafe  
but decided to save the extra cost of reinforcing it with steel, a 
change made on post-1979 Broncos. The plaintiffs' witnesses 
included a former Ford executive vice president who said company 
officials knew the roof was virtually certain to fail in a 
rollover. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford asserted that the Bronco's roof was sound and met federal  
safety standards, blaming the deaths on Romo and the driver he was 
passing. 
</P>
<P>
	In seeking a new trial, Ford offered statements by jurors that  
fellow juror Denise Salinas had described a ``60 Minutes'' segment 
about faulty fuel tanks in Ford Mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
	Iaccoca, then Ford's president, was incorrectly quoted by  
Salinas as saying Ford would rather defend against lawsuits than 
recall or fix vehicles. Beauchesne said Thursday a tape of the 
program contained no such statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Romos' lawyers recently submitted a sworn statement from  
Salinas in which she said she briefly mentioned what someone had 
told her about the program, but agreed with another juror that it 
was irrelevant to the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford also submitted declarations that a second juror, Karen  
Zaccheo, described her nightmare about rolling Broncos and burning 
children as an ``omen,'' and advised other jurors they did not need 
to follow the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Zaccheo's declaration, offered by the Romos' lawyers, confirmed  
that she mentioned the dream but denied the additional statements. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurence Drivon, a lawyer for the Romos, said plaintiffs'  
lawyers will review the ruling before deciding on their next step.

<HEADLINE> Vt. Voters OK Prison Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Vt. (AP) -- Residents gave final approval to build a  
prison near a historic observatory in Vermont, despite concerns by 
astronomers that it would mar the center's pristine view of the 
heavens. 
</P>
<P>
	Springfield town Clerk Bonnie Reynolds said 2,332 people voted  
in favor of the prison while 1,545 voted against it, a margin of 
about 20 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	About 60 percent of the community's eligible voters cast  
ballots, Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an excellent turnout,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's vote was the second on whether or not the community in  
the southeastern section of the state would allow construction of a 
350-bed medium security prison about three miles away from 
Stellafane -- Latin for ``Shrine to the Stars.'' A national 
landmark, it is the site of a conference that attracts more than 
2,000 amateur astronomers every summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the prison said its lights would ruin star viewing  
from the hilltop observatory, but state officials denied that. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, townspeople approved the prison, but only by a margin  
of 69 votes, 1,633 to 1,564. Tuesday's vote was forced by a 
petition drive led by prison opponents 
</P>
<P>
	The state offered the town a $7 million economic incentive  
package for the prison. State officials also say the prison could 
bring about 160 new jobs to Springfield residents, one of the most 
depressed areas of the state since the machine tool industry fell 
on hard times.

<HEADLINE> Bill Blass Strides Through Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Saying the show must go on, Bill Blass staged  
his spring 2000 runway preview Thursday before a packed audience of 
loyals undaunted by the wind, rain and fury of the remnants of 
Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	All through the show, driving rain pummeled the roof of the tent  
used for most of the week's designer previews. But that didn't 
deter Blass from continuing with the Fashion Week show he expects 
will be his last before he sells his 26-year-old company. 
</P>
<P>
	Blass' garden-party floral prints and vivid sherbet shades  
provided springtime warmth to a swan song that threatened to turn 
into ``Swan Lake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of a dramatic effect for my swan song,'' said Blass  
backstage before his show, dapper in an impeccable navy suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``All morning long the ladies have all been coming backstage,''  
he said of his social-page following. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got there literally bedraggled and I thought, surely those  
ladies won't break their necks to make it even if it is Bill's last 
show,'' said CeCe Cord, a longtime customer. ``And one after 
another came in, looking more perfect than the next, in white suits 
and high heels and jewelry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 77-year-old designer, who plans to sell his  
$700-million-a-year company within the year, received a standing 
ovation. Audience members said they would not consider missing the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my job,'' said veteran fashion columnist Marylou Luther,  
toting a plastic bag as headgear. ``If I were a war correspondent, 
I wouldn't say, `I'm not going to this war.' So here I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to miss him so much,'' said Vogue editor in chief  
Anna Wintour. ``He's not been afraid of color in this decade of 
black and minimalism. ``He's remained very much his own master.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, ``Color, color, color'' was Blass' assessment of his  
collection. ``Massive color, bright color, in-your-face color, no 
more pale colors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For spring, the typical well-heeled Blass customer will wear  
long, lean, column gowns, attention-getting thanks to thigh-high 
slits and bright stripes or big bouquet patterns of lime, yellow 
and hot pink. Sequins splashed all over skirts, ruffles cascading 
on necklines and scalloped hems all add up to a season of 
embellishments. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night downtown designer Anna Sui presented her  
``Rococo Gypsy'' collection of mismatched pieces reminiscent of 
various times and places. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing really goes together. It's a thrown-together look,''  
said Sui of her deliberate attempt at undeliberate dressing, based 
on recent visits to rococo palaces in Europe. Her vivacious street 
fashion is an amalgam of bustle skirts and corsets, hippie peasant 
blouses and embroidery that evoked the era of Empress Josephine. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Wednesday night, London designer Nicole Farhi showed her  
women's collection in New York for the first time during Fashion 
Week. The show tied in with the Sept. 9 opening of her New York 
store. 
</P>
<P>
	Farhi, whose company generated $75 million in wholesale sales in  
1998, is known for minimalist clothes that emphasize comfort. Her 
side-tie wrap dresses and sequined wrap skirts projected a look of 
ease.

<HEADLINE> Judge Frees Cisneros' Ex-Lover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- The former lover of ex-Housing Secretary  
Henry Cisneros has been freed a week after Cisneros was fined but 
given no jail time for lying to the FBI about payments to her. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Jones was released Thursday. Her 3 1/2-year sentence was  
reduced to time served -- nearly 18 months -- for her cooperation in 
the Cisneros case, according to court documents filed in federal 
court in Lubbock. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones, 50, was to be the star witness in the government's  
prosecution of Cisneros. But Cisneros pleaded guilty last week to a 
single misdemeanor count of lying to the FBI in a plea deal. The 
agreement, which included a $10,000 fine, called for no prison time 
or probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros admitted in court that he falsely told the FBI, while  
under consideration for a Cabinet post, that he had never paid his 
ex-mistress more than $2,500 monthly after their affair ended. He 
gave Ms. Jones more than $250,000 between 1989 and 1994, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	She pleaded guilty in January 1998 to 28 counts involving fraud,  
conspiracy and money laundering for, among other things, lying 
about the payments and concealing evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	She was freed Thursday in Washington, where she had been under  
the custody of Independent Counsel David Barrett, one of her 
lawyers said. Authorities would not say where she was held, but 
said it was not in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am relieved that she is going to get out and be reunited  
with her family,'' said attorney Sam Ogan. ``She had gotten such a 
high sentence that I'm glad this episode is finally over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett, who has refused to talk to reporters since the abrupt  
end of the Cisneros prosecution, offered no comment. U.S. District 
Judge Sam Cummings, who had sentenced Ms. Jones, granted Barrett's 
motion to release her. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros' plea marked a sharp reversal for Barrett, who had  
indicted the one-time Clinton Cabinet member in 1997 on 18 felony 
counts of conspiracy, obstruction and lying to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones herself ran afoul of the independent counsel after  
federal investigators discovered that she had lied about recordings 
she secretly made of her phone conversations with Cisneros, 
misrepresenting the tapes as unaltered originals.

<HEADLINE> De La Hoya, Trinidad Proud Fathers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Even if Oscar De La Hoya beats Felix Trinidad  
on Saturday night, he's not counting on being complimented by his 
father, Joel De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a Mexican father and has a big ego, and he won't tell  
me,'' said the 26-year-old De La Hoya, who was born and raised in 
East Los Angeles. His father and grandfather also were fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	Another proud father is Felix Trinidad Sr., who manages and  
trains the IBF welterweight champion from Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	Father-son combinations in boxing often hurt the fighter, but  
not in this case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to give credit to Felix Sr.'' said Gil Clancy, a boxing  
adviser to De La Hoya. ``He's done a marvelous job. In this case, 
it works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elder De La Hoya does not manage or train his son, yet makes  
his presence felt to the point that he has been accused of 
interfering with Oscar's career -- but not by Oscar or trainer 
Robert Alcazar. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to say Joel De La Hoya has never interfered with  
Oscar's training in any area,'' said Alcazar, who knows pleasing 
Joel is not easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two weeks ago for the first time he came to me and said, `I  
like what I see,''' Alcazar said. 
</P>
<P>
	The father, however, did not tell the son.  
</P>
<P>
	``I read it in the paper,'' the WBC welterweight champion said.  
``It would have been nice to hear it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya did hear from his father after his split decision  
victory over Ike Quartey on Feb. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said I didn't put enough pressure on him,'' De La Hoya  
said. ``He said, `You gave him too much respect.' He was right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Trinidad also fought professionally. In 1979, he  
fought the late Salvador Sanchez, a Hall of Fame featherweight 
champion, and was knocked out in the fifth round. 
</P>
<P>
	A knockout is what Felix Sr. says his 26-year-old son is going  
to do before a sellout crowd in a 12,000-seat arena at Mandalay Bay 
and a big pay-per-view audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fight will end by a knockout,'' said the younger Trinidad.  
``I really don't like to predict a round. My father has told me it 
will not go past six rounds. He knows a lot about boxing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya wouldn't be surprised to win by a knockout, but he  
added, ``If I box well and win a decision, I'll make myself 
happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A knockout could happen since both champions are power punchers.  
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya has 25 knockouts on his 31-0 record. Trinidad (35-0)  
has 30 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	What might decide the outcome, however, is how hard of a punch  
each can fighter take. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya suffered a flash knockdown by Narciso Valenzuela in  
the first round of his 11th pro fight, Oct. 30, 1991. He also was 
knocked down and hurt in the first round by Giorgio Campanella on 
May 25, 1994, and was knocked down and hurt in the sixth round by 
Quartey. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad was knocked down twice in the second round by Alberto  
Cortes in his 16th fight, Oct. 3, 1992. He also suffered 
second-round knockdowns in four other fights, the last time by 
Kevin Lueshing on Jan. 11, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya and Trinidad have had two common opponents -- Carr and  
Pernell Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad got up to stop Carr in the eighth round of a title  
defense on Dec. 10, 1994. De La Hoya knocked Carr down in the first 
round, but didn't stop him until the 11th round of his last fight 
May 22. De La Hoya said he bruised his left hand in the first round 
-- the left hook is his money punch -- but the hand is fine now. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men won decisions in title defenses against Whitaker -- De  
La Hoya on April 12, 1997, and Trinidad last Feb. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe Whitaker won that fight (against De La Hoya),''  
Trinidad said. ``A lot of people say the same thing.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates Fall in Past Week / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages settled back to 7.82 percent this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The average was down from 7.88 percent last week, Freddie Mac,  
the mortgage company said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Federal Reserve interest rate increases this summer added to  
pressures pushing market-sensitive mortgage rates on a general 
upward trend. This year, the average rate for 30-year mortgages 
peaked at 8.15 percent in mid-August, the highest level since April 
1997, before dropping back some since then. 
</P>
<P>
	``Continuing news that inflation has been kept in check so far  
this year translated into relatively stable mortgage interest 
rates,'' said Freddie Mac economist Robert Van Order. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's low rate for 30-year mortgages was 6.74 percent, set  
at the end of January. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate for fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for  
refinancing, averaged 7.43 percent last week, down from 7.49 
percent the week before. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 6.22 percent, up from 6.21 percent the week 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged at or just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three 
types of mortgages.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Won't Turn Over FALN Files </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Invoking executive privilege, President  
Clinton today refused to turn over to a House panel documents 
related to his offer of clemency to 16 members of a violent Puerto 
Rican nationalist group. 
</P>
<P>
	The clemency grants have stirred up a political firestorm, with  
law enforcement groups and victims of actions by the group accusing 
Clinton of using clemency to boost his wife's Senate ambitions. The 
group is known as FALN, Spanish initials for the Armed Forces of 
National Liberation. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said none of the 16 was convicted of a violent  
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the legal advice of the attorney general, the president  
is invoking executive privilege over certain documents and 
testimony relating to the grant of clemency,'' said Jim Kennedy, 
spokesman for the White House counsel's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy said the White House would be providing some 10,000  
pages of documents related to the decision, including thousands of 
letters exhorting the president to show leniency toward the 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	``But those that are directly related to the exercise of the  
president's constitutional authority are not being provided,'' 
Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House also rebuffed the committee's request to have  
the new White House chief counsel, Beth Nolan, provide testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House Government Reform  
Committee, was being informed of the president's decision in a 
letter from White House Deputy Counsel Cheryl Mills. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pursuant to the Constitution and the separation-of-powers  
doctrine, the president's authority to grant clemency is not 
subject to legislative oversight,'' Mills wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee officials had threatened to seek contempt charges if  
they weren't satisfied with the administration's response to its 
subpoenas. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fourth time that the Clinton White House asserted  
executive privilege with regard to demands from Congress, according 
to a Justice Department official. 
</P>
<P>
	``The White House staff and the Department of Justice act as  
confidential advisers to the president as part of the clemency 
review process, and executive privilege has long been understood to 
protect confidential advice generated during that process,'' 
Attorney General Janet Reno advised Clinton in a letter today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Judiciary Committee also plans to issue subpoenas for  
documents and testimony regarding the clemency case, according to 
the chairman, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have accused Clinton of making the clemency offer to  
help first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's budding Senate campaign in 
New York, home to 1.3 million Puerto Ricans. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton opposed the deal after it began to draw criticism,  
and then was herself criticized by some prominent Puerto Ricans in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton offered clemency to 16 former FALN members, on the  
condition that they first renounce violence. Fourteen accepted and 
11 were released from prison last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton extended the offer after a lengthy review by the former  
White House chief counsel, Charles F.C. Ruff. Prominent human 
rights advocates, including South African Anglican Archbishop 
Desmond Tutu and former President Carter backed the move. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is strong sentiment against Clinton's decision among  
law enforcement officers. At a Senate hearing, two retired FBI 
agents who investigated the FALN characterized its members as 
terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same hearing Wednesday, Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.,  
who has pushed Mrs. Clinton to seek the Senate seat, lashed out at 
the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I regret greatly the actions of President Clinton,''  
Torricelli said. ``I hope the committee will learn more about his 
motivations and the process so that it's never repeated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton asserted executive privilege three times in 1996: when  
Congress demanded documents related to the White House travel 
office firings, a joint FBI-Drug Enforcement Agency memo to Clinton 
on drug enforcement, and foreign-policy documents on the 
administration's Haiti policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House also has asserted executive privilege in  
litigation and independent counsel investigations, most notably 
when Clinton sought to shield his deliberations with aides and 
in-house counsels over Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's Lewinsky 
investigation.
