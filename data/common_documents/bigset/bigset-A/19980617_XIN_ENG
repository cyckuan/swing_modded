<HEADLINE> South Korean Tycoon Makes Cattle Drive to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- South Korean business tycoon
Chung Ju-Yung handed over 500 head of cattle at his hometown in
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Tuesday in a
gesture of unity and reconciliation between the two sides of the
Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The 83-year-old founder of Hyundai Group crossed the Military
Demarcation Line (MDL) Tuesday morning with a convoy of 50 Hyundai
trucks carrying the cattle to Tongchon, where he was born.
</P>
<P>
"I am so happy to visit my hometown. I am so happy to go to my
birthplace in my car," said Chung before going on to meet DPRK
official, including Kim Yong Sun, chairman of the Korean
Asia-Pacific Peace Committee (KAPPC).
</P>
<P>
Chung had offered to donate 1,000 head of cattle and 50,000
tons of maize to the famine-hit DPRK. The rest of the donation
will be delivered after consultations on the route and schedule
are completed between the Red Cross organizations of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Korean Central News Agency reported that Chung and Kim held
talks in "an atmosphere of compatriotic feelings" at Mansudae
Assembly Hall. Also present were KAPPC Vice-Chairman Song Ho Gyong
and other officials.
</P>
<P>
Chung and his party were warmly greeted at Panmunjon by Song
and Jong Un-Op, chairman of the National Economic Cooperation
Federation.
</P>
<P>
Chung is the first South Korean businessman to have entered the
DPRK via Panmunjon, a small village lying on the MDL where the
truce ending the 1950-53 war was signed, a half century after the
division of the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the cattle drive, Panmunjon had never been used as a
route for the intra-Korean private visits and the transportation
of commodities.
</P>
<P>
Chung, who made another trip to the DPRK in 1989, said he would
also explore the possibility of a tourism resort at Kumkang
Mountain and the prospects of economic cooperation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fed Chief Calls for Free-Market View of Giant Mergers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan Tuesday urged Congress to take free-market
view of recent wave of multibillion-dollar mergers and be cautious
in substituting government regulations for the giant mergers.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan made the remarks during a hearing at the Senate
Judiciary Committee, which seeks to determine how the recent spate
of mergers in banking and other industries would affect the U.S.
consumers and the economy overall.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is currently experiencing its fifth major
corporate consolidation of this century," Greenspan told the
committee. "When trying to understand and deciding how to react to
this development, I would hope that we appropriately account for
the complexity and dynamism of modern free markets."
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said the first merger wave occurred at the turn of
the century, followed by other waves in the late 1920s, the late
1960s and the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The first two merger waves produced significant increases in
economic concentration in the manufacturing sector, the Fed chief
noted. He added that there was no sign recent rounds of mergers
have had much effect in further consolidating manufacturing
companies, reflecting that they are occurring in a U.S. economy
that is already at an advanced stage of development.
</P>
<P>
"The effects of the present merger wave on concentration have
yet to be determined, but there is little reason to expect their
influence will differ substantially from the merger wave of the
early 1980s, which produced at most a slight increase in
manufacturing concentration," Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. lawmakers have expressed concerns that a number of
big bank mergers could force consumers to pay higher bank fees as
a result of reduced competition.
</P>
<P>
But Greenspan said while the wave of bank mergers had reduced
the level of banks nationally, the number competing in any given
region of the country remained about the same.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the local banking competitors now "tend to
be the same competitors in an increasing number of markets."
</P>
<P>
Asked about the economic impact, Greenspan said there would
clearly be job losses as banks consolidate branches, but he said a
growing U.S. economy should be able to handle the displaced
workers. He noted that 300,000 workers lose their jobs each week
but despite this fact, the unemployment rate still remains at a
28-year low of 4.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> French Former Prime Minister on the Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Alain Juppe, visiting mayor of
Bordeaux and former Prime Minister of France, predicted here
Tuesday that the Euro will become one of the leading international
currencies of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference attended by about 200 Hong Kong and
French entrepreneurs, Juppe said the Euro, as a fundamental phase
in European integration, is the outcome of years of work which
called for outstanding energy and political will from its heads of
government.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the economic potential of a unified Europe is
comparable to that of the United States and greater than that of
Japan.
</P>
<P>
With 290 million inhabitants, or six percent of the world's
population, the Monetary Union with its 15 members represents 20
percent of the world's GDP and a similar share of the world's
trade.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of statistics for 1996, Juppe said that the share
of the European Union in the GDP of the OECD countries stands at
38.3 percent compared to 32.5 percent for the United States and
20.5 percent for Japan.
</P>
<P>
Setting aside intra-community trade, the share of the European
Union in world trade stands at 21 percent compared to 19.6 percent
for the United States and 10.5 percent for Japan.
</P>
<P>
"Europe is therefore one of the world's leading economic
powers, and the Euro will make it possible to transpose on to the
monetary plane an economic capacity which hitherto was unable to
find its true expression on the international financial markets,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am personally convinced that this economic power will be
consolidated even further within the next few years, thanks to the
Euro," he said.
</P>
<P>
This is firstly because that the European Union countries will
be obliged to coordinate their economic and budgetary policies to
ensure their convergence.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, "the Euro zone will form an incredible single
market of some 300 million consumers, a veritable source of future
development for our firms."
</P>
<P>
Finally, competitive devaluations and unforeseeable swings in
exchange rates, which always impact competitivity, growth and
therefore employment, will no longer be possible.
</P>
<P>
On the monetary plane, the Euro therefore spells out the
economic and commercial power of Europe, but also stands as the
guarantor of the conditions of stability and transparency required
for its development, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Euro will, in the future, be a stable and firm
currency, capable of being the preferred instrument of
international transactions and an international monetary tool as
well.
</P>
<P>
After his arrival in Hong Kong on Tuesday morning, Juppe
attended an opening ceremony of the first International Wine and
Spirits Exhibition for the Asia-pacific region.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic: Belgrade Ready for Political Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic pledged here Tuesday that Belgrade is ready to settle
the Kosovo issue through political means.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement reached after talks between Milosevic and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin said Belgrade has made a
commitment to resume talks with leaders of ethnic Albanians in its
Kosovo region
</P>
<P>
The statement said talks on all issues concerning Kosovo,
including possible forms of an autonomous status for the area,
will be held uninterruptedly in accordance with a schedule
approved by the sides and in line with international standards,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders reaffirmed the need to preserve Yugoslavia's
territorial integrity and condemned any manifestations of
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
It also guaranteed employees of the International Committee of
the Red Cross and the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees free access to Yugoslav areas and unhindered delivery of
humanitarian aid to the regions.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Yugoslav government forces will reduce
their presence in Kosovo as terrorist activity diminishes.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo is a region within the Yugoslav republic of Serbia where
ethnic Albanians, who account for 90 percent of the population
there, are demanding independence.
</P>
<P>
More than 250 people have died since military conflict between
government troops and the Kosovo Liberation Army, the armed wing
of the Albanian independence movement, broke out in February.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic, for his part, welcomed "Russia's clearly expressed
stand" against sanctions on Yugoslavia and in favor of restoring
Yugoslavia's membership in international organizations.

<HEADLINE> Laser Depilation Works for Girl With Hirsute Affliction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Liu Hua, a 17-year old girl
suffering from a hirsute affliction, today received the first
session of laser depilation treatment.
</P>
<P>
The operation was carried out at the No.9 Hospital attached to
the city's No.2 Medical University, and experts said that the girl
will look normal after four such operations over the next six
months.
</P>
<P>
Liu, from northeast China's Liaoning Province, was born normal,
but her skin turned black and thick hair grew in many parts of her
body.
</P>
<P>
The hospital learned about the girl and her anguish that she
was different from other girls from a newspaper report.
</P>
<P>
The hospital administration decided to carry out the
operations free of charge, the country's first treatment using
laser depilation for a hirsute affliction patient.
</P>
<P>
To protect the skin, the depilation will keep the sweat and
sebaceous glands sound while only removing the hair, according to

<HEADLINE> UNEP Calls for Enforced Battle Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the United Nations
Environment Program Klaus Topfer called for worldwide enforced
battle against desertification Tuesday, one day before the World
Day to Combat Desertification.
</P>
<P>
"Desertification remains the leading environmental problem of
the world's dry lands," Topfer said. "Its effects are manifested
socially."
</P>
<P>
"Most of the failure of dry lands management schemes can be
attributed to the adoption of a top-down approach to development,
ignorance of local systems, short time horizons and use of
complicated, difficult-to-maintain systems," said Topfer.
</P>
<P>
The latest U.N. data estimate that now desertification affects
about 3.6 billion hectares -- 70 percent of the global dry lands,
or a quarter of the total land areas of the world excluding the
naturally hyper-arid deserts and Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
Thus, it puts at risk more than one billion people in over one
hundred countries -- about a sixth of the world's population,
said Till Darnhoffer, a senior official in charge of UNEP
projects in this field.
</P>
<P>
In Africa, 73 percent of the the dry lands shows signs of
desertification, said Darnhoffer.
</P>
<P>
He said rough estimations also indicate that the value of the
income foregone annually due to desertification is about 42
billion U.S. Dollars worldwide and in Africa alone 9.3 billion
U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The overall cost of desertification of developing countries
stands at six to 14.6 billion U.S. Dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Desertification means land degradation in arid, semi-arid and
dry sub-humid areas resulting from mainly man-made activities and
climatic variations. It is different from "desert expansion"
caused by climatic fluctuations on vegetation productivity at
desert fringes, said Darnhoffer.
</P>
<P>
"Desertification is both an environmental problem and a
development problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
On June 17, 1994, the Convention to Combat Desertification was
adopted in Paris.
</P>
<P>
So far, a total of 125 countries have ratified or acceded to
the convention. The United States, Russia and Australia are
among those who have still to join.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Housing Starts Drop 0.7 Pct in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Housing construction
in May slid slightly for the third straight month, but building
activity continues to be considerably strong, the Commerce
Department reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In May, builders started construction of new housing units at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.53 million units, down 0.7
percent from March, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
Construction also slowed a bit in March and April after hitting
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.62 million units in
February, the best in over 9 years.
</P>
<P>
Including May, home building has now stayed above the 1.5
million unit rate for nine straight months, a stretch never seen
since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
For the first five months of this year, housing starts have
been 6.4 percent higher than the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that strong economic growth, low unemployment
and mortgage rates helped new home sales hit a record high in
April. Along with home builders, furniture and appliance
manufacturers, architectural firms and landscaping companies are
benefiting from the buying boom.
</P>
<P>
New construction of single-family homes was down a tiny 0.4
percent in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.23
million units. Meanwhile, apartment building starts were down 1.9
percent, to 302,000 units.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Pick Up 0.3 Pct in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. prices increases for
lettuce, cigarettes, gasoline and prescription drugs pushed up
consumer inflation by 0.3 percent in May, the Labor Department
reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Though moderate, the seasonally adjusted increase in the
department's Consumer Price Index (PPI) reported Tuesday was the
largest in 17 months. For the first four months of the year and
for all of 1997, it had varied between no increase and a 0.2
percent rise. For the whole 1997, it dropped to a 1.7 percent low.
</P>
<P>
However, many of the items fueling inflation in May were viewed
as temporary, so there's little sign inflation is headed
dramatically higher either.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report today, the Federal Reserve said production
at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 0.5 percent,
the largest increase in six months. It was driven by a 2.8 percent
surge at utilities, particularly for electricity generation, and a
1.2 percent jump at mines, reflecting a large gain in coal
production. At factories, production edged 0.2 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
The country's industry was operating at 82.2 percent of
capacity, up slightly from 82.1 percent in April and the same as
in March and February. That level indicates little danger of
inflationary bottlenecks developing.
</P>
<P>
For the first five months of the year, inflation ran at a 1.5
percent annual rate. Excluding the volatile food and energy
sectors, the "core rate" of inflation advanced at a 2.7 percent
annual rate, compared with a 2.2 percent increase for all of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Most of the deterioration in the core rate were blamed for
price increases by tobacco companies preparing to settle
multimillion-dollar liability lawsuits. Cigarette prices rose 2.6
percent in May. They're 7.7 percent higher than at the end of
1997.
</P>
<P>
Prescription drug prices rose 1 percent in May, the largest
increase since August 1991. Medical care overall was up 0.3
percent for the month and 3.1 percent over the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
Increases also were registered for child care and nursery
school, clothing and cable television.
</P>
<P>
However, new-car prices fell 0.3 percent, the result of U.S.
manufacturers' effort to compete with imports, whose price has
been lowered by the devaluation of the Japanese yen. Car prices
are down 0.9 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The price of personal computers also fell, as did sporting
goods, home furnishings, video and audio equipment and toys, all
likely the result of the problems in Asia. Airline fares fell 2.4
percent, the second consecutive drop, after rising 8.2 percent
during the first three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, food prices jumped 0.6 percent in May, the largest
pace since October 1996. Lettuce costs soared 26.4 percent, the
result of El Nino's rains washing out California vegetable fields.
Vegetable prices overall shot up 11.9 percent, the biggest
increase in three years.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Upgrades Kariba Power Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Electricity Supply
Authority (ZESA) has refurnished its Kariba South Power Station
in the north at the cost of about 14 million U.S. Dollars to
improve its power generating capacity.
</P>
<P>
A senior ZESA official, James Chiuta Tuesday said the
upgrading of the turbines, which will see them last the next 30
years, will significantly improve turbine efficiency and provide
an increase in output.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when he was presenting a study paper on
the Kariba Dam at the on-going 23rd Southern African Development
Community (SADC) energy ministers meeting which focused its
discinto the sector, the Zimbabwen News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Kariba Dam is the third largest hydro-electric power
reservior in the world with a design volume of 180 billion cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, Edward Rugoyi of the Southern African
Power Pool (SAPP) said the SAPP will soon establish a
co-ordination centre maintain an effective organisation and
infrastructure which promotes the interest and image of SAPP

</P>
<P>
He said the co-ordination centre will be a permanent and
independent entity free from the control and influence of any
power utilities.
</P>
<P>
Countries in the region get their power from an
inter-connected system through SAPP and Harare was chosen as the
location for the co-ordination centre which is obliged to monitor

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's Sam Rainsy Party to Go Ahead With Demonstration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian Sam Rainsy Party
announced Tuesday it will proceed to organize on Sunday a peaceful
demonstration in support of fair elections despite the
government's ban on demonstrations before the elections.
</P>
<P>
Phnom Penh municipality issued an order last weekend, which
took effect immediately, banning any demonstrations until after
the scheduled July 26 elections so as to maintain good security,
public order and a good atmosphere of neutral politics.
</P>
<P>
Municipal cabinet chief Mann Chhoeun said the suspension was in
accordance with an order from the Interior Ministry to maintain a
good atmosphere leading up to the polls.
</P>
<P>
But a statement released by Sam Rainsy Party (former Khmer
Nation Party) accused the order of violating the Constitution and
therefore illegal and unenforceable.
</P>
<P>
Party leader Sam Rainsy said the demonstration planned for June
21 "is precisely on the issue of asking for free and fair
elections and pointing out the shortcomings of the current
electoral process."
</P>
<P>
He expected 10,000 people, including those deprived of the
right to register for voting, would take part in the parade on
June 21, the day after the Friends of Cambodia group of nations
meet in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
According to National Election Committee's figures, about 4.7
million people, or 92 percent of the eligible voters, registered
during the four-week voter registration drive.

<HEADLINE> Somali Currency Cheapest in History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU,June 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Dollar, the leading
hard currency in Mogadishu, Tuesday scratched 8,600 against the
Somali Shillings, the highest ever reached in the history.
</P>
<P>
According to dealers in Bakara market, one of the main
currency markets in the capital city, the Somali Shilling has
started loosing ground a month ago after the business communities
lost their sympathy for the faction leaders following their
failure and continuous postponement of establishing
administration in Mogadishu and reopening the air and sea ports.
</P>
<P>
Abdurahman Abdulle Sanweyneh, one of the well-known business
owners in Bakara market, said that they have observed many
business people who are changing their money into the U.S.
Dollars so that they can start new business activities elsewhere
in Africa, favorably in Kenya, Malawi and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Many Somalis are already having large businesses in Kenya
following the collapse of the former regime in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Sanweyneh said that the Somalis are unfortunately lacking
political stability which has been the basic ground for
guaranteeing the large business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the quick rise of the U.S Dollar value is also
attributed to the withdrawal of the international aid agencies
from Mogadishu following the abduction of the 10 International
Red Cross aid workers in Mogadishu in April this year.
</P>
<P>
The aid agencies had injected a considerable amount of money
into the poor economy of Somalia in their various humanitarian
and development projects.
</P>
<P>
The high rate of the U.S. Dollar is also seriously affecting
almost all the prices of the imported goods including food,
clothes and cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
The other currencies such as Kenyan Shilling, Ethiopian Birr
and Saudi Arabian Riyal are also following the footsteps of the
U.S. Dollars by increasing about five percent each during the
past two days.
</P>
<P>
Even though the supper decentralized economy of Somalia is
lacking administration, the Somali Shillings had maintained a
stable value against the U.S. Dollars in most of the seven-year
long civil strife. The U.S. Dollar had floated between 6,500 and
7,500 Somali Shillings until very recently.
</P>
<P>
This high value for the U.S. Dollar is contrary to the
habitual depreciation of other currencies which often lose their
values against the Somali Shillings during the high tide season
of the Indian Ocean when the demand of U.S. Dollars will decrease
to the minimal since the imports will close down for the four
months between June and September.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique May Rejoin COMESA When Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The visiting Mozambican Foreign
Minister, Leonardo Santo Simao, said here Tuesday that his
country will consider rejoining the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) when its economy improves.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Enoch Kavindele, the outgoing Chairman of
COMESA Council of Ministers and Zambian Minister of Commerce,
Trade and Industry, Simao said that Mozambique has nothing
against COMESA and may rejoin the organization when its economy
has picked up.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique left COMESA about two years ago due to difficulties
in subscribing to many regional organizations, the Zambia News
Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In response to Kavindele's call for Mozambique to rejoin the
19-member regional body, Simao who is on a three-day visit to
Zambia explained that during the period of national
reconstruction, Mozambique decided to withdraw membership from
some organizations that do not benefit the country immediately.
</P>
<P>
Earlier during the meeting, Kavindele asked Mozambique to
reconsider returning to COMESA at some stage due to increasing
intra-regional trade.
</P>
<P>
Kavindele said that Mozambique should rejoin COMESA
particularly because its trading capacity with other countries is
on increase.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Happy With No EU Opposition on Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has been pleased to see
that some European Union (EU) members have retreated from their
threat of seeking to suspend the island's EU accession talks at
the EU summit in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his press briefing Tuesday, government spokesman
Christos Stylianides said "we consider the fact that there has
been no attempt by any country to cause any problems in our
accession negotiations as a positive development."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the EU summit which opened Monday in
Cardiff, the Welsh capital in Britain.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that during Monday's afternoon session of the
EU summit, none of the 15 members raised the possibility of
suspending membership talks with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Last week a French presidency spokeswoman said it would be
difficult for a divided Cyprus to join the EU and hinted that
France may ask for a suspension of accession negotiations with
Cyprus until the Turkish Cypriots join the negotiating team.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides noted that "we are actually awaiting for the
conclusions of the EU summit to assess the outcome of the
meeting."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus started its accession talks with the EU last March in
accordance with a EU summit decision made in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
But Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, who opposes Cyprus'
EU entry, has turned down an invitation from Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides to nominate representatives to participate in the
accession talks as full-fledged members.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since Turkey landed its troops and
took over the northern third of the island in 1974 in the
aftermath of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> Israel Refuses to Extradite Hezbollah Activist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel on Tuesday rejected a
request to extradite a Hezbollah activist who is a German citizen
to Germany for trial, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
A representative of the State Attorney Office told Tel-Aviv
district court during a hearing that Israel wants to try in the
Jewish state Stefan Josef Smirak, who was recruited by Hezbollah,
or Party of God, to attack Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The representative noted that according to the European
Convention on Extradition, there is no obligation to extradite a
person who has already been indicted in the country where he was
arrested.
</P>
<P>
But the defense council for Smirak argued that its client can
not get a fair trial in Israel, which it said wants to hold him as
a bargaining chip for future prisoner exchange with Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Smirak, a convert to Islam, was reportedly recruited by the
militant group Hezbollah during his visit to Lebanon between
August and November in 1997.
</P>
<P>
During this period, he was sent to a training camp in the Bekka
Valley in Lebanon, where he was taught how to use light weapons
and operate explosive devices.
</P>
<P>
Sent by Hezbollah to launch a suicide attack in Israel last
November, he was arrested on arrival at the Ben-Gurion Airport in
Tel-Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Smirak was indicted on December 25 last year on charge of
planning terror attacks in Israel.
</P>
<P>
While under the interrogation of Israeli General Security
Service, he confessed to acting against Israel and said that if
he were released, he would continue his efforts to kill Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The charge against Smirak carries a maximum penalty of life
imprisonment and the next hearing on his case is set for June
30.

<HEADLINE> Malawian Medical College Embarks on Anti-Biotic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 16 (Xinhua)--The University of Malawi's College
of Medicine has launched a study to see if anti-biotic
bacterium can prolong the life of a tuberculosis (TB) patient who
also carries HIV, the Malawi News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Head of medicine department at the college at Blantyre's major
referral hospital, the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH),
Martin Bouree told Malawi's daily The Nation Monday that research
in Europe and west African has shown that bacterium can prolong
the life of an HIV-positive TB patient.
</P>
<P>
Bouree has therefore been testing the bacteria treatment on
200 patients at QECH over the past 6 months to validate the
finding.
</P>
<P>
"TB cases are increasing at an alarming rate, with five new
cases reported everyday at the hospital alone and 68 countrywide,
claiming 9,000 lives annually," said Bouree.
</P>
<P>
"Three out of four TB patients at QECH are also HIV-positive,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Malawi has one of the highest TB and HIV/AIDS rates in the
southern Africa region largely attributed to the rampant poverty
and scanty information on the killer disease among the majority
rural people. Ninety percent of Malawi's population of 11 million
live in rural areas and 60 percent live below the poverty line
and are illiterate.
</P>
<P>
"We have two groups. One group takes one tablet of bacterium
for each patient and the other group two tablets for each
patient. We want to see if the medicine can prolong the life of
these patients who also carry the AIDS virus," said Bouree,
adding that this is also in addition to the usual TB treatment
they receive.
</P>
<P>
He said that the college is also studying how long a patient
coughs before TB is diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
This particular research, he said, will also help traditional
healers to know how long they should keep patients in their
places who "are coughing and may carry the TB germ."
</P>
<P>
He said at the moment 800 traditional healers drawn
countrywide on a pilot basis are being taught on this new
development so that "they do not keep patients for too long at
their places byt are sent to the hospitals in good time for
immediate diagnosis."
</P>
<P>
Tb and AIDS which are mostly going together now are among the
highest killer diseases in this small southern African state.

<HEADLINE> Israel, U.S. Making Headway on Third </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the United States
have made progress in their contacts over the scope of Israel's
third further withdrawal from the West Bank, Israel Radio reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A senior source was quoted as saying that the headway was made
in the last few days in intensive contacts between Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
The radio did not elaborate what progress was actually made.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli President Ezer Weizman will meet later
Tuesday with U.S. Ambassador Edward Walker to get a briefing on
the status of the ongoing Israeli-U.S. negotiations which are now
focusing on the size of the third redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The report came a day after the U.S. State Department
vigorously denied Israel and the Palestinians are on the verge of
a redeployment agreement.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said Monday that Israel
and the Palestinians still disagree on the issue, and any reports
suggesting that an agreement has been reached totally wrong.
</P>
<P>
Although Israel has never publicly adopted the U.S. proposal
for a 13 percent withdrawal in the second redeployment, it seemed
the dispute is over as Netanyahu is ready to accept it. But a new
dispute over the third redeployment has surfaced as Netanyahu is
trying to cancel or minimize the scope of the last redeployment.
</P>
<P>
There are sharp differences within the so-called "kitchen
cabinet," created by Netanyahu to deal with core security matters,
over how to continue the negotiations with the U.S., the radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, a leading dove within the
Cabinet, has pressed Netanyahu to speed up the redeployment
decision in order to move ahead to the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
But the hawkish National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon
insisted that Israel should stand firm to safeguard its vital
security interests. He believes that any pullback exceeding 9
percent will compromise the country's security.
</P>
<P>
A major far-rightist coalition party, National Religious Party
(NRP), has warned Netanyahu against carrying out a significant
pullback, or it would topple the government.
</P>
<P>
To allay concerns of his far-rightist partners, Netanyahu has
been seeking a "total package" on combining the second and third
redeployments in the West Bank. Under the package, Israel accepts
the 13 percent pullback proposal on condition that the third
redeployment will be only 2 percent and the final-status talks
should be immediately started.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has flatly rejected the idea of another 2
percent withdrawal in the third redeployment, while Washington has
also reportedly refused to commit itself to this figure.
</P>
<P>
Israeli newspaper Haaretz quoted government sources as saying
Tuesday that as part of the redeployment package, Israel wants
the U.S. to provide a letter of assurance making clear that
Washington will oppose any unilateral declaration of Palestinian
statehood until the peace process is completed. In return, Israel
will agree to forgo any construction of new settlements.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has vowed that on May 5 of
next year, he will declare an independent Palestinian state
whether progress in the peace process will be made or not.
</P>
<P>
Observers believed that by seeking the U.S. assurance, Israel
hopes to make sure that its best card -- namely, Israeli
recognition of Palestinian statehood -- is not discarded by
premature U.S. recognition.

<HEADLINE> Insects Helpful in Criminal Investigation: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A South African medical
expert has found that insects can be helpful to police in
establishing the time of death of victims of crime.
</P>
<P>
Theunis Van der Linde, forensic entomologist at the University
of the Orange Free State, used his expertise to help police
investigate nearly 100 cases of unnatural death over the last
five years, The Citizen newspaper Tuesday quoted a statement by
the Medical Research Council (MRC) of South Africa as saying.
</P>
<P>
Forensic entomology, which analyses insects found on
decomposing bodies, is often the only scientifically reliable
method to determine the time of death when a body is found in an
advanced state of decomposition.
</P>
<P>
"Insects are always the first to discover the body, sometimes
within minutes after the person had died, and they always arrive
in particular pattern," Van der Linde was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said blowflies arrived first, followed by beetles and ants
when the body was in a more decomposed state. Predators also
visited the body to feed on larvae.
</P>
<P>
A final group, known as "the tourists" (cockroaches,
butterflies and moths), simply used the environment of the
</P>
<P>
body to hide, Van der Linde said.
</P>
<P>
The research, contained in the MRC's latest annual report, is
one of several projects on crime prevention supported by the MRC
as part of a national initiative against crime undertaken by the
Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
The MRC said that Van der Linde had established a model using
dead animals to determine the pattern of insects visiting
carcasses. The carcasses were burnt, frozen, or simply left to
the elements in both winter and summer trial.
</P>
<P>
Van der Linde also studied carcasses which had been left in
shady and sunny position, immersed in water, or hanging, the MRC
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano said here Tuesday that the military crisis in Guinea
Bissau should be resolved peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Chissano made the remarks to reporters after the opening of
the Regional Forum of Investors for Southern Africa, the official
Mozambican News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican president said that the intervention of Senegal
and Guinea has been supported by the Organization of the African
Unity (OAU) which passed the resolutions in favor of the
government of Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
Chissano pointed out that the support from OAU is aimed at
maintaining peace and protecting the peace process in Africa.
</P>
<P>
As to the role of the Community of the Portuguese-Speaking
Countries in resolving conflicts in Africa, Chissano said
that leaders from the Portuguese-speaking African countries held

<HEADLINE> Arafat Starts Consultations on Cabinet Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat on Tuesday started consulations in
Gaza with other political factions on his imminent cabinet
reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
According to East Jerusalem-based Palestinian press service
JMCC, Arafat has met with leaders of the Palestinian Legislative
Council (PLC) on Monday to secure a 10-day delay of a
no-confidence vote against his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Abu Ala, speaker of the legislature, said during the meeting
that the new cabinet should carry out administration reforms as
demanded by the lawmakers. The incumbent cabinet is riddled with
charges from mismanagement to corruption.
</P>
<P>
The speaker said the new cabinet should be responsible for all
phases of the interim agreement, prepare for national
independence, build strong national institutions and do everything
possible to meet the requirements of the people and increase their
living standards.
</P>
<P>
He and other PLC leaders also gave their suggestions on the
structure of the new government, but no details in this regard
were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
All other Palestinian factions, including the Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas) and Islamic Jihad, expressed their
welcome to Arafat's ongoing consultations on cabinet reshuffle,
saying such steps are conducive to the national reconciliations.
</P>
<P>
But a PNA source said in Gaza that because Hamas spiritual
leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin has not returned to Gaza from a
fund-raising tour of regional Arab countries, Arafat's talks with
him have been postponed.
</P>
<P>
Other leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said earlier that
they will not join the new government headed by Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The consultations will last for four days. After that, Arafat
would present the list of his new government to the legislative
body.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Arafat plans to fire Faisal Husseini,
minister for Jerusalem affairs, and replace him with Omar Khatib,
the PNA representative in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Arafat is not happy with Husseini's
spending of donations he received abroad and did not hand over to
the PNA to be included in its budget.
</P>
<P>
Husseini refused to comment on this report in East Jerusalem on
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Ready to Talk With Kosovo Albanians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic agreed on Tuesday to resume talks with a moderate leader
of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians in an effort to defuse the crisis in
the southern Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after his talks with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and
other Russian leaders in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic, who arrived here Monday night on a brief working
visit, said Belgrade is ready to resume talks with Ibrahim Rugova,
a political leader of Kosovo's Albanians, and not with the Kosovo
Liberation Army, the armed wing of the Kosovo independence
movement.
</P>
<P>
More than 250 people have died in clashes between government
forces and the KLA in the region where ethnic Albanians, who
account for 90 percent of the population, are demanding
independence from the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
"I see no reason to conduct negotiations with terrorists,"
Milosevic told reporters, referring to the KLA.
</P>
<P>
He denied that his decision to find a peaceful solution to the
conflict was a result of pressure from NATO air exercises over
neighboring Albania and Macedonia that began Monday.
</P>
<P>
In televised comments after his talks with Milosevic, Yeltsin
said "the most important thing is that Milosevic agreed to sit at
the negotiating table with the Kosovo Albanians".
</P>
<P>
According to a joint statement, read by Primakov, talks on all
issues concerning Kosovo, including possible forms of an
autonomous status for the area, will be held uninterruptedly in
accordance with a schedule approved by the sides and in line with
international standards, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reaffirmed the need to preserve Yugoslavia's
territorial integrity and condemned "any manifestations of
terrorism, separatism and armed actions affecting the civilian
population," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The document said that full freedom of movement will be ensured
throughout Kosovo as a confidence-building measure.
</P>
<P>
It also guaranteed employees of the International Committee of
the Red Cross and the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees free access to Yugoslav areas and unhindered delivery of
humanitarian aid to the regions.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Yugoslav government forces will reduce
their presence in Kosovo as terrorist activity diminishes.
</P>
<P>
"The ball is now mainly in the court of Kosovo's Albanians,"
Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic, for his part, welcomed "Russia's clearly expressed
stand" against sanctions on Yugoslavia and in favor of restoring
Yugoslavia's membership in international organizations."
</P>
<P>
Belgrade is ready to begin talks with the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe on the establishment of an OSCE
mission in Kosovo and reinstating Yugoslavia within the
organization.
</P>
<P>
The statement gave a realistic opportunity to settle the
situation in Kosovo, Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his talks with Milosevic, Yeltsin called U.S.
President Bill Clinton and briefed him on the talks with
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
Clinton expressed satisfaction at the agreements reached with
the Yugoslav leadership, especially its readiness to immediately
resume negotiations with the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, Yeltsin's
press service said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also agreed that the U.S. secretary of state
and the Russian foreign minister will continue consultations on
the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic is scheduled to leave here for home late Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Fifth BITME Exhibition Opens in Bucharest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bucharest, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The fifth BITME international
exhibition of machinery and equipment for the textile industry
started on Tuesday in Bucharest, capital of Romania.
</P>
<P>
"BITME offers this year the latest technologies with respect to
all kinds of machinery for spinning, twisting or winding, weaving
preparatory machinery, weaving and carpet machinery, knitting and
hosiery machinery for the garment industry, as well as other
textile equipment and machinery, testing and measuring equipment,"
said George Cojocaru, General Manager of ROMEXPO, and the main
organizer of the exhibition, at the inauguration of the
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
"All these, through the high amplitude, show a new climate of
performance, competence and intelligence within real competition,
a climate that came true thanks to those who get themselves
involved in the potentials of the Romanian light industry," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"The Romanian textile industry needs fresh infusion of soft
equipments and technologies", Cojocaru said, adding that "The
every year exhibitors' larger number means maybe the best possible
proof that BITME has already become a stable part in the minds of
the specialists and public alike."
</P>
<P>
"Ever since its start, BITME has illustrated, through increased
participation of prestigious foreign companies, a great interest
not only for the Romanian market, but also a challenging
competition of the brand new technologies, an attempt to emulate
all specialists, technologists and merchants," Cojocaru said.
</P>
<P>
The exhibitors are from 19 countries, including Austria,
Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Britain,
Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain, Switzerland, and
for the first time this year, Finland, Israel, Japan,
Liechtenstein, the United States and Sweden.

<HEADLINE> Lufthansa Apologizes for Employee's Anti-Semitic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The German airline Lufthansa said
Tuesday that it would run advertizements in three major Israeli
newspapers on Wednesday to apologize for anti-Semitic remarks made
by one of its employees in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
At issue was an incident which took place on May 19 when a
Lufthansa employee at a check-in counter of the Frankfurt airport
reportedly made a disparaging remark on the religious affiliation
of an Israeli passenger after the two ran into a dispute about the
seat assigned to the passenger.
</P>
<P>
A Lufthansa spokesman said Tuesday that the advertizing apology
was made under an agreement reached with the Israeli passenger,
Itzhak Barak. The dispute had been settled to mutual satisfaction,
he added.

<HEADLINE> Burley Goal Keeps Scotland in Picture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BORDEAUX, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A 67th-minute equalizer from Craig
Burley forced a 1-1 draw for Scotland against Norway here on Tuesday,
saving the team from being the first squad ruled out of the second
stage in the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
After a goalless first half, Havard Flo of German side Werder
Bremen put the Scandinavians ahead less than one minute into the
second half.
</P>
<P>
Vidar Riseth, earning his starting place on the expense of striker
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, dribbled on the left almost to the goalline
before floating the ball to the far post for Flo to head home.
</P>
<P>
Scotland, who lost to defending champions Brazil in the opening
game, retained their composure and then rallied strongly.
</P>
<P>
After receiving a central long pass from behind, Burley calmly
lobbed the ball into net over goalkeeper Forde Grodas.
</P>
<P>
A loss for Scotland would mean they had no chance to enter the
16-team second stage.
</P>
<P>
Gordon Durie and Darren Jackson were the Scots who were cautioned
with yellow cards by Hungarian coach Laszio Vagner while Norway's
Kjetil Rekdal and Henning Berg were also warned.

<HEADLINE> Platini Says First Round Wide Open and Balanced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
PARIS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Michel Platini, president of the World
Cup Organising Committee, said the first round matches at the World
Cup finals were wide open and balanced.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held at the International Media Centre on
Tuesday, Platini said:"If we summarise the first 16 matches played
since the World Cup kicked off, it seems as though the competition
is wide open and balanced."
</P>
<P>
"No one team stands out above the rest. I'm also very happy
that there have many goals in this first round of compeition, in the
first 16 matches, an average of 2.3 goals were scored in each
match-up." said Platini.
</P>
<P>
Platini said some of the small teams overestimated their
opponents. "They focused too much on defence, with the unique
objective of ending up in a draw," Platini said, "It's unfortunate,
because these teams definitely have the means to surprise us.
Nonetheless, I expect they will step their performance up a notch in
the coming matches."
</P>
<P>
As a former soccer star himself, Platini said not a single player
has impressed him greatly. "As far as I am concerned, a great player
is one who makes the right pass at the right time."

<HEADLINE> Iraq Hails New Agreement With U.N. Inspectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tareq
Aziz said on Tuesday that the agreement reached with
U.N. inspectors recently represented "a major turning-point" in
the relationship between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
Aziz made the remarks following the opening ceremony of
Egyptian Products Fair in Baghdad which was organized by 121
Egyptian companies.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and the U.N. Special Commission on disarmament in Iraq,
known as UNSCOM, reached the agreement on the program of work in
the next two months during the commission chief Richard Butler's
recent five-day visit to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Butler told a press conference before leaving Baghdad on Sunday
that if Iraq cooperates fully and give access to important
documents and materials, he will begin to prepare a report which
will lead to the lifting of trade embargo imposed on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz described the agreement was "a good outcome that
represents the willingness of the best people, world public
opinion and all people who call for an end to the embargo."
</P>
<P>
The relationship between Baghdad and the UNSCOM has hardly had
a good time as U.N. inspectors accused Baghdad of refusing to
cooperate. A crisis which arose early this year almost triggered a
war.
</P>
<P>
Aziz also called for an early lifting of the U.N. sanctions
imposed on Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions can only be lifted when UNSCOM verifies that
Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
On Iraq's relations with Arab countries, Aziz said Iraq "has a
sincere willingness to develop relations" with Arab states, and
that the willingness has become a reality "because Iraqi market
has been receiving many Egyptian goods and has room for more."
</P>
<P>
Aziz stressed that Iraq believed seriously in joint Arab work
and cooperation, elaborating that joint work with Egypt has always
been one of the priorities in the approach of the Iraqi leadership.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Underscores Need of Protecting Free Shipping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- In its reaction to Turkey's search
of a Maltese-flagged vessel, Cyprus on Tuesday undercored the need
for protecting the freedom of international shipping.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Customs authorities intercepted and searched a
Maltese-flagged vessel in the Dardanelles, suspected of carrying
components of Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles to
Cyprus. The vessel was released eight hours later after it was
found that the cargo was destined for Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on this incident, Cypriot Government spokesman
Christos Stylianides said that even Cyprus was not involved in
this case because the ship was neither registered under the Cyprus
flag and nor destined for Cyprus, the Cypriot government must
underline its support for free shipping.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that to protect the freedom of shipping, all
international conventions and agreements on shipping should be
implemented.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus clinched a deal with Russia in January 1997 to buy S-300
missiles worth 400 million U.S. dollars in order to increase its
defense capability.
</P>
<P>
The deal, however, angered Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots
living in the northern part of the divided island, who vowed to
take all possible means to prevent the deployment of the missiles.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of an abortive coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Greece, Cyprus' strong supporter, announced last week that the
delivery of the S-300 missiles, scheduled for mid-August, would be
delayed until November.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has said that it can cancel the deployment of S-300
defense system only if considerable progress is made toward a
comprehensive Cyprus settlement or an agreement for the island's
demilitarization is reached.

<HEADLINE> Arab League to Consider Ending Embargo on Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) may join the
African countries in an effort to bring the U.N.-imposed embargo
against Libya to a quick end, a senior AL official implied Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
AL Assistant Secretary General Zakariya Ismail said Arab
foreign ministers will consider swift steps toward doing away with
the embargo in their next regular meeting in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed a resolution adopted by the summit of Organization
of African Unity (OAU) last week in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, to
conditionally lift sanctions against Libya.
</P>
<P>
The northern African country has been under an air, arms and
diplomatic embargo since 1992 after Tripoli refused to hand over
two Libyans suspected of involvement in blowing up a Pan-Am
airliner in 1988 over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people, to
stand trial in the U.S. or Britain.
</P>
<P>
Tripoli argued the two have no chance of getting a fair trial
in the two countries, and insisted that they be tried in a neutral
country or by the International Court of Justice in the Hague. The
stance is backed by families of the victims but shrugged off by
both the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The OAU resolution stipulates that as of September 1, the
African states will not abide by the embargo imposed on Libya if
the West continues to refuse that the two Libyans stand trial in a
neutral country.
</P>
<P>
Nine Arab countries took part in the OAU summit, whose
resolution will "influence the Arab decision-making," Ismail
pointed out, implying the 22-member AL may follow suit.
</P>
<P>
"It has been proven since the ruling of the International Court
of Justice that it is within its jurisdiction to examine the
Lockerbie issue, that sanctions imposed on Libya should be lifted
since they have no legal grounds and only express a political
stance," Ismail said.
</P>
<P>
AL Secretary General Esmat Abdel Meguid flew to London Sunday
on a four-day visit in which he would discuss the Libyan-West
stand-off with British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
Libya has reportedly suffered up to 23.56 billion U.S. dollars
in losses since the sanctions began six years ago.

provoked the Tunisians.
</P>
<P>
Speaking from the town of La Baule near Nantes, Hoddle said he had
heard two sides of the story.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there are English people who are guilty of causing
trouble and they've been dealt with, which is good," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But we saw clips which suggest they were provoked. Some people
were provoked, certainly down at the beach," said Hoddle, whose team
defeated Tunisia 2-0.
</P>
<P>
"Inside the ground, where I was, there was no trouble," said
Hoddle, adding that he fully appreciated the thundering vocal support
from the England fans in Stade Velodrome in Marseille.
</P>
<P>
"Every supporter who was there was fully behind England and they
were superb. As for outside the ground, and in the city, there is
always two sides to the coin," the coach said.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle said he hoped English fans would give the team the same
support on June 22, when England faces Romania in Toulouse.
</P>
<P>
Toulouse city authority has postponed a concert for fear that there
would be crowd trouble invovling England fans.

<P>
MAPUTO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano said Tuesday that foreign investment is welcome in
Mozambique and southern Africa, where joint ventures are of great
significance to the success of social and economic policies.
</P>
<P>
"The governments of southern African countries are carrying
out macro-economic policies aimed at regaining the confidence of
the international community which had been weakened by
instability and armed conflicts in the past," said Chissano in
his opening speech at the Southern Africa Investors Forum.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, southern Africa is now no longer
a region of high risks, but one of peaceful co-existence and
cooperation, and one committed to progress and development.
</P>
<P>
So long as the economies are liberalized, investment
encouraged and infrastructure network restored, the economic
potentials in the region will be fully explored, Chissano noted.
</P>
<P>
He called for concerted efforts by governments and
entrepreneurs to achieve economic prosperity in the southern
African region so as to rival with other emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
The president also briefed the forum on some big projects
Mozambique is now undertaking, such as the Maputo Development
Corridor and the Libombos development initiative involving
Mozambique, South Africa and Swaziland, adding that investors in
the development program of Zambeze Valley will enjoy free tariff
for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
The forum to be ended Friday has drawn about 500 people

<HEADLINE> Chamonix to Hold First World Tourism Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Chamonix, a French resort bordering
Geneva of Switzerland, will hold the first World Tourism Summit on
December 1-3, 1999, the organizing committee announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chamonix provides visitors with a view to the highest summit in
Europe, the Mont-Blanc (4807 meters), which is the third most
visited natural site in the world.
</P>
<P>
The World Tourism Summit is the missing link and is a major
challenge, said Michel Charlet, mayor of Chamonix.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, internationally recognized experts will
debate the implications of tourism on long term development, a
concept widely accepted but whose execution is often problematic.
</P>
<P>
In the coming years, other themes will be on the agenda: the
effects of tourism on economic growth, employment, health,
alimentary habits, national cultural identities, and transport.
</P>
<P>
Today, tourism represents the biggest single factor of travel
in the world, with 550 million people travelling to a multitude of
destinations.
</P>
<P>
Tourism was originally limited to the industrialized nations
but over the past two decades it has become a world-wide
phenomenon with competition exacerbated by the dawn of new
technology and means of communication.

<HEADLINE> More S. Leonean Rebels Surrender to ECOMOG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Over 1,500 soldiers of Sierra
Leone's former military junta have surrendered to the west
African peace-keeping force ECOMOG in the last two weeks, the
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted ECOMOG sources in Freetown, capital of
Sierra Leone, as saying Tuesday that rebels of the ousted
military junta led by Major Paul Johnny Koroma have been coming
to ECOMOG for surrender for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The government announced Two weeks ago that rebels
surrendering by Monday night will be pardoned and guaranteed of
security.
</P>
<P>
Troops loyal to Koroma have been engaged in fierce fighting
against ECOMOG in eastern and northern Sierra Leone since
mid-February when they were chased out of the capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG sources said earlier that the rebels are now in a
desperate situation as they have been out of food and other
logistic supplies.
</P>
<P>
The rainy season, however, has prevented ECOMOG from a quick
success in its efforts to mop up all the rebels, the sources
said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus: Cooperation With Greece Key to Counter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Defense Minister Yiannakis
Omirou Tuesday stressed the importance of military cooperation
with Greece in the context of "Turkish expansionism."
</P>
<P>
Omirou made the remarks in a statement issued after four Greek
F-16 fighters landed at Andreas Papandreou air base near the
western coastal town of Paphos, Cyprus News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the landing of the aircraft conveys a specific
political message: that the military cooperation "will develop as
long as there is Turkish expansionism."
</P>
<P>
It also proved the air base was ready for use, he said, adding
Greek military officers were briefed on and shown around the base.
</P>
<P>
The air base, constructed under the 1993 joint defense pact
between Cypriot and Greek governments, is to be used by Greek Air
Force planes. It has been completed in January.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has warned against
the opening of the airbase to the Greek fighters, saying that the
Turkish Air Force will break the wings of the Greek warplanes if
they land at the base.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared "Turkish Republic
of Northern Cyprus" in 1983 in the north, which is recognized only
by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has kept a 35,000-strong armed forces in northern Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> French Gov't Report Regards Alcohol as Dangerous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A French government report published
on Tuesday said that alcohol is as dangerous as the most harmful
drugs such as heroin and cocaine.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the government to put alcohol among
the top dangerous substances for human consumption and it could
trigger protests from the country's powerful wine and beer
producers.
</P>
<P>
French State Minister in charge of public health Bernard
Kouchner presented the report written by a group of experts to the
Senate, which was debating policy to reduce the risk of drug
addiction.
</P>
<P>
"Scientific facts show that there is no difference in causing
neurotoxicity between alcohol and cocaine," said the report, which
was written under Professor Pierre-Bernard Roques of the National
Council of Scientific Research (CNRS).
</P>
<P>
It used several parameters to measure the degree of harmfulness
of drugs, tobacco and alcohol, such as psychological and psychic
dependence of their addicts, their neuro-toxicity rates, their
capability to cause social dangers, and the existence or no of
substitutes for them.
</P>
<P>
"The state of depression, the compulsive and obsessional
troubles, the anti-social personalities, and anxiety are found
with very high rates among the subjects relying on heroin,
alcohol, and cocaine," it said.
</P>
<P>
The report regarded tobacco as more dangerous than cannabis but
less so than alcohol, heroin and cocaine.
</P>
<P>
More than one in 10 women and more than one in four men in
France have the habit of excessive drinking, according to former
Minister of Health Herve Gaymard.
</P>
<P>
Each year in France, 52,000 people were killed because of
reasons linked directly or indirectly with alcohol and 4,000
killed in driving in drunkenness.

<HEADLINE> 167 Turkish Officers Sacked for Islamic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- In a show of its resolve to crack
down on Islamic fundamentalism, the Turkish army sacked 167
servicemen Tuesday for suspected involvement in radical activities.
</P>
<P>
The order was issued by the Supreme Military Council (SMC) at a
meeting co-chaired by Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and Chief of
General Staff Ismail Hakki Karadayi.
</P>
<P>
Most of the sacked personnel, 58 officers and 109
non-commissioned officers, had allegedly been involved in
fundamentalist activities, the Anatolia News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The council's decision is final and cannot be challenged at the
courts, which have no jurisdiction over the matter.
</P>
<P>
Turkish military, which regards itself as protector of the
country's secular system, sacks some military officers relating to
fundamentalist groups every year.
</P>
<P>
At the Tuesday meeting, Karadayi once again stressed the
importance of fighting fundamentalism in the country. He
complained of the government's inaction in taking tough measures
against those religious extremists, who want to establish an
Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued following the meeting said that the
participants also discussed "foreign threats against Turkey."
</P>
<P>
The SMC meeting is usually called in August and December each
year. Tuesday's meeting, the first in this year, was moved up due
to the increasing concern of the military over the rapidly
spreading fundamentalist activities.

<HEADLINE> Three GCC States Agree to Cut Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Three of the six members of
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) agreed on Tuesday in Saudi
capital Riyadh to cut their oil output by a total of 170,000
barrels per day (bpd).
</P>
<P>
This is the latest of a string of moves taken by oil producers
to trim crude supply in order to shore up the sagging oil prices
on the world market.
</P>
<P>
GCC Assistant Secretary General for Economic Affairs Abdullah
Al-Khleifi said at the one-day meeting of GCC oil ministers
Tuesday that Kuwait agreed to slash its output by 75,000 bpd, the
United Arab Emirates by 75,000 bpd and Oman by 20,000 bpd.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kuwait News Agency, Al-Khleifi said that the
reduction of oil production would start on July 1 and last until
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, which holds most of the Arab crude reserves, with
a proven total of 261.5 billion barrels, had already promised in
an agreement on June 4 with Mexico and Venezuela to cut its output
by 225,000 bpd.
</P>
<P>
GCC oil ministers convened their 21st session at a time when
the oil prices still languished between 12 and 14 U.S. dollars per
barrel despite output cuts, far below the reference price of 21
dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The ministers of Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the
United Arab Emirates and Qatar, held three rounds of talks in the
day to discuss the world market situation and ways to bolster the
oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The GCC oil producers, whose economy depends heavily on oil
earnings, have taken a hard hit in the current oil price slump
resulting from oversupply and flagging demand.

<HEADLINE> Japan Intentionally Lets Yen down: U.S. Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Some advisers of U.S. President
Bill Clinton have said that Japan is letting its currency down so
that its goods would be less expensive in the United States and
Washington has little leverage remaining over Tokyo, the New York
Times said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion was reached after recent internal debates
within the Clinton administration, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The purposes of the Japanese hidden strategy to let a sharp
fall of the yen is to make it nearly impossible for other
Asian nations to export more goods into Japan while Japanese
goods could push out products that other ailing Asian nations
are trying to export to the United States and Europe,
particularly South Korean cars, steel and semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
"What is happening in Japan is hitting all of its neighbors
-- Korea, Thailand -- and it is triggering a huge amount of
instability around the world," Charlene Barshefsky was quoted by
the newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky, a veteran of five years of trade war with Japan,
told the New York Times that the United States would put
pressure on Japan to reform its economy. But she conceded the
threat to block Japanese goods such as cars and computer chip
from U.S. shores would probably accentuate Japan's troubles if
used to compel Tokyo to speed up economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Administration officials in private have long referred to
Japan as "the last firewall" of the Asian crisis, and contended
that if that wall were breached, it was only a matter of time
before Asia's trouble leaped the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
It is an unproven thesis, but clearly investors harbor the
same worry, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin has repeatedly argued
that the Asian crisis poses a rising threat to the United
States. However, the recent run on the yen may have been helped,
intentionally or not, by Rubin, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Rubin told Congress that he had not backed away
from his mantra that "a strong dollar is in the interest of the
United States." A strong dollar benefits American companies
by making it possible for them to snap up assets across Asia at
fire sale prices, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Investors have interpreted those comments as a license to
sell the yen, without fear that the United States would join
Japan in an effort to bolster the yen. "They are probably
reading him correctly," the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Protests Greek Fighters' Landing in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Ministry issued a
statement Tuesday to protest against Greece's landing of its
fighters on the divided island of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the arrival of Greece's four F-16
fighters and a C-130 transport plane at the air base in the
western coastal town of Phaphos is a "grave and provocative
development to destroy security and stability in this region."
</P>
<P>
As a guarantor country of Cyprus, Turkey will take all
necessary measures to stop this development, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish media noted that it is the first time that Greek planes
have landed at the air base since its completion in January,
adding more had used it in joint war games with Cyprus before.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed and
took over the northern third of the Island in the wake of a
pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
About 35,000-50,000 Turkish troops are stationed in the
northern part of the island with the claimed aim to protect the
security of the Turkish Cypriots, who declared unilaterally in
1983 a "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" there.
</P>
<P>
The republic is recognized only by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Milosevic's Offer Not Enough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Tuesday that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic had failed to meet most of the U.S. demands despite his
promise to resume talks with the Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Congress, Albright said there was some progress in
Milsoevic's meeting in Moscow with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, but Milosevic did not pledge to halt "torching the
various populations" in the province.
</P>
<P>
Albright also urged Belgrade to withdraw all its troops from
the Serbian province, criticizing the Yugoslav president for
conditioning any pullback of Serbian forces on Albanian extremists
halting their attacks.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that "all options are open," including military
options, and that a U.S. warning under the Bush administration in
1992 of unilateral U.S. action "is still valid."
</P>
<P>
"NATO leaders have not ruled out the use of force," she said.
"Contingency planning is under way," although the United States
would far prefer a diplomatic settlement of the crisis in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The key U.S. demands, endorsed Friday at a foreign ministers
meeting in London by Russia and six other U.S. allies, are a
cease-fire, a pullback of Serb forces, resumption of negotiations
with Albanian leaders, a monitoring system and return of refugees
to their homes.
</P>
<P>
While the allies are united in their demands, there is some
disagreement on how to proceed. Russia, for instance, dissented
from the decision Friday to cut off Yugoslav commercial flights.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration believes that a new U.N. Security
Council resolution is not required to take military action while
Britain is pushing for such a resolution which could be vetoed by
Russia in the Security Council.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Business Leaders: Engaging China, Critical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- American business leaders
kicked off a nationwide campaign here Tuesday to increase
understanding of trade issues, particularly the importance of
maintaining normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
The campaign called "Go Trade: Compete to Win" was sponsored by
the Business Roundtable (BRT), which voices strong support for the
renewal of China's most favored nation (MFN) trading status, a
controversial issue in Congress.
</P>
<P>
"Trade is the fuel of our economy. International trade and
investment are, more than ever, critical for the well-being of the
United States, its companies and its workers," BRT Chairman Donald
V. Fites told a press conference on the Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
A 30-second television spot was shown and later distributed at
the press conference, featuring an American girl and a Chinese boy
playing together. The spot script goes, "It's not child's play.
Learning to share is serious business."
</P>
<P>
Joseph T. Gorman, chairman of the BRT's Task Force on
International Trade and Investment, said that the renewal of
China's MFN is the key to continued constructive engagement with
China because it will advance important U.S. national security,
foreign policy and economic interests.
</P>
<P>
"MFN, or non-discriminatory treatment of trading partners, is
the norm in international trade -- not a privilege or `favor'
accorded to friendly nations," Gorman said.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton recommended to Congress on June 3 that
China's MFN be extended for another year, a policy pursued by his
predecessors since 1980. Some congressional critics have raised
their voices of opposition before the president flies to visit
China later this month.
</P>
<P>
"MFN not only supports hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs
created by exports, but also supports U.S. companies operating in
China that contribute to the continued expansion of economic,
political and social reform in that country," Gorman noted.
</P>
<P>
The trade between China and the U.S. has grown at an annual
rate of over 18 percent since 1979. China has become the U.S.'
fourth largest trading partner while the U.S. is China's second
largest. Direct exports to China creates more than 300,000 job
opportunities in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Commerce William Daley joined the business leaders
at the press conference, reaffirming that the U.S.-China relations
would be the most important bilateral ties in the world in the
years to come, and normal trade status should be accorded to
China.
</P>
<P>
Congressman David Dreier shared the belief that the U.S. should
follow a "Double Win" China policy. He noted that the two
countries disagree on many issues, however, the most important
thing is to find the best way to address them.
</P>
<P>
He believed that President Clinton's upcoming visit to China
and the renewal of China's MFN would contribute to better
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Congressman Jim Kolbe applauded the BRT's efforts to renew
China's MFN, saying that "America's relationship with China
presents the most complex and significant foreign policy challenge
we face."
</P>
<P>
He was concerned about the lack of understanding among the
American people, quoting a recent poll which showed that 62
percent of the public had no knowledge of international trade and
75 percent did not even know the position of their Congressional
representatives on trade.
</P>
<P>
"This lack of knowledge plays right into the hands of the
protectionists who try to protect their narrow economic interests
at the expense of the American consumer," Kolbe said, warning
"such protectionism often results in higher prices and
lower-quality goods."
</P>
<P>
Congressman Bob Matsui also stressed the importance of
maintaining normal trade relations with China, pointing to the
significant role it played in the Asian financial crisis and the
tension in South Asia following nuclear tests by India and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
China is trying to maintain good relations with its neighboring
countries and rejecting expansionism, and if this could be
ignored, new cold war would prevail in the next century, Matsui
warned.
</P>
<P>
The voice in favor of China's MFN was made heard before the
House Ways and Means Committee holds a hearing on the matter
Wednesday. Congress has 90 days to respond to the president's
decision.
</P>
<P>
The BRT, established in 1972, is an association of chief
executive officers who examine public issues that affect the
economy and develop positions. It groups some 200 business leaders
in all fields.

<HEADLINE> Scotland Coach Says Should Have Won </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BORDEAUX, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Scotland coach Craig Brown said his
team should have won Tuesday's game against Norway in group A of the
World Cup finals here.
</P>
<P>
"The only time we were out of the game was a 10-minute spell after
their goal. I thought we controlled the remainder of the match," Brown
said.
</P>
<P>
"We always have a habit of coming back - I would love to think that
sometime soon we'll get ahead in the game and then I think we can go
on from strength to strength," he added.
</P>
<P>
Brown said he was very disappointed with one point because he
thought the team had done enough to get all three points.
</P>
<P>
The coach said, "We're still here and we'll be fighting to the
end."
</P>
<P>
He was pleased with the decision to put Craig Burley ahead into
midfield from defence in the 1-1 draw.
</P>
<P>
Burley's equalizer in the 67th minute kept their hope to reach the

Burley said after the game, "When the Norwegians scored, we were a
little demoralized but we continued to play well."
</P>
<P>
He added, "I took advantage of an opening in the defence and I saw
that a Norwegian defender was out of position and the goalie had come
out, so I lobbed it in to equlize."
</P>
<P>
Burley said, "Today we were a better team, we could have won it
several times, but we did not quite make it. If we manage to beat
Morocco (on June 23), we still have a chance to qualify."
</P>
<P>
Norway coach Egil Olsen was disappointed at the result, saying "I
thought we could have done better. We are still in the tournament."
</P>
<P>
He added, "We were in control (in the second half) until Scotland
equalized. After that we lost it."

<HEADLINE> Drought Most Linked With Desertification: WMO Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Of many climatic events, drought is
perhaps the one that is most linked with desertification, said
Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)
Godwin Obasi here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The 1997-1998 El Nino, which has now entered its decaying
phase, resulted in serious drought situations in parts of South
America, Africa, Asia, Australia, New Zealand and North America,"
said Obasi in his message marking the fourth World Day to Combat
Desertification and Drought.
</P>
<P>
"These extreme weather events had an adverse impact on economic
sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, forestry, insurance and on
human health," the WMO head said.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the U.N. Inter-Agency Task Force on El Nino,
Obasi said that his organization is collaborating closely with
other U.N. bodies and agencies to develop a strategy for the
prevention, mitigation and rehabilitation of the damages caused by
this episode.
</P>
<P>
He said that desertification and drought pose major problems
for millions of people spread across many continents of the world.
</P>
<P>
Obasi called on the international community "to extend their
full cooperation and to provide the necessary information" to the
second Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Convention to Combat
Desertification, scheduled from November 30 to December 11 in
Dakar, Senegal.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, drylands are inhabited by approximately 2.0 billion
people globally, representing about 40 percent of the world's
population.
</P>
<P>
About 54 million square kilometers, or 40 percent of the land
area of the world, can be classified as drylands, according to the
WMO.
</P>
<P>
In Africa, almost three-quarters of the agricultural drylands
are already degraded and the region is prone to frequent and
severe droughts.
</P>
<P>
In Asia, vast regions of the 1.7 billion hectares of drylands
are threatened by desertification.
</P>
<P>
Though better known for their rainforests, Latin America and
the Caribbean are actually about one-quarter desert and drylands.
In the Americas and the Caribbean, 178 million people live and
work in these drylands and therefore face the risk of
desertification and drought.
</P>
<P>
Much of the Northern Mediterranean region is semi-arid and is
subject to seasonal droughts and high rainfall variability.

<HEADLINE> Six Russian Satellites Enter Planned Orbit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Six Russian Kosmos satellites
launched on Tuesday reached the projected orbit and are
functioning properly, the Russian Strategic Rocket Force stated on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But the Interfax news agency quoted another military source as
saying that the first and second stages of the Tsiklon-3 launcher
fired as required, but the booster's second pulse was mistimed.
</P>
<P>
Instead of a circular orbit at an altitude of 1,400 kilometers,
the satellites are flying in an elliptical one with an apogee of
1,900 kilometers and a perigee of 1,300 kilometers, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
Both sources agreed that the six communication satellites would
operate properly for the Main Intelligence Board of the General
Staff.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday, it was reported that the six satellites
failed to reach the desired orbit, but could still be used.
</P>
<P>
The Tsiklon-3 light booster which launched the satellites was
built at the Yuzhnoye design bureau in Ukraine and based on the
R-36 ballistic missiles, the report said.

<HEADLINE> India Misleading World opinion by Offering Talks: Pak Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Wednesday accused India
of misleading the world community by offering bilateral talks to
Pakistan "as is evident from its double standards on the core
issue of Kashmir which lies unsettled for the last fifty years
despite the UN resolutions."
</P>
<P>
"It's a wrong impression that India first made offer of
bilateral talks to Pakistan on June 22 rather it's Pakistan which
first offered India for talks in Islamabad on June 20 by calling
Indian High Commissioner to the Foreign Office on June 11," said
Foreign Office Spokesman Tariq Altaf in an interview with Pakistan
Television telecast Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
"India instead of responding to Pakistan's initiative of
offering talks went on to announce its own offer of talks for June
22 through the world media unilaterally, thus giving a false
impression to the international community that it wanted to talk
to Pakistan on all issues," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said, India's double speaking can be judged from the fact
that on the one hand it offers bilateral talks to Pakistan on all
matters including Kashmir but on the other its leaders and
diplomats openly speak at local and international fora that
Kashmir is India's integral part.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that India is not serious in holding talks with
Pakistan at this moment and wanted to delay the matter at least
till the SAARC summit to be held at the end of next month where
the two Prime Ministers are likely to meet," the spokesman said.
The 10th summit of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) is scheduled to take place in Colombo, Sri
Lanka late July.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also called upon the international community to
come forward and help resolve the Kashmir issue as it poses a
serious threat to peace in this region.
</P>
<P>
After the nuclear explosions by India and Pakistan, the world
community now strongly feels to resolve the Kashmir issue and has
put it as first priority agenda, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he said, will welcome any initiative from the world
community to help resolve the Kashmir issue which is the root
cause of tension between India and Pakistan, he said.

PARIS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran has lodged with France a
protest against the showing of a movie by the private M6
television channel, which Teheran said portrayed a false picture
about Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian national football team has also threatened to
withdraw from the World Cup finals if France does not make an
official excuse before Sunday, the day when it plays the United
States.
</P>
<P>
But the president of the International Football Federation
(FIFA) Sepp Blatter that he was sure that Iran would play the
United States on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure that things will go ahead well. I also believe that
the men can go to the field and shake hand, even though their
governments don't have official relations," he said at a press
conference here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Iran said that the showing of the movie "Not Without My
Daughter" on Monday by M6 had political implications to destablize
the Iranian footballers.
</P>
<P>
The movie, based on a novel of American writer Betty Mahmoody,
tells about a story of an Iranian-American woman who married with
an Iranian man.
</P>

The woman fled Iran with her daughter after being denied her
right to leave the country without her husband's permission, said

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto said Wednesday he and U.S. President Bill Clinton have
agreed on the need for Tokyo and Washington to join forces to
reverse the yen's plunge against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, in a statement after a telephone talk with Clinton,
said both leaders were delighted to see the United States and
Japan cooperating in exchange markets to support a strong, stable
yen.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar plunged against the yen in New York on
Wednesday, slipping below 138 yen on a sell-off triggered by joint
dollar-selling intervention by the Japanese and U.S. monetary
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said stabilization of the Japanese financial system
and achievement of domestic-demand-driven economic growth in Japan
were crucial to other Asian countries and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government would expeditiously restructure the
financial system and ensure the prompt disposal of bad assets, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Japan would also accelerate the implementation of the fiscal
stimulus package and reform both corporate and individual income
tax structures, Hashimoto added.

<HEADLINE> SADC Members Urged to Ratify Energy Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Failure by some member states to
ratify Southern African Development Community (SADC) energy
protocol is hindering plans to boost energy provision in the
region, a regional official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
SADC energy coordinator Henrique Da Silva said the secretariat
was concerned that some member states were taking longer time
than expected to ratify the energy protocol.
</P>
<P>
He was addressing delegates from 14 member countries attending
the 23rd SADC Energy Officials and Ministers meeting.
</P>
<P>
If ratified by all member states, the protocol would see the
subsequent establishment of an energy commission along with the
replacement of the Technical and Administrative Unit by a
Technical Unit.
</P>
<P>
"Reminders were sent through the proper channels in order to
speed up this process in those countries," Da Silva said. "We
have not received enough response from some member states and we
are still short of quorum for the protocol to become effective."
</P>
<P>
However, he did not mention the member countries that still
have to ratify the protocol.
</P>
<P>
SADC countries operate under an interconnected power system
through the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP).
</P>
<P>
Da Silva said there was an urgent need for member countries to
distinguish between bilateral and regional activities to ensure
that proper procedures were followed in the implementation of
regional ones.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Transport and Energy Secretary Paul Kodzwa stressed
that southern African countries should focus their objectives on
regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The meeting aims to review regional power policies and
discussing ways through which investment can be increased in the
energy generation sectors in the region.

PARIS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A total of 102 people, half of them
English fans, have been brought to court following the violent

Marseille, said the governor of the region PACA Jean-Paul Proust

</P>

"One hundred and two people have been questioned for flagrant

The governor said that almost all the English fans arrested are
adults, while a majority of the local fans arrested in Marseille
are minors.
</P>

He said that no one has been expelled so far, as those who will
be condemned to prison sentence should serve their terms before
being expelled.

KUWAIT CITY, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A ranking official of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Wednesday
appealed to Islamic countries for more financial assistance to
refugee-relief programs.
</P>
<P>
The chief of mission of the UNHCR in Kuwait, Moustafa Omar,
called on the Muslim world to help overcome his organization's
financial difficulties that could jeopardize the protection and
assistance of the world's refugees.
</P>
<P>
This is part of an urgent global campaign, which is also the
first ever staged by the UNHCR, to raise funds for its 1998
operations that cover almost 22 million refugees across the world.
</P>
<P>
Omar told a press conference here that the UNHCR budget is
financed by governments, non-governmental organizations,
individual and corporate donations. But the donations this year
covered only half the budget of 1.1 billion U.S. dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret that Islamic countries are not represented
as major donors, though the majority of refugees in the world are
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
There have been contacts between the UNHCR and several Gulf
Arab countries, and some of them are likely to make contributions,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Omar said that the shortage in financing will affect several
refugee programs including repatriation projects in Afghanistan,
Angola, Liberia and the Great Lakes region in Africa.

Chinese hostages in the process.
</P>
<P>
On June 7, police in the east China province of Fujian were

The kidnappers told Liu's family to get the money ready and

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz met here Wednesday with Russian presidential envoy Viktor
Posuvalyuk to review the latest developments in the U.N. weapons
inspections, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Posuvalyuk, also Russia's deputy foreign minister, arrived here
Tuesday for talks with Iraqi officials on the U.N. Security
Council resolutions on Iraq, and the closure of Iraq's weapons
files, starting with the nuclear file, INA said.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the files on Iraq's biological, chemical and
nuclear weapons programs will prepare the ground for lifting the
U.N. sanctions imposed in 1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Aziz and Posuvalyuk discussed Iraq's relationship with the
U.N. Security Council and the outcome of Iraq's recent talks with
the U.N. Special Commission on disarmament in Iraq, or UNSCOM, INA
said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz and UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler on Sunday reached an
agreement on a two-month timetable to end the U.N. disarmament
activities in Iraq if Baghdad fulfills a string of obligations to
prove it has come clean of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Butler said he believed that Iraq was close to be free from the
long-running crippling U.N. sanctions.

Russia, along with some other permanent members of the Security
Council, has proposed ending the inspection mission in Iraq and
replacing it with long-term monitoring, in order to relieve the

WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
spoke to Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto through
telephone on Tuesday night, a White House official said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"They spoke by phone last night," the official said. But he
declined to provide details of their conversation.
</P>
<P>
They spoke as the Untied States was preparing to send Deputy
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers to Japan and hours before
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began intervening in
foreign exchange markets for the Treasury Department on behalf
of the yen.
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said on Tuesday that he was
concerned about the weak yen and was examining the possibility
of sending Summers to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
"We've had for a long time concern about the absence of
Japanese growth and we have had great concern about the weakness
of the yen," Rubin said after a lunch with Democrats in the U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese currency has tumbled in recent weeks to an
eight-year low as Japan's economy slipped into recession and
Japanese government officials offered no concrete measures for
stimulating activity.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply concerned about the prolonged weakness of the
Japanese economy," Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has told
a Senate hearing.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Gives Guarded Welcome to Milosevic's Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
Wednesday praised Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's offer to
alleviate the Kosovo conflict as "an important step in the right
direction."
</P>
<P>
But Kinkel noted that not all the Western demands had been met
and therefore the pressure on Belgrade should be maintained.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel made the remarks after a telephone conservation
Wednesday morning with his Russian counterpart Yevgeni Primakov to
gather information about the talks between Russian President Boris
Yeltsin and Milosevic in Moscow on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Wednesday, Kinkel said that Moscow had
succeeded in pushing through some key demands made by the
six-nation Contact Group, with Milosevic pledging to resume talks
with Kosovo's Albanian leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav president also agreed to provide freedom of
movement in the Serbian province of Kosovo for diplomats and
international humanitarian organizations.
</P>
<P>
However, Kinkel also regretted that Belgrade still refused to
withdraw its troops from Kosovo unconditionally and to accept a
third party in the Kosovo peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations could only be successful when the escalation
of violence and clearing of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians actually
came to a stop, Kinkel said.
</P>
<P>
The German foreign minister said he did not believe it was time
to ease the economic sanctions on Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, western countries would continue to examine military
options in order to maintain pressure, he added.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Environmental Protection
Authority of Ethiopia said Wednesday that 70 percent of
Ethiopia's land is exposed to desertification.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here to mark the World Desertification
Day which has been observed on June 17 since 1994, the authority
said the size of forest area in Ethiopia which protects leaching
has been reduced to only three percent.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government is taking measures to sustainably
address the problem of desertification, the authority said,
adding, the Ethiopian parliament has endorsed the international
convention on the prevention of desertification and issued
directives for its implementation.
</P>
<P>
The preparation of the national desertification prevention
program is underway to implement the international convention,
the authority added.
</P>
<P>
The World Desertification Day was established following the
agreement on the United Nations convention to combat
desertification in 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics available, about 900 million people
across the world suffer from desertification-related problems, of
whom 80 percent live in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
In Africa, one-third of the population suffers from this
problem, while three-fourths of the people of the member
countries of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development
(IGAD) are facing the problem.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Effort Last Chance to Save Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian ambassador to Egypt
said Wednesday that Cairo's efforts to coordinate with the parties
concerned may prove to be the "last chance to save the peace march
in the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
Talking to the Middle East News Agency here, Zuhdy Al Qidra
said that moves and contacts made by Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak will in the coming days "define the fate" of the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
"They will reveal to the United States and the entire
international community the truth about the stance of Israel which
rejected the peace approach and challenges the aspirations of the
peoples of the area to realize peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said there is a pressing need for the United States, as a
co-sponsor of the peace process, not to submit to Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who "continues to play with fire and
pursues his expansionist plans which have blocked all roads toward
peace."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) now asks the Arab
nation to agree on a common mechanism capable of confronting
Netanyahu's intransigent policies, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Qidra warned the situation in the area was taking a "very
dangerous turn," which threatens stability in the area and could
lead to acts of violence, particularly after Israel decided to
form a force of Civil Guards in Jewish settlements in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli decision is a clear call to resort to violence to
seize more Arab land by force, to open the road before Israeli
extremists to attack Palestinians, and to undermine the
restoration of the legitimate rights of Palestinians," he added.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said a careful analysis of the deadlock in the
peace process and latest Israeli statements show that the road of
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations has been fraught with dangers.
</P>
<P>
There is no hope that Israel will accept the U.S. initiative
calling on Israel to withdraw from 13.1 percent more of the West
Bank, which has been accepted by the Palestinian side, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks have been stalled since March
1997 when Israel began work on a new Jewish settlement in Arab
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Americans have so far failed to convince Israel to accept
its formula of further Israeli redeployment in the West Bank in
exchange for Palestinian crackdown on terrorism, in order to move
the peace wheel forward.

<HEADLINE> Manila Hopes to Weather Fresh Currency Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government on
Wednesday expressed the hope that the Philippines will be able to
ride out the financial storm in the midst of the depreciation of
the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Press Secretary Hector Villanueva told reporters
that "if the Japanese economy contracts, the Philippines also will
follow the trend."
</P>
<P>
The yen has been falling against the U.S. dollar recently, with
its exchange rate against the dollar plunging to a record low of
more than 147 to one dollar Monday.
</P>
<P>
Japan, the world's second largest economy, has declared a
recession, worsening unemployment.
</P>
<P>
However, Villanueva said that the Philippines has some strong
points to contend with in the face of the recession in Japan.
</P>
<P>
These are the strong underground economy which serves as a
balancing factor to keep the Philippine economy strong, the income
disparity between the rich and the poor is not too high, and
prices of prime commodities have remained stable.
</P>
<P>
Villanueva admitted that the financial crisis that hit East
Asia, including the Philippines, has caused havoc in the economy.
</P>
<P>
He was hopeful that Japan will shortly recover from the
recession because a long recovery will affect the economy
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
An economist, Villanueva said Asia's economy had overheated in
the mid 1980s due to the unregulated entry of foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
With the East Asian contagion still being felt compounded by
the depreciation of the yen, Villanueva was still optimistic that
"we will ride the storm."

<HEADLINE> Euro Endeavor Stifles German Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The fiscal austerity program imposed
by Germany to meet the criteria for joining the single European
currency cost the country about 1 percent in economic growth last
year, a leading German economic research institute said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates of the Berlin-based German Institute for
Economic Research (DIW), fiscal restrictions resulting from the
euro endeavor amounted to about 29 billion marks (16.2 billion
U.S. dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a number of restrictive measures, Germany managed to
cut its budget deficit from 3.6 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP) in 1996 to 2.7 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Under the European Union's Maastricht Treaty, countries must
cut their 1997 budget deficits to no more than 3 percent of the
GDP in order to qualify for the euro.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the DIW, only about half of Germany's
budget reduction in 1997 actually came from spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
The rest was the result of one-off measures adopted by the
government to increase revenues and of the new calculating methods
used by the German Federal Statistics Office.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Presidents George
Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford have jointly urged the Congress
to work for a stronger relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
In an unusual move, the three former presidents, together with
seven former secretaries of state, seven former secretaries of
treasury, six former secretaries of defense and five former
national security advisors, signed an open letter to the Congress,
urging the legislators to approve the Most-Favored-Nation (MFN)
trading status for China.
</P>
<P>
"American foreign policy cannot succeed if it fails to engage
China," said the letter, which was published Tuesday in The
Washington Post, The New York Times and other influential
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
"Establishing strong, enduring ties with China has been a
principal objective of American foreign policy since President
(Richard) Nixon's historic visit in 1972, and has been supported
by all subsequent administrations of both parties," it added.
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton's upcoming visit to the People's Republic of
China is a continuation of that policy. It is also an affirmation
of the importance of constructive Sino-American relations at a
critical moment in Asia," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
"It is thus necessary that the visit take place as scheduled,"
the former presidents and secretaries declared.

TOKYO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto said Wednesday he and U.S. President Bill Clinton had
agreed to cooperate in stabilizing foreign exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders reached the agreement during telephone talks
after the dollar hit an eight-year high earlier this week against
the lackluster Japanese currency.
</P>
<P>
"I agreed with the (U.S.) president that it is preferable for
Japan and the United States to cooperate for a strong yen and the
stabilization of the market," Hashimoto said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar hit an eight-year high of the 146.75 yen, the
highest level since August 1990, earlier this week in Tokyo on the
weakness of the Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
In London, the dollar dropped to 138.75 yen after the
U.S. Treasury Department confirmed the U.S. Federal Reserve Board
had intervened in the market by selling the dollar against the
yen, traders said.
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the U.S. unit was trading at 141.98-142.01 yen at
5:00 p.m. (local time), after falling to low as 144.10 in early
trading. The Japanese unit traded at 143.35 in New York late
Tuesday.

<P>
LA-TOUR-DU-PIN, France, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Fautino Asprilla has
been kicked out of Colombian squad, head coach hernan Dario Gomez said
here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Asprilla's exclusion from the rest of competition followed comments
made by the Parma striker on Colombian radio which questioned the
tactics used by Gomez and the performance of whole team in their 1-0
loss to Romania.
</P>
<P>
"He broke the rules by speaking that way to a journalist. He knew
what he was doing, he has excluded himself," said Gomez after
Wednesday morning's training session here.
</P>
<P>
Gomez added that ousted Faustino remained a friend of him and the
country's soccer association would issue a official press release to
announce the date of his departure.
</P>
<P>
Gomez said, "He may be young but the rules still apply to him.
Moreover, the comments he made aren't justified as there were no
tactical problems against Romania."
</P>
<P>
The expulsion came as a surprise for most of the Colombian players
but Carlos Valderrama said the team was still united.
</P>
<P>
Asprilla had told the Colombian radio reporter that he thought he
had not played badly and teammates had played worse without being
taken off, apparently referring to playmaker Valderrama.

<HEADLINE> Kiriyenko: Russia to Carry out Anticrisis Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko on Wednesday called on the government to show courage
and political will in implementing its economic anti-crisis
program, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session of the second economic forum of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in St. Petersburg,
Kiriyenko said the program would be unpopular in certain areas,
but the government would have to carry it out.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's financial and economic crisis was due to
both external and internal causes, but mainly the latter.
</P>
<P>
The main cause, in his view, was the crisis of confidence in a
system which lived beyond its means, funding expenditure with
external and internal borrowings.
</P>
<P>
The government's priority was to establish a tight budget
policy and support industrial production, Kiriyenko said. Only
"firm budget stabilization" could help overcome the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The anticrisis program will be presented to the enlarged
government meeting on June 23, in front of President Boris Yeltsin
and members of parliament, he announced.
</P>
<P>
Over 2,000 delegates from the CIS states are taking part in the
St. Petersburg forum, the largest economic congress of the CIS.

<HEADLINE> Initiatives in Progress to Get Pak to ASEAN Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Diplomatic initiatives are now in
progress to get Pakistan to attend the nuclear non-proliferation
discussions of the upcoming ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) to be held
here in July, a senior Philippine official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Domingo Siazon, current
chairman of the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
Regional Forum, said the initiatives were taken on the basis of
consensus among ARF members.
</P>
<P>
But Siazon said that the materialization of these initiatives
will largely depend on the agreement by India, Pakistan's arch
enemy.
</P>
<P>
India is a regular member of the ARF, the only existing
security forum in the Asia-Pacific, which groups the nine-member
ASEAN and its 10 other dialogue partners.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has a pending application with the ARF but its recent
nuclear tests in reaction to India's similar nuclear detonations
are expected to discourage its admission into the forum in the
immediate future.
</P>
<P>
Both the nuclear tests by India and Pakistan were strongly
condemned by the international community.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said a prudent approach to the incipient arms race
triggered by the nuclear tests is to get the players to the
conference table.
</P>
<P>
"The ideal is to get Pakistan and India to the same discussion
when the ARF meets in Manila next July, with Pakistan granted only
ad hoc observer status but discussions involving Pakistan will
focus only on nuclear non-proliferation," Siazon explained.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he explained, needs first to agree to the invitation,
and India to give its consent to the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The idea of inviting Pakistan to the Manila ARF meeting, Siazon
said, has many proponents and entails diplomats with "closer ties"
with New Delhi and Islamabad "getting in touch with the two
capitals" on an informal basis.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear issue is expected to figure prominently when ARF
foreign ministers meet in Manila.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines, which is now holding the rotating ASEAN
chairmanship, will host its ministerial meeting and the ARF
conference in late July.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's dialogue partners in the ARF include Australia, Canada,
China, Japan, India, Russia, New Zealand, the United States and
the European Union. Cambodia and Papua New Guinea are observers in
the ARF.

countries."

<P>
BEIRUT, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldiers were wounded
in south Lebanon by a roadside bomb overnight, the Orient Radio
reported here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bomb was detonated by remote control about midnight Tuesday
when an Israeli patrol was driving along a road near the village
of Hadatha in the western sector of the Israeli-occupied zone.

<P>
Six Israeli soliders have been killed and 64 others injured in
south Lebanon so far this year.

Israel carved out a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in
south Lebanon in 1985 as security zone, with the claimed aim of
protecting its northern areas from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah has been spearheading a guerrilla war in south
Lebanon against some 1,500 Israeli occupation troops and their
allied 2,500-strong South Lebanon Army militia.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Feels Fallout from Yen Weakness: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The weakening Japanese yen has
started to hit the Hungarian economy, sending stock prices down
and affecting the forint, the national currency, the Nepszabadsag
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The yen would further affect the national economy, which was
already straining under the knock-on affects of the recent
parliamentary elections and the lackluster Russian economy,
according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Hungary has a trade deficit against Japan with Japanese-funded
automobile and electronic firms importing large amounts of
equipment and parts from Japan.
</P>
<P>
The yen's weakness would further increase the deficit, helping
Japanese exports, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the exchange rate averaged one forint to seven yen,
but it is expected to rise to one to 10 this year because of the
yen's devaluation.

Spain lost the high-profile match 3-2 after taking the lead
early in the match.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan Seeks More Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan will create a sound
environment for foreign investment built on a steady economic
policy, First Deputy Prime Minister Alievich Djandosov said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Djandosov, also the chairman of the state investment committee,
told the Economy and Life in Asia newspaper that encouraging
foreign investment was the top priority of the central Asian
nation's economic agenda.
</P>
<P>
A string of laws, including a foreign investment law passed in
January 1995, have been formulated to attract foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
Investment has been mainly channeled into the construction and
processing industries, Djandosov said.
</P>
<P>
The government would also seek to entice direct investment in
the development of the nation's new capital of Astana.
</P>
<P>
Endowed with rich natural resources, including oil and natural
gas, and cheap labor, Kazakhstan has become an attraction to
foreign businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The past five years have seen a total 6.2 billion U.S. dollars
in direct foreign investment in Kazakhstan with an inflow of 1.7
billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 foreign companies have invested in Kazakhstan,
making huge contributions to its economic development and social
stability.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 2.5 percent
last year, which according to the World Bank was among the highest
in the Commonwealth of Independent States formed by members of the
former Soviet Union.

<HEADLINE> Blatter Says Referee Work Needs Improvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Joseph Sepp Blatter, president of
international soccer governing body FIFA, said here on Wednesday the
refereeing in the World Cup finals still needed improvement.
</P>
<P>
"I said refereeing is generally good but should improve. It should
not be described 'excellent' because of the lack of rigor against
tackling from behind.," the president said.
</P>
<P>
"I saw a tackling from behind in a match yesterday but the referee
did not show the red card," said Blatter.
</P>
<P>
After 18 group games in the tournament, only South Korea's Ha Seok
Ju was sent off for tackling from behind.
</P>
<P>
Blatter added that the goalkeepers who had not followed the new
rules in the first days of the competition were not dealt with by the
referees either.
</P>
<P>
According the latest rules, the goalkeeper could not handle the
ball more than six seconds or four steps before releasing it.
</P>
<P>
The president, who was elected on June 8 in the FIFA Congress here,
backed the decision of referee Lucian Bouchardeau from Niger to award
a penalty kick to Italy in their 2-2 draw with Chile.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why there are rumors that Mr. Bouchardeau has been
sent home. Bouchardeau did his job as a referee properly. A player
touched the ball and Bouchardeau made his judgement whether it was
unintentional. And it was right." Blatter said.
</P>
<P>
Roberto Baggio converted the spot kick, giving Italy the equalizer
in their first group match.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Inner Cabinet Fails to Decide on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Amid reports that some progress
has been made over further Israeli pullback from the West Bank,
Israeli inner cabinet met Wednesday to discuss the issue, but no
result was yielded.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that the members of the inner cabinet,
namely, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai, National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon
and Minister of Industry and Trade Natan Sharansky, will meet
again in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held after Netanyahu confirmed Tuesday night
that there has been progress in the Israeli-U.S. contacts over the
redeployment. Speaking on Israeli television, the prime minister
said a decision on the scope of the second pullback has not been
made, but he believes that an agreement could be reached soon.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Israel Radio quoted diplomatic sources as
saying that Israel and the U.S. have made headway in their
negotiations over the further redeployment, which Israel says the
negotiations are centering on.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been seeking a "total package" concerning the
further redeployments from the West Bank. In another word, it is
trying to include the third redeployment into the second pullback
agreement. Some believe that by doing so, Israel hopes to minimize
the scope of the third redeployment.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, in a seldom
expression of cautious optimism, also said Tuesday that she
believes Israel and the Palestinians could reach an agreement on
the redeployment. Speaking at a Senate hearing, she said that the
U.S. will continue its efforts "so long as we believe that Israel
and Palestinians are serious about doing so."
</P>
<P>
But there are sharp difference in Israel's inner cabinet over
how to continue the negotiations with the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Mordechai has stressed on many occasions that the time has come
for a redeployment decision. He also said that "as much as
possible" should be finalized concerning the third withdrawal in
order to move ahead to the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
But Sharon, the leading hawk in the cabinet, insisted that
Israel, now more than ever, should stand firm to safeguard its
vital security interests.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Aim At Vital Clash Against Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BORDEAUX, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Belgian team, which held the
Netherlands to a goalless draw in their first group match, are
aiming at their vital match against Mexico on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The match on Saturday against Mexico is vitally important
because they lead the group with three points," said George Leekens,
head coach of the Belgian team, "For me, the main question is
whether Mexico will settle for a draw or attempt to earn
qualification as of Saturday."
</P>
<P>
Leekens said:"I am preparing my players without knowing exactly
the final line-up. All 22 players must be ready. I'm adapting my
tactics because of injuries, although the three-substitute rule is a
big problem."
</P>
<P>
Leekens showed his respect towards Mexico:"Mexico is still a
very technical team, very talented and experienced, despite having a
young defence."
</P>
<P>
"Luis Hernandez is very creative. As for Cuauhtemoc Blanco, I
was very impressed by his technical skill against South Korea. I
hope he will be as successful against the Netherlands in their last
group match." Leekens said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- China's major securities firms
today called for increased awareness of the law, risks, and
service to get the securities market to contribute more to
economic development.
</P>
<P>
This comes from more than 300 representatives from across China
who participated in a two-day meeting sponsored by the Securities
Association of China.
</P>
<P>
They said that the laws and regulations of China's securities
market are not perfect and the quality of professionals falls
short of what is needed. Securities firms need to deal with
unethical behavior, they said.
</P>
<P>
China's securities market began when the stock exchanges in
Shanghai and Shenzhen were founded in the early 1990s. China now
has 327 major securities firms, and 2,440 securities offices.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 800 Chinese companies that are listed and
about 34 million investors.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that as China increases its market economy
reforms, the securities market becomes more important and provides
a very important venue for the cash-starved state-owned
enterprises to raise funds.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A reconciliation meeting of the
Islamic fundamentalist Al-Itihad al-Islam, the Somali National
Front (SNF) and the Marehan subclan has been concluded in
El-Addeh village in the Somali border region of Gedo.
</P>
<P>
Ali Nur, deputy chairman of the SNF factions, who attended the
meeting, said delegates had agreed upon an immediate cease-fire,
the cessation of all hostilities, and the re-encampment of the
opposing militiamen back to their former barracks, effective from
June 15 onward.
</P>
<P>
The leaders who contacted Xinhua in Mogadishu via VHF radio
characterized the reconciliation meeting as "historic and
fruitful in fostering peace in Gedo region" bordering on
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
According to Sheikh Mohamud Moallim Nur, the deputy chairman
of Al-Itihad Al-Islam, the meeting concluded two days ago was
prompted by the call of Marehan traditional leader Ugas Omar Ugas
Hirsi, following the increased restlessness and armed skirmishes
in the region between the feuding groups.
</P>
<P>
The elders said all the roads abandoned due to the hostilities
will be reopened to traffic and commercial activities between the
districts of the region and the country at large.
</P>
<P>
The conference also resolved that another follow-up meeting
will be convened in the same village on July 15.
</P>
<P>
The border region of Gedo had been the center of conflicts
between the SNF faction of General Omar Haggi Massale and those
of the deposed Al-Itihad militiamen after Ethiopian forces
supported by the Marehan SNF militiamen to control of the
border towns of Dolow, Bulo Hawo and Luq in late 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian forces pulled out of the region last year after
Somali faction leaders including General Omar Haggi Massale
signed an agreement in Cairo late last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the agreement was not recognized by Ethiopia.

CAIRO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
GAZA -- The Ministry of Agriculture of the Palestinian National
Authority has announced that Saudi Arabia has imported from
Palestine 13,000 tonnes agricultural products during the current
agricultural season.
</P>
<P>
Khalid Zarid, the ministry's marketing director, said that
since Saudi Arabia exempted Palestinian agricultural products from
customs duties, the country's imports from Palestine have
increased more than 10 folds from last year's imports.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- The Damascus Chamber of Commerce has announced that
the first private company in Syria has been set up for the
marketing of vegetables, fruits and agricultural products with a
capital of 8 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The company is aimed at seeking outlets for world markets,
especially the European markets, the Syrian News Agency reported
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It assumes special importance after Syria's decision to sign
the Euro-Mediterranean partnership agreement.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt and Belarus have signed nine agreements on
activating cooperation, avoidance of double taxation and promotion
of trade, the Egyptian Alam Al Yom daily reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The agreements signed on Tuesday cover cooperation in the
fields of transport, education, information, veterinary medicine,
utilization of natural resources and transfer of technology.
</P>
<P>
The two countries agreed to set up a joint supreme committee to
follow up bilateral cooperation.
</P>

public utilities in Suez gulf and the eastern sub-Suez canal zone
will enjoy tax exemption, in implementation of the law of
incentives and investment guarantees, the Alam Al Yom daily
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But Fawzi said that contracting works do not enjoy the favors
given by the law, under which exemptions cover those activities
which face investment risks.

JERUSALEM, June 17 (Xinhua) -- In a recent opinion poll, most
Israelis surveyed expressed readiness to accept that Israel
withdraws troops from another 13 percent of the West Bank, the
Yediot Aharonot daily reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the opinion poll conducted by Hadaf for the daily,
59 percent of the surveyed said they were in favor of the
withdrawal scope.
</P>
<P>
The United States has reportedly put forward the proposal in a
bid to break the deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
The Palestinians have accepted the proposal, but Israel has not.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 people in all walks of life across the country
were surveyed in the opinion poll.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that 74 percent of the surveyed think that it
is necessary to continue the peace talks and implement the signed
peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
But more than half of the surveyed do not think that Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to carry out the
agreements.
</P>
<P>
The peace process between Israel and the Palestinians has been
deadlocked since March 1997 when Israel began construction of a
Jewish settlement in traditionally Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
It is now mainly stalled over Israel's further troop pullback
from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The error rate of the survey is 4.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> China Announces Ambitious Housing Reform Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government today
announced an ambitious market-oriented housing reform plan aimed
at providing better dwellings for its urban residents.
</P>
<P>
The plan, declared at a national housing reform conference
which closed here today, will end the long-practiced welfare
housing distribution system for government officials and
enmployees of state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, workers will be encouraged to buy houses
with their salary or bank loans as the newly completed houses will
be sold, instead of rented, to the dwellers in pricinple.
</P>
<P>
The reform also calls for the introduction of a multi-layered
housing supply system to meet the needs of people of different
incomes.
</P>
<P>
Under such a system, high-grade apartments and houses will be
sold at market prices; medium-income families will enjoy housing
sold at government-directed prices; and low-income families will
receive government-set low-rent dwellings.
</P>
<P>
The conference stressed the importance of expanding
investment in economical apartments and dwellings and called for
curbs on the excessively high land and housing prices and profits
in major cities.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also called for expanded and better financial
support and services for urban home buyers, allowing all
commercial banks to provide mortgage loans with no amount limits
to potential buyers.
</P>
<P>
In his speech delivered at the meeting, Vice Premier Wen Jiabao
emphasized the importance of introducing the housing reform in an
active and steady manner.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the deepening of the reform will help turn
housing construction into a new growth point of the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts observed that, despite progress in housing
reform in recent years, the market mechanism still cannot play its
proper role in the construction, distribution and marketing of
housing. If housing reform is not deepened, the reform in other
sectors will be affected, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
They stressed the importance of housing reform in achieving the
goal for this year's economic growth and in creating new jobs.
</P>
<P>
They also pointed out that deepening the reform of the housing
system is also a need for the constant rise in the people's living
standards.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: China Expecting Housing Sector Growth Li Jianmin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- China is working on a new housing
reform for commercializing housing that is expected to promote
growth in the housing sector.
</P>
<P>
Under a new plan, new affordable housing will be sold to
workers and staff only. The workers and staff have to purchase
apartments by themselves by using the housing subsidies, public
housing fund and bank loans, according to a Ministry of
Construction official.
</P>
<P>
This will bring China's welfare-based housing allocation
system, which has been operating for nearly 50 years, to a
complete halt, and demand for affordable housing is expected to
increase sharply. China is planning to spend 41.9 billion yuan
this year building nearly 49 million sq.m. of housing, the
ministry says.
</P>
<P>
To increase the average per capita urban living space to 9
sq.m. by the end of the century, the country has to build 175
million sq.m. annually and renovate or rebuild 200 million
sq.m. of old housing annually.
</P>
<P>
The housing reform is meant to bring rational and stable
development to the real estate sector, mainly in affordable
housing projects to improve the standard of living and to make the
housing sector a pillar of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The effort to reform the housing market by selling housing to
Chinese rather than using housing as a benefit at the work unit
will play a decisive role in developing the market.
</P>
<P>
To stimulate this, commercial banks have begun to provide
mortgages, and a nationwide fund system is providing assistance
for private housing.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Invites Afghan Parties to Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar
Ayub Khan said here Wednesday that Pakistan has invited
representatives from Afghanistan's Taliban militia and their rival
Northern Alliance to work out formulas to press forward their
deadlocked peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"We have invited one representative from each side to meet here
to decide on some sort of formula for their possible talks in the
future," Gohar told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Afghanistan early this month, Pakistani
State Minister for Foreign Affairs Siddique Khan Kanju conveyed
this proposal to the leadership of both the Taliban and the
Northern Alliance, Gohar said.
</P>
<P>
"We are still waiting for the confirmation from both sides," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said Pakistan and Iran, as the two immediate
neighbors of Afghanistan, are trying to establish "a mechanism" in
which the two countries can work together to bring about peace in
war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan peace process has been in jeopardy following the
break-up of the Joint Steering Committee meeting which was
attended by five delegates from the Taliban and nine from the
alliance early May in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
The Steering Committee meeting, sponsored by the United Nations
and the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), was aimed at
establishing the Taliban-proposed Ulema (religious scholars)
Commission, which will decide the future political set-up in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia have already given up the idea of holding a
 dialogue with the Northern Alliance under the proposed Ulema
Commission as the alliance had disrespected this commission, the
Taliban's envoy Abdul Hakim Mujahid told Xinhua here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He called for new initiatives from the U.N., OIC and other
neighboring countries for the resumption of the Afghan peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
"Since the Afghan Steering Committee has slowed down and made
little progress, we are trying to make new proposals so that they
(the Afghan talks) can start," Gohar said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the peace mediation in Afghanistan was no easy
job as the Taliban, who control two-thirds of Afghanistan, and the
alliance, who holds the remaining one-third, "are still looking
for a military solution."
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban feel that over a long period of time they might be
able to take control of all of Afghanistan while the alliance
thinks that if they have limited military success, their
bargaining position would be better," he said.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that the rigid stances held by the two groups
would lead to more bloodshed and suffering in a country where the
infrastructure has been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
"We have been trying to bring them here on numerous occasions,
so that a broad-based government could be formed in Afghanistan.
We are trying all options whichever we succeed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's new peace initiative in Afghanistan came just days
after a two-day visit to Pakistan by Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharazi early June.
</P>
<P>
Gohar said during Kharazi's visit both countries agreed to
enhance their joint efforts in seeking peace in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Now we are trying to get a mechanism in which both of
us can work together for this purpose."
</P>
<P>
However, he emphasized that the final solution should come from
the Afghans themselves.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister described the U.N. role in the Afghan
peace process as "very positive." "But a little more
understanding and encouragement from the U.N. would be
reciprocated by the Taliban," he added.

<HEADLINE> African IT Show Opens in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The seventh African Information
Technology (IT) Exhibition and Conference (AITEC) opened in
downtown Nairobi with at least 5,000 visitors expected.
</P>
<P>
"The dramatic growth this year in the size of the exhibition
reflects the increasing importance and penetration of information
technology in Kenya's economy," said Kenyan Minister for Research
and Technology Andrew Kiptoon in his opening speech.
</P>
<P>
"The information technology is synonymous to development,"
Kiptoon stressed, calling for the promotion of IT in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
About 65 companies including IBM, Microsoft, Compaq and other
worldwide computer giants attended the show set to end on June
22, said the chief organizer, Sean Moroney.
</P>
<P>
The theme of this year's show and conference is "Developing an
IT Strategy for the New Millennium."
</P>
<P>
"Now IT has become the mainstream and Kenya has become part
and parcel of that growth," Moroney claimed.
</P>
<P>
"When we first launched AITEC seven years ago, we were seen as
ahead of our time," he recalled.
</P>
<P>
Kenya, hosting about 8,000 Internet users, remains east
Africa's largest information IT market valued at some 63.5
million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Moroney said the exhibitors and experts will explore the
global trends in computing and internet management as well as
look at the risks, costs and effectiveness of re-engineering old
systems versus investing in new systems.
</P>
<P>
"Since we began the AITEC shows in this region, they have
become milestones in computing development. They don't just
showcase new products but also bring information on global trends
and relate them to the local IT environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
This year's conference will also focus on preparedness for
what has come to be known as the "millennium bug" -- a shutdown
of computer and electronic systems which are not programmed for
the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is expected to attract IT managers, upper-level
operations managers, IT professionals, software consultants and
service organizations, IT vendors and so on. Some 7,000 visitors
attended last year's event.

<HEADLINE> 3 Israeli Settlers Arrested for Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police arrested three
Jewish settlers on Wednesday, who were suspected of killing a
Palestinian farmer in the West Bank, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the settlers, two of them minors, beat
the Palestinian farmer to death with a wooden bat on Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened when the farmer, Abdel Majid Turki, met
the suspected assailants along a main road near the Jewish
settlement of Beit Hagai, south of the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
One of the suspects said that they beat Turki just for
"playing a prank." And police have not given a motive.
</P>
<P>
Turki was sent to a hospital in Hebron, where his skull was
found fractured and later he died. His body was taken to Tel Aviv
for an autopsy.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a Jerusalem magistrate also called the three
settlers for a hearing to extend their detention.
</P>
<P>
The attack took place in the sensitive Hebron area, where the
Jewish settlers have involved in frequent clashes with the
Palestinian residents in recent years. And in 1994, a Jewish
settler shot and killed 29 Muslim worshippers in a Hebron
mosque.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Adhere to Fiscal Prudence: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Financial Secretary Donald Tsang
 said here Wednesday that Hong Kong would adhere to fiscal
prudence despite the current economic woes.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the media after discussing the 1999-2000 Budget
with members-elect of the first Legislative Council, Tsang
emphasized: "The Budget is an instrument for economic growth and
an instrument to address social problems."
</P>
<P>
The financial secretary said that he had to balance the pleas
for tax reduction and greater expenditure, which would relieve the
 pains of present economic adjustment, with the expectation of
international investors, who would want to see Hong Kong
continuing its prudent financial management principle.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law, the constitutional document of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR), stipulates that the SAR will
follow the principle of keeping expenditure within the limits of
revenues in drawing up its budget, and strive to achieve a fiscal
balance, avoid deficits and keep the budget commensurate with the
growth rate of its gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
The trend growth rate for the past few years was five percent,
said Tsang, who predicted that it would be unlikely that Hong Kong
 would sustain five-percent growth in real terms in the coming few
 years.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the economic slowdown would grossly limit the
new resources available for new expenditure in the coming
financial year.

HONG KONG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Mortgage
Corporation (HKMC) Wednesday launched a Debt Issuance Program,
which involves 20 billion HK dollars (2.56 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The corporation signed an agreement here Wednesday with five
primary dealers and 12 selling group members appointed for the
program, which is aimed at further enhancing the HKMC's ability to
raise funds through the debt market.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, Financial Secretary Donald Tsang, who
is also chairman of the HKMC, said: "The launching of the Debt
Issuance Program is a timely development crucial to the successful
operation of the HKMC."
</P>
<P>
Under the innovative program, five primary dealers who have
good access to institutional investors are appointed to play the
role of underwriter and market maker for securities issued while
12 selling group members are appointed to help with the
distribution of the debt securities.
</P>
<P>
The program will complement a 20-billion-HK dollar Note
Issuance Program introduced by the HKMC in January 1998. The
previous program takes financial institutions as its main client
base while the new one targets institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
The two programs together provide a comprehensive coverage of
the investor base of the Hong Kong dollar debt market.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Publishers Want To Help Save Tibetan Culture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- China's publishers plan to spend
15 million yuan (1.8 million US dollars) to print books on Tibetan
culture, some of which have long been out of print.
</P>
<P>
Yang Muzhi, deputy director of China's Press and Publications
Administration, said today that 18 publishers will cooperate with
the Tibet Publishing House in 26 categories of books on the Dalai
Lama, Tibetan history, Buddhism, the arts, astrology, Tibetan
language, traditional medicine, and other areas. One of them will
be a large dictionary on Tibetan history and culture containing 14
million characters and 1,600 photos, Yang says.
</P>
<P>
Gong Xinhan, the deputy head of the Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee's Publicity Department, calls it a major step in
protecting Tibetan culture.
</P>
<P>
The publications show that the statements that "Tibetan
people's human rights have been violated and Tibetan culture has
been destroyed" are totally groundless, Gong says.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, some 17 million yuan has been donated by various
publishers to support Tibet's publishing industry, and Yang
explains, "Tibetan culture is a part of Chinese culture, and the
Party and the government have been placing great importance on
preserving it."
</P>
<P>
China has set up institutes to collect, record, and study
Tibetan culture and a lot of works have been published, he says,
but the Tibetan publishing industry is faced with a lack of money,
equipment, and skilled workers, so the cooperation with the
rest part of the country will be very helpful.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Parliament Approves Extra Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Japan's House of Councillors (upper
house of parliament) on Wednesday endorsed a pump-priming
supplementary budget for the 1998 fiscal year, paving the way for
the latest government package of economic stimulus measures.
</P>
<P>
The 4.6 trillion yen (32.1 billion U.S. dollars) extra budget,
which was approved at a plenary session of the upper house,
cleared the powerful House of Representatives, or lower house, on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The supplementary budget is part of the 16.65 trillion yen
(116.4 billion dollars) stimulus package, which the government
expects will put the floundering domestic economy back on a
recovery track later this year.
</P>
<P>
The budget enables additional government spending and special
tax cuts totalling 6.1 trillion yen (about 42.7 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
With the passage of the extra budget, government expenditure
will rise to 82.31 trillion yen (575.6 billion dollars) this
financial year.

<HEADLINE> CITIC Global Tourism Network Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Beginning today, travelers in
China can order hotels and other tourist service programs in more
than 70 countries through CITIC-SPY Internet Global Tourism Order
Network.
</P>
<P>
SPY Internet Global Tourism Ordering Network, which was opened
by Singapore Linbert Travel under the support of the Singaporean
government, provides order services for more than 5,000 star-rated
hotels in the world, including more than 500 in China, as well as
such tourist services as plane, train and boat tickets,
sightseeing, and car rentals.
</P>
<P>
The China International Trust and Investment Corporation
(CITIC) became the sole agent of the SPY tourist network by
signing a cooperative agreement with Linbert in March of this
year, said Yao Jinrong, vice-president of CITIC, at today's news
conference.
</P>
<P>
The CITIC-SPY network will join the ticket-booking network of
the Civil Aviation Administration of China and the Ministry of
Railways to spread its use in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The number of global users of the Internet has increased
sharply in recent years. In China, the figure reached 1.06 million
by May 30 of this year, according to statistics from the Chinese
Academy of Sciences. Experts believe that the opening of the
CITIC-SPY network will offer more convenience for travelers in
China.

These businesses brought into China more than 100 advanced
technologies and employed some 6,000 Chinese workers. Through its
extensive sales network, Unilever has also offered 14,000

</P>
<P>
To many Chinese consumers, Unilever is associated with brands
such as Lux, Ponds, Hazeline, Omo and Wall's ice cream.
</P>
<P>
As a British-Dutch joint venture, Unilever has based its

<HEADLINE> Feature: Chinese Military Officers Visit Harvard (1) (by Peng Shujie and Liu Yunfei) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of 23 senior Chinese
military officers from the People's Liberation Army (PLA) attended
a two week training course at Harvard University in March.
</P>
<P>
The delegation was the second group of PLA officers to complete
studies at Harvard, a highly prestigious university with a history
of 362 years.
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Joseph Nye,
president of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, initiated the
Annual Harvard Senior Military Officers program in 1997 with the
support of defense ministries in both countries.
</P>
<P>
The two-week course featured some 40-odd seminars on topics
ranging from Sino-U.S. relations and security in the Asia-Pacific
Region to nuclear nonproliferation and information warfare.
</P>
<P>
The PLA officers, most of whom were visiting the United States
for the first time, spent two weekends visiting U.S. warships, the
headquarters of the United Nations, the Pentagon and Capitol Hill,
as well as military bases and farms. The delegation also enjoyed
NBA basketball and stage performances.
</P>
<P>
"USS Constitution"
</P>
<P>
The first day of sightseeing included a visit to the USS
Constitution, an over 200 year old warship still in symbolic
service in Boston Harbor. The vessel, which is armed with 50-odd
cannons, has achieved a remarkable record since the War of
Independence in 1775.
</P>
<P>
"My deepest impression was that backwardness leaves one
vulnerable," according to Senior Colonel Wang Guanzhong, a Chinese
specialist in national defense strategic military studies.
</P>
<P>
"Our American hosts obviously used the ship to exemplify the
spirit their ancestors exhibited over two centuries ago during
efforts to catch-up with Britain and other European powers," said
Wang.
</P>
<P>
"We have entered the era of information warfare at a time when
the Chinese army has not yet completed preparations for overall
mechanization. We must maintain a sense of urgency and extend
great efforts to catch-up with advanced countries in order to
prevent being left behind," said Wang, who overcame his limited
English by relying on interpreters during his studies at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
"We formerly paid close attention to new types of weapons
developed by foreign armies and neglected the role of information
technology in modern warfare.
</P>
<P>
"Discussions with our American counterparts and visits to
U.S. military bases helped me realize that the use of high
technology to upgrade conventional weapons helps to multiply
combat capabilities. Applications of information technology can
significantly enhance the control and guidance of forces during
wartime, while at the same time uniting surveillance, guidance
systems and combat troops," according to Wang.

Woman Naval Captain's Argument
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue, a core issue in Sino-U.S. relations, was
obviously a focal point during discussions between Chinese
officers and their American counterparts. The most heated
discussions took place between Lei Xiaoping, the only female
captain in the Chinese Navy, and a U.S. researcher on the staff of
the congressional Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
The researcher told participants in one seminar that China's
1996 missile exercises created a crisis in the Taiwan Straits
which was resulted from China's misunderstanding of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
He commented that Deng Xiaoping once said that the Taiwan issue
could either be dealt in a step by step manner or could otherwise
be passed and settled by the next generation.
</P>
<P>
The researcher completed his presentation and Lei immediately
commented that the missile exercise was a normal military
manoeuvre. She noted that the exercises were preceded by a public
announcement and were carried out in strict accordance with
international conventions.
</P>
<P>
"Lee Teng-Hui's visit to the United States in 1995 has been
widely acknowledged as encouraging forces calling for
Taiwan's 'independence' and creating the crisis in the straits,"
said Lei in fluent English. "In addition, your reference to Deng
Xiaoping's remarks on Taiwan were totally inaccurate. His comments
were in fact referring to the Diaoyu Islands."
</P>
<P>
Lei informed the researcher that both China and the United
States will suffer losses if bilateral relations deteriorate
because of the Taiwan issue, and noted that the latter might even
sustain heavier losses.
</P>
<P>
"The only wise approach for the U.S. government is to strictly
abide by the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and cease selling
military hardware to Taiwan rather than dispatching aircraft
carriers," said Lei.
</P>
<P>
Lei's precise and clear comments left a deep impression on
Americans attending the seminar. Major Roy Kamphausen, assistant
military attache-designate to the U.S. Embassy in China, commented
in Chinese: "Captain Lei, you are really sharp."

United Nations Visit
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation visited the United Nations headquarters
on their last weekend in the United States. The group paused
before entering the building to view two sculptures, one of which
was the twisted barrel of a rifle and the other is a cracked globe.
</P>
<P>
"The pieces represent the massive damages the earth and human
beings have suffered at the hands of war," said Colonel Jiang Lei,
one of the first Ph.D. graduates from the Chinese Academy of
Military Sciences. "The world is far from peaceful despite the
fact that peace and development are the two major themes in
today's world. Arms race and regional conflicts continue to
surface from time to time," said Jiang
</P>
<P>
"This poses a question for world leaders and soldiers
concerning whether the security of one country can be built on the
insecurity of another nation," said Jiang. "The world will enjoy
real peace only after this particular concept of defense is
abandoned."
</P>
<P>
"China, the world's most populous and largest developing
country, and the United States, the most developed country, have
the responsibility to raise relations to a new plateau regardless
of differing ideologies and social systems," according to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Strength Forms the Foundation for Equal Contacts
</P>
<P>
"Strength speaks the loudest and it is the foundation for equal
contacts; this is my deepest impression of the two-week stay
there," said Colonel Li Jiang, an expert on China's national
defense policy and strategy.
</P>
<P>
"If China had not made the crusade of reforms and opening to
the outside world 20 years ago, and the country was not
politically stable and economically prosperous nowadays, and it
has not played a bigger role in world affairs, it is hardly
imaginable for us to sit in the classrooms of Harvard."
</P>
<P>
"The meticulous arrangement of our American host is also a good
demonstration of it," Li said, who has visited the former Soviet
Union and Romania.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, we must always keep in our mind that national
development should be the most important task at any time for any
one of us," Li emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. and Chinese sides agreed that this new type
of exchange is beneficial for both of them to learn from each
other, the Chinese officers admitted that two weeks is far from
being adequate to understand a country, especially a country like
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Information from the Ministry of National Defense says that
defense ministries of both countries have the willingness to
continue this program, and they are now working to perfect it.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong stocks jumped 6.3
percent Wednesday as interbank rates eased due to a stronger
Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
The key Hang Seng Index leapt 477.9 points to register the
day's closing trading figure at 8,004.35, its second straight gain
following a 0.86-percent rise Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two-day rise recovered some of the loss it suffered from
the more-than-three-year low of 7,462.5 points on Monday. The
plunge was caused by rising local interbank rates and increasing
pressure from the weakening Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
The market's turnover on Wednesday amounted to 6.143 billion HK
dollars (788 million U.S. dollars), 1.431 billion HK dollars (183
million U.S. dollars) more than that of Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng Index registered a gain of 261.38 points, or 3.47
percent, to open at 7,787.83 Wednesday morning. It rose 273.9
points, or 3.63 percent, to close at 7,800.1 at midday.

TIANJIN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A rainstorm and hailstones struck
China's northern port city of Tianjin for 12 consecutive hours
between 5 p.m. Tuesday and 5 a.m. today. The storm flattened to
varying degrees standing crops in the fields and hindered urban
traffic.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the local meteorological department said that the
rainfall, sweeping extensively over the whole municipality,
averaged 71.5 millimeters (mm) in the urban areas, with Dongli
District receiving as much as 125.3 mm.
</P>
<P>
Egg-like hailstones dropped in a number of districts and
outskirtan counties, and brought damages to apples, grapes,
vegetables and grain.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, because of prompt weather forecast prior to the
rain and hails, the relevant local departments took preventive
measures to stop the hail by launching more than 1,000 artillery
shells.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani-Indian PM Meeting in Colombo Hopeful: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar
Ayub Khan said here Wednesday that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and
his Indian counterpart will "hopefully" hold a formal meeting at
the forthcoming SAARC summit next month.
</P>
<P>
"We would have a formal meeting with the Indian prime minister
in Colombo next month and hopefully the two prime ministers will
meet there," Gohar said in an interview with Xinhua Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 10th summit meeting of the seven-nation South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is to take place in
Colombo, capital of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
"We have told the Indian government about this on numerous
occasions and we will formally communicate with them shortly that
the two prime ministers would meet in Sri Lanka," Gohar said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister emphasized the need for Pakistan and India
to resume their bilateral talks as the situation in South Asia
"has become so volatile after the two countries have acquired
nuclear weapons" following their nuclear tests last month.
</P>
<P>
He called for more active and positive international engagement
in the dialogue process between Pakistan and India to ensure its
success.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the expected meeting between the two
prime ministers will help push forward the foreign secretary-level
talks which broke down last September in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, "We have to see the approach of the Indian
leadership as to how they reciprocate the Pakistani proposal for a
meaningful dialogue on Kashmir."
</P>
<P>
"With seriousness we address the issue, hopefully we can kick
off from there," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan proposed last Friday that the foreign
secretary-level talks be resumed on the basis of the agreement
reached between the two sides on June 23 last year in Islamabad,
under which eight issues including peace and security, Jammu and
Kashmir would be discussed in their future talks.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that the Indian government failed to respond
positively to the Pakistani proposal, instead it unilaterally
announced that the bilateral talks would be held on June 22 on the
basis of the draft proposals it made in January.
</P>
<P>
Gohar termed the proposals made by India in January when Sharif
and his then Indian counterpart, I.K. Gujral, met in Dhaka,
capital of Bangladesh, as "unpractical and unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
India suggested that each of the eight issues on the agreed
agenda of talks be headed by a secretary of a ministry, meaning
that eight groups would be sitting simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a practical solution. It indicates that there is a
lack of seriousness on the Indian side to implement such a serious
issue," Gohar said.
</P>
<P>
"Basically it is to create more issues out of the talks, to
prolong the sessions and not come to a solution," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he reiterated that the bilateral talks between
Pakistan and India will not bear fruits unless the international
community seriously involves itself in the political process.
</P>
<P>
Since March 28 last year to January 15 this year, Pakistan and
India have held three rounds of foreign secretary-level talks, one
foreign minister-level meeting and four prime minister-level
meetings, he said, adding that "unfortunately, none of these talks
produced any positive results."
</P>
<P>
"If we continue talks still on a bilateral basis, the talks
will be again fruitless. We are just going through an exercise
with a knowledge that there will be hardly any progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So it is high time for a third party to channelize efforts, to
give direction and ensure certain amount of constructive and
positive outcome through these talks," he said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Putonghua Gaining Popularity in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Luk Hon Tak just completed a
12-session middle-level Putonghua course to polish his standard
spoken Chinese.
</P>
<P>
As most Hong Kong people were, the middle-aged Luk was educated
in English, the official working language, and Cantonese, the
dialect spoken by 98 percent of Hong Kong's 6.5 million
population.
</P>
<P>
In his memory, Putonghua was only heard in Mandarin songs 20
years ago. Today, Luk, a corporate affairs manager at Hongkong
Telecom, speaks Putonghua almost every day in his frequent contact
with mainland media and telecommunications circles.
</P>
<P>
"It (speaking Putonghua) is a trend that every one can see,"
said Luk. "If you can speak Putonghua, you master a necessary tool
of communication."
</P>
<P>
The number of people learning Putonghua has surged dramatically
over the past two decades, according to Sin Kam Wai, principal of
Hong Kong Putonghua Society, a non-government and non-profit
organization devoted to the promotion of Putonghua since 1976.
</P>
<P>
In its early days, the Society enrolled at most several hundred
students a year. The number surpassed 10,000 in the mid-1980s, and
eventually jumped to about 20,000 per year around the handover on
July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The momentum continued into the first year after Hong Kong
became a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China, enjoying a
high degree of autonomy under the "one country, two systems"
formula. Close economic interaction and rising exchanges between
Hong Kong and the mainland have driven more and more Hong Kong
residents to pick up Putonghua, the language spoken by their 1.2
billion compatriots on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the biggest overseas investor in China, and China,
the second largest trading partner of Hong Kong. Today one out of
four tourists arriving in Hong Kong come from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
"Putonghua can provide you an opportunity to tap the mainland
market, the biggest and nearest for Hong Kong, and put you a few
notches above others in the competitive job market," Sin added.
That is why an increasing number of government institutions and
private companies organize Putonghua classes for staff members,
which always get an active response.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Putonghua has entered the daily life of the common
people. Telephone users can dial to a new hotline that provides
Putonghua service, passengers can hear Putonghua announcements on
the trains running along the Kowloon-Canton railway, and radio
audience can tune in a Putonghua channel.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to promote the use of the mother tongue, the SAR
government has asked the 1,500 middle and primary schools in Hong
Kong to open Putonghua courses in September this year. Students
are encouraged to master English and Chinese, both working
languages in the SAR, and speak English, Cantonese and Putonghua.
</P>
<P>
A mother who invites a Putonghua teacher for her five-year-old
child said she did so "because I clearly know that Putonghua is
tomorrow's language in Hong Kong."

<HEADLINE> Chinese State Councillor Meets with British Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- China understands and respects the
change in Britain's policy for assistance to China, Chinese State
Councillor Wu Yi said today.
</P>
<P>
During her meeting with Clare Short, Britain's Secretary of
State for International Development, Wu said that China began its
financial cooperation with Britain in 1986, and until now, Britain
has offered 800 million pounds in mixed loans, which have been put
into 43 projects.
</P>
<P>
She expressed her hope that the new British government would
continue to implement the agreements between China and the former
British administration.
</P>
<P>
Short promised that the government of Prime Minister Tony Blair
would carry out the concluded accords as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The new British government changed its policy of cooperation
with China by mainly providing it with donations rather than mixed
loans.
</P>
<P>
Short said that this policy change is aimed at more effective
use of Britain's assistance to China, and that the amount of the
assistance could increase in the future.
</P>
<P>
She added that the British side is interested in cooperating
with China in such areas as culture and education, health care,
reform of state-owned enterprises and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Wu spoke highly of the positive approach of the British in the
conduct of its financial cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
Wu expressed her hope that the two sides would implement
cooperative projects in these fields as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Short said that although the Blair government took office less
than one year ago, many cabinet members have visited China, which
indicates that the British government values its ties with
China.

<HEADLINE> Tung Chee Hwa Praises Success in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of China's Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region Tung Chee Hwa Wednesday praised
the success achieved in Hong Kong after it returned to the embrace
of China last July.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a dinner in New Zealand's largest city of Auckland
hosted by the New Zealand Asia 2000 Foundation, Tung said, "Eleven
months have gone by since July 1. The central leadership has shown
great determination to implement the principle of 'one country,
two systems', 'Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong' with a 'high
degree of autonomy'."
</P>
<P>
"We in Hong Kong are also determined to ensure the full
implementation of the Basic Law. Indeed, the success is manifested
every day in Hong Kong and in every possible way. I invite you to
come and see for yourselves," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
On the current financial crisis in Asia, he described it as
being "painful to us all."
</P>
<P>
"But the fundamentals in Asia haven't changed. We still have a
young and flexible workforce, a very high savings rate, openness
to trade and ideas and an indomitable spirit to improve ourselves.
Some glaring uncertainties still need to be resolved, but I would
expect the Asian financial crisis to bottom out in a number of
years and we shall then witness a slow but sure road toward
recovery."
</P>
<P>
On the question of whether China will devalue its currency, the
renminbi (RMB), Tung said that in his view, the answer is no.
</P>
<P>
"China's leaders have committed not to devalue the RMB and
China is acting responsibly as an important member of the
community of nations of the world. Indeed, another round of
devaluation is not helpful to anybody," he stated.
</P>
<P>
Tung arrived in Auckland on Wednesday afternoon from Australia
to start a three-day visit to New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
He will come here on Thursday to meet New Zealand leaders,
including Prime Minister Jenny Shipley, Foreign Minister Don
McKinnon and Finance Minister Bill Birch. He will also attend a
reception to be hosted Thursday night by Chen Wenzhao, Chinese
ambassador to New Zealand.

<HEADLINE> Release of Detainees Hailed in, outside Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The release of nine political
detainees by the Nigerian government Monday has been hailed both
in and outside Nigeria, media reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Human Rights Commission welcomed the move
at a press briefing in Geneva Tuesday and hoped that the Nigerian
government would soon free Moshood Abiola, the widely believed
winner of the annulled June 12, 1993 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson,
was pleased to hear of the release of political prisoners,
including General (Olusegun) Obasanjo and she would hope the new
government would soon see a way to release chief Moshood Abiola,"
said John Mills, a rights spokesman for the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU), said in a statement issued Tuesday
from the British Deputy High Commission, Lagos, that "We welcome
General (Abdulsalam) Abubakar's decision to release nine
detainees. This is an important first step in the process of
national reconstruction, reconciliation and development."
</P>
<P>
"We hope that General Abubakar will now move swiftly to effect
a rapid and inclusive transition to c rule,
including detainees. We remain ready to help and support that
process," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government described the release of detainees as an
important step which it hoped would lead to a credible move
toward a democratic government in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
In Nigeria, the National Human Rights Commission commended
General Abubakar over the release of the nine detainees, saying
it looked forward to the full implementation of its
recommendations regarding the detention of persons without trial.
</P>
<P>
The National Democratic Coalition, a major opposition group,
said the release was a first step toward the restoration of the
confidence of Nigerians, as well as the international community.
</P>
<P>
The group, in a statement signed by its deputy leader Abraham
Adesanya, called for the release of all political detainees,
including Abiola, who should be allowed to head a government of
national unity.
</P>
<P>
The most prominent person released by the Nigerian government
Monday is former head of state, General Obasanjo, who was serving
a 15-year jail term for involvement in a failed coup plot in
March 1995.
</P>
<P>
Others are a religious leader, a publisher and leaders of
trade unions and human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government said the release is to "facilitate the
process of national reconciliation, reconstruction and successful
completion of the social-political transition program."

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Driven High by Yen Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A strong correlation with the
Japanese yen Wednesday brought good news for the Australian dollar
as the struggling Asian unit recovered some ground.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished trading Wednesday at 59.24 U.S.
cents, around half a U.S. cent stronger than the close of 58.68
U.S. cents in Sydney Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It was again the yen that took center stage Wednesday, this
time providing some support for the local unit rather than causing
a fall as on previous days.
</P>
<P>
After touching eight-year lows of above 146 to the U.S. dollar
Tuesday, the Japanese yen closed much stronger at 143.31 against
the greenback.
</P>
<P>
"The yen is just driving everything at the moment," a foreign
exchange trader said.
</P>
<P>
The rise in the yen began offshore Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Economists had suggested that the Australian dollar could fall
to as low as 55 U.S. cents if the yen remained under pressure.
</P>
<P>
Annette Beacher, senior economist with Citibank Australia, said
the upcoming Japanese election would be carefully watched and any
instability in the yen would transfer to the local unit.
</P>
<P>
For Australia, any slowdown in the Japanese economy means less
exports to its largest trading partner, causing the deterioration
of the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
On the cross rates the Australian dollar was also buying 84.9
Japanese yen from 85.52 yen and 1.0642 marks from 1.0588 marks.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Drops Below 142 Yen in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar fell below 142 yen in
Tokyo Wednesday on news that U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers will visit Japan for high-level talks.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was quoted at 141.98-142.01 yen at 5 p.m. (local time),
down from 142.71-74 yen at 9 a.m., and 143.35-45 yen late Tuesday in
New York.
</P>
<P>
Market players worked on liquidating their overbought dollar
positions for the yen on the expected talks between U.S. and
Japanese monetary officials, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
Expectations that Summers, who is likely to come to Japan Thursday,
will discuss measures with Japanese officials to prevent the yen's
continuing fall arrested the yen's slide, they said.
</P>
<P>
There is also some speculation that the sudden visit is a sign
that the United States will yield to recent political pressure and
help support the falling yen against the dollar, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
But a majority view in financial markets is that Summers is not
coming to Tokyo to discuss coordinated intervention, but to have a
more detailed and probing discussion on how to clean up the
nonperforming loans held by Japanese financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Many traders and analysts said the yen will remain weak against
the dollar over the short term, reflecting differences between the
Japanese and U.S. economies.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Will Beat Denmark: Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- South Africa head coach
Philippe Troussier vowed to beat Denmark in Thursday's
make-or-break World Cup Group C match after his team lost to
France last week, South African newspapers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"There are six points left to play for and there is no reason
why we can not win both our remaining matches. I'm very
optimistic," Troussier said in Vichy, France, where the team is
camping.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has to beat both Denmark Thursday and Saudi Arabia
next Wednesday to advance to the next round.
</P>
<P>
Troussier said there would be a change of strategy against
Denmark. "From now on, the finals really start for us. There can
be no more excuses after Denmark," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the French coach said he did not intend to change his
defensive strategy for the match against Denmark. He said the
fault did not lie with his defense in the team's crushing 3-0
defeat to France in their opening fixture played in Marseilles on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We did not lose the game from poor defending. France played
six defensive players against us and I fielded only four. I don't
see the need to make big changes tactically in my defense,"
Troussier said.
</P>
<P>
"We made a mistake in the first half and were punished. We more
than held our own against a very formidable French side for the first
45 minutes," he said, adding that they also made mistakes in the
second half by conceding two goals.
</P>
<P>
Troussier said there could be changes in the team, hinting at a
replacement of the injured striker Phil Masinga by Shaun Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
The coach said the team were disappointed at losing to France,
but would correct their mistakes and beat Denmark.
</P>
<P>
"The pressure is off us now. It hasn't been easy for the
players who've had to adjust (to the World Cup atmosphere). We're
getting there," he said.

SINGAPORE, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Share prices rose sharply on the
Singapore market Wednesday as the benchmark Straits Times

The total market volume declined slightly to 146.86 million
units, valued at 275.07 million Singapore dollars (about 160.39
million U.S. dollars). Advances led declines by 235 to 82 while
269 other counters remained unchanged.

DBS Land remained the most actively traded stock as it
registered a turnover of 16.25 million units. It was followed by

<HEADLINE> Macao Foreign Trade Down in First 4 Months of 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Both imports and exports dropped in
Macao in the first four months of this year, the latest official
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the Macao Census and
Statistics Department on Wednesday, exports declined by 6 percent
from the same period last year, to 4.394 billion patacas (about
549.25 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The value of imported goods added up to 4.759 billion patacas
(about 594.875 million dollars), down 7.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a trade deficit of 365 million patacas (about
45.625 million dollars) was recorded.
</P>
<P>
Garments and textile goods made up 81 percent of all exports in
the period and their export value declined by 9.2 percent.
Meanwhile, non-textile exports rose by 10.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The United States and the European Union (EU) were the two
leading export markets for Macao and they together bought 73.3
percent of all Macao exported goods. But compared with the same
period last year, purchases made by the United States fell by 1.8
percent and those by the EU by 14.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decline in imports was attributed to reductions in the
purchase of capital goods, fuel and lubricative oil, raw materials
and semi-finished products and consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
Macao has been hit by an economic slowdown since 1993. Last
year, the growth rate of its gross national product was officially
put at minus 0.1 percent, as against minus 0.3 percent in 1996.

<P>
MACAO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Macao Amusement and Tourism Company
(STDM), which monopolizes all casinos in Macao, said its gross
income in 1997 rose 8.4 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In a report published on Wednesday's Macao Daily News, the STDM
said, however, that its net profit dropped 19.9 percent due to an
increase in casino tax payments and other financial commitments to
the government.
</P>
<P>
The STDM said its net profit for 1997 was 3.71 billion patacas
(about 463.75 million U.S. dollars) and total assets by December
31, 1997, were valued at 28.384 billion patacas (about 3.548
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
It also said the company's hotel and jetfoil businesses
suffered decreases because of fewer passengers as a result of the
financial crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
But, it said it has confidence in Macao's future and promised
to continue making its contributions to the prosperity and
stability of Macao.
</P>
<P>
The STDM currently runs nine casinos and its subsidiaries run a
jockey club, a greyhound race course and several lotteries in
Macao. It also launched football pools earlier this month.

</P>
<P>
The financial aid will be offered to some 6,000 students from

and Cambodia, who are studying in Japan at their own expenses, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government has appropriated 3.05 billion yen

<P>
The program is expected to cover 70 percent of students from
the seven countries who are not receiving public or private

<HEADLINE> EU Pledges Free Trade Pact With S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela has elicited a pledge from European leaders that a
free trade deal between South Africa and the European Union (EU)
will be finalized in three months.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was in Cardiff, Britain, as a guest of an EU summit.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair who chaired the summit,
Tuesday struck an upbeat note on the trade talks, saying only one
percent of trade between South Africa and the EU was still in
dispute, media here reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have clearly agreed that by the autumn we will have in
place the EU-SA agreement. There have been difficulties to iron
out, actually on both sides, but now we are very close to the
conclusion."
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing Tuesday, Mandela said the International
Monetary Fund supported South Africa's position in trade talks
with the EU. Europe's agricultural subsidies were contributing to
poverty alleviation in Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
Trade talks between the two sides were deadlocked in April
after the EU refused to make substantial concessions.
</P>
<P>
In the 19th round of negotiations in Brussels, Belgium, held
on June 10 and 11, South Africa presented potential revisions of
its trade offer and some progress was reported.
</P>
<P>
A new round of talks is scheduled for next month in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Mandela met European leaders mainly to bid farewell before his
retirement next year.

<TEXT>

LAGOS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior Nigerian officer has
debunked insinuations of widespread disunity in the armed forces
of the country following the death of the late head of state
General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
The rumor was embarrassing and unprogressive, said Federal
Capital Territory Minister Jeremiah Useni, who is currently the
only lieutenant general in the Nigerian military after the head
of state General Abdulsalam Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
"The Nigerian armed forces had been very much in unity and
that unity is still being sustained," said Useni, who until
Tuesday last week was seen as the likely successor to General
Abacha.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, General Abacha did not die via a coup plot. The
death is a natural one. So there is no reason for anybody to hold
the belief that there is disunity in the armed forces."
</P>
<P>
Useni called on Nigerians to focus on issues that could help
in accelerating task of national building, especially
reconciliation, the Guardian reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"If Nigeria gets destroyed, no one stands to benefit," the
minister warned Tuesday.

TAIYUAN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Datong, a major city in north
China's Shanxi Province, is reporting good results in using World
Bank loans to plant trees on barren hills.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the city began implementing a forest resources
development and protection project financed by the World Bank to
cover 130,000 hectares of barren hills and wasteland.
</P>
<P>
The project, covering seven counties and one district, was to
cost 62 million yuan, 24 million of which would come from local
revenues and other channels, and to focus on 16,000 hectares of
barren hills.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a high survival rate, related areas offered special
training courses to 16,000 technicians, and adopted some
afforestation and drought-resistant technologies. As a result, a
tree survival rate of more than 95 percent was obtained.
</P>
<P>
The city's method has been expanded to other World Bank
projects in 15 areas across the country.

Xi'an Rich in Culture, Local Flavor (1)
</P>
<P>
XI'AN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Xi'an, reputed as the first city in
the world whose population exceeded one million more than 1,000
years ago, was acclaimed one of the world's four major ancient
capitals with Athens, Cairo and Rome. Xi'an's long history created
a varicolored ancient culture and gave birth to a simple, honest,
generous and unique quality in the local people.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an was known as Chang'an, meaning eternal peace. Numerous
painters living here and their works constituted a major component
part of China's cultural accomplishment. With more emphasis placed
on the reality and livelihood of the people, local painters today,
well-groomed in tradition, have created a new style: the Chang'an
school of Chinese painting.
</P>
<P>
The new style, which originated in the mid 1930s with the rise
of the Red Army, or the Communist-led armed forces in Yan'an, is
noted for its revolutionary ideas but rigorous means of
expression. Many of their works depict the forthright but splendid
northwestern loess plateau and people's hard work. The paintings
are rich in power and grandeur.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi Opera to the locals is like coffee to the
Europeans. This earliest opera in China, which fathered many other
local operas including Beijing (Peking) Opera, was a combination
of ancient folklore and Chinese traditional royal music.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, several classical plays were for the first time
brought to a foreign stage when they were performed in Japan. The
plays are an interesting and effective way to understand the
people of Shaanxi. The reason is that the opera tells how the
locals feel, many people say.

Xi'an Rich in Culture, Local Flavor (2)
</P>
<P>
Xi'an is also unique for its numerous bookstores, numbering in
the hundreds. The market lies in the local people's thirsty and
ardent love for books as well as the rapid cultural and
educational development over recent years. Statistics show that
there are 42 institutions of higher learning, and 510 research
institute with 320,000 professional and technical employees in
Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
The city's midnight snacks and refreshments are the local
residents' pride. "Xi'an snacks second to none," as a local saying
goes. With more than 100 varieties, some are hot and spicy while
others are sweet.
</P>
<P>
Because it was once an international metropolis, Xi'an food is
actually a mixture of various flavors from all over the world. Its
longtime foreign residents once reached some 100,000 about ten
centuries ago,
</P>
<P>
Folk art may best represent Xi'an. In Huxian County, almost
every farmer is also a painter. Because of their focus on rural
life and a bulky style, they are called "the school of village
painters." The technical approaches used in paper-cutting,
embroidery, sculpture and other art forms are incorporated into
their paintings. When crops are ripe, they harvest and, at any
other time, they paint.
</P>
<P>
The lantern is an icon of this ancient city. And the best time
to enjoy the symbol is the Lantern Festival, which comes 15 days
after the Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the art of embroidery is a byproduct of the ancient
"Silk Road" to West Asia. China's biggest market for embroidery
products is in Yabai Town in Xi'an's Zhouzhi County. Foreign
visitors frequent it for gifts for family and friends.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A three-billion Rand (570
million U.S. dollars) international airport is to be built in
southeast suburb of Johannesburg, local daily Business Report
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The privately owned Springs/Nigel International Airport is
situated on an old airforce base about 20 km southeast of the
city center.
</P>
<P>
The airport is due to be completed within the next five years.
It was expected to generate more than 100 billion Rand (18
billion U.S. dollars) over 20 years and create more than 285,000
jobs, managing director of the chosen developer Braam Loots was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
It will be the second gateway into Gauteng Province, where the
administrative capital of Pretoria and the commercial center of
Johannesburg are situated.
</P>
<P>
Gauteng Province generated 40 percent of the country's gross
domestic product and attracted 80 percent of air traffic movement
in Southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The airport was designed to cope with future increase in
international air traffic. Johannesburg International Airport was
expected to reach saturation point soon.
</P>
<P>
Intensive research and feasibility studies had shown that
facilities at the Johannesburg International Airport would not be
able to cope with air traffic growth in the next 20 to 30 years.
</P>
<P>
According to Loots, annual passenger flows were expected to
escalate from nine million at Johannesburg International Airport
at present to more than 42 million by 2030.
</P>
<P>
Air traffic movements would increase from 130,000 a year to
more than 700,000 by the same year.

BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government recently
announced a plan designed to improve the food-supply structure and
nutrition conditions.
</P>
<P>
The first document on nutrition promulgated by the State
Council since 1949, the plan stresses the principle of
"nutrition, hygiene, science and reason" in upholding the eating
traditions of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
According to the document on present nutrition conditions in
China, people in some poverty-stricken areas suffer from
malnutrition due to inadequate food supplies while urban residents
suffer imbalances and over-nutrition.
</P>
<P>
The document calls for people to take vegetable products as the
stable food and animal meat and milk as supplementary.
</P>
<P>
It urges the governments in poor areas to make full use of
local resources in reasonably arranging the production, supply and
distribution of food.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are also called for to scientifically readjust the
structure of food production, and persuade urban residents to form
reasonable eating habits to effectively control chronic
illnesses.

<HEADLINE> OECD Chief Satisfied With Turkey's Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's economy is running
steadily and will gain continued development in the coming years,
said Donald J. Johnston, secretary general of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
"I have the impression that the Turkish government is
determined to reduce the inflation and that the economy is
running well," Johnston was quoted by Wednesday's newspaper
Daily News as saying.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks following his meetings with Turkish Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz and other government officials.
</P>
<P>
"Presently, a sound and realistic policy is being
followed. There was no such policy in the past. I see some very
positive improvements in your economy, different in the past,"
Johnston told the paper.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Paris-based financial body is willing to
enhance cooperation with Turkey in various fields.
</P>
<P>
The OECD chief, however, demanded that the Turkish government
take resolute actions in fighting economic crimes, such as money
laundering and corruption, in order to ensure a positive
economic environment.
</P>
<P>
The high inflation rate, which stood at about 68 percent last
year, has been a major bottleneck for Turkey's economic
development over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
However, the figure has decreased since early this year thanks
to a successful monetary plan implemented by the Turkish
government, according to an OECD economic report issued recently.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the inflation in Turkey might continue
its downward trend through next year and fall to 65 percent in
1999.

<HEADLINE> Lancang River: New Source for China to Develop Hydropower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Lancang River, known as the
oriental Danube, is becoming China's new source for hydropower
generation. Eight power stations will be built on the river in the
next 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The Dachao Mountain Hydropower Station, now under construction,
will be installed with a capacity of 1.35 million kilowatts (kw)
and should be completed in 2003.
</P>
<P>
It will be China's first share-holding power station with a
capacity of more than one million kw and will provide more than 7
billion kilowatts/hour (kwh) of electricity annually. Since
the 1980s, the state has spent 6 billion yuan developing
hydropower resources of the Lancang.
</P>
<P>
The first one-million-kw hydro-electric power station along the
river was at Manwan, built in the early 1980s, with a capacity of
1.5 million kw. It was financed by the central and local
governments.
</P>
<P>
Preparations are also being made for another two million-kw
stations, construction of which will start in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The river is estimated to have the capacity of generating more
than 100 billion kwh annually, accounting for one-fourth of the
province's total.
</P>
<P>
Some Southeast Asian nations will be confronted with
electricity shortages during the first half of the 21st century,
experts said, adding that power development along the river will
not only provide electricity to other parts of China, but also to
neighboring countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- ING Insurance, a member of the ING
Group of the Netherlands, has funded the establishment of a LOMA
(Life Office Management Association of the United States)
Training and Examination Center at the Graduated School of the
People's Bank of China (PBOC).
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed by the two sides here today, ING
Insurance will donate 500,000 yuan to set up the center in

Insurance has sponsored in China.
</P>
<P>
LOMA holds 100,000 examinations of Fellow of Life Insurance
Management Institute (FLMI) in more than 60 countries in the world
every year.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, more than 800 persons took the FLMI examination in
China.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Donaldson, president and chief executive officer of
LOMA, said at the signing ceremony that China is expected to have
one of the largest groups taking FLMI examinations in the next
five years. It is expected to rank second or third in the world,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Donaldson said the translation of the examination papers is
under way and that people can take FLMI examinations in Chinese
beginning in January.
</P>
<P>
Gan Peigen, honorary president of the PBOC Graduate School,
said that establishment of the LOMA centers is one of the steps
that China took to upgrade its financial and banking systems to
international standards.
</P>
<P>
Phillip Sherriff, chief executive officer and a member of the
executive committee of ING Financial Services International Asia,
said at the signing ceremony that ING Insurance is actively
involved in China's efforts to develop a social security system,
reform its housing system and improve the education system.
</P>
<P>
Sherriff expressed the hope that ING Insurance will soon obtain
government approval to do business in China so that it will
contribute more to the country's reform and opening drive.

<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- China and the Republic of Korea
(ROK) have agreed on measures to open ROK as a tourist

</P>
<P>
A memorandum signed by the country's tourism, foreign affairs
and public security departments shows:

agencies will be allowed to conduct the business;
</P>
<P>
-- Both sides will choose a group of travel agencies with
sufficient assets and service capability to handle the business;

</P>
<P>
-- Tourists will be allowed to visit ROK only in the form of
tour groups of nine or above.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Asks Critics Not to Fuss Over Marcos Burial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President-Elect Joseph
Estrada Wednesday urged his critics not to make an issue out of
the proposed burial of former President Ferdinand Marcos at the
heroes' cemetery in Manila.
</P>
<P>
Estrada made the appeal to those opposing the burial of Marcos'
remains as he assured them that the criminal and other cases filed
against the Marcoses will still be pursued by the government.
</P>
<P>
Burying the former president, he said, would only mean that the
government is committed to according the dead the rightful
Christian burial.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Estrada urged his critics to focus on more pressing
concerns, particularly the problems of the economy, peace and
order and the country's foreign and domestic debt.
</P>
<P>
Estrada agreed to bury Marcos at the heroes' cemetery on July
11 after he assumes the presidency. However, Marcos would not be
granted a state funeral.
</P>
<P>
Several organizations recently launched a signature drive in
the hope of convincing Estrada to change his mind. The opponents
include former President Corazon Aquino.
</P>
<P>
Marcos fled to Hawaii, the United States, in a popular revolt
in 1986 and died there three years later. His remains were brought
back to the country in 1993 for a private funeral in his native
province of Ilocos Norte.

<HEADLINE> Capital of 12 Dynasties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Xi'an, capital of northwest China's
Shaanxi Province, has been political center for 12 dynasties
lasting more than 1,100 years. Now, It is still the economic and
cultural center of northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Located in the center of the rich and fertile Central Shaanxi
Plain, the city has been a strategic military spot in history.
</P>
<P>
Because of its superior natural resources, Xi'an is where the
earliest stone-age humans were found to have existed -- the
Lantian apeman of one million years ago. The Ruins of the Banpo
Culture displays the matriarchal society of 6,000 to 7,000 years
ago. And, the Keshengzhuang Ruins, dating back 4,000 years,
indicates that ancient man had evolved to a patriarchal society by
then.
</P>
<P>
In 221 B.C., Qin Shi Huang united China and set up the Qin
Dynasty, the first feudal dynasty in the Chinese history. He named
himself "the First Emperor," and he built his capital in Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-220 A.D.), Xi'an was the
only city in the world that could stand side-by-side with Rome.
</P>
<P>
During the Tang Dynasty (618-907), Xi'an became
the single biggest international metropolis in the world with a
population of one million.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an was the starting point of the Silk Road, a route throught
which China's silk, tea, compasses, as well as the expertise to
make paper, gunpowder and herbal medicines were exported to West
Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Today's Xi'an, home to the world famous terra cotta warriors
and horses, is also the biggest modern industrial and commercial
center of northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an's trade ties have been extended to more than 100
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
It is also linked to more than 50 cities in China by direct air
flights, and non-stop air routes to Japan and some other countries
have also been opened.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Zambia and Angola have agreed to
cooperate in removing the landmines that still litter 1500
kilometers of the two countries' common border.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed here Tuesday by foreign affairs minister
Keli Walubita when arriving at the Lusaka international airport
after a five-day visit to Angola, Times of Zambia reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister told reporters that landmines planted
many years ago continue to be a major source of insecurity
especially in areas along the two neibouring countries' common
border.
</P>
<P>
He said that there is no meaningful development along the
common border if insecurity prevails.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed the area of landmines planted years back along
the border. So we will work together and ensure that a de-mining
program is jointly pursued by the two countries," said Walubita.

He said economic experts will soon meet to rehabilitate the
railway which has been discussed since the conflicts in Angola
started several decades ago.

<HEADLINE> China's Grain Marketing System Continues to Mature (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 17 (Xinhua) -- In a seven-storey building in
central China's Zhengzhou City, nervous traders from throughout
China are painstakingly monitoring data on a hall's 100-odd
computers.
</P>
<P>
It is the Zhengzhou Grain Wholesale Market, the first and
largest such kind in China where close to ten percent, or three
million tons of grain and five billion yuan worth of cereals,
cooking oil, by-products and fodder circulated nationwide are
traded annually.
</P>
<P>
The wholesale grain market system offers appealing prospects
for members of China's agricultural sector which demonstrates that
China's grain marketing system has continued to mature, said an
expert from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
It enables the Chinese government to implement macro-controls
on the national grain system. Related efforts are vitally
important to national economic growth and livelihood of Chinese
people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides the spot market established in 1990, the Zhengzhou
Market also set up a futures market in May 1993.
</P>
<P>
The aforementioned markets, which coexist and promote each
other, have developed into a national information and trade center
for cereals and cooking oil. Chinese and foreign economists refer
to the highly successful market as the "Zhengzhou Model".
</P>
<P>
"A major objective of ongoing reform of China's grain marketing
system is to find scientific mechanisms governing grain prices. A
wholesale grain market system, an integral part of the mechanism,
has taken shape in Zhengzhou," according to Li Jingmou, chairman
of the Zhengzhou Wholesale Market.
</P>
<P>
China, a nation with a population of over 1.2 billion people,
has long pursued a policy under which state grain companies engage
in a unified effort to purchase farm produce in line with fixed
quotas. The government grants several billion yuan annually to
offset the losses of related companies which have for many years
suffered from bad debts and financial losses resulting from
redundant staffs, high operational costs and poor economic returns.

<P>
Bumper harvests make it difficult for farmers to sell grain in
bumper years and crop failures lead to soaring prices.
</P>
<P>
China's grain marketing system has taken a great step forward
towards market-oriented operation.
</P>
<P>
Ding Shengjun, deputy director of the Commercial and Economic
Research Center under the State Internal Trade Bureau, said: "The
Zhengzhou Grain Wholesale Market is a product of grain marketing
system reform. The market has successfully experimented with grain
marketing in China."
</P>
<P>
Pricing is the core of the market system, with the grain price
index offered by the Zhengzhou Market providing the basis for
related reform, according to Ding Shengjun, a grain marketing
expert who has worked in the field for many decades,
</P>
<P>
Substantial national grain reserves has made it possible for
China to regulate its grain market. Facts prove that the gap
between bumper harvests and crop failure most often ranges from
15-25 million tons. Ding noted that the goal for stabilizing grain
prices applies to only a small portion of the national grain
reserve.
</P>
<P>
He Ruo, director of Fuzhou Grain Wholesale Market, said in a
telephone interview, that her province is one of China's leading
grain production bases and is linked to the Zhengzhou computer
network. She added that the link enables the province to receive
information and release trade prices on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin Municipal Grain Bureau established links with the
network in 1996 and over a dozen provinces including leading grain
producers such as Heilongjiang, Guangdong, Hunan and Hubei are
expected to join in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Butler Urges Iraq to Cooperate with UNSCOM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Chief U.N. arms inspector
Richard Butler has called on Iraq to cooperate with the United
Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) to help end its mission
quickly.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held here late Tuesday, Butler
said he promised Iraq that UNSCOM would do its work "honestly,
confidently and quickly, we have no hidden agenda, we want
disarmament."
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM is charged with overseeing the elimination of Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction, which was ordered by U.N. Security
Council after the end of the 1991 Gulf War triggered by Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Butler said that if Iraq cooperates with UNSCOM according to
a program of work, things are expected to be "quite different."
</P>
<P>
He reached an agreement on the program Sunday with the Iraqi
government for arms inspections in the next two months, raising
hope that Iraq is close to being free from U.N. economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed the sanctions on Iraq in 1990
after its invasion of Kuwait. It will not lift the sanctions
unless UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has destroyed the banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
"What we need for successful completion (of the arms
inspections) is full cooperation by Iraq," Butler said.
</P>
<P>
"We think we could do it in two months because Iraq did
promise the (U.N.) Secretary General (Kofi Annan) a new level of
cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan reached an agreement with Iraq in February, under which a
special U.N. team conducted free and unrestrictive inspections of
Iraq's eight presidential compounds, which used to be off-limits.
</P>
<P>
Butler, who arrived here Monday, has held a wide-range of
talks with Kuwaiti leaders and briefed them on the outcome of his
five-day visit to Iraq from last Thursday.

<P>
XIAMEN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Martijn C. Notten, general manager
of the Dutch-funded Xiamen Paktank Co. Ltd. in the special
economic zone, said he appreciates his Chinese employees very
much. Notten expressed his hope that his post will be filled by his
Chinese counterparts in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"They are competent to take the responsibility," said
Notten. "They are young, but they are very proficient in their own
fields."
</P>
<P>
John T.M Chi, manager of Taikoo (Xiamen) Aircraft Engineering
Co. Ltd., expressed similar opinion about his Chinese workers. The
firm, engaged in airplane maintenance, primarily serves foreign
customers. Chi said his firm pays great attention to the foreign
language level of employees as well as their knowledge of the
world outside China.
</P>
<P>
"In Xiamen, this does not pose a problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
The high quality of personnel is considered an important
advantage for attracting foreign investors, said Shi Zhaobin, a
high-ranking official in the city in east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
So far, 10.4 percent of the city's population has obtained a
college degree.
</P>
<P>
"Though different investors have different requests, Xiamen can
really provide them all they want," said Shi.
</P>
<P>
Besides advantages in personnel, the city has a favorable
geographic position, an advanced infrastructure, and services and
management comparable to the international norm.
</P>
<P>
It is after careful comparison that the Dutch-funded Paktank
chose Xiamen as its settlement site. "Xiamen, having a deep-water
port and being advantageously located, has great potential for
further development," said Notten.

The efficient sea port and airport in Xiamen have also solved
Taikoo's problems for transporting large equipment and tools for
airplane maintenance, said Chi.
</P>
<P>
Chi said his firm is considering a third-phase project, though
their second one is just under way.
</P>
<P>
A Philippine investor said he has not been as fortunate as his
Dutch and Hong Kong counterparts. Though his investment contract
was postponed because of the depreciation of the Philippine Peso,
he believed Xiamen the best place for investment.
</P>
<P>
The investor said he was moved by the sincere help from
officials in the Supervision Commission of the Haichang
Investment Zone. When many investors were mired in the Southeast
Asian financial crisis, the commission adopted supporting policies
to help them, he said.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland-based ABB Corp. has increased its number of
branches in Xiamen to four, lured by the high profits of its first
one. It also bought 10,000 square meters to build plants, changing
its original policy of not investing in real estate projects.
</P>
<P>
By the end of April, the city had used 8.12 billion
U.S. dollars for 4,366 projects.
</P>
<P>
While investors come to Xiamen for its favorable investment
environment, foreigners working here are attracted by the cozy
living.
</P>
<P>
"There's no difference living here than in our own country,"
said Gerold Brunken, financial controller of the ABB Xiamen Switch
Gear Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Brunken described the climate as spring-like in all four
seasons, and said he liked the beautiful island scene, safe social
security, convenient transportation and clean air.
</P>
<P>
As many foreigners now living here know, Xiamen has been named
China's hygiene city, park city, and environmental protection
city, all set by the state to show the city's advancement.

<HEADLINE> Phone Boom in Africa Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Africa could see a boom in the
number of phone lines across the continent early next century,
but rural areas still look set to miss out, international experts
predict.
</P>
<P>
New satellite, cellular and fiber optics technology could see
a rapid rise in phone lines in many African cities and large
towns as costs become lower and state-owned phone firms become
more efficient once privatized, the Daily Nation newspaper
Wednesday quoted a report in World Bank News as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Africa is on the move and telecommunications is one of the
sectors leading the way," said World Bank's telecommunications
expert Paul Bermingham.
</P>
<P>
"Not only have we seen a revolution in technology, but there's
been a wave of reforms and private financing sweeping through
Africa, which is opening up the telecommunications sector," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Although Africa makes up around 12 percent of the world's
population, it currently only has 1.8 percent of the world's
phone lines, said the report.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, nine Sub-Saharan African countries have
privatized their state-run telephone companies, representing
about 75 percent of all telephone lines in the region.
</P>
<P>
Another 12 African states, including Kenya, are planning
similar privatizations.
</P>
<P>
The report says that while telephone lines in sub-Saharan
Africa are still expensive, the cost per line has dropped
dramatically in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
However, the report acknowledges there are still huge problems
getting phone lines into the rural areas because of the cost
involved.

<P>
JERUSALEM, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A war of words erupted Tuesday between Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the
lack of a clear-cut decision on the scope of the next Israeli
troops pullback from the West Bank and the absence of a timetable
for its implementation.
</P>
<P>
In response to the remarks made by Mordechai Monday that
violence will break out in the Palestinian self-rule areas if
Israeli troops are not redeployed immediately, Netanyahu
indicated Tuesday that it will be possible to make progress in
this regard if the Palestinian National Authority accepts Israel's
"minimal conditions."
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Political sources said Tuesday that Netanyahu discussed the
issue of forming a unity government with opposition leader Ehud
Barak in their talks last Friday. In TV interviews later that
evening, Netanyahu said he "didn't say one word about a unity
government." Barak did not answer although he was asked several
times by his interviewers.
</P>
<P>
Barak's associates pointed out that his refusal to give a
straight answer indicated the issue had come up in their meeting,
and this side-stepping could be attribute to Barak's relative
inexperience in politics.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli President Ezer Weizman, hoping to organize a safety
net for Netanyahu on the issue of further redeployment, has held
serious meetings with coalition and opposition figures toward
this end.

<HEADLINE> Macao Foreign Trade Down in First 4 Months of 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Both imports and exports dropped in
Macao in the first four months of this year, the latest official
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the Macao Census and
Statistics Department on Wednesday, exports declined by 6 percent
from the same period last year, to reach 4.394 billion patacas
(about 549.25 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The value of imported goods added up to 4.759 billion patacas
(about 594.875 million dollars), down 7.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a trade deficit of 365 million patacas (about
45.625 million dollars) was recorded.
</P>
<P>
Garments and textile goods made up 81 percent of all exports in
the period and their export value declined by 9.2 percent.
Meanwhile, non-textile exports rose by 10.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The United States and the European Union (EU) were the two
leading export markets for Macao and they together bought 73.3
percent of all Macao exported goods. But compared with the same
period last year, purchases made by the United States fell by 1.8
percent and those by the EU 14.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decline in imports was attributed to reductions in the
purchase of capital goods, fuel and lubricative oil, raw materials
and semi-finished products and consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
Macao has been hit by an economic slowdown since 1993. Last
year, the growth rate of its gross national product was officially
put at negative 0.1 percent, as against negative 0.3 percent in
1996.

<P>
MANILA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Government troops and Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) rebels renewed their clashes in the
southern Philippines, sending hundreds of civilians fleeing their
villages.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines News Agency reported Wednesday that both sides
started shelling early Tuesday and went on the whole day pounding
each other with mortar fire in Buldon, Maguindanao province.
</P>
<P>
Civilians living in at least five villages were forced to flee
to safe ground, the report said, adding that the parties accused
each other of "firing the first shot."
</P>
<P>
Rosque Garingalao, spokesman of the Army's Sixth Infantry
Division, reported no casualties on the military. He confirmed the
evacuation of civilians but refused to give specifics, saying the
troops assigned to Buldon will continue looking over the safety of
civilians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Al Haj Murad, MILF vice chairman for military
affairs, chided the military for starting the renewed hostilities.
</P>
<P>
He said the military fired at least five 105 howitzer rounds
and 19 mortar rounds, but killed none of the MILF members.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, currently the largest rebel group in the country,
often clashes with the military although it has been engaged in
low-level peace talks with the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's total overseas
debt reached 99 billion New Zealand dollars (49.5 billion U.S.
dollars) at the end of March this year, Statistics New Zealand
announced in a press release received on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The latest figure represents a rise of 19.4 billion dollars
(9.7 billion U.S. dollars), or 24 percent, since March 1997. It is

to GDP now stands at 100.4 percent, the highest since it began to
publish the series on debt in December 1992.
</P>
<P>
The mounting debt has been caused by growing borrowing by the
corporate sector, which has increased by 20.1 billion dollars (10
billion U.S. dollars) since December 1992 to 79 billion dollars
(39.5 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>

<HEADLINE> Overseas Pakistanis Respond to Self-Reliance Fund: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said here Wednesday that overseas Pakistanis responded
enthusiastically to his call for increasing remittances to their
native country for meeting economic challenges.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the media at Islamabad Airport on his return from a
four-day visit to Britain, Sharif said overseas Pakistanis are
fully charged and want to strengthen Pakistan economically in the
wake of the nuclear detonation.
</P>
<P>
He termed as highly successful his visit, which was aimed at
motivating overseas Pakistanis to increase home remittances for
achieving self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
Pakistanis residing in Britain have assured him that they would
contribute generously to Pakistan's self-reliance fund, Sharif
said.
</P>
<P>
The fund was launched by the prime minister shortly after
Pakistan's nuclear tests in May. Sharif has expressed the hope
that each and every earning member of the Pakistani family
residing abroad would remit at least 1,000 U.S. dollars every year
through nationalized banks.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, Sharif said his meeting with British
Deputy Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Derek Fatchett on
Tuesday was good.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Sharif said, he was informed that the
British government considers the Kashmir issue as the main cause
of tension in South Asia and that major powers are ready to help
Pakistan resolve the issue.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Keeps Budget Deficit Under Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese government has made
significant progress in controlling its ballooning budget deficit
below the overall 1998 target of 42 percent in the past five
months this year, the Daily Star newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The deficit for the first five months averaged 35 percent
after the government collected 1.229 billion U.S. dollars in
revenue and spent 1.905 billion dollars, the paper quoted the
Finance Ministry's monthly report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The expenditure is expected to reach 5.224 billion U.S. dollars
with revenues projected at 3.042 billion dollars this year, the
paper added.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit has exceeded 50 percent since 1994 and
reached the record high of 59 percent last year, overshooting the
target of 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
An official at the Finance Ministry said that the rise in
revenue was due to the 2 percent increase in customs duty
imposed at the end of April and the inflow of income tax.
</P>
<P>
"We're confident we shall remain below target. We've taken
revenue measures, expenditure cuts and we have a political
consensus in the country," the Finance Ministry said in the
report.
</P>
<P>
Ghaleb Musleh, a senior manager at the central bank, said that
the new figures were a result of better revenue collection and
increased taxes, but they also reflected a certain amount of
window dressing by the government.
</P>
<P>
"We can't deny that there was a big effort to improve the
fiscal position, but the May figures do not show the true budget
balance and expenditure for 1998," Musleh said.

<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The government has allocated 1
million yuan (120,481 U.S. dollars) to save extensive areas of
trees threatened by plant diseases and insect pests in northwest
China's Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
To date, the total area of trees threatened by plant diseases
and insect pests has reached 133,333 hectares, today's China Youth
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The disaster was attributed to abnormal climatic conditions and
began 20 days earlier than in previous years. Experts said the
long growing period of trees in the province also increased the
chance of plant diseases and insect pests.
</P>
<P>
The disaster was first discovered in Minhe Autonomous County of
Hui and Tu nationalities in the eastern part of the province on
May 27.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province felled nearly 100,000 trees suffering
inroads caused by insect pests in order to prevent the spread of
the disaster.

<P>
YANTAI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The city of Yantai in east China's
Shandong Province now has some 30 environmental protection
organizations in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Yantai's rural economy has developed rapidly since 1978, with

100,000.
</P>
<P>
They had 98.7 billion yuan worth of industrial output in 1997,
accounting for 74.2 percent of the city's total. But, they have
also caused pollution. So, to protect the rural environment,
Yantai has tried to build environmental protection organizations
each staffed by three to five workers, since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Laizhou, a suburb of Yantai, has six rural environmental
protection organizations, which have discovered at least 100

<HEADLINE> Kenyans Face Two Years of Pain: Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Kenyans face two years of
economic pain even if the government implements a wide-ranging
and long-overdue reform program, Micah Cheserem, Governor of the
country's central bank, has warned.
</P>
<P>
However, there is no alternative if the government is to avoid
an even-deeper crisis, Cheserem was quoted by Wednesday's Daily
Nation newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The economy is like a ship -- it will not just change
course," he said Tuesday," But the determination is there."
</P>
<P>
"There has to be pain before gain.... We will have to go
through pain for perhaps two years, but it is for the good of the
country," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he hailed Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae's agenda
for reform, announced in last Thursday's draft budget.
</P>
<P>
In his budget speech, Nyachae said he wanted to balance the
budget in fiscal 1998/99 (July/June) after running a deficit of
around 2.7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1997/98.
</P>
<P>
Faced with a growing mountain of short-term domestic debt and
cripplingly high interest rates, Nyachae says government spending
and civil service jobs must be slashed.
</P>
<P>
Cheserem said the changes proposed in Nyachae's budget speech
will face opposition from strong vested interests within the
government itself.
</P>
<P>
"For the public good these people had better accept to let
go," he said, "They have to let go because the situation is
precarious."
</P>
<P>
The economy has slowed to standstill this year with interest
rates of more than 25 percent on the government's three-month
treasury bills choking off private investment.
</P>
<P>
Cheserem said that he believed interest rates would fall if
the government puts its promises into practice and investor
confidence returns.
</P>
<P>
An expected return of International Monetary Fund (IMF)
support this year would be a major factor in bringing rates down,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Last July's decision by the IMF to halt a key loan package on
the grounds of poor governance and corruption was the spark for a
flight of international capital and an increase in treasury bill
rates to 26 percent from 18.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 17 (Xinhua) -- An eleven-day three-nation trade
mission led by Thai Deputy Commerce Minister Photipong Lamsam has
successfully secured new markets for Thai products, the Bangkok
Post Wednesday quoted the Department of Export Promotion (DEP) as
saying.

</P>
<P>
Comprising leading businessmen from the Board of Trade and Thai
Gems and Jewelry Trade Association, the mission visited South
Africa, Brazil and Italy between June 4 and 15.
</P>
<P>
The export target for Thailand's gems and jewelry industry this
year is 2.03 billion U.S. dollars. By the end of the first
quarter, the industry had reached 17.6 percent of its target.
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, the mission held negotiations with local gems
and jewelry association to purchase raw materials at favorable

Members of South Africa's Board of Trade expressed interest in
buying Thai goods, especially electrical transformers, machinery,
foods, furniture and garments, and plan to send a buying mission
to Thailand by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>

who is in charge of industry, trade and tourism to expand
bilateral trade.
</P>

Thailand hopes to use Brazil as a gateway to Latin American
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilians said they were interested in purchasing Thai
gems and jewelry, fragrant jasmine rice, medical gloves, rubber
block and latex, synthetic fiber and fishing equipment.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Tuesday approved
an interest-free credit equivalent to 75 million U.S. dollars for
an education quality and equity strengthening project in Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
Reinforcing the World Bank's commitment to education made at
the Second Summit of the Americas in April this year, the project
aims to increase the number of completed years at school by
students in Bolivia. As recently as 1995 only 20 percent of the
population there completed 12 years of school.
</P>
<P>
The project will help improve the quality of Bolivian education
by financing more than 1400 Municipal Educational Development
Programs. These programs were developed from school improvement
proposals prepared by the parents, teachers and directors from a
nucleus of nine schools reviewed and selected by municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The credit will be provided by the International Development
Association, the World Bank's concessional lending wing for
developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Thai Finance Minister Pledges to Cut Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Thai Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda said he would try to reduce the country's high
interest rates, which have caused liquidity problems in the real
sector, the Bangkok Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I'd be happy to see interest rates at around 11-15 percent to
ease liquidity," Tarrin said at the cabinet meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates in Thai commercial banks are between 16 to 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
But the finance minister made it clear that a cut would not
come soon as regional currency volatility made it necessary to
maintain a high interest rate regime.
</P>
<P>
The baht would be the first to be hit by the regional
fluctuations, but the emergency loan plan should cushion the
impact, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin had already asked for additional loans from the
International Monetary Fund, Japan and the United States to
augment international reserves if the crisis hit again.
</P>
<P>
He said measures would also have to be worked out to give the
country immunity from financial ills such as those concerning debt
restructuring and capital increases.
</P>
<P>
The government needed to speed the use of the 1998 budget to
improve liquidity and create more jobs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at the cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
said the recent turmoil, featured by the sharp depreciation of the
Japanese yen, may have a direct impact on foreign investor
confidence, wiping out the efforts of the government in the past
six or seven months.
</P>
<P>
But, Chuan said, the government would continue with measures to
oversee the export sector, ensure exchange rate stability and
rebuild foreign investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
Government policies over the next several months would focus on
financial sector reform, debt restructuring and increasing
liquidity in the economy, legal reform, recapitalizing commercial
banks and restructuring the Bank of Thailand, Chuan said.

<HEADLINE> Environment Fears to Affect Maldives Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Maldives Islands' ambitious
tourism growth program of doubling the number of 12,000 beds in
its 74 holiday resorts may be adversely affected by environmental
problems, according to reports reaching here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have cautioned that most of its 1,200 low
coral islands that make up the Maldives could disappear in the
next three decades as the ocean level rises due to global
warming.
</P>
<P>
The Maldives attracted over 365,000 high spending tourists last
year, paying 150 U.S. dollars per night to enjoy the sun sand and
reefs with their spectacular marine life, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Maldivian government had started a masterplan aimed at
increasing the number of resorts and bed capacity.
</P>
<P>
The plan to increase the tourist bed capacity to 22,500 by year
2005 is being reconsidered as Tourism Minister Ibrahim Hussain
Zaki says, "We do not want to spoil our environment at the cost of
tourism," the reports said.
</P>
<P>
They now want to control the booming tourist industry to
preserve the delicate environmental balance.
</P>
<P>
However 14 islands with 3,000 additional beds are being
developed as new resorts and will be ready by 1999.
</P>
<P>
Holiday resorts in the Maldives are separate islands that
import everything from drinking water to manpower, said the
reports, adding that guests are requested to take their plastic
bottles and other non-biodegradable items back to their own
countries instead of polluting the environment there.

<HEADLINE> Croatia's Mine Clearance Will Take 15 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Croatia aims to clear all mines
which were left over by the war and are scattered across 6,000
square kilometers, one ninth of its territory.
</P>
<P>
At the speed of 400 square kilometers a year, with a yearly
labor force of 1000, the task could be fulfilled in 15 years, said
an official in charge of the national mine clearance center.
</P>
<P>
The clearance project, plus the rebuilding of factories,
houses, roads, energy facilities and other war-destroyed
infrastructures would cost 2.5 billion U.S. dollars which, the
official, said would be shared by the state budget and
international loans.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Ban Circulation of U.S. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam will ban the U.S. Dollar
from public use in a bid to boost the stability of the
unconvertible vietnamese currency, the dong, according to the
latest issue of the Vietnam Investment Review.
</P>
<P>
The new regulation, which is aimed at controlling currency
speculation and black-market trading, outlaws the use of
U.S. dollars in restaurants, shops, hotels and other retail and
service outlets, the English-language weekly quoted a senior State
Bank official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Governor of the State Bank of Vietnam Do Que Luong said
the regulation, which is still under consideration, should help
consolidate the dong's status as the only legal currency to be
used for Vietnam's domestic transactions.
</P>
<P>
Last week Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung ruled out
further devaluation of the Vietnamese dong in an attempt to
instill public confidence in the country's banking system and its
currency.
</P>
<P>
"If we devalue the dong now, there will be a significant negative
impact on our economy," said an official from the State Bank's
Department of Foreign Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign bankers expect Vietnam to permit a
five-to-six percent devaluation in its currency in June or July as
a move to boost the country's exports and increase liquidity in
the inter-bank market.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is facing mounting difficulties in its exports due to
the prolonged economic crisis in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Banks' Nonperforming Loans Soar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian banks' nonperforming
loans at the end of April jumped to 25 percent of outstanding
credit from 10 percent at the end of April last year due to the
monetary crisis, press reports Wednesday quoted Bank Indonesia
(BI) governor as saying.
</P>
<P>
The bad debts as of April this year were 3 percent of the
outstanding loans, compared with 2.93 percent of outstanding loans
in the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Doubtful loans were 4 percent, under-performing credits 7
percent and specially mentioned credit 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The credit collectibility declined significantly compared with
the level in the previous year," BI Governor Sjahril Sabirin told
a hearing with a commission of the House of Representatives
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the low rate of credit collectibility might
further decline due to the deteriorating economic situation,
meaning that nonperforming loans would soar further.
</P>
<P>
A study shows that the banks with a very low credit
collectibility are those which have not been careful in providing
credits, and suffer a loss in their foreign exchange transactions
as a result of the depreciation of the rupiah against the U.S.
dollar, he added.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's banking sector is currently mired in its worst ever
crisis, with confidence at its lowest ebb. This has forced the
central bank to inject more than 130 trillion rupiah (13 billion
U.S. dollars) in liquidity support into banks whose depositors
have panicked and rushed for their savings.
</P>
<P>
Sabirin ruled out the possibility of stopping liquidity
injections into troubled banks as this would be a disaster for the
overall banking system amid the crisis of confidence in the
banking industry.
</P>
<P>
He said the central bank's main priority was to curb inflation
and stabilize the rupiah's exchange rate against the U.S. dollar
by maintaining its high interest rate policy.
</P>
<P>
"I'm certain that if the interest rate is reduced now, the
rupiah will fall further," he added.

<HEADLINE> Incoming Philippine Government Sets GDP Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The incoming Philippine government
will target an average of five percent growth rate in the gross
domestic product (GDP) for the next six years, Business World
reported here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Agrarian Reform Secretary-designate Horacio
Morales as saying that the economic team of President-elect Joseph
Estrada has set the target for the period from 1999 to 2004.
</P>
<P>
The incoming administration will achieve the target by aiming
for at least a three percent growth in agriculture for the next
few years, Morales said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the growth target will follow a
lower-than-expected GDP growth this year due to the effects of the
currency crisis and the El Nino weather phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines attained a GDP growth of 1.7 percent during the
first quarter this year. Morales said the growth will probably
remain slow for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
"With uncertainty still looming in the region, GDP is expected
to average at two percent for the whole year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada will assume the presidency when President Fidel Ramos'
term ends on June 30 this year. Analysts said the five percent GDP
target would be a tough job for the new administration.

<HEADLINE> China Sends Large Yellow Croakers Back to Sea (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- China released 20,000 large yellow
croakers into the East China Sea Tuesday, expecting this type of
fish, which was on the point of extinction, to start to flourish
again in three to five years' time.
</P>
<P>
At ten o'clock Tuesday morning, when the fish fries swam to the
deep water from their temporary home in Xiangshan Bay, more than
100 fishing boats blew whistles to send them off.
</P>
<P>
"I will be able to listen to their serenade in the sea again in
two or three years," said Shen Xianneng, a 58-year fisherman, "I
hope I will not be too old to do so then."
</P>
<P>
This was the first batch of 300,000 croakers to be released, noted
aquatic experts in east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the fishing ban on the croakers will help the
fries to grow.
</P>
<P>
To better protect fish resources, the State Council has
decided to extend the moratorium on fishing from two months to
three months this year. The release of croakers is one part of the
activities held during the banning period in the province.
</P>
<P>
These croakers were artificially bred in Xiangshan Bay, the
largest breeding base for this kind of fish. So far, three million
fish fries have been produced.
</P>
<P>
Though now the croakers have a cosy home in the bay, experts
warned that long-term artificial breeding will cause degeneration
of the species. To maintain their vigor, experts have considered
every possible method, but still hold that the best way is to
release them to their natural habitat.

<HEADLINE> China Sends Large Yellow Croakers Back to Sea (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The large yellow croaker has long been popular with the Chinese
for its taste. In the 1970s, there were 200,000 to 300,000 tons of
them harvested each year, 90 percent of them from the East China
Sea.
</P>
<P>
Then, overfishing in the 1980s sharply brought down their
numbers, so specialists began to do research on breeding methods
in the late 1980s. The research was also included as a State key
research subject.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Zhiying, 54, is the leader of the research. To look for
wild fish roes for artificial breeding took Zhen several years. He
finally succeeded in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Xiangshan Bay was designated as the research base for its
favorable geographical position. Located near the mouth of the
Yangtze River, the bay enjoys abundant bait and easy flow of
water. The Zhoushan islands around the bay also protect it from
ice, red tide and other dangers.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, large-scale artificial breeding was carried out, and
in the first year, 1.6 million fish fries were produced. The
number increased to 3.3 million this year, and 80 percent of fries
survived.
</P>
<P>
At the fish farm, a 60-year-old breeder said he had been a
fisherman previously. "I played my part in the overfishing, so now I
feel that it is my duty to cultivate them."
</P>
<P>
Advanced technology has also shortened the growing period of
the croaker from two years or more to one year and half. The first
batch of artificially raised croakers have entered the market and
even been exported to Japan and the Republic of Korea.

<HEADLINE> Correlation Between Menstrual Phase, Breast Density Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A group of American
researchers have for the first time found an association between
menstrual phase and breast density as detected on a mammogram.
</P>
<P>
Reporting their findings in the latest issue of the Journal of
the National Cancer Institute, researchers at the Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Research Center in Seattle said that mammography, the
primary means of detecting breast cancer, may be more effective if
it is conducted during the first two weeks of a woman's menstrual
cycle.
</P>
<P>
Their findings could improve the accuracy of mammography at a
relatively small cost to the woman.
</P>
<P>
For some time, physicians have debated the usefulness of
mammograms for younger women who don't have a family history of
breast cancer, because of the difficulty of detecting tumors in
women in their 30s and 40s. The study of Seattle researchers gives
some insight into why this difficulty may exist.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that as a woman's menstrual cycle
progresses, breast tissue becomes less fatty and more fibrous and
dense, most likely the result of fluctuating hormones. This
increased density, which appears as cloudiness on a mammogram, can
make it more difficult to detect early-stage malignancies.
</P>
<P>
The findings have led the researchers to believe that accuracy
may be improved if mammograms are done within the first two weeks
of a woman's menstrual cycle, when breast tissue is less dense and
more easily imaged by an X-ray.
</P>
<P>
Of the 2,591 women aged 40 to 49 surveyed, 28 percent of those
who underwent mammography during the second half of their
menstrual cycle had highly dense breasts, compared with 24 percent
screened during the first week of their cycle and 23 percent
during the second week of their cycle. The researchers said that
the difference is statistically significant.
</P>
<P>
The impact of the menstrual phase on breast density was most
apparent among women at or below average body weight, who
naturally have denser breasts. Forty-six percent of them were
categorized as high density in the last half of their cycle,
compared with 38 percent screened during the first half of the
cycle.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Milosevic's Pledge Spells Victory for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's agreement made here Tuesday to resume negotiations
with ethnic Albanians in Kosovo represents another victory for
Russia's diplomacy and a boost to its international stature.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued after his meetings with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev and other ranking officials,
Milosevic indicated his readiness to settle the Kosovo issue
through political means.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is that Milosevic agreed to sit at
the negotiating table with the Kosovo Albanians," Yeltsin said in
televised comments after meeting with the Yugoslav leader.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, read out by Primakov to reporters,
employees of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the
Office of U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees would be guaranteed
free access to Yugoslav areas and unimpeded delivery of
humanitarian aid to the regions.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade also agreed to reduce the presence of its security
forces in Kosovo where ethnic Albanians, who account for 90
percent of the population, are demanding independence.
</P>
<P>
However, Milosevic precluded a total withdrawal of Yugoslav
military units from Kosovo, saying there is no reason for the
Yugoslav army not to be in some parts of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
More than 250 people have died since February in clashes
between government security troops and the Kosovo Liberation Army,
the armed wing of the Albanian independence movement.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia is Russia's traditional ally. "We don't forget that
we are Slavic states, friends," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
"The Kosovo problem is not getting settled without our
participation," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic arrived in Moscow Monday, the same day that NATO
launched an air exercise over Albania and Macedonia, which border
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-four aircraft from 13 of NATO's 16 member countries
staged the flyovers in a not-so-veiled threat to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Local observers say that the Moscow talks will substantially
reduce the threat of NATO military actions and improve the chances
for a peaceful settlement of the Kosovo question.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic praised Yeltsin for his "complete understanding of
the situation in Kosovo, which will help the international
community to better understand the situation."
</P>
<P>
He denied Western accusations that Yugoslav security forces
committed acts of ethnic cleansing during the recent operations in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"All actions by Yugoslav police were aimed against terrorists
rather than peaceful civilians," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also refuted the notion that his decision to find a peaceful
solution to the conflict was a result of pressure from the NATO
air exercise.
</P>
<P>
During the Kremlin talks, the two sides reaffirmed the need to
preserve Yugoslavia's territorial integrity and condemned "any
manifestations of terrorism, separatism and armed actions
affecting the civilian population," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The ball is now mainly in the court of Kosovo's Albanians,"
Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic, for his part, welcomed "Russia's clearly expressed
stand" against sanctions on Yugoslavia and in favor of restoring
Yugoslavia's membership in international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade is ready to begin talks with the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe on the establishment of an OSCE
mission in Kosovo and reinstating Yugoslavia within the
organization.
</P>
<P>
The statement gives a realistic opportunity to settle the
situation in Kosovo, Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his talks with Milosevic, Yeltsin called U.S.
President Bill Clinton and briefed him on the results.
</P>
<P>
Clinton expressed satisfaction with the agreements reached with
the Yugoslav leadership, especially its readiness to immediately
resume negotiations with the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, Yeltsin's
press service said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton Tuesday
discussed with Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri the stalled
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said after the meeting that he doubted Israel's
commitment to peace but suggested that if it were to resume talks
on the Lebanese and Syrian tracks of the peace process, an
agreement could be reached in three months.
</P>
<P>
"It's not a secret we are very sceptical about the readiness of
the current government of Israel to work toward a general peace in
the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As far as Lebanon and Syria are concerned, if the government
of Israel is willing to seriously work toward peace by continuing
the negotiations..., we can achieve an agreement within three
months," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hariri was formally scheduled to see U.S. National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger at the White House Tuesday and Clinton
dropped by the meeting. Clinton also met Jordan's King Hussein
Monday to discuss the peace process.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARDIFF, June 16 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela received the Freedom of the City of Cardiff Tuesday, the
second day of the European Union summit.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, Mandela paid tribute to the response of the
Welsh people to the discrimination against non-whites that had
existed in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The president said, "When the call for the international
isolation of apartheid went out to the world, the people of Wales
responded magnificently."
</P>
<P>
"The knowledge that local authorities all over Wales were
banning apartheid products from canteens and schools... was a
great inspiration to us in our struggle," he added.
</P>
<P>
Accepting the honor, Mandela said, "I would like you to accept
our heartfelt thanks on behalf of the people of South Africa for
your solidarity."
</P>
<P>
Hanif Bhamjee, secretary of action for Southern Africa, said
Wales had played a major role in international campaigning to
secure Mandela's release after 27 years' in prison.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Nelson Mandela has a special place in the hearts of
Welsh people. The anti-apartheid campaign was always very strong
here."
</P>
<P>
An official of the Cardiff council said that Mandela's visit to
Wales during the EU summit created huge public interest, and more
than 1,000 people requested for tickets to the freedom ceremony.

CARDIFF, June 16 (Xinhua) - The Cardiff European Union (EU)
summit ended here Tuesday with a Presidency Conclusions expressing
its deep concern over the situation in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
The document, released after the two-day gathering, said, "The
nuclear tests by India and Pakistan have damaged stability in the
region and isolated both countries from the international
community's efforts on non-proliferation."
</P>
<P>
It reaffirmed the EU's view that India and Pakistan should take
early steps to reduce tension and instability in South Asia, by
resuming their political dialogue with each other, and seeking
ways to build confidence between them.
</P>
<P>
The European Council called upon the two countries to adhere to
international non-proliferation regimes by signing the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty as it stands and actively
contributing to negotiations on a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty.
</P>
<P>
It reiterated that the EU considers the Non-Proliferation
Treaty the cornerstone of the international non-proliferation
regime, calling upon India and Pakistan and any other countries
which have not done so to accede to the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The European leaders made it clear that it would consider
further measures should India and Pakistan fail to make progress
on these issues.

NANTES, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Brazil became the first team to
qualify for the knock-out stage after beating Morocco 3-0 in a Group
A match on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo ended his four-match goal drought as he opened the
scoring at the 8th minute. The Morocco team made a tactic mistake
by strengthening their attack and that gave the Brazilians more
scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
Rivaldo made it 2-0 for Brazil just before the interval and
Bebeto sealed the 3-0 victory at the 50th minute.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian team enjoyed such great advantages in the match
they could have scored more goals, but they preferred to
domonstrate their skills instead.
</P>
<P>
Though Morocco lost the match, they still have the chance to
qualify for the top 16 if they can beat Scotland in their last group
match.
</P>

Earlier on Tuesday, the highspirited Scottish team forced Norway
to a 1-1 draw to keep their hopes alive.

Norway and Scotland both have the chance of qualifying as Norway
have garnered two points from as many matches while Scotland and

<P>
LONDON, June 16 (Xinhua) - The British government Tuesday
welcomed Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's concession on the
Kosovo issue and his willingness to hold talks with ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the indications that Milosevic is willing to enter
into meaningful dialogue with the Kosovo Albanians and it is
important that this makes rapid dialogue," a Foreign Office
spokesman said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the ending of repressive action against the Kosovo
Albanians... but we are concerned that Milosevic does not appear
to have agreed to withdraw the forces used in the repression of
civilians," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement with President Boris Yeltsin after talks
in Moscow Tuesday, Milosevic promised to meet many of the
conditions set by the six-nation Contact Group on former
Yugoslavia for averting NATO military intervention.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is not what Milosevic says but what
he does," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
But Milosevic did not accept the key demand for an immediate
withdrawal of Serbian security forces who have been fighting
independence-minded ethnic Albanians, dismissed by Belgrade as
"terrorists," in the southern Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also announced that European Union foreign
ministers had agreed to increase the number of EU monitors in
Kosovo "in order to enable effective and continuous international
monitoring."
